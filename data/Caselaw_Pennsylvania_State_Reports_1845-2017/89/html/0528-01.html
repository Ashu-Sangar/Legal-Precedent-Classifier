He failed to comply with the conditions within the time mentioned. The plaintiff immediately had judgment entered, and issued a writ of <em>habere facias possessionem. </em>The day after the time prescribed in the verdict the defendant filed a deed for the plaintiff and paid the <em>costs; </em>and one day later made application to a judge at chambers, and obtained a stay of the writ; also, at the ensuing term of the court, obtained a rule to show cause why the said writ should not he set aside. Soon after, and at the same term of court, the defendant filed a fuller affidavit, and on motion of his counsel the court granted a rule to show cause why the plaintiff should not be enjoined from issuing a writ of <em>habere facias possessionem, </em>the defendant alleging he had substantially complied with the verdict. Depositions were taken on both sides, a hearing had, and rules discharged July 25th 1873 by the court, and his honor, Judge Elwell, filed a written opinion.</p>

A preliminary injunction issued and the case was referred to a master, Felix Ansart, Esq., who reported in favor of dissolving the injunction and dismissing the bill, on the ground that the question raised was <em>res adjudicata. </em>The court, Ingham, P. J., sustained the report and entered a decree accordingly, in an opinion, saying:</p>

This is because law is a rule of conduct, and to vary strict rules to relieve all the cases of ignorance, negligence and misfortune would destroy law as a rule and substitute therefor the opinions of judges in every individual case, which experience has proved leads to greater injustice than the most rigid adherence to the law. To provide remedies for cases which the great grooves of common-law actions do not reach, to furnish relief in eases of fraud, accident and mistake, and some other cases, our statutes, have invested certain courts with equity powers. While this power is to some extent flexible in its nature, and adapted to establish justice in many cases, it is far from being a discretionary power. It has bounds as clearly defined as the bounds of common law actions, and the court is equally under obligations to cohform to former decisions in equity as at law. When Andrew Gordinier filed his affidavit and moved for a rule to show cause why the plaintiff should not be enjoined from issuing a <em>habere facias possessionem, </em>he appealed to the equity powers of the court and he prayed for the same measure of relief that he asks for now. It is true he did not proceed by bill, but he did proceed in a form in common practice, and the court, at that time, and in that form had as ample power to do equity as we have now. In Stephens.?;. Stephens, 1 Phila. R. 108, Lowrie, J., says: ‘ Chancery grants relief by injunction to stay proceedings where it is shown that a judgment is satisfied or was procured by fraud; or where it is used to enforce payment of a penalty; or where it is tainted with anything contrary to public policy ; if the defendant had no chance of making his defence at law ; or whenever by fraud, accident, mistake or otherwise the plaintiff has an unfair advantage which would make the court an instrument of injustice; and in these cases wre grant relief much more simply and beautifully on motion by ‘the court laying its hands upon the action and preventing its execution, if in equity the party is entitled to relief.’</p>

F. Smith 501, and see cases there cited. Justice Si-iarswood says: ‘ Nor is the defendant in the position of the plaintiff in error without a form of reme'dy which will enable him regularly to obtain the decision of the court of last resort. * * * If the grounds of his defence be purely equitable, and such as would entitle him to an injunction in a court of chancery, then upon bill filed and proceedings thereon he will be entitled to an appeal to the Supreme Court.’</p>

It seems to us to mean that the defendant had a choice of remedies, by motion or bill; if he had chosen the latter he could have had an appeal to the Supreme Court. If a party may try his chances on motion and, and if he fails sustain a bill afterwards, it tends to multiplicity of actions; for that is the course parties will be likely to pursue. Thus a court of competent jurisdiction will have to hear the same matter twice ; first deciding ‘ a matter which rests in the sound discretion of the court below’ (<a href="/watts-serg/3/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 91" data-case-ids="1854668" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0091-01">3 W. &amp; S. 91</a>), and afterwards hear it again, to give an opportunity for review in the Supreme Court.</p>
