The contract was that North &amp; Co. should buy the stock on margin, Phillips to deposit with them ten per cent, of the par value of the stock to protect them against a fall, and at any time that this margin of ten per cent, should be reduced by a decline in the market, Phillips was to make up the difference in the margin; otherwise the defendants were privileged to sell the stock.</p>

On the 18th of September 1872, the defendants furnished plaintiff with an account, wherein it was shown he was largely in debt for margins, and defendants threatened to sell him out, if additional margin was not furnished. A temporary arrangement was made, and a portion of the stock was sold with Phillips’s consent. The defendants, however, continued to carry for him one thousand shares of the stock, and as the market was still declining, renewed their requests for margins, and their threats to sell, if they were not furnished.</p>

Yet, still it is a substantial difference in our law, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania have <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>had this question before them. It is decided in a very recent case, reported in 22 P. F. Smith. The question was there whether it was an agreement to purchase — that is, the custom or purchased stock — and whether he should, upon complying with the terms of the purchase, be entitled to' have that stock delivered to him, or whether it was only an agreement that he should not risk anything more than the margin he had paid from time to time. In the first place, although it may be bought upon time, it may be a bargain for an option. If it is a bargain by which the right of property in a stock vests in a customer, so that he would be entitled to call upon the seller to deliver the stock, that, in law, is a good contract. But if it was nothing more than an agreement that stock was to be carried for him by other parties, who did not part with the title, and did not agree to sell the stock and vest the title in him, so that he was simply to take the chances of making money or losing money by the rise or fall of the stock, the law says it would be an invalid contract. In the case of Kirkpatrick <em>v. </em>'Bonsall this distinction is endeavored to be set up by Chief Justice Agnew. We cannot call this, on the face of it, a gambling contract, so I say to you that a bargain for an option, if this was that kind of a contract, may be a legitimate and perfectly fair and proper business transaction.”</p>

It would seem, from the statement of the counsel for the plaintiff below, that the defendants were to carry for him four hundred shares'of the stock of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company untiltthe 11th of November 1872, and six hundred of the same shares until the 14th of the same month. He complains that they “slaughtered” these shares, on the morning of the eleventh of November; that is, if we understand the term, sold them before the time for which they had agreed to carry them had expired. Hence arises his claim for damages.</p>
    <p id="b255-7" data-blocks='[["BL_255.7",255,[248,1141,1168,564]]]'>Phillips, himself, says: “ On receiving that note” (the one informing him of the sale) “I went to the offibe of Messrs. North &amp; Co. on the morning of the 11th of November 1872. I saw Mr. George North. I said to Mr. North I had received notice of the sale of my one thousand shares of Pennsylvania Railroad stock; what does it mean ? He replied he was called on, or something of the kind. Then I asked him why he did not notify me. I think he made no response to that. Then I told him I would not accept the sale. * * * Then North, pulling out his watch, said, ‘ I call on you for $5000 margin, in five minutes,’ or heAvould sell my stock. Then I said to him, ‘You notified me you had sold the stock;’ then I told him I Avould hold him responsible for the stock he held of mine.” So the matter rested until the bringing of this suit.</p>

But there was nothing of the kind. These stock shares belonged to the defendants. Phillips neither had paid for, nor intended to pay for any of them. They Avere worth at this time some $52,000, and Phillips himself being judge, Avas not worth half that amount. According to the statement, above referred to, North &amp; Co. were only to carry them for him for a certain length of time, for a consideration, technically called a “shave.” In other Avords, they agreed to hold this stock in his name, for thirty or sixty days, as the case might be, in order that he might have the advantage of any rise in price that might happen in the meantime, it being also understood, that he must make good any fall in such price. Thus, the dealings of the par-ties Av-ere in “differences” and “margins,” and the purchase and sale of the stock was a mere pretence. Hence it Avas, that when North was challenged about the disposition of these stocks, he <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>made no demand for their price but for margin. So Phillips, on the other hand, never pretends that he paid for any of the shares, ■which the defendants, from time to time, professed to sell to him, but he says, “ I settled margins, from time to time, as they called for them by their notes; that is, notifications of Messrs. North.” Now, as is said in Maxton <em>v. </em>Gheen, 25 P. F. Smith 168, transactions in stocks, by way of margins, settlement of differences and payment of the gain or loss, without any intention to deliver the stocks, are mere wagers. Nothing, however, could better describe the transaction in hand than the above language. It is conceded that an optional contract may be valid and binding upon the parties to it, as in the case of Kirkpatrick <em>v. </em>Bonsal, 22 P. E. Smith 125, where the agreement was to deliver oil, within a given time, buyer’s option and at a fixed price, but there was nothing in the transaction which indicated an intent to gamble on the fluctuation of prices. Had any such intent been apparent, the result would have been different, for the doctrine above stated, is in that case, emphatically recognised and approved. In the case in hand, however, the very proofs adduced by the plaintiff to establish his several contracts with the defendants, reveals the fact that they were mere gambling devices, such as the courts will not help the parties to enforce.</p>
