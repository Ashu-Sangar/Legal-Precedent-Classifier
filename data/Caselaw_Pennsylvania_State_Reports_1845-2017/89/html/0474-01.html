The package was made up in a paper and addressed to the plaintiff’s wife at Rehoboth, Delaware. The address was on the package when brought to the office and delivered to the express agent.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b474-10" data-blocks='[["BL_474.12",474,[251,1369,1160,600]]]'>The plaintiff testified: “In the month of July 1873, I took a package of clothing, addressed to my wife at Rehoboth, Delaware, to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company’s office. That was the only address there was on it. I handed it to Mr. Hess, and asked him to please send it to Mrs. Ramsey, at Rehoboth; and I wanted to pay the express charges, but he said he did not know what they would be. I said I wished he would find out, as I did not know how Mrs. Ramsey would' be off for money, and I did not know as she would be there when the package arrived. I asked if there was any w7ay he could get it down, and he said ‘ Yes, we can send it on and collect back to this office, and I will do that, if you will pay me promptly the express charges when I get the return,’ and I said ‘Yes, I would do that.’ Then I left the package there. Thomas Hess was the name of the express agent.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b474-11" data-blocks='[["BL_474.13",474,[251,1969,1158,216]]]'>The original waybill was produced, whereby it appeared that sometime after the delivery of the package, Ramsey had paid forty cents charges, which were the rates only to Birdsboro, at which place the defendant delivered the package to the Wilmington and Reading Railroad, which was the usual connecting route to Rehoboth.</p>

It is a question of contract entirely. Did the Reading Railroad Company receive these goods and undertake to convey them to Rehoboth ? <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>And did they fail to deliver them at that place ? If they did, then the company would be liable. If the contract was simply to deliver them at Birdsboro, and there transfer them to a connecting route, and they were lost afterwards upon the connecting route, then the company would not be liable. In some of the cases it is held that the amount of charges paid is evidence for the consideration of the jury. Thus, in the case of a company whose route does not extend to the point of destination of the goods, but it is necessary to forward them by a connecting route or routes, and it receives the goods for transportation, and takes pay for the whole distance, it is evidence that they undertook to convey them over the connecting-route, and of liability for any loss that occurred after they left their own route. The evidence here is that Mr. Ramsey offered to pay at the time, but the agent could not tell him what the express charges would be. It was some time after this that the forty cents were paid, to w-hich your attention has been called by the testimony.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b475-6" data-blocks='[["BL_475.7",475,[230,1391,1170,209]]]'>Ans. “We think that it is a question of fact entirely for your consideration what the contract was. You will determine by your verdict whether the contract extended to Rehoboth, or to the point on the Reading road at Birdsboro, where the goods were transferred.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b475-7" data-blocks='[["BL_475.8",475,[231,1608,1168,215]]]'>2.

    <p class="summary" id="b475-8" data-blocks='[["BL_475.9",475,[230,1825,1168,215]]]'>Ans. “ That is just as you determine from the evidence what the contract was; if it was a contract to carry to Birdsboro, then there could be no liability here; but if you find the contract was to deliver the package at Rehoboth, then the defendants would be responsible for the loss.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b475-9" data-blocks='[["BL_475.10",475,[229,2039,1169,163]]]'>3. The defendants’ responsibility can only be for injury or loss occurring by their own negligence or that of their employees, and the defendants are not responsible for the loss of the package while in the hands of another carrier.</p>

The defendants were common carriers to the end of their own route only, and beyond that held the relation to the plaintiff of forwarders only, and as such, having forwarded the package beyond their lines at the point nearest and most convenient to destination, in the usual course of business, being in good condition when so forwarded, the plaintiff cannot recover in this action.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b476-7" data-blocks='[["BL_476.6",476,[239,870,1161,343]]]'>Ans. “We affirm this point if you find that the contract between the company and Mr. Ramsey was that the Reading Railroad Company was simply to forward them; that is, that the contract did not extend beyond Birdsboro or the terminus of their own road, and that from that point they were simply forwarders of the goods through the agency of the other road. If you find that the contract was to convey the goods to Rehoboth then this point would not apply.”</p>
