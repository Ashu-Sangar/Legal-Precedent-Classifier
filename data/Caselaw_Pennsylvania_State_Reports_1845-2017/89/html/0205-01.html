The plan exhibited we have no doubt is a proper exhibit, but it is not attached tó, or certified with, the record. It exhibited a change in the Passyunk road or avenue, one of the oldest thoroughfares in the city of Philadelphia, whereby a new route is laid down, of the width of one hundred and twenty feet, and a part of the old route vacated, very materially affecting the interests of the appellants to the Quarter Ses1 <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>sions. It is not our province to review the action of the board of surveyors, or of the Court of Quarter Sessions, excepting so far as' their action involves a question of power appearing in the case. Now, it is alleged that the board acted upon an ordinance of the city, containing no authority to lay out new streets and vacate old ones, but merely a power to regulate the lines and the grades of streets, already surveyed on the general plan and to report their work in a plan. The plan reported, it is alleged, exhibits an-unauthorized action of the board, in vacating an old, and locating a new street, and hence the appeal. On the other hand, it is said, the form of the ordinance is the same as that always used, and implies an authority to alter, not only lines, but routes. As the rights of the appellants depend on this question of authority, we are disposed to hear an argument upon the character, use and effect of the ordinance or resolution, as it is termed, of June 29th 1874.</p>

L. 1853, confers upon the board of surveyors authority to confirm or reject all plans of surveys or revisions of plans of the city of Philadelphia, when the same shall have been made by direction of'the Select and Common Councils of the said city. The plan in controversy, No. 272, was made under this act. The city councils, by their joint resolution of June 29th 1874, ordered “ that the department of surveys be and is hereby authorized and directed to prepare plans in duplicate of the lines and grades of so much of the Twenty-sixth ward as is embraced between Twenty-fifth street and the river Schuylkill, Ritner and Geary streets.” In order to ascertain whether the board of surveyors exceeded the authority contained in this resolution, we must look at what they have done, as we find it in the record. And for the purposes of this case, giving the plan all its effect as though a part of the record, we find nothing in it but the lines and grades of the streets in the territory referred to. This is precisely what the resolution of councils directed. But it is said new streets have been laid out and old ones vacated. All this is <em>dehors </em>the record and the plan. The latter furnishes us no information as to what are old streets and what new. It is true, a street is marked vacated. But vacated when and by w'hat authority ? For aught that appears, it may have been vacated years ago, by order of the Court of Quarter Sessions, upon proceedings properly had for that purpose.</p>
    <p id="b209-9" data-blocks='[["BL_209.9",209,[206,2082,1165,259]]]'>The difficulty in the way of the plaintiffs is, that they cannot, upon a certiorari, have the case heard as upon an appeal.

The rule, as settled by numerous decisions under the constitutional provision, is, that it is sufficient if the title fairly gives notice of the subject-matter of the act, so as reasonably to lead to an inquiry into its body: Blood <em>v. </em>Mercelliott, 8 P.
