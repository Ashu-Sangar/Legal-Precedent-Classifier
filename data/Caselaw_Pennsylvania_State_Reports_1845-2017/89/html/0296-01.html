The secretary accepted the risk, and a policy for $1500 was duly -prepared, but remained .unsigned by the insured. The company is a mutual one, and each member is liable to assessment as often as a loss requires it. Upon taking out this policy, a premium of $1.65 was required to be paid as well as a fee of $1.95, the latter to defray the incidental expenses of insurance. These were not paid at the time, but as Scheirer had another policy upon other premises to be transferred, he said he would pay for them both at the same time. On the same day Schaffer was enrolled as a member upon the books of the company, and a memorandum made of the amount of the insurance, the premium, and that the policy was assigned to the Whitehall Loan and Building Association. On the next morning, April 9th 1876, the building, in the absence of the insured, was destroyed by fire. On April 10th 1876, Scheirer called upon Koch, and asked for the <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>policy, which was handed to him. He then offered the premium and the fee of membership, but before the money was received, informed the secretary of the fire. The secretary then refused, to accept the payment or to deliver the policy. Scheirer then stated that he had effected the insurance on the Saturday previous, and that it was agreed that he should pay when he brought the other policy for transfer. Koch replied that he must now submit the matter to his company. On May 13th 1876, an endorsement, signed by Koch, was made on the policy in these words, “Not satisfied by the time of filling out the policy and burned, therefore not insured, and can-celled.” Schaffer’s name was also erased from the book of membership and a similar entry was there made. Schaffer testified that after the fire, in a conversation with Koch, the latter stated “it (the house) was insured, but now it is not, because it was burned off.”</p>

The question here arises did Schaffer become a member of the Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Lehigh county, by reason of what took place between Koch and Schaffer April 8th 187 6 ? Schaffer had neither paid nor agreed to pay any premium. What losses or expenses of the company was he liable for ? What action could have been maintained against him upon what transpired between Koch and Scheirer ? None. He had entei'ed into no contract to pay anything. He had merely made an application that required a payment of premium to constitute him a member of the company. The by-laws contemplate an application and the payment of a fee not only by those whose application is accepted but by all applicants. Their applications must be accepted. The fee paid is not the premium required to be paid; that is paid when the policy is ready to be signed by the insured and delivered. The policies are executed in duplicates — one is given to the assured and the other retained by the insurer.</p>

He must have known that a contract could not be binding on the company, and not binding on Schaffer — could not he a contract to insure the safety of Schaffer’s property and no contract to render Schaffer liable for lossds falling within this class. He did not ask if the property was insured from that time on; but he wanted it insured right away, as soon as possible.</p>

The payment of this premium was the condition precedent to the insurance. He did not ask the secretary to waive it, but contented himself in saying he would pay when he took the policy. In Mar-land <em>v. </em>The Royal Insurance Co., <em>supra, </em>it appeared that some question was asked about payment of the premium when the person asking was assured that he was safe without paying then. It was held that this was no excuse for the non-payment, Mr. Justice Agnew says: ‘The true-and easy explanation is, that they did not expect that a fire would take place so speedily and thought they would have time enough to close this business.’ These words are peculiarly applicable to this case. Schaffer must have known that he was not a member of the company for he neither paid, offered to pay nor authorized any one to pay one cent to that company on April 8th 1876. No policy was held in trust for him. He could <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>not have understood that he was entitled, as a matter of right, to the undelivered policy. It was because of this want of mutuality in the alleged contract as set up by the plaintiff that the court directed a nonsuit; what was done was inchoate and not complete; it needed the payment of the consideration to vitalize the contract. Viewing the alleged contract in this light we attach no importance to what the secretary did and said after April 8th 1876. So that the application would grow into a consummated contract it was necessary to have a policy, to enrol it on the record of the company and to present it for the signature of the assured. When Koch said Schaffer was insured but now that there was a fire he was not injured, merely meant that if no fire had occurred he would have paid the premium according to and concluded the contract. This evidence gave to what was said between Koch and Scheirer no greater force than the words employed at that meeting. If they failed to consummate the contract no act of Koch subsequently done could operate to consummate it. Payment of the premium was required of Schaffer to constitute him a member.</p>

Insurance companies should be held to a very strict rule of accountability. The tendency of these companies to invoke legal technicalities to escape liability .should not be encouraged by the courts. But while this rule may produce salutary results and may give stability to this class of contracts, it does not follow that insurance companies can have no legal defence to a suit upon a policy. When one is made to appear, it is the duty of the court to see that it be sustained. Any other course would be unjust.

While the company, on the one hand, undertakes to pay or make good the losses, the insured, on the other, agrees to contribute his proportionate share of current expenses and losses happening during the life of his policy. Their respective promises are mutually dependent upon each other. The undertaking of the one is the only consideration for that of the other. It would be unreasonable therefore to contend that there could be any liability on the part of the company to the insured for the loss of his property, unless he at the same time had paid or assumed to pay his proportionate share of expenses and the losses sustained by other members. The principle upon which the system of mutual insurance rests is utterly inconsistent with any such proposition. The plaintiff in error had neither paid nor agreed to pay any premium or fees, nor had he in any manner assumed the payment of his share of expenses and losses. In fact he had entered into no contract whatever. There was nothing on which the company could have sustained an action against him on an assessment to pay losses, or anything else. At most, he had merely made application, not in person, but through Scheirer, for insurance and membership in the company, without as yet having complied with <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>any of the pre-requisites of membership. The charter and by-laws form an essential part of the contract of insurance, and these require the payment of a stipulated amount to defray incidental expenses. They also provide that all policies shall be issued in duplicate and be signed by the insured as well as by the president of the company. Soheirer was not furnished with funds to pay the premium and fees, nor had he any authority to sign Schaffer’s name, or in any manner bind him to discharge the obligations of membership, nor did he undertake to do so. At most, the evidence shows that there was a proposition to insure, which the company was ready and willing to accept, and all that was wanting to consummate the contract was the payment of the money by the plaintiff in error a,nd his signature to the policy, both of which were essential and neither of which was waived. Perhaps the secretary might have agreed to postpone the payment of the premium and fees, but there is no sufficient evidence that he did; nor does it appear that he had any authority whatever to dispense with the signing of the policy by the insured. The substance of Scheirer’s testimony is that he had another policy to be transferred uto the building association; that he requested the secretary to prepare both policies, make out a bill of amount to be paid, and he Avould pay it when he called for the policies. There is nothing in the testimony that Avould have justified the jury in finding that at the time of the fire there Avas any contract to insure, and if the fire had not occurred, no such thing Avould have been claimed. The .correct and natural explanation is that they did not anticipate that a fire would take place so soon-, and thought they would have ample time to close the transaction. While the negotiation Avas thus pending, the property was destroyed, and the company, as it had the right to do, refused to deliver the policy and assume payment of the loss. The questions involved are so fully and ably discussed by the learned president of the Common Pleas, in his opinion refusing to take off the nonsuit, that it is unnecessary to add anything to AYhat he has so Avell said.</p>
