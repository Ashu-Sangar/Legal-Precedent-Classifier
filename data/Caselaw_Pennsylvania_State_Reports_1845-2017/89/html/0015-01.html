R. 203, Judge Hare sums up tersely the general judgment of the Supreme Court, when he says : ‘ So far as I am able to understand the view taken by the Supreme Court of building associations, it would seem to be that they are, in point of fact or of law, schemes for avoiding the statutes against usury, and that all payments made under their constitutions or by-laws, as instalments on stock, are consequently to be regarded as payments on account of loans made to their stockholders. Such undoubtedly was the effect of the decisions in which it was held that the payments on stock assigned as collateral security for a mortgage loan, interest and fines were to be credited as payments on the sum actually advanced to the borrower, and that usurious interest paid under such circumstances is not a voluntary payment in any such sense as to entitle the receiver to retain. the sum paid above legal interest: Association <em>v. </em>McKnight, 11 Casey 472. But in the case of The Association <em>v. </em>Sutton, 11 Casey 463, the court qualify the decisions in Gruttenberg Association <em>v. </em>Kupfert, and Hughes’s Appeal, 6 Casey 465 and 471, to the effect that payments on account of stock were to be regarded as payments on account of the loan, and hold that the doctrine of those cases was in advance of the general understanding, and was considered necessary to protect the borrowing community from the oppression and hardships imposed on them by money-lending associations. The most material point ruled in The Association <em>v. </em>Sutton is, that the former decisions are not to be regarded as laying down the rule that payment of dues on stock <em>ipso facto </em>works an extinguishment of so much of the mortgage. The debtor <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>may so apply it, but payment itself is not an application of the money to the reduction of the mortgage. This was followed by the case of The S. G. Association <em>v. </em>The T. S.-Association, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20493" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="10 Wright 493">10 Wright 493</a>, in which the same principle is affirmed, and The Association <em>v. </em>Sutton is recognised as having been well decided.</p>

It by no means follows, as the terre-tenant in this case contends, that because unincorporated associations are not entitled to invoke in their behalf the saving clauses of the Act of 1859, in relation to the recovery of premiums on loans, as decided in Jarrett <em>v. </em>Cope, that the established rules of law, in cases where there is an indebtedness upon several distinct accounts, and payments are made by the debtor to his creditor, are not applicable.

That if such excess or premium could not be recovered against the land in the hands of the mortgagors, why against the land in the possession of a terre-tenant ? When one purchases under and subject to a mortgage debt, it is the debt which at the time is due. He ought to be allowed to show payments made upon the mortgage by the mortgagor, by which the mortgage is to that extent extinguished, or to show payment in full, or that the mortgage debt never existed, and that there is therefore no such lien to be enforced as against the land. For a like reason he ought to be allowed to show that the mortgage is in part or in whole fraudulent. The mortgages in these cases were unlawful to the amount of the premiums, and to that extent never were a valid charge against the land, having been given for a larger sum than the actual loan. When the purchase is under and subject to a bona fide debt secured by mortgage, the purchaser buys for a consideration of which the mortgage debt forms a part, but where the debt is not bona fide, or where it does not exist at all, he ought to be entitled to take defence to the claim.</p>
