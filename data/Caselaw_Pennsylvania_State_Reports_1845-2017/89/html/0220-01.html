The will provided for the paj'ment of his debts; the disposition of his mother’s and father’s portraits; that $5000 should be given to the son of each of his partners; that $5000 should be given to “Mena Ueberroth, the daughter of his friend Amanda Ueberroth,” and the residue of his estate he gave to said Amanda Ueberroth.

The heirs at law appealed <em>from his </em>decision and the proceedings were thereupon removed to the Orphans’ Court. An examiner was appointed to take testimony, which was duly reported to that court. On December 22d 1876, the cause came on for a hearing and was argued before Judges Dwight and Hanna. The judges being <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>divided in their opinions as to the right of the appellants to an issue, the decision of the register was affirmed.</p>

The evidence in this cause is that the testator made his will about sixteen hours before his death; that he was living with the principal legatee in unlawful relations; that while his brothers, if I read the testimony rightly, were excluded, she was present in his sick room up to the time when a gentleman of the bar, who had been sent for to draw the will of the testator, entered it to receive his instructions; that while this gentleman was- drafting the will this legatee was alone with the testator for half an hour; that at the end of that time the executor, whose son was also a legatee, having been informed by the legatee in question that testator desired to marry her, went into the testator’s sick room, had an interview with him, and on coming out again told the appellants that he had fixed the matter, and told the legatee that the contemplated marriage need not or ought not to go any further, because she was already well provided for by the will. I think that these facts, taken in connection with the illicit position of this legatee, and her manifestly increased influence over the testator during the last few months of his life, should be laid before a jury, in order that they might determine how far the principal legatee prompted or how far she and the executor united in controlling the testator’s mind in his testamentary dispositions. As the request for the issue must be refused, and as Judge Hanna is clearly of the opinion that the decree of the register should not be reversed, I would only add that upon the appeal the decree of the register is affirmed.”</p>

While it is true that he and the principal legatee were living together as husband and wife, without the marriage ceremony having been solemnized, yet this is no evidence of nor does it raise any presumption of itself that she exercised any improper influence or control over the mind of the testator.

It was not illegal or improper for Mr. Trimble to suggest to and advise with the testator as to the disposition of his property or the object of his bounty, and if this can be gathered from the testimony, it shows that his efforts all tended to reconcile testator to the wishes and objections of his brothers, the appellants, to his proposed marriage with the principal legatee.</p>

It is clearly settled that the constraint which will avoid a will must be one operating in the act of making the will. Threats, violence or any undue influence long past, and not shown to be in any way connected with the testamentary act are not evidence to impeach a will: McMahon <em>v. </em>Ryan, 8 Harris 329; Eckert <em>v. </em>Flowry, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wright%20417" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="7 Wright 417">7 Wright 417</a>; Thompson <em>v. </em>Kyner, 15 P. F. Smith 368. In an issue <em>devisavit vel non </em>on the allegation of undue influence by the mother of an illegitimate child, the legatee in the will, the unlawful cohabitation of the mother with the testator is not of itself sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer undue influence: Rudy <em>v. </em>Ulrich, 19 P. F. Smith 177. It is true that if there are other facts, unlawful cohabitation may be a circumstance of w'eight": Dean <em>v. </em>Negley, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20317" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="5 Wright 317">5 Wright 317</a>; Main <em>v. </em>Ryder, 3 Norris 217. In the case before us there was not a scintilla of evidence of the exertion of any ..influence over the mind of the testator in the testamentary act. His capacity was perfect, the act was free and voluntary; a respectable member of the bar was called in; everybody was excluded from the room when his instructions were given, and the will when afterwards drawn in form was executed in the presence of the two witnesses who attested it. There was never a case in which a will was executed less liable to. exception on this ground. It is true that the testator and the <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>residuary legatee had never been lawfully married. Rut for a year, at least, he had cohabited with her as his lawful wife, acknowledging her to be such. He was not on good terms with his brothers and sisters, the present contestants, and on many occasions had expressed his intention of providing for the residuary legatee. It is contended, however, that she had falsely represented to the testator that he had seduced her. It is more than doubtful whether the letter of May 2d 1874, so much relied on by the appellants, was not the testator’s own work, intended to justify him in the eyes of his friends in living with the woman, and it is difficult to believe that he was deceived by it. But concede it to be as contended. How can it by itself justify the conclusion of undue influence in the testamentary act ? Say that it was intended by her to induce him to remove her from the condition of a common prostitute and take her under his protection. Why might not her care and attention, her faithful performance of all the duties of a wife, though she did not bear the lawful relation, making his home peaceable and comfortable, produce in him a natural and legitimate affection for her sufficient to account for the not unreasonable provision made for her in his will ? It is clear to üs that this circumstance alone is not sufficient to justify a jury in finding a verdict against the will. If, upon the whole evidence such a verdict ought not to be allowed to stand, an issue ought not to be awarded. Upon a careful examination of all the testimony this is our conclusion.</p>
