The lease contained a condition that the tenant should pay for all the gas consumed on the premises. Defendant remained in possession until April 30th ■1878, when he removed, having paid the rent to that date. Twibill then entered, made certain repairs and brought an action for two months’ rent, ending June 1st and July 1st 1878, of the unexpired term, and a gas bill. The defendant filed an affidavit of defence, wherein he averred that deponent rented the house in dispute from plaintiff, as set forth in the lease filed, but moved out of the said house April 30th 1878, and surrendered the term to the plaintiff, paying him the rent in full to that date, whereupon the plaintiff immediately took possession of said premises and proceeded to repair the house, by building a new bath-room, a new porch, putting in a new range, and making general repairs, such as could not have been done while the house was occupied by a tenant; tliat deponent saw the house repeatedly during the time for which rent is claimed in this suit, and plaintiff was in possession all that time, and said repairs going on for the greater part of the time. And deponent further says, as to the gas bill charged in said statement, that he had not used gas upon said premises for over two years before surrendering the same; that the pipes in the house leaked so that an employee of the gas office, upon examination, declared it to be dangerous to use the gas with, the pipes in the condition they were, and that the gas ought to be turned off or pipes repaired; that plaintiff, although notified, neglected and refused to repair or supply new pipes, whereupon the gas was turned off by the gas office employees at the stop-cock upon the pavement over two years theretofore, since which time no gas has been.used upon said premises, and deponent therefore says that he is not indebted to <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>plaintiff in any amount whatever, and expects to be able to prove all these facts upon the trial of this case.</p>
