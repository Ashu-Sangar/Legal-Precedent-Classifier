This view, in the opinion of your auditor, is equally erroneous and untenable; for it is clear, ¡from the language of the will, that the testator intended giving his sister Susanna Skiles a life-estate and nothing more, for he not only uses the words ‘her lifetime,’ but adds ‘and at her death it is my desire,’ &amp;c. He does not intend or attempt to dispose of the residue until after her death; so that it would be utterly impossible for her to take with'‘Hopkins Skiles and his heirs’ under the will. It being therefore beyond controversy that Susanna Skiles can take only a life-estate under the will, any other interest she may derive in her brother’s estate must come tbrough the medium of the intestate laws. But if she take under the intestate laws, she takes not under but outside of the will, whilst ‘ Hopkins Skiles and his heirs’ <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>take under the will or not at all, and as it is evident the testator intended to dispose of the whole of his estate by his will, we cannot presume that he intended Hopkins Skilesand his heirs to take a part of the residue under the will, and his sister Susanna the other part under the intestate laws.

We contend, also, that the subject of the gift Avas well defined. It was a share of the “ balance ” of the estate which Susanna Avas to enjoy for life. That balance is now made certain by the settlement of the estate and it is this sum, thus ascertained, which is to be parted and one part allotted to Hopkins. Where something is to be divided into two parts, the presumption is that it is to be divided into two equal parts.

    <p id="b512-9" data-blocks='[["BL_512.11",512,[252,1335,1172,778]]]'>The fund for distribution in this case represents real estate, and the question is, what interest, if any, did Hopkins Skiles take under the residuary clause of his cousin’s will? The testator, after giving sundry pecuniary legacies, and directing his executors to sell sufficient real and personal estate to pay debts and legacies, disposed of the residue of his estate in the following words: “Also, all the balance of my property, personal and real, I give and bequeath to my sister, Susanna Skiles, her lifetime, and at her death it is my desire that a part of it go'to Hopkins Skiles and his heirs.” The learned judge of the Orphans’ Court held that the bequest of <em>a part </em>was void for uncertainty; that as to the residue of his estate, subject to the life-estate given to his sister, the testator died intestate; that immediately upon his decease, the same vested in her as his next of kin under the intestate law, and consequently she took the entire residue absolutely, instead of a life-estate therein. This, of course, resulted in a decree in favor of the executor of Susanna Skiles, from which the administrator of Hopkins Skiles took this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b512-10" data-blocks='[["BL_512.12",512,[254,2111,1167,172]]]'>If the bequest was void for uncertainty, it is conceded the decree is correct. On the part of the appellant, however, the contention is that the bequest was valid, and that his intestate took, under the will, at least one-half of the residuary estate.</p>
    <p id="b512-11" data-blocks='[["BL_512.13",512,[256,2284,1165,130]],["BL_513.1",513,[176,398,1173,1474]]]'>The first paragraph of the will contains the usual declaration of intention by the testator to’ dispose of his entire estate; but it is manifest from the residuary clause that he did not fully carry out <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>his original purpose. In the first part of this clause, he gave, in express terms, a life-estate to his sister; and if he had stopped there, it is very clear that the entire remainder, at the termination of the life-estate, would have been, undisposed of and would have passed, as in case of intestacy, to his next of kin. It appears, however, that this was not his will, for in the same breath he expresses a desire that a part of the remainder should then go to his cousin, Hopkins Skiles, but he made no disposition of the other part. It must be presumed that the testator knew what the effect of this partial disposition of the remainder would be, viz., that the undisposed of part or portion would pass,.under the intestate law, to his sister, as his next of kin. We have, then, the clearly-expressed intention of the testator to give the residue of his estate to his sister for life, and, at her death, a part or portion thereof to his cousin, leaving the remaining part undisposed of, so that upon his decease it would vest absolutely in her. If, then, after carving out the life-estate, the testator declared that' a part of the remainder should go to his cousin, and knew that the law would give the undisposed of part to his sister, in what proportions did they take, the one under the will and the other under the intestate law ? Under the circumstances, it is manifest that not more than the two could participate, and hence the remainder was to be parted or divided between them; and in the absence of anything to indicate an unequal division, the presumption is that equality was intended; that the testator used the word <em>part </em>as synonymous with moiety, a sense in which it is sometimes popularly employed in speaking of a division between two. If he had said that one part should go to his cousin and the other to his sister, it would certainly be construed to mean an equal distribution between the two. What difference can it make that he expressly gave a part to Hopkins, and so drafted his will that by his silence as to the other part it would go to his sister ? He is presumed to have known that this would be the effect, and to have had the result in contemplation when he published his will.</p>
    <p id="b513-6" data-blocks='[["BL_513.6",513,[175,1872,1168,388]]]'>Giving effect, then, to the will, so far as it speaks, and appealing to the intestate law as to that wherein the will is silent, we reach the conclusion, that Hopkins took one part- under the will, and the sister the other part under the intestate law. In other words, the remainder, subject to the life-estate, vested in the two, each taking a separate portion or interest, and presumptively an equal share. Equality is equity, and where distribution is to be made among two or more, without anything to indicate the proportions in which they are to take, the presumption is that the shares are to be equal.</p>

Here two classes were contemplated, and it was held that the property so bequeathed was divisible in two equal parts, one of such parts for charitable purposes, and the other for the child of the testator absolutely.</p>

Both of these results should be avoided, if it can be accomplished without doing violence to the language employed by the testator.</p>
