In 1860, when largely indebted, and as it subsequently appeared, insolvent, he conveyed this store to the accountant, who re-conveyed it to his sister, the decedent. These conveyances were subject to a mortgage.Subsequently, judgments were obtained against William Ryan and William Ryan &amp; Co., among which was one confessed to White, as trustee for the decedent. In 1861, Braman obtained a judgment against Ryan for $4300, which was revived in 1867, when the store was levied upon and sold at sheriff’s sale to Braman. In 1871, Braman brought ejectment against Ryan and his wife therefor. Mrs. Ryan died in 1872, and Ryan in 1873, and in 1874, on a trial of the ejectment suit the verdict was for defendants, upon which judgment was entered-June 8th 1874. In 1874, the counsel for the accountant stated to the holder of the mortgage that default would be made in the payment of the interest thereon, and that he <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>wanted to have the mortgage sued out to make title. A writ issued April 4th 1874, and service was accepted by a member of the bar who was not then practising. The defendant in the writ had been dead several years. On April 22d 1874, judgment was entered for want of an appearance. A levari facias issued the same day, and before the property was sold the accountant, through one Powell, paid the amount of the judgment, interest and costs, and the judgment was marked to his use. The sale however proceeded, and the premises were sold by the sheriff to White, the accountant, who received a deed therefor on May 16th 1874, thirteen days before the- verdict in the ejectment.</p>

But this is not even now pretended. Nor is it pretended that from the day of his purchase to the present time the exceptant has ever paid, or offered to pay, one cent, principal or interest, on the mortgage.

The fraud, if such it be, against him would not extend beyond the judgment, which was voidable merely on this ground — not absolutely void: Pearsoll <em>v. </em>Chapin, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%209" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Wright 9">8 Wright 9</a>. The exceptant might either have applied to the court to open the judgment and let him into a defence, or he might have appeared in the proceedings for distribution and claimed the fund as owner of the property sold. But he did neither. It is not alleged that he had not actual notice, both of the sale and of the subsequent proceedings. He certainly had legal notice. The relations between himself and Mrs. Ryan’s estate were entirely hostile, both claiming to be the owner of the property sold; and the verdict in the ejectment was in her favor. It was certainly his duty, under these circumstances, to have made his claim at the proper time and place, and to have established it by due proof. Having suffered a decree to be made in favor of his adversary, he is bound by it. This principle was applied in the case of Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Trout, 26 P. F. Smith 884, where the Supreme Court, Williams, J., says: ‘ If then the plaintiff’s evidence would have shown that the defendant was guilty of fraud in making the sale, it would not have avoided the conclusiveness of the decree confirming the sale and distributing the proceeds.’ * * * ‘And what right have the plaintiffs to complain that the decrees áre held to be conclusive upon them ?

Smith 484, is thus stated by Judge Williams : ‘ The fund for distribution, from whatever source derived, constitutes part of the decedent’s estate, and no one is entitled to claim any portion of it in this proceeding for its distribution who does not claim it through the decedent, and as part of her estate, either as creditor, legatee or next of kin. But the appellant does not claim it either as creditor, legatee, or next of kin, nor does he claim it as part of her estate; but he claims it as his own.’ * * * ‘It is clear he cannot raise any such issue in this proceeding for distribution.’ * * * ‘ If he denies that the money belongs to the estate, * <em>* * </em>and claims it as his own * * * he must resort to some other form of proceeding for his remedy.’</p>

True, when he afterwards resold at an advance of price, he gave the estate the benefit of this, and charged himself with it in his account; but this was because he chose to recognise a fiduciary relation in which the ex-ceptant has no part, and which cannot affect his rights one way or the other. His claim is against the accountant individually, as trustee <em>ex maleficio. </em>An estate is not liable for the tort of an executor, nor can the tort be waived and the claim made for money had and received by the executor for the use of the exceptant. In such case the only judgment possible is <em>de bonis propriis : </em>Rose <em>v. </em>Bowler, 1 H.

E. Smith 480. Legatee or next of kin the appellant did not pretend to be. Creditor he was not. The wrong of which he complains — conceding that it was a wrong — was the act of the accountant for which the estate was not liable. The accountant having received the money for the estate was bound to account for it and could claim no indemnity for his fraud in procuring it, if any such fraud was resorted to. It follows that the appellant could not waive the tort and sue the estate for money had and received — however he might have done so as against the accountant. Of course he could not claim damages as mesne profits accruing to him since the death of the decedent.</p>
