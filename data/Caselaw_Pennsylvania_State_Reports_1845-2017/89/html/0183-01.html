On this land was a wharf, from which extended two piers into the river at a distance of about sixty-four feet from each other. Neill and Simpson agreed to make partition of the land, and deeds were mutually executed by the parties for their respective portions, that of Neill being made to Simpson’s sons. At the time of the conveyance, defendant’s pier <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>was used by Neill and Simpson as tenants in common, and had for years been almost entirely used for vessels lying in the dock and moored to its north side. In the deed from Neill to the two Simpsons, defendant’s pier was conveyed to the latter with “ all passages, waters, watercourses, wharves, docks, landings, landing-places and other appurtenances thereto belonging.” . After the deed the grantees continued to use the water north of the pier for vessels moored to the pier as fully and in the same manner as Neill and James Simpson had used it before the partition. In the year 1871, Neill set up a claim, as against the two Simpsons, for a portion of the wharfage of vessels lying in the dock against the north side of defendant’s pier, and requested the port wardens to adjust the proportion, under the provisions of the Act of April 8th 1851, Pamph. L. 354, which provides as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b184-5" data-blocks='[["BL_184.5",184,[245,1003,1171,904]]]'>“That in all cases when the owner or owners of adjoining wharves, docks, landings or river front, or any part or portion thereof in the port of Philadelphia shall disagree as to the proper apportionment of the wharfage or dockage payable to them in accordance with their titles by persons making use of the same or by vessels lying in front thereof, it shall the the duty of the master warden and board of wardens of said port, upon the written application of one or more of such owners, and the said wardens are hereby authorized and required,1 after notice to the parties interested and in accordance with the established custom, and usages of the port, or where there is no such usage, then as justice and equity may require, to determine the relative proportions of such wharfage and dockage belonging to the several proprietors of such adjoining wharves, docks, landings, or river front, or any parts thereof: Provided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to authorize the said wardens to take cognisance of any questions involving the title to such property ; but such jurisdiction and the power to enforce the rights of the owners of said wharves, docks, landings or river front to wharfage and dockage from persons or vessels heretofore or hereafter using or .lying opposite to the same shall exist and remain in the proper courts of law.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b184-6" data-blocks='[["BL_184.6",184,[245,1908,1171,516]]]'>The division line after the partition was close to the north side of the defendant’s pier and gave Neill nearly the whole of the dock or slip. It was in evidence that there was a slip on t]ie south side, but it was narrow and stopped up by a marine railway and was seldom used for mooring vessels. The Board of Port Wardens decided that the Simpsons should pay Neill the one-third of all the wharfage from vessels moored at the north side of their pier, and fixed the amount of wharfage, as between certain dates, at $579.25. The foregoing facts having been shown at the trial, the court, Mitchell, J., directed a verdict for plaintiff for one-third the above amount, and judgment having been entered thereon the defendants took this writ alleging that this direction was error.</p>

The wharfage to he divided or apportioned between owners is wharfage for vessels lying “in front” of such wharves. Vessels lying at the side of a pier cannot be said to lie in front of a wharf.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b185-6" data-blocks='[["BL_185.8",185,[221,676,1172,346]]]'>The object of the act evidently is to prevent differences between owners in cases in which one has a bulkhead of say twenty feet, and another a bulkhead of the like front, and no vessel can lie at either without overlapping the other. In such cases neither would be of any use without the privilege of using the water in front of the other, and to utilize both, without discord, the act was passed. The reason for its application does not arise between owners of opposite piers.</p>

If the deed Neill to Simpson contained the general words “ waters, docks, &amp;c.,” so did the deed Simpson to Neill of the same date, and the one was a fair set-off against the other. But in truth neither party had any right to convey the waters and docks, being as they wore part of the river Delaware. These words could have no more effect on the rights of the respective parties than would a conveyance of a lot on a public street “ with all the streets and highways thereunto appertaining.” All the property on the river front of the city below low-water mark of the river Delaware is held merely by license from the Commonwealth, under and subject to such laws and restrictions as the legislature has seen fit to enact. It cannot, we think, be doubted that these wharves were adjoining, within the letter and spirit of the Act of 1851, and would be so though the piers were one hundred feet apart, provided there was no intervening wharf or pier. That the claim of the defendant below was derived from and altogether depended upon statutory enactment is a sufficient answer to the argument that the Act of Assembly vesting jurisdiction in the wardens is unconstitutional as depriving the defendant of his right to a trial by jury.</p>
