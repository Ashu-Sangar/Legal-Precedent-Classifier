L. 889, with the route therein described, with the power to lay out and construct a railway. By a supplement to said act, passed March 8th 1860, Pamph. L. 123, they were expressly authorized to lay out and construct their railway tracks, from the bridge at Fair-mount to Callowhill street, and along Callowhill street to Delaware avenue, and to occupy such other street or streets as may be necessary to reach Twenty-first or Twentieth and Callowhill streets from said bridge. 2. Under these acts there was constructed a track from the bridge at Fairmount westwardly to Hestonville. 3. That by an Act passed April 13th 1858, Pamph. L. 257, there was created the “ Fairmount Passenger Railway Company,” with power to construct a passenger railway from the south side of Fairmount to Callow-hill street; thence east on Callowhill to Twenty-third; thence south to Vine; thence east to second; thence south to Walnut or Dock; thence w'est to Third ; thence north to Race ; thence west to Twenty-second; thence north to Callowhill street, with a double track on Callowhill street, to Fairmount. Section 7 provided: “ That before the said company should use and occupy the said street, the consent of the councils of the city of Philadelphia shall be first obtained.” This consent was given. • 4. That by the Act of April 16th 1858, Pamph. L. 320, there was created, “The Fairmount and Arch street City Passenger Railway Company,” with power to construct a passenger railway “ commencing at Tenth and Arch and continuing westwardly along the same, with a double track to Twentieth and Twenty-first streets, respectively, with single track to Callowhill street, and thence westwardly with double track to bridge.” Section 7 provided: “That before the said company shall use and occnpy the said streets, the consent of the councils shall be first obtained.” On May 5th 1858 (Ordinances of 1858, 177), the councils disapproved of the act and refused consent. By a supplement to the aforesaid act, passed March 24th 1859, Pamph. L. 234, it was enacted that said company should have full authority to construct and lay a passenger railway on the route hereinbefore stated. Section 3 provided, that “ after the special consent of the councils, said company may, in lieu of two tracks on that part of Callowhill street which is between Hamilton and Twenty-second, construct one of their tracks on Twenty-second from Callowhill to Hamilton, and thence west on Hamilton street <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>to Callowhill street.” That consent was given by an ordinance passed April 28d 1859 (Ordinance of 1859, 198). In accordance with the authority of said acts, railway tracks were laid on Twenty-second street, from Callowhill to Hamilton and thence west on Hamilton street to Callowhill street. 5. Callowhill street, from the bridge at Fairmount, is between curbs twenty-nine feet in width, and the existence of more than a double track at that point would sacrifice the other uses of the highway. If, therefore, the defendants exercised their right as a separate corporation, to lay a double track on Callowhill street between these points, and the Fairmount Passenger Railway Company sought to exercise theirs, and the <em>“ </em>Fairmount and Arch Street City Passenger Railway Company” sought to exercise theirs, the whole width of the street would be occupied without space between each set of tracks. 6. Such an exercise of separate corporate discretion and right would be impossible of execution, as cars could not pass each other, and therefore the several companies did by agreements arrange such running of their cars over the tracks actually laid by the Fairmount Passenger Railway Company and by the Fairmount and Arch street City Passenger Railway Company, as secured to each their separate circuits, the integrity of the several franchises and the- accommodation of the passengers seeking the cars of either. The former company have laid a track from the bridge, along Callowhill street to Twenty-third street; and the latter company have laid a track from the bridge, along Callowhill street to Hamilton, and thence eastwardly along Hamilton to Twenty-second street. These are the tracks now in existence and now used. 7. That by reason of an entire alteration of grades, caused by the construction of the double-decker bridge at Fairmount and of the necessities of public travel, they have become convinced that the franchise of a double track on Callowhill street must be maintained. Accordingly they have made arrangements to remove the tracks laid by the Fairmount Passenger Railway to the side of said Callowhill street and to lay another track beside it on their own behalf. The effect of this would be that the double tracks now existing on Callowhill street, from the bridge to Hamilton street would be continued eastward on the same alignment.</p>

On that day they began to take up and remove the cobble stones from said street for the purpose and with the avowed intention of laying a double track therein; whereupon this suit was commenced and the work enjoined. It is .not charged, and, of course, could not be, or it would have been, that the plan of the double track proposed to be constructed differs from the one which was duly approved and laid in 1858 and removed in 1865. The answer avers that by reason of the alteration of grades caused by construction of the double-decker bridge and the increased public travel, it is necessary that the franchise of a double track be maintained.</p>
    <p id="b218-6" data-blocks='[["BL_218.7",218,[240,1647,1170,688]]]'>The Fairmount Passenger Railroad Company had right to lay a double track on Callowhill street, which was promptly done and the track used for seven years. Then followed a period of ten years during which a single track being sufficient for the business, the double one Avas removed. Their charter required no continuous use of a double track on pain of forfeiture of the right. The public interests, either of the city at large or of the portion adjoining and near the street, were not prejudiced. There has been no attempt to enlarge the power originally granted, or to vary the location of the double track as first laid, nor such frequent changes as to give just cause of complaint. Hence, there are no peculiar circumstances calling for unusual strictness of adjudication on account of misuse or non-user. And, if there were, this bill would not authorize a decree of forfeiture: Slee <em>v. </em>Bloom, 5 Johns. Oh. 879. HoAvever, Ave are of opinion that there is no ground for holding a forfeiture of the right to a double track for non-user.</p>

The franchise is not held at the mercy of any one. It is not now necessary to speak of the,extent of the power of the city to regulate and control the operations of passenger railways. The ordinances set forth in the bill may be valid. Possibly the company may incur a penalty of $500 for each offence of removing cobble pavements for the purpose of relaying a double track as they first laid it under the city’s sanction. Be that as it may, we are not convinced that they should be prohibited the enjoyments of a franchise solemnly granted.</p>
    <p id="b219-6" data-blocks='[["BL_219.6",219,[249,784,1167,1635]],["BL_220.1",220,[244,404,1175,734]]]'>The learned counsel for the city contend that the Act of May 16th 1861, entitled “ An Act relating to railroad companies,” must be regarded as a portion of the General Railroad Law, authorizing roads to be built where none was built before ; generally through the country, requiring bridges, cuttings and fillings, and sometimés tunnels through hills and mountains ; dealing with a distinct subject which existed before passenger railways came into use, while the latter, unlike a railroad, always contemplates a track laid upon an established road, is always restricted to the bounds of a city or town and its immediate vicinity ; and, in the law, a distinction has always been made between railroads and railways, the former term being applied to subjects of the General Railroad Law, and the latter to passenger railways in cities. Their argument is, at least, plausible, but we are not satisfied that it is free from error. In 1861, all railroads were incorporated by special laws, and in so far as each law did not prescribe specially, reference was made to the provisions of the Act of February 19th 1849. This was common in charters for passenger railroads, as well as others. In the statutes, one class was generally styled railroads, and the other more frequently, but not always, railways. These words are popularly used as synonymous, and Webster defines both alike, but this matters little. A slight examination will show that the legislature did not use the words in a distinctive sense. On th;e same date of the act, in consideration, the “ Philadelphia and Delaware River Railroad Company” was authorized to lay passenger tracks on certain streets in Philadelphia, thereby combining both classes in one corporation. Also, same day, a supplement to the charter of the “ Philadelphia and Olney Railroad Company” was passed, which company was incorporated April 1st 1859, with right to lay their tracks on specified streets and highways and connect with passenger railroads. In 1859 the “ Pittsburgh and Birmingham Passenger Railroad Company” was incorporated. Also the “Passenger Railroad Relief Association of Philadelphia.” Two of the three companies consolidated into the company appellant are “ railroads.” These instances sufficiently indicate that the legislature indiscriminately used the words in their popular sense. It is true that, railroads were used in the country prior to theix*' use on the streets of towns, and that many differences necessarily exist in their regulation and <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>management. It is useless to name points of likeness and unlikeness, for there are many of each. And these vary in the same road when one part is in the country and the other in a city. Recently narrow gauge railroads have been introduced, not laid on streets of cities, nor tunnelled through hills and mountains, but running over the latter. All three kinds are railways — are railroads. Then, as respects the title of the Act of 1861, it embraces railways on streets as well as those through or over hills and mountains. It is equally comprehensive in its provisions, not one of which is inap-. plicable to any class of railroads. Not an incongruous clause has been pointed out, considered in relation of proceedings for merger of city passenger railway companies. The right of consolidation is limited to connecting roads. Not in the title, nor in the body of the act, is anything discoverable why its benefits should be confined to a class instead of embracing all. We were not informed at the argument of any extraneous cause for holding that one class was without the legislative intendment.</p>
    <p id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.6",220,[244,1137,1168,473]]]'>Mergers have been made of passenger railway companies and new corporations formed thereby, under this statute. The proper state officers filed the agreements and certificates. No 'one has directly questioned the right of such new corporations to hold property and transact business. Very likely many citizens would severely suffer if all these organizations are void. While the hardship resulting from their mistake, if mistake it was, is no reason for improperly placing them within the intendment of the statute, it is a reason for careful inquiry into the meaning of the law, and not excluding them from its operation by a forced construction against its letter and apparent spirit.</p>
