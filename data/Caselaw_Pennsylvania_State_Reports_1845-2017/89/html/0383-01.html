Black, for a farm, consisting of one hundred acres of land, in Bradford county. The defendant was the youngest son of the plaintiff, and when suit was brought was about forty years of age. On his part, it was alleged that about the time he became of age he entered into' a parol agreement with his father, that he would remain at home and aid in working the farm and render his parents such assistance as their circumstances might require, and that if he did so, then the farm should belong to him after his father’s death absolutely, and that defendant should have a writing to that effect. That in pursuance of this arrangement a will was made in 1857, wherein the farm was devised to defendant and the personal property divided between the plaintiff -s wife and his daughter, Nancy. It appeared that the defendant continued to live upon and work the farm up to 1871, with the exception of two years when he was in the army. In the meantime, Nancy was married, and in 1871 the plaintiff was induced to prepare another paper, in which all the personal property was bequeathed to defendant. This paper was in all respects a will and was formally executed as. such on the 13th of August 1871. Its fifth item was in these words :</p>

An arrangement was made, however, by which the landlord’s share was paid to the father. While Sweat-land was in possession, the plaintiff informed defendant that he did not wish him to return to the place, but before Sweatland moved out the defendant took control and assumed the management of the farm, against the wishes of his father, and refused to surrender possession. On the 31st of December 1873, the plaintiff served a written notice on defendant to surrender possession on the 1st of Api’il following, and, upon a failure to comply therewith, this ejectment was brought on April 2d 1874.</p>

If it is a contract, then the whole arrangement is by parol, and is without consideration and void, and it is clear that no consideration could be added to it after-wards, by a concurrent possession of the land with the father. A nude promise can not be enforced either in equity or at law, and this is emphatically true in regard to a promise to give by will : McClure <em>v. </em>McClure, 1 Barr 874. The will itself was such an instrument as was revocable, and the plaintiff could have revoked it the next day: Bash <em>v. </em>Bash, 9 Barr 260. The arrangement alleged by defendant was that he should stay and assist his father. The will says, that it is understood that he should do so. Does this add to or take anything away from the will, or create any personal interest in the defendant in the land in question.</p>

At the trial a wide field was covered in the examination of witnesses, but the case is now brought within a narrow compass. It depends upon the construction of a writing which one party calls a will and the other a contract. If, taken as a contract, it gives the defendant no present right of possession, it need not be determined whether it is a will.</p>
    <p id="b387-6" data-blocks='[["BL_387.6",387,[197,771,1163,475]]]'>The learned counsel for defendant puts his case thus: <em>“ </em>The defendant sets up no present title to the farm. He has never claimed any right to exclusive possession. What he insists upon is simply that he shall not be turned out of doors and away from the farm when it was agreed between him and his father he should remain during the lifetime of his parents.” The plaintiff claims to recover possession whether the writing is a will or contract. His second point asked instructions that if the jury believed there was an agreement, substantially as defendant alleged, the latter cannot hold possession. He prayed for no instruction as to the title, nor concerning rights defendant would have after the plaintiff’s decease.</p>
    <p id="b387-7" data-blocks='[["BL_387.7",387,[190,1245,1168,1213]],["BL_388.1",388,[264,413,1162,476]]]'>On its face the paper is a will, formally executed as such. The fifth item, in which the residue of the maker’s real and personal estate is given to N. A. Black, contains the following: “ It being understood, that he, the said Niram, is to remain on the farm and assist in working it, and render his parents such assistance as their circumstances may require.” It is alleged by defendant that this will was made in pursuance of agreement, in parol, namely: “ The plaintiff agreed with defendant in 1857 that defendant should remain at home on the farm and assist in working it and render his parents such assistance as their circumstances might require, and that if he did so then the farm should belong to the defendant after his father’s death absolutely, and that defendant should have a writing to show that the farm would be his;” and consequently the will is irrevocable, and binding between these parties as a contract. If this be the contract, who- is entitled to possession of the farm during the vendor’s life ? His contract was to give it at his death, and putting it in form of a will, by its own operation, would vest the title then, and, by irresistible inference he was to retain possession till then. The consideration was services of the vendee to be rendered on the farm. These services were labor and assistance, not control of the farm nor seizure of its products. The vendee is not made tenant during the vendor’s life, to receive the income and dole out subsistence to his parents. Nor is there any provision for joint possession, for joint management, or an interest in common in the use and profits. The parents wished the son, who had just arrived at majority, to remain with them, and, as inducement, promised him the homestead at the father’s death. 'Such arrangements are not infrequent and have not been understood as vesting in the son pre<a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>sent proprietorship, and subjecting the parents to his mercy. Often the parties live in peace for many years and end in strife, as in this case; but now is not a time, to descant on the folly of such loose agreements between parents and children. If the defendant offers to remain and the plaintiff forbids, if he tenders performance of the work and assistance required by his obligation, and holds himself in readiness for such performance, and the plaintiff refuses to receive, the contract will not fall by his delinquency.' He has as little right to remain on the farm by strong-hand, and compel acceptance of labor on it, as he would have to force a money consideration into the vendor’s pocket.</p>

We refer to it only to call attention to the undeniable fact that the defendant is living on the land with his family, cultivating fields, and in exclusive occupancy of a part of the dwelling-house, against his father’s consent. The plaintiff’s second and third points should have been unqualifiedly affirmed, and defendant’s first point refused. It is unnecessary to remark upon other alleged errors in the trial.</p>
