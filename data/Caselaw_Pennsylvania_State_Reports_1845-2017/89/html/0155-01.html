Morey &amp; Co., cotton buyers, at Galveston, Texas, in the early part of 1874 were requested by J. F. Hellen, of Philadelphia, to purchase for him one thousand bales of cotton, to be shipped to Philadelphia. Morey &amp; Co., not being provided with funds to purchase the cotton, applied to Ball, Hutchings &amp; Co., bankers, of Galveston, who agreed to advance the money to make the purchase, upon the express condition that they should be furnished with insurance certificates and drafts drawn on Hellen for the price of the cotton, together with the bills of lading, which bills, as well as the cotton, they were to hold until the drafts were not only accepted but paid. With the funds obtained upon the faith of this arrangement, Morey &amp; Co. purchased the cotton in their own name, shipped the same, and drew on Hellen at thirty days’ sight for the amount. They then endorsed the drafts and bills of lading and gave them to Ball, Hutchings &amp; Co., who transmitted them, duly endorsed, to the City National Bank of New York for collection, which forwarded them to the plaintiff. To both banks express instructions were sent to retain the bills of lading until the drafts were actually paid. To each draft was attached a bill of lading, on which was written, “ Hold bill of lading until draft is paid.” The drafts to which were thus attached the bills of lading were duly presented to Hellen on July 13th 1874, and were accepted by him. The cotton arrived in Philadelphia on July 15th 1874, and upon Hellen being notified to remove it from the wharf <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>of the steamship company, he took it away and stored it in the warehouse of the Hieskells, and on the 17th of July 1874, obtained from them an advance of $10,000 thereon. Hellen failed a few days thereafter. The bank, on July 23d 1874, having learned of the delivery to Hellen, instituted this action. The delivery was made to Hellen without the knowledge of the bank or presentation of the bills. It appeared that in other transactions between these parties, where drafts and bills of lading had been sent with similar instructions as to retention, the cotton had been delivered by the steamship company to Hellen in the same manner without presentation of the original bills of lading.</p>

It is there said by Chief Justice Erie, “ If it were established that a bill of lading — one of the most frequent securities for advances amongst mercantile men — becomes exhausted and ceases to be a security when the ship has reached her destination, and the goods which it represents have been landed and warehoused, what a wide door would be opened for fraud. It is scarcely possible to exaggerate the evil consequences which would be likely to flow from such a doctrine. There is no authority for it.” In a concurring opinion, it is said: “ There can be no complete delivery of the goods under a bill of lading until they come -into the hands of some person who has a right to the possession under it.” Dows <em>v. </em>National Exchange Bank, supra, is in point, and rules the main questions in this case.</p>

It is entirely proper for the court to exclude the irrelevant facts from the consideration of the jury; and, if there is no dispute as to the relevant and material testimony, to instruct them as to its legal effect: Graff <em>v. </em>The Pittsburgh &amp; Steubenville Railroad Co., 7 Casey 489; Johnston <em>v. </em>Gray, 16 S. &amp; R. 361; Dows <em>v. </em>The National Ex.

The testimony as to the inception of the transaction and previous course of dealing; how the bills of lading came to be taken in the name of J. M. Morey &amp; Co., and by them endorsed to Ball, Hutchings &amp; Co., and what occurred subsequently, was undisputed and consistent, but still it was submitted to the jury, with proper instructions as to its legal effect, in case they believed it to be true. They were told that the question was not what Hellen desired Morey &amp; Co. to do, but what they had done ; that inasmuch as Hellen claimed the transaction was a sale <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>of the cotton to him, and insisted upon his rights as a purchaser, he would have to take it subject to such terms as Morey &amp; Co., who were acting for him, were able to make, in order to procure the money to pay for it. There was no error in this. Hellen had never advanced or paid a cent on the cotton, and if he claimed the benefit of the purchase, as made by him through his agents, he could not repudiate the arrangement made by them to secure and pay for the cotton.</p>
    <p id="b162-6" data-blocks='[["BL_162.6",162,[261,723,1169,775]]]'>There was no evidence of any laches on the part of the bank, by which the plaintiff in error was induced to receive the cotton and make the advances thereon. The testimony was undisputed that the bank was instructed to hold the bills of lading until the acceptances were paid; that it knew nothing of Hellen’s having obtained possession of the cotton by the unauthorized act of the steamboat company, until after it was stored with the plaintiff in error and the money had been advanced. Nor was there anything in the circumstances under which previous deliveries had been made to Hellen by the carrier, that was calculated to affect the bank. It was in no way a party to these unauthorized transactions, and so far as appeared was ignorant of his having thus obtained wrongful possession of the cotton on former occasions. In every case the bank had been instructed to retain the bill of lading until the accompanying draft was paid, and this instruction was always literally carried out. The bills of lading provided for the storage of the cotton by the carrier, in case it was not called for, and the bank might reasonably suppose that this had been or would be done.</p>

It is unfortunate that the plaintiff in error should lose the amount he advanced in apparent good faith; but, similar results often happen when property is purchased from one who has no title or right to sell. The trouble in this ease was brought about by the unauthorized act of the carrier, in putting Hellen in possession of the cotton; but, for this, the defendant in error was in no way responsible.</p>
    <p id="b162-8" data-blocks='[["BL_162.8",162,[1057,1843,330,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
