In 1836 said real estate was divided by proceedings in partition. The inquest appraised a purpart and D.’s son George took it at the valuation. , The court approved the security George offered for the payment of the proportions of the widow and other heirs, and adjudged the purpart to him, his heirs and assigns for ever, “ he having entered the usual securities to pay the other heirs according to law.” The record omitted to state the form of the security, and neither bond nor recognisance could be found. In 1858 the widow died. In 1860 II. obtained a judgment against George. In 1862 George confessed a judgment to the heirs in an amount that covered the one-third allotted to the widow and the proportions of the heirs. This judgment was not duly revived. After the decease of George, the real estate was sold under an order of the Orphans’ Court, and II. claimed that he had the prior lien upon the fund. The auditor allowed the heirs their respective proportions in the third allotted to the widow, with interest from her death, but decided that the ■ lien of the heirs to their own proportions did not extend farther back than to the judgment confessed to them by George, and that that judgment, not having been revived, the judgment, of II. was entitled to priority. The court below held that the proportions of the heirs should have been paid before judgment creditor. <em>Held, </em>that this was error.</p>

The action of the court, in awarding purpart ‘A’ to George Deibert, ‘he having entered into the usual securities to pay the other heirs according to law,’ the auditor discusses at. length, and decides that there is no evidence that the security in this case was a recognisance, and, therefore, holds it was a mere personal obligation on the part of George Deibert to the other heirs. But I think the evidence is stronger that a recognisance was the security given, than that it was a bond or other personal obligation.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b492-6" data-blocks='[["BL_492.6",492,[248,863,1172,1246]]]'>“As far back as the case of Walton <em>v. </em>Willis, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Dallas%20265" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Dallas 265">1 Dallas 265</a>, the Supreme Court said that where an heir-at-law takes an intestate’s lands at a valuation, the Orphans’ Court ought, instead of bonds, to take recognisances by which the lands themselves would be bound for the distributive shares. That this was generally followed by the lower courts, and a recognisance adopted as the usual security, is apparent from the report of the commissioners, who drafted the Act of 29th March 1832, relating to Orphans’ Court. In their remarks on the 37th section, they say : ‘ We have introduced the word <em>recognisance </em>into the latter clause of this section, that being the kind of security which is most usually taken, and, it appears to us, the most proper to be taken, although we have not felt ourselves authorized to limit the authority of the court to this mode.’ That the usual security required by the court of George Deibert, in accepting the purpart awarded to him, was a recognisance, was expressly acknowledged by him in the judgment confessed'to the other heirs. All the parties seemed to have acted on that understanding. Some of the heirs have been paid in full for their interests, exclusive of the widow’s third. As to the others the balances were ascertained and set forth in the judgment. No bond or personal obligation is heard of in this settlement between the parties. If a single bond was given, or separate obligations were given to each of the heirs, they would, of course, be in their possession, and the judgment, it would be fair to presume, would be based upon it then, instead of an admitted recognisance. Notwithstanding the able argument of the auditor on the point, we think he erred in his ruling that the security given in the Orphans’ Court by George Deibert was a personal obligation and not a recognisance.</p>

He therefore decreed that the unpaid portions of the two-thirds, as well as the third on which the widow drew the interest, should be paid in preference to any judgments subsequently recovered against George. This is assigned for error.</p>
    <p id="b496-5" data-blocks='[["BL_496.5",496,[254,681,1166,817]]]'>The 41st section of the Act of 29th March 1832, relating to. the partition of the real estate of a decedent declares, “should the widow of the decedent be living at the time of the partition, she shall not be entitled to the payment of the sum at which her purpart or share of the estate shall he valued, but the same, together with interest thereof, shall be and remain charged upon the premises, if the whole be taken by one child or other descendant of the deceased, or upon the respective shares, if divided as herein before mentioned, and the legal interest thereof shall be annually and regularly paid by the persons to whom such real estate shall be adjudged, their heirs or assigns holding the same, according to their respective portions, to the said widow during her natural life, in lieu and full satisfaction of her dower at common law, and the same may be recovered by the widow by distress or otherwise, as rents in this Commonwealth are recoverable. On the death of the widow, the said principal sum shall be paid by the children or other lineal descendants, to whom the said real estate shall have been adjudged, their heirs or assigns, holding the premises to the persons thereunto legally entitled.”</p>
    <p id="b496-6" data-blocks='[["BL_496.6",496,[254,1498,1168,902]],["BL_497.1",497,[183,387,1171,906]]]'>The Act of 19th April 1794, in substantially like language declared “ the purpart of the widow shall be valued, and the same together with the interest, shall remain charged on the premises ; the interest to be paid annually and at her decease the principal sum to be distributed and divided among the children, and representatives of the intestate.” The character and duration of the widow’s lien under this Act of 1794, received a careful consideration in Medlar et al. <em>v. </em>Aulenbach and wife, <a href="/pen-w/2/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2 Pen. &amp; W. 355" data-case-ids="8878723" data-case-paths="/pen-w/2/0355-01">2 P. &amp; W. 355</a>. It was there held that when the legislature thought proper to divest the right given to the widow, by the common law, they took effectual care of her interest by creating a statutory lien to the extent of the value of the purpart which with the interest was to remain charged on the purpart; and as the death of the widow might occur at an indefinite period of time, they had also extended the lien to the heirs and legal representatives. In this respect a distinction was made between the purpart of the widow and the shares of the heirs of the intestate. The latter are placed on a different footing. They are payable at a fixed and short period of time after the allotment. But as to the sum, on which the widow draws the interest, and to which the heirs are not entitled until after her death, the statute has stamped the same continued lien, as on the interest <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>■which it produces. Nor does the fact that security was given for its payment by either bond or recognisance change the effect of the lien. It is merely cumulative to guard against accidents by fire or otherwise. It is collateral only, the law creates the lien: De Haven <em>v. </em>Bartholomew, 7 P. F. Smith 126. The lien thus created by statute for the- security of the widow’s rights, can no more be lost by the recovery of a judgment or merged therein, than the lien of a recorded mortgage is lost or merged by the issuing of a scire facias, and obtaining judgment thereon. Nothing less than payment discharges the lien. A sheriff’s sale on a judgment obtained against the heir to whom the purpart was allotted, will not divest the widow’s lien : Fisher <em>v. </em>Kean, <a href="/watts/1/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Watts 259" data-case-ids="1838090" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0259-01">1 Watts 259</a>. Nor will an actual payment to the administrator authorized by an order of court to sell the land, under proceedings in partition, discharge the lien which the heir has- in the share allotted to the widow : Hise <em>v. </em>Geiger, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 273" data-case-ids="481774" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0273-01">7 W. &amp; S. 273</a>. As, however, this preferred and continued lien does not extend to the portion which the heirs of John were entitled to on his death, the decree must be reversed in so far as it prefers the several sums due on two-thirds of the whole valuation, but in holding the heirs entitled to their respective shares in the one-third allotted to the widow, no error was committed.</p>
