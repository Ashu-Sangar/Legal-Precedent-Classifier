Eehr against Charles Graver, trustee, before a justice of the peace to recover possession of certain premises from the defendant, who, the plaintiff alleged, held them under him as his tenant by virtue of a lease in writing. During the progress of the case, both parties appeared on several occasions before the justice. On December 5th 1877, judgment was given in favor of the plaintiff and a writ of possession issued. The record of the justice, after describing the premises, set forth that the plaintiff “ did demise the said premises during the will and pleasure of Morgan W. Fehr to Charles Graver, trustee, for his wife Melinda Graver, the tenant now in possession, and that the said Charles Graver, trustee as aforesaid, entered into possession of <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>said premises by virtue of said lease in writing and held the same, and that the said term for which the premises were demised is fully ended.” There was also a statement of denial and notice, and that the defendant had refused to deliver possession. The writ of possession was superseded on the same day it issued by a writ of certiorari taken by the defendant. ■ ■ After argument this writ was quashed by the court, and an alias writ of possession was issued by the justice on January 28th 1878. The constable then made return on Januai’y 29th that possession of the demised premises had been given to the plaintiff, and that defendant had “no goods.” A second certiorari was issued February 26th 1878, and the following, among other exceptions, were filed to the proceedings of the justice:</p>

It is claimed, however, that in this particular case, the record made by the justice shows no amount of rent reserved. This was known when the first writ of certiorari was taken, which was in time,' with full knowledge of all the facts. Can the defendant, after having failed in his first writ of certiorari lay by till nearly a month after possession has been given under the alias writ of possession, and then issue his second writ of certiorari, on the ground that the omission of the justice to specify a rent reserved ousted his jurisdiction ? If so, how often in the same case, and at what indefinite length of time may he avail himself of the privilege ? The judgment here was not obtained by trick or fraud, and is not within the cases which decide that a party may issue his certiorari where more than twenty days have elapsed, provided he takes action within twenty days after the facts have come to his knowledge. Counsel for the defendant strenuously resisted the offer made by counsel for plaintiff to submit the written agreement to the court, for the reason that the record of the justice alone must govern, and the written contract recited by the justice was therefore withheld. Our impression is that the defendant has been guilty of such laches as gives him no right to now invoke the powers of the court. He refused to appeal in the proper time, and if he can succeed in his present effort, it will lead to a very <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>troublesome line of practice which we are not willing to inaugurate, unless in obedience to the mandate of a superior power.”</p>

    <p id="b463-7" data-blocks='[["BL_463.9",463,[188,656,1164,944]]]'>This was a proceeding, instituted by Morgan W. Fehr, the plaintiff below, before a justice of the peace, under the Landlord and Tenant Act of December 14th 1863 (Pamph. L. 1864, 1127), to recover from the defendant certain demised premises, situated in the borough of Tremont, Schuylkill county. The record of the justice, after describing the premises, setg out, that the plaintiff <em>“ </em>did demise the said premises, during the will and pleasure of Morgan W. Fehr, to Charles Graver, trustee, for his wife, Melinda Graver, the tenant now in possession, and that the said Charles Graver, trustee, as aforesaid, entered into possession of said premises by virtue of said lease in writing, and held the same, and that the said term, for -which the- said premises were demised, is fully ended.” There is also a statement of demand and notice, and the necessary allegation that the defendant had refused to deliver up possession. In all these proceedings, however, there is nothing by which the jurisdiction of the justice can even be inferred. The supplement to the Act of 1863, approved March 6th 1872 (Pamph. L. 22), prohibits a proceeding under this act, “ unless such proceeding shall be founded on a written lease or contract in writing, or on a parol agreement in and by which’ the relation of landlord and tenant- is established between the parties, and a <em>certain rent is therein reserved."</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b463-8" data-blocks='[["BL_463.10",463,[189,1598,1172,821]],["BL_464.1",464,[270,381,1166,513]]]'>Now, not only does it not appear by the proceedings before the justice, that a certain rent was reserved, in the lease therein recited, but from the whole case, as we have it before us, it is manifest that there was no such rent. As, therefore, this summary proceeding, though convenient and necessary in proper cases, is in derogation of the common law, and as it is given only by statute, the necessary jurisdiction must appear affirmatively on the face of the record, or the proceeding is <em>coram non judice </em>and utterly void McGee <em>v. </em>Fessler, 1 Barr 126. We have here, however, a case in the.very teeth of the legislative-prohibition ; a lease at will without a reservation of rent of any kind, so that, so far as jurisdiction is^ concerned, it is affirmatively, by the proceedings themselves, put out of the question. Indeed, it does not seem to be seriously denied but that the justice, in taking cognisance of and giving judgment in .the case, did that which the law gave him no right to do, but the defendant was turned out of,.court..on the ground that the certiorari, not having been sued out within twenty duys from the rendition of the judgment, was too late. This was error; for, in the first place, even under the twenty-first section of the Act of <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>1810, this limitation does not apply where it is apparent the justice has no jurisdiction : Lacock <em>v. </em>White, 7 Harris 495. And, in the second place, that act does not apply to the summary process for obtaining possession of leased property under the Landlord and Tenant Acts. This was so held by Judge King in Rubicum <em>v. </em>Williams, 1 Ash. 230, and we are inclined to think that, in this, his conclusion was correct. The Act of 1810, known as the “ One Hundred Dollar Act,” is a uniform, symmetrical code, designed to regulate the powers and jurisdiction of justices of the peace in the collection of “ debts and demands,” and the twenty-first section, being part and parcel thereof, extends to nothing beyond its provisions.</p>
    <p id="b464-6" data-blocks='[["BL_464.6",464,[270,895,1161,590]]]'>It is true the Act of 1863, as well as that of 1830, provides that “ nothing therein contained shall prevent the issuing of a certiorari with the usual form and effect, but the usual form and effect of this writ is found rather in. its general judicial character than in any description of it as found in the Act of 1810. .Besides this, it has an effect in that act which it has not in the summary proceedings under consideration. When properly sued out, under the statute above named, it becomes 'a supersedeas to further proceedings, but such is not the case under the Landlord and Tenant Acts. This was so held, under the Act of 1772, in the cases of Grubb <em>v. </em>Fox, <a href="/binn/6/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="6 Binn. 460" data-case-ids="1795151" data-case-paths="/binn/6/0460-01">6 Binn. 460</a>, and Stewart <em>v. </em>Martin, <a href="/yeates/1/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 Yeates 49" data-case-ids="6771627" data-case-paths="/yeates/1/0049-01">1 Yeates 49</a>, and we can find nothing in the later acts which would alter this rule. We think, therefore, that the court below erred in the disposition of the defendant’s writ.</p>
