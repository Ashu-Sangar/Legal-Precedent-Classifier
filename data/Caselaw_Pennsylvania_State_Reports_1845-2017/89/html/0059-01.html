On the morning of February 24th 1877, the deceased, who was a paper carrier, was observed standing on the crossing about five feet from the east track of the railroad, on which was slowly passing a long train of coal cars. As soon as the caboose, at the rear of the coal train passed, Werner walked across the east track, and in attempting to cross the west one, was struck by a passing engine coming from the direction in which the coal train was moving, and was instantly killed. One of the plaintiffs’ witnesses, a brakeman on the coal train, testified that he saw Werner standing on the crossing, and that as soon as the caboose of the coal train cleared the crossing he walked across, and that witness called to him to look out, “ but he never looked up and went straight on;” and, stated the witness, “I would have done the same thing.” Another brakeman testified, on behalf of plaintiffs : “ Werner was looking on the other side when I first saw him after he had passed the caboose. I can’t tell which way the man was looking when he was crossing. He just looked across and started. He must have looked up the track, for he started or drew back, but did not get away quick enough. Werner just got about a step away from the west track; did not get on it; he was struck on the right side by the beam of the engine; it projects beyond the track about one-and-a-half feet.”</p>

You will recollect the testimony of the first witness called, who was the brakeman on the coal train; he called to him to look Out. Now, whether Werner heard that we have ho means of knowing. Whether he did not hear it, or whether hearing it, he was under the impression that he would get across, and committed an error of judgment in coming forward, or whether having got into a difficult position — having got between the two tracks-r-he then was put in a position of having to choose between two evils, and went forward as the least evil of the two, we are not able to say from any positive testimony. In the latter case, of course, that is an exception to <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>the general rule which I have given you. [If a man has got himself, without negligence, into a position of danger, he is not responsible if he makes a mistake of judgment in getting out.

There was, therefore, a space of four feet in the centre between those tracks, where a man might stand and be entirely safe from passing trains; but if you have ever had any experience of standing near a train of cars or a locomotive coming at the rate of twenty-three miles or twenty-four miles ’an hour, you must remember that it takes a man of pretty steady nerve to stand within a few inches of a locomotive, and the slightest mistake, a mistake of either involuntary starting of the nerves, or of judgment in the distance, may subject a man to the risk of being struck. [Therefore it may be that Mr. Werner, having got out from behind this coal train, found himself between the tracks, in a position of danger, and went forward as the least dangerous alternative that he had presented to him. Iiis action under such circumstances would, of course, not be negligence on his part, but if he got himself into a position of danger by negligence in the first place, he would not be excused by any subsequent danger.] * * * If, therefore, you are satisfied under the testimony that the deceased did not perform his full legal duty of stopping, looking and listening before he crossed, but if you think that, as described by one of the witnesses for the defence, the moment this caboose car of the coal train got beyond the crossing, he darted across without looking up or down the road, that was negligence on his part, and however unfortunate the result, the railroad company cannot be made to pay for it. * * * I have substantially affirmed all the defendants’ points, if the jury find the facts as assumed.

Testimony, tending to prove that the deceased, August Werner, lost his life by the negligence and improper conduct of the employees of the railroad company, was introduced, and, without objection, submitted to the jury, who, by their verdict, have settled that question in favor of the plaintiffs below. It must therefore be assumed as a fact that the company was guilty of negligence. In the court below the defence was <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>rested mainly on the ground of concurring negligence on the part of the deceased; and, as to that, the contention now is that under the testimony it was a question of law for the court, and not one of fact for the jury. It was not raised, as is sometimes done, on a motion for a nonsuit, grounded solely on the plaintiffs’ testimony, but by a request for binding instructions after the testimony on both sides was closed. The five points submitted by the learned counsel for the company are each based on the assumption that acts of the deceased, constituting contributory negligence, were established beyond reasonable doubt, and the court was asked to say, as matter of law, that the plaintiffs could not recover.</p>
    <p id="b64-5" data-blocks='[["BL_64.6",64,[241,862,1164,649]]]'>The learned judge who presided at the trial, after fairly presenting the questions of fact raised by the testimony, submitted them .to the jury in a very clear and able charge, in which he affirmed the defendants’ points, provided the jury found “the facts as therein assumed,” but declined to affirm them as matters of law. In the course of his charge, after calling the attention of the jury to the testimony and stating in the most pointed and emphatic terms the duty of the deceased, he proceeded to say, “ If, therefore, you are satisfied under the testimony, that the deceased did not perform his full legal duty of stopping, looking and listening before he crossed; but, if you think, as described by one of the witnesses for the defence, the moment the caboose car of the coal train got beyond his crossing, he darted across without looking up or down the road, that was negligence on his part, and however unfortunate the result the railroad company cannot be made to pay for it.”</p>

The line of demarcation, in this respect, between the duty of the court and that of the jury should be carefully guarded. While, on the one hand, the court should not permit the jury to disregard or evade its instructions as to matters of law, it should be equally careful not to invade the province of the jury and take upon itself the determination of facts about which there is 'any dispute.</p>

This was asking the court to do more than the evidence warranted. The undisputed testimony was that he did stop, when he came to <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>the railroad; indeed, he was compelled to do so by the passing coal train. When first seen by the brakeman, who was on the caboose attached to the train, he was standing in the centre of Erie avenue, a few feet from the eastern side of the track, and there he remained until the coal train passed by. To conclude that he did not listen while standing there, would require a strained and unnatural inference. The presumption would rather be that he did listen as well as look. The love of life and the instinct of self-preservation are too strong to justify the inference that he was heedless all the while, and failed to exercise ordinary care. The common-law presumption is that every one does his duty until the contrary is proved, and none of the witnesses undertake to say that he did not both look and listen while waiting for the coal train to pass. It is undoubtedly true that when the plaintiff’s own evidence discloses contributory negligence, there can be no recovery; but, if it does not, the burthen is on the defendant to disprove care, and, in such case, the question of negligence is for the jury: Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Weber, 26 P. F. Smith 157. The vice of these points was that they assumed more than was clearly proved.</p>

The witness already referred to, after describing the situation and Werner’s movements, says: “I would have done the same thing.” Another brakeman, who narrowly escaped being run over by the locomotive, says: “ Werner was looking on the other side when I first saw him, after he passed the caboose. I can’t tell what way-he was looking, when he was crossing. He just looked across and started. He must have looked up the track, for he started or drew back, but did not get away quick enough.”</p>

There is nothing in the testimony that would have justified the court in assuming these as uncontroverted facts. One of the witnesses testified that he hallooed, “Look out!” This was done, as the witness says, to warn him of the approaching locomotive; but it would be difficult to say, from the testimony, whether he heard the warning or not, or if he did what he supposed it meant. Possibly, if Werner had survived, he would say that he heard the warning, and thought it had reference to the coal train, and that he was thus induced to hasten across the track so as to escape danger. This would be a more reasonable inference than that he heard the warning that a <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>locomotive was coming, disregarded it and pressed on to his own destruction.</p>

This also would have been an unwarranted assumption of fact on the part of the court.

    <p id="b66-6" data-blocks='[["BL_66.6",66,[275,803,1170,390]]]'>The question is not whether the testimony did not point strongly to the conclusion that the deceased was chargeable with contributory negligence in one or more of the particulars stated in the points, but whether there was such conclusive evidence of the facts as would warrant the court in regarding them as clearly established, and declaring, as matter of law, that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence, and therefore his widow and children could not recover. We are not prepared to say that there were such undisputed facts.</p>

On the contrary, we think that if they had been so affirmed, the learned judge would have invaded the province of the jury and taken upon.himself the determination of facts which properly belonged to them. The testimony revealed, as far as was possible, the position and movements of the deceased and the circumstances by which he was surrounded at the time he met his death; and it was for them to find the facts, draw such inferences as were warranted, and, under the direction of the court as to the law, say whether he was chargeable with negligence which contributed to the accident.
