Crill.\nPractice, Supreme Court\u2014Appeals\u2014Jurisdiction as to amount\u2014Superior Court.\nThe Supreme Court has no jurisdiction over an appeal where the judgment in the court below is for an amount less than $1,500, although the judgment may incidentally settle the right to future sums which will exceed $1,500.\nArgued Oct. 12, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 121, Oct. T., 1900, by defendant, from decree of C. P. Mercer Co., April T., 1899, No. 2, on bill in equity, in suit of Samuel Hosack, executor of John Hosack, deceased, et al., v. John T. Crill. Certified to the Superior Court.\nBill in equity for an account. Before Miller, P. J.\n. From the record it appeared that the question in controversy was whether a written agreement effected a sale of coal in place, or whether it was*a lease of the coal.\n' The court found that the agreement effected a sale of coal in place, and entered a decree in favor of the plaintiffs for $572.66, being the amount of certain royalties which had accrued.\nThe court filed a certificate that the amount involved in the proceeding exceeded the sum of $1,500. The case apparently adjudicated not only the ownership of the sum of $572.66, being the amount of accrued royalties in actual controversy, but also incidentally adjudicated the right to future royalties.\nErrors assigned were various findings of fact and conclusions of law.\nW. W. Moore, J. W. Bell and S. S. Mehard, for appellant.\nB. Magoffin, for appellees.\nOctober 12, 1900:"
