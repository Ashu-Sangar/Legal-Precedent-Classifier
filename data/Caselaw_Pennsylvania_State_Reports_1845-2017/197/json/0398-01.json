He claims under a sale on execution against J. R. Patterson & Company in 1886, on a judgment founded on a note made in 1881. It is admitted that title to the land was in J. R. Patterson & Company in 1866, but defendant gave uncontradicted evidence that the Patterson who as individual or as one of a firm owned the land in 1866, died in 1868. The judgment on which plaintiff\u2019s title rested was therefore either void because entered against a dead man, or was against a different J. R. Patterson from the one to whom the land was conveyed bjr Adams in 1866. In either case plaintiff\u2019s title failed even against one who held the bare possession. The tax sale deeds put in evidence by defendant were superfluous ones, but their admission did plaintiff no harm.

National Transit Company.\nEjectment\u2014Record title\u2014Execution\u2014Failure of plaintiff's title.\nIn an action of ejectment where the defendant is in possession under color of title, plaintiff cannot recover where it appears that his only claim to the title is under an execution issued on a judgment entered on a note of a date subsequent to the date of the death of the alleged maker.\nArgued Oct. 15, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 51, Oct. T., 1900, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. Venango Co., Nov. T., 1898, No. 78, on verdict for defendant in case of W. J. Kountz, trustee for the persons named in the last will of P. W. Kountz, v. National Transit Company.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nEjectment for a lot of land in Oil City. Before Criswell, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that the defendant was in possession under a color of title by reason of certain tax deeds. It was not disputed that prior to December 29, 1866, title was in W. H. Adams, who on that day conveyed the lots to J. R. Patterson & Company in fee simple. The deed did not show who composed the firm of J. R. Patterson & Company. The evidence was uncontradicted that J. R. Patterson died on January 18, 1868. On July 19, 1886, judgment was entered on a judgment note bearing date July 23, 1881, purporting to have been given by J. R. Patterson & Company to W. J. Kountz for $3,950. Plaintiff claimed under a sale on execution issued on this judgment. The court gave binding instructions for defendant.\nVerdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned amongst others was in giving binding instructions for defendant.\nBryan H. Osborne, with him John 0. MbOalmont, for appellant.\n\u2014The note, judgment, execution, sale and deed were admitted without objection, and there was no contention either that the note was not executed by a member of the partnership named in the Adams deed, or that it was not for a just debt of the partnership. That it was for a partnership debt must be presumed : Evans v. Watts, 192 Pa. 112; Morris v. Wallace, 3 Pa. 319; Grier v. Hood, 25 Pa. 430; Miller v. Royal Flint Glass Works, 172 Pa. 70; Boyd v.

Wood, 71 Pa. 488; Oliver\u2019s Est., 136 Pa. 43.\nIn any case the plaintiff\u2019s title, acquired by judicial sale upon an unimpeached judgment, the sheriff\u2019s deed having been duly acknowledged, cannot now be attacked collaterally, least of all by this defendant: McFee v. Harris, 25 Pa. 102; Benninghoff v. Stephenson, 161 Pa. 440; Hageman v. Salisberry, 74 Pa. 280; Weaver v. Brenner, 145 Pa. 299; Kennedy v. Baker, 159 Pa. 146.\nH. MeSweeney, with him J. JET. Osmer, A. R. Osmer and N. F. Osmer, for appellee.\n\u2014J. R. Patterson being the only defendant named upon the record in the judgment entered to No. 206, April term, 1886, and he having died long prior to the entry of said judgment and many years before the date of the note on which such judgment was confessed, the judgment so entered was absolutely void as to him, and his name must be stricken from the record, and if so stricken from the record the judgment would only remain against the \u201c & Co.,\u201d a name too indefinite to sustain a judgment: McConnell v. Apollo Savings Bank, 146 Pa. 79; Mexican Mill Co. v. Yellow Jacket Silver Mining Co., 97 Am. Dec. 510; Castle v. Reynolds, 10 Watts, 51; Dellone v. Wagner, 2 York Legal Record, 41.\nThe defendant had the right in this case to attack the title set up by the plaintiff as the purchaser of the property in controversy at the sheriff\u2019s sale made in pursuance of proceedings on the judgment entered against J. R. Patterson & Company to No. 206, April term, 1886, and to show that the plaintiff acquired no title by reason of her purchase at said sale: Breckwoldt v. Morris, 149 Pa. 293 ; Pall v.
