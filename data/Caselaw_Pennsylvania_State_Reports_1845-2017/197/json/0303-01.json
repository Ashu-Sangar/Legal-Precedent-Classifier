Pantall.\nPractice, Stipreme Court\u2014Appeals\u2014Equity\u2014Failure to file brief statement of errors.\nThe Supreme Court will quash an appeal from a decree in equity, where the appellant has failed to file in the court below, with his notice of appeal, the brief statement of errors required by the equity rules.\nArgued Oct. 10, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 19, Oct. T., 1900, by plaintiff, from decree of C. P. Jefferson County, May T., 1896, No. 1, on bill in equity in case of S. T. North v. J. Reece Pan-\ntall and Irwin Simpson.\nAppeal quashed.\nMotion to quash appeal.\nThe appellees moved the court to quash the appeal because there was no compliance with the following equity rule:\n\u201c Whenever an appeal shall be taken from an order or decree in equity the appellant shall file in the court below, with his notice of appeal, a brief statement of tbe errors he alleges to have been made by the order or decree appealed from, or the findings on which it rests. No other errors shall be assigned in the Supreme Court.\u201d\nSee 159 Pa. 28.\nWinslow Calderwood and Jenks 8f Corbet, for appellees.\u2014\nRemarks in support of motion to quash. The rule has the force and effect of a positive enactment: Cassidy v. Knapp, 167 Pa. 305; Barlott v. Forney, 187 Pa. 301; Swoope v. Wakefield, 10 Pa. Superior Ct. 342; Wilson v. Keller, 195 Pa. 98.\nThere is no ground for alleging mere \u201coversight\u201d and absence of \u201cspecial hardship\u201d to appellees. Notice of appeal was given June 29, 1899. (The record so far as printed does not show that it was taken at all.) There has been ample time for observation, reflection and action, but nothing done. The rule was intended to inform the court below, advise the other party, and define the errors alleged to be considered in this court. The profession has been amply warned to observe it.\nThe present instance has 'worked hardship to appellees in delay, uncertainty, deprivation of time for deliberation and preparation, and notice only at the very last moment of the assignment of errors alleged.\nOctober 10, 1900:"
