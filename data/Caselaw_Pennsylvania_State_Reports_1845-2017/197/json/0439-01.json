No act of incompetency on the part of Weigle previous to the act complained of was shown, and it was not claimed prior to that time that any incompetency on his part was suggested or known to the defendant. All of his previous acts evinced care on his part, and could not well be considered as proof of incompetency in the performance of the duties pertaining to the work to which he was called. It follows from the evidence in the case that the defendant was not properly chargeable with negligence in employing him. That he used more than ordinary care in the performance of the work to which he was assigned was no evidence of incompetency. Nor did such care at any'time impose additional liability on the defendant.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Bruce v. Penn Bridge Company.\nNegligence\u2014 Fellow-servant\u2014 Employment of incompetent workmen\u2014 Nonsuit.\nIn an action by an employee against his employer to recover damages for personal injuries caused by the negligence of a fellow-servant, a non-suit is properly entered, where no act of inoowpetenoy or negligence on the part of the fellow-servant previous to the act complained of was shown, and it was not claimed prior to that time that any incompetency on his part was suggested or known to the defendant. In such a case the fact that the fellow-servant used more than ordinary care in the performance of the work to which he was assigned, was no evidence of incompetency; nor did such care at any time impose additional liability on the defendant.\nArgued Oct. 15, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 150, Oct. T., 1900, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. Beaver Co., June T., 1898, No. 178, refusing to take off nonsuit in case of G. W. Bruce v. Penn Bridge Company.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Pell, Brown and Mestrezat, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before Wilson, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that on November 25, 1896, G. W. Bruce, while in the employment of the defendant in constructing a bridge over the Ohio River, was injured by the negligent act of Oliver Weigle, another employee of the defendant, in permitting a piece of timber to fall upon Bruce\u2019s head. Weigle went into the defendant\u2019s employment in July, 1896, and while there was evidence that he had a reputation for carelessness and awkwardness, it did not appear that the defendant company had any knowledge of his reputation. There was proof that Weigle was somewhat nervous, and that he exercised more than ordinary care in clambering over the bridge, and that in crossing on a beam or girder he would sometimes get down on his hands and knees. The specific act which caused the accident was the only one of the kind ever shown to have occurred on the part of Weigle. The court entered a compulsory non-suit which it subsequently refused to take off.\njError assigned was in refusing to take off nonsuit.\nRobert Ritehie, with him John M. Buchanan, William A. Me Connell and D. A. Cooper, for appellant,\ncited as to the duty of an employer in hiring servants: 1 Shearman & Redfield on Negligence (5th ed.), sec. 191; Prescott v.
