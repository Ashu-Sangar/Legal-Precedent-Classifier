These findings were conclusive of the issues raised. Whether the plaintiff as sheriff of the county fully performed official duties not connected with the service of his special deputies was a question which under the pleadings and evidence did not enter into the case.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

T., 1900, by defendants, from judgment of tbe Superior Court, April T., 1900, No. 125, affirming judgment of C. P. Washington County, Feb. T., 1899, No. 186, on verdict for plaintiff in case of J. Y. Clark v. J. V. H. Cook et al., trading as Cook & Sons.\nBefore McCollum, C, J., Mitchell, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit by sheriff to recover expenses of special deputies.Before McIlvaine, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that on July 3, 1897, a strike was instituted at the defendants\u2019 mines in Washington county. On application of the defendants, the sheriff furnished a number of special deputies to protect the defendants\u2019 mines from the attacks of a large number of strikers who had established a camp in the vicinity. The evidence tended to show that the defendants had agreed to pay the wages of the special deputies, and that the sheriff and the special deputies had performed the services contracted for. The defendants claimed in the first place that there was no sufficient evidence of a contract to pay the deputies, and in the second place, that even if there was, the sheriff could not recover because he had not afforded defendants the protection, which as a public officer, he might and could have done. The case is reported in 14 Pa. Superior Gt. 309.\nError assigned was the judgment of the Superior Court.\nBoyd Crumrine, with him B. W. Irwin and E. E. Orumrine, for appellants.\nW. S. Parker, with him Winfield McIlvaine, for appellee.\nJanuary 7,1901:"
