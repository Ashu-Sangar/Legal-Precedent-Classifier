The daughters were aged twenty-two and twenty, respectively, and the son nineteen years. On July 5, 1899, between the hours of 12 and 1 o’clock in the afternoon when the prisoner and his wife were alone in the kitchen of the house, the prisoner lighted his pipe by a piece of paper ignited at the stove. Immediately thereafter the wife’s clothes took fire. She rushed from the house and attracted the attention of neighbors, who hurried to her rescue. The woman was terribly burned. She declared to her rescuers immediately, and subsequently to her children, when they returned, that the prisoner had set her on fire. The wife died on July 17. On the night of July 16, she sent for a lawyer and a priest, and made a declaration which was reduced to writing, that her husband had set her on fire.

Nor, should evidence of this character be excluded because the death is delayed for any length of time, if the death resulted from the injury in question. We think the law permits evidence of this character to be given to the jury, and that it has the same force under the law as it would have if the deceased person were alive and called and sworn as a witness testifying to the facts in question.

And it is because of that principle that the rule of law has been established, that has been invoked in this case, allowing the ante-mortem statements of persons who die from injuries to their persons to be given in evidence, and to have the same effect, under the law, as to the facts about the occurrence of the injury, that the testimony of the person deceased would have if that person were in court and upon the witness stand <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>giving in testimony to the same effect. So we have permitted the commonwealth in this case to give sundry statements of this deceased woman in evidence by the mouths of other witnesses as proof in this case that the law allows; and all of that evidence is for your consideration. As we have said, while there is no other living witness to that transaction, this deceased woman speaks of it through the mouths of others, who are really in effect taking her place before the court and jury in this matter against her husband, the defendant, charged with killing her by burning her. So you will observe there is a conflict between the one and the other (speaking of her as a witness hei’e now), as to whether this man is guilty of setting fire to this woman by burning her up, or by burning her so her life would be shortened or destroyed. We shall speak of that again in some remarks that we shall make later on; but we regard that as an important point in the investigation of this matter by the jury in determining what is the fact about this matter; for that is what the jurors are to determine, and with the court rests the responsibility for what the law is applicable to the case. In considering what weight you should give to the testimony of these two witnesses, the one here and the deceased, you should consider their relations to this matter and the circumstances under which they give in their testimony, so to speak. As to this deceased woman, of course you understood the proof (and that was necessary in order that the statement should be admitted in evidence at all), that she was then under the belief that death was impending over her. That was a matter that had to be addressed to the consciousness of the court, and if the court had not become satisfied on the subject, that she was in that belief at that time, this written statement should not have been admitted as evidence and read to the jury. But as we have meant to be understood, we think that is not the case trying here, because we must take all the evidence as to the statements of the deceased woman as part of the case: and as we remember it, one of those statements was distinctly that this defendant did, in fact, light the clothes of the woman, and so we think it is a part of the case of the commonwealth that you are to dispose of.] [7]</p>

    <p id="b407-7" data-blocks='[["BL_407.14",407,[119,1360,1180,816]]]'>The defendant was indicted for the murder of his wife, and was duly convicted of murder of the first degree. From the judgment pronounced upon him he appealed to this court, alleging errors in rulings on offers of evidence and in the charge. The errors alleged and complained of are included in eight assignments, six of which relate to rulings on offers of evidence, and two relate to the charge. The defendant was represented by competent counsel, who earnestly and ably discussed the questions raised by the assignments. These questions have been carefully considered by us and the conclusion we have arrived at is that no material error is discoverable in the charge or in the rulings on offers of evidence. It seems clear to us that the defendant has had an impartial trial in which all the rights and privileges consistent with the proper administration of justice have been accorded to him. We therefore dismiss all the assignments of error.</p>
