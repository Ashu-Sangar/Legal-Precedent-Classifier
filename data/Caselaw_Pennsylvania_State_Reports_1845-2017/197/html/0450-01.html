Brown. On March 10,1900, Mary Read executed and delivered to John Snyder &amp; Son an oil and gas lease for fifty-five acres of land, including the thirteen acres leased to Brown. On April 1, 1900, Mary Read executed to Brown a new lease for farm purposes of forty-four acres of land, including the thirteen acres described in the lease of April 1, 1896. When Brown accepted the last lease, he had full knowledge of the oil and gas lease to John Snyder and Son. In September, 1900, John Snyder &amp; Son entered upon the surface of the'thirteen acres for the purpose of operating for oil. Prior to this time oil had been struck in large quantities on adjoining land. Brown at first made no objection to the entry of Snyder &amp; Son, but subsequently had the plaintiffs twice arrested for unlawful trespass. Plaintiffs then filed this .bill, praying for an injunction to prevent the defendant from further suing out writs to arrest plaintiffs, and from further hindering plaintiffs in their mining operations.</p>
