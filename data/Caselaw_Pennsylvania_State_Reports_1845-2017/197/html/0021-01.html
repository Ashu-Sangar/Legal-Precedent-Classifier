A member secured a loan from the association, assigning her stock as security, and executing a bond and mortgage of real estate as additional security. The articles provided for the association being made whole on account of default made in payments, by the imposition of fines, and the only right to cancel stock and forfeit the benefit of payments made was “ when the fines upon any certificate of shares shall amount to fifty per cent of the amount paid on said certificate.” The borrowing member defaulted in payments after the sixty-fifth month, but the association did not cancel the stock, and the series proved successful and matured. The fines upon the borrowing member’s shares did not amount to fifty per cent of the amount paid on them. <em>Held, </em>that in an accounting between the association and a borrowing member, the latter was entitled to credit for profits on her stock, and that the association could only collect from her the amount required to mature her stock at its expiration, including the charges made against her for default, with interest.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b50-4" data-blocks='[["BL_50.5",50,[260,416,1185,1477]]]'>The plaintiff association is a foreign corporation, duly chartered under the laws of the state of New York, and authorized to do a regular building and loan association business under the laws of said state, its charter of incorporation and the articles of association adopted in pursuance thereof. On June 19, 1889, it filed with the secretary of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania a certificate in compliance with the act of assembly providing therefor, which authorized it to do business in this state. On May 24,1890, Lizzie C. Neeley, one of the defendants, made application to the plaintiff association for thirty shares of its capital stock, which were duly granted to her, as evidenced by certificate thereof, dated June 1, 1890. The stock was of the par value of $100 and was to mature in six years. To mature the stock and entitle her to demand and receive the par value, she was required to pay an admission fee of $60.00, being $2.00 on each share, and the following payments during the said period of six years, viz: (1) A quarterly instalment of $7.50, or twenty-five cents a share, as dues, which with the admission fee went into the expense fund for the purpose of defraying the expenses of conducting the business affairs of the association; (2) a monthly instalment of $30.00, being $1.00 on each share, and (3) in case of default in payment of the said quarterly or monthly instalments, when due, she had to pay a weekly fine of $1.50, being five cents a share, during the continuance of the default. And the second condition provides that whenever the fines imposed amount to fifty per cent of the amount deposited as monthly instalments, then the “certificate shall be canceled, and all deposits made thereon shall be forfeited to the association.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b50-5" data-blocks='[["BL_50.6",50,[258,1912,1183,454]]]'>The articles provide that members may withdraw their stock at any time after one year and receive back the monthly payments made of $1.00 on each share, with interest. If the withdrawal is within three years the rate of interest allowed is four per cent, and if after that period six per cent per annum. The withdrawing member thus gets back his stock payments with interest, loses his admission fee and quarterly dues paid, and gets no profits earned by the association with the moneys paid by himself and other members on stock and loans.</p>

The premium is a fixed one,—the same on all loans,—and is not adjusted by competitive bidding as provided for in many other building and loan associations. It is the benefit which the association claims the borrowing member will enjoy over other methods of borrowing money, and goes to make profits and accumulations for the benefit of all members. It is not interest, though paid by the borrower because of the loan, but is money paid in pursuance of the contract entered into by the shareholder for his benefit and from which he expects to reap a profit. The loan can be procured at any time when there is sufficient money in the treasury, and no matter when procured it runs during the life of the stock and is paid upon its maturity. The payments of monthly interest and premium keep down the interest on the loan, and the maturity of the stock pays the principal. Section 1, of article 4 provides “ In case any member shall fail to make any payment of principal or interest, premium or fine, or if any part of such principal, interest, premium or fine shall remain unpaid for three months after the same shall become due, the board of managers shall have the power to collect the same by action at law, or by foreclosure of the mortgage given to secure such payment, and the whole amount secured thereby shall be deemed due and payable, immediately.” And section 4 of the same article provides, <em>“ </em>Each certificate of shares shall be charged with any and all amounts that may be owing from the shareholder, or his or her assigns, to the association whether in dues, payments, instalments, fines, loans, interests or premiums, and at the time of paying said certificate, the association reserves a lien thereon to secure the payment of any such indebtedness, and the right to deduct and withhold the amount of any such account, or indebtedness in payment thereof.”</p>

Until the stock period expired the association had the right, upon three months’ default being made, to either collect the arrearages, or permit them to accumulate until cancelation of stock occurred from accumulation of fines. They had the option of collecting these arrearages either by an action at law and thus permit the stock and loan to continue, or by foreclosure of «mortgage which would result in cancelation of the stock.

It is in accordance with the contention of defendant and against that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s counsel claim to be entitled to recover the principal debt, $3,000, and in addition the instalments of interest, premium, dues and fines, from the time default was made up to the time suit was brought, less only the sixty-five monthly stock payments, and without any interest thereon or profits of any kind. Payments to the amount of $3,243.05 were made and yet the credits allowed in plaintiff’s statement only amount to $1,950, a difference of $1,293.05. The amount sued for is $1,380, and yet had $443.82 more been paid, the entire debt would have been extinguished. This shows a loss to Mrs. Neeley of $931.68, which plaintiff claims was the result of her default. To my mind to so adjust the claim would work a great hardship, which should not be permitted, if it can legally be avoided. To justify such an adjustment, specific authority for it must be pointed out in the law or contract between the parties. Plaintiff’s counsel, to sustain their contention, claim that as Mrs. Neeley did not elect to withdraw her stock, she is not entitled to the interest for average time on stock payments allowed to withdrawing members. This is correct. Further, that the balance due is to be adjusted on the basis provided for defaulting stockholders. But where is provision made therefor ? Plaintiff’s counsel, at argument, in answering this question, admitted it was not contained in the articles of association, but claimed it was provided for in the conditions of the bond. But, in my opinion, this is not correct. The condition of the bond is to pay $3,000 by maturing the stock, i. e., by making the payments provided for in the certificate of stock, to wit: stock payments (called in the bond “instalments of principal”), dues,interest, premiums and fines. The clause relied upon is that providing that on thirty days’ default being made in any of said payments “ the whole principal sum then remaining unpaid, together with the unpaid interest, dues, penalties, fines and assessments thereon, together with an attorney’s commission of five per cent on the <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>said principal sum, shall, at the option of said association, become due and payable forthwith.” This is cited to sustain the claim that the defaulting borrower is only entitled to credit for the stock or principal payments made; that nothing was paid on account of principal, except the monthly payments of $30.00.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b56-4" data-blocks='[["BL_56.5",56,[348,616,1025,43]]]'>But this position cannot be sustained for the reasons :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b56-5" data-blocks='[["BL_56.6",56,[299,668,1187,1167]]]'>1. The loan was not on the mortgage but on the stock, which was assigned to the association as security, and which under section 5 of article 4 would be liable for arrearages without any assignment. The bond and mortgage were only given as collateral security to ensure the stock and loan payments, as provided in the articles of association. The payments mentioned in the bond are identical with those provided for in the articles of association. The bond recites that the payments are to be made “ on said shares ” and “ pursuant to the articles of association” and they could have been collected on-the stock contract without regard to the mortgage. If so collected, the stock would thereby have been matured and the mortgage debt extinguished. On this point plaintiff’s counsel, in their law brief furnished the court, say: “ This was a loan of money by a New York party to a citizen of Pennsylvania and contracted by the defendant to be repaid to the plaintiff at its home office in the city of Rochester, in that state. The bond and mortgage, though connected'with it, are not the essential parts of the contract. The real contract is in the application for stock, the stock certificate, the application for the loan and the loan granted. The plaintiff might sue upon that, even in this court, and recover without resort to the bond or mortgage. They are but securities for the loan.”</p>

These fines were imposed, and these and all other stock and loan payments are charged to and claimed from defendants in this suit. With these charges made against Mrs. Neeley, it cannot be said she is profiting by her default. On the contrary, she is required to pay for. her default or will be through this foreclosure suit, and in doing so she makes it good.</p>

The agreement of the association is that the stock will <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>mature in six years, or by seventy-two payments. There is no provision that it shall be matured at the expiration of the period by a dividend to be declared by the directors and credited only to the shareholders not in default. The only provision for dividend is that provided in section 7 of article 2, which authorizes the directors to declare “extra dividends from any surplus that may accumulate from the net earnings more than sufficient to pay the shares at the fixed date of maturity.” There was no deficiency of profits, and the stock in class “ A,” to which Mrs. Neeley belonged, was duly matured. The funds are on hand to pay her, and plaintiff can only collect from her the amount required to mature her stock at its expiration, including the charges made against her for default, with interest. If the profits on Mrs. Neeley’s stock are not credited to her, where should they be credited ? Who will receive them ? The other members of her class will not likely do so, as it has matured and the evidence shows they are paid.</p>

When the case was reached for trial it was agreed by the parties to submit it-to the decision of the court under the act of April 22, 1874. It seems that Lizzie C. Neeley on May 24, 1890, applied to the plaintiff for thirty shares of its capital stock. The application for the stock was complied with and a certificate for it was granted to the applicant on June 1, 1890. The shares of the stock were of the par value of $100, and were to mature in six years. On <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>August 8,1890, Lizzie C. Neeley and J. R. Neeley, her husband, executed and delivered to the plaintiff their bond and mortgage in the sum of $6,000, conditioned for the payment of $3,000 as defined therein. The suit upon the mortgage was instituted by the plaintiff on November 17, 1896, for the recovery of an alleged balance of $1,449 from the defendants on their alleged default “ in the payment of the instalment on principal, interest, premium and quarterly dues for more than the space of three months, whereby the said balance became due and payable.” The plaintiff’s statement of the balance due from the defendant does not correspond with its statement of balance in its seventh exception, or in its fifth point. There is at best a seeming discrepancy between them to which no explanation is attached. Payments were made by the defendant to the amount of $3,243.05, while all the credit allowed her in the plaintiff’s statement of its claim was $1,950. The defendant at the time of her alleged default had made sixty-five monthly payments in accordance with the terms of the articles of the association and had she made seven more monthly payments in conformity with said terms they would have extinguished her liability to the plaintiff in the transaction between them.</p>
    <p id="b59-3" data-blocks='[["BL_59.5",59,[155,1436,1183,508]]]'>The learned judge of the court below upon a careful consideration of all the testimony in the case, of all the articles of association relating to the questions involved, of the terms of the bond and mortgage and of the rights and obligations of the contracting parties arrived at the conclusion that the balance due from the defendants to the plaintiff amounts to the sum of $470.74. His findings of fact and conclusions of law, together with the judgment entered, do not appear to have been successfully combatted by the plaintiff at any point. We therefore dismiss the assignments of error and affirm the judgment.</p>
