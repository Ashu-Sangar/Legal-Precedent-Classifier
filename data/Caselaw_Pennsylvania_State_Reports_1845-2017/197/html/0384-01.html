This train was moved about from place to place and its crew ate and slept upon it. On September 23, 1898, after the train had been moved on to the main track from a siding at Lilly Station, a freight train collided with it, and the plaintiff was severely injured. The evidence tended to show that the accident was caused either by the negligence of the flagman or the combined negligence of the flagman and the engineer of the freight train. The court entered a compulsory nonsuit on the ground that the accident was one of the risks of the plaintiff’s employment, which risks included the negligence of fellow workmen. The court subsequently refused to take off the nonsuit, filing the following opinion:</p>

      <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>Nothing has been adduced on the argument of the above motion that convinces us there was error in sustaining the motion for a compulsory nonsuit made at the time of the trial. There is nothing in the case to distinguish it from many others of the same kind in which an employee is injured by the negligence of a fellow employee, excepting that this case is free from doubt on the main question. The burden of proving that this injury resulted from the negligence of the defendant was on the plaintiff : Erie &amp; W. Va. R. R. Co. v.

If there was any proof of negligence on the part of any one in this case, it is so clear as to permit of no discussion that it was on the part of some one engaged in a common employment with him and, therefore, under all the decisions in this state and elsewhere, the employer cannot be held responsible. Whatever the law may be in other states, either under the decisions or statutes, the law of this state has been well settled and cannot be now questioned that where several persons are employed as workmen in the same general service, though in different parts or departments of it, or though one may be in an inferior position to the other, and one of them is injured by the carelessness of another, the employer is not responsible, unless he has employed unfit persons for his service: Ryan v.
