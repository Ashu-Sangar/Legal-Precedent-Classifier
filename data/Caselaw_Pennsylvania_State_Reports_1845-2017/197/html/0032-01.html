Prior to July 1, 1891, the earnings arising from joint business were divided on a twenty-mile block basis. The testimony in the case is to the effect that this division was inequitable to the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company and that the said company could not continue to exist under such an arrangement. On June 4, 1891, at a meeting between the representative freight agents of the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company, a memorandum was made of a proposed division of the earnings from freight traffic exchanged between the former company and the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company, on a fifty-mile block basis, which proposed division was subsequently declared by the general freight agent of the former company to be satisfactory, and it only went into effect on July 1, 1891. The same through rates were continued in force as previously, the only change being in the method of apportionment between the two companies. An arrangement by which “ arbitrarles ” were charged on business exchanged between the line of the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company and the line of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company also went into effect on the same date. These arbitrarles which were ostensibly “ figured on a basis of fifty miles for all points on the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway,” in reality constituted charges on the basis of blocks of 100 miles, and they were intended to give the average charges upon that block system. The division between the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company was mpon the same mileage block basis. Special arbitrarles for anthracite coal, etc., were also fixed. The above mentioned rates have continued in force ever since. On December 13, <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>1891, Thomas B. Kennedy, president of the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company, wrote to A. A. McLeod, president of the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad Company, complaining of various alleged infractions by the latter company of the provisions of the agreement of September 30, 1882. Their correspondence on the subject appeal's in evidence. After a careful consideration of all the facts in the case, we are satisfied that the court would not be justified in adjudging the twenty-mile block system to be a proper basis for apportionment of joint earnings, and further, that there is not anything in the bill taken in connection with the evidence which would warrant a decree of any kind in relation to a mileage basis.</p>

There are two proposed additions to the bill, and two corresponding prayers. The first addition and prayer relate to the apportionment of joint earnings between the plaintiffs and the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company on the basis of fifty-mile blocks, thereby doing away with “ arbitrarles,” whilst the second are for the purpose of obtaining a decree against said railway company for damages arising from various alleged violations of the agreement of September 30, 1882. Much of the matter which composes the first addition arose before the bill was filed, and is covered by the pleadings, evidence and decree. The declared and only purpose of this addition being to reopen the hearing as to “ arbitrarles” and the mileage basis, it cannot be allowed, for the reason that the original bill was proceeded with to final decree, and it was then determined that the “ arbitraries” complained of are not violative of the agreement of September 30, 1882.</p>

On the 15th of the same month the plaintiffs applied for leave to amend their bill by making the receivers of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company parties to the suit, and on May 9, 1893, the amendment as prayed for was allowed. On June 30, 1893, the defendants filed demurrers to the bill which were overruled on March 30, 1894, at which time the court directed the defendants to make answer to the bill within thirty days from that date. The answer was filed within the time prescribed, and on December 7, 1894, the plaintiffs joined issue on the matters alleged in it. The joinder was followed by evidence submitted by the litigants in support of their respective claims and by their requests for findings of fact and law. The evidence was closed on January 30, 1895, the case was argued on March 4, 1895, and the opinion of the court, together with the decree based thereon, was filed on June 26, 1895. The operation of the decree was suspended until July 27, 1895, to enable the litigants to file exceptions to it. The exceptions were filed within the time prescribed and the court upon a careful consideration dismissed them and directed the prothonotary to enter the decree of June 25, 1895 as its decree. All the parties to the suit appealed from the decree to this court where the questions involved in the bill and answer were duly considered and passed upon in a clear and comprehensive opinion by our Brother Dean. The result of the hearing had on the appeal was an affirmance of the decree entered by the court <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>below. The grounds of the affirmance are fully and fairly stated in the opinion as appears in <a href="/citations/?q=177%20Pa.%20555" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="177 Pa. 555">177 Pa. 555</a>-564. All matters material to the decision of the case appear in the opinion of the court below occupying twenty-nine pages extending from page 520 to page 549.</p>
    <p id="b68-5" data-blocks='[["BL_68.5",68,[275,640,1184,302]]]'>The above recital of the proceedings under the original bill is intended to direct attention to the matters included and considered in it. A reference to the opinion appearing in <a href="/pa/177/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="177 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="883781" data-case-paths="/pa/177/0519-01">177 Pa. 519</a>, discloses all matters embraced and passed upon in the original bill together with the findings of fact and conclusions of law approved on appeal.</p>
    <p id="b68-6" data-blocks='[["BL_68.6",68,[273,950,1184,355]]]'>On February 14, 1898, the plaintiffs moved for leave to file additions, by way of supplement, to their bill. The motion was made sixteen months after the opinion and decree of the appellate court was filed. In an opinion filed by the learned court, below on May 8, 1898, the motion for leave to file additions to the bill was refused, and from the refusal to grant the leave prayed for the plaintiffs appealed to this court.</p>
    <p id="b68-7" data-blocks='[["BL_68.7",68,[270,1313,1187,663]]]'>An examination of the proposed additions to the original bill and of the assignments based on excerpts from the opinion of the court below has satisfied us that no error was committed in the refusal of leave to file the additions by way of supplement to said bill. It is obvious that the additions proposed would, if allowed, have resulted in a review of matters included in the original bill, and that such a réview was under the circumstances plainly inadmissible. The cases cited by the plaintiffs do not, on inspection, sustain their contention. It may also be stated here that nothing appears in the opinion of this court in 177 Pa., hereinbefore referred to, which authorizes or sanctions it. The assignments of error are therefore overruled and the appeal is dismissed at the cost of the appellants.</p>
