The plaintiff was acquitted in the criminal court, and the costs imposed upon the prosecutor, which costs were not paid by him, but by some other party. The evidence showed that plaintiff was the treasurer of a corporation, and as such gave a check for goods furnished his company. He made no representations as to this check, and it was good at the time it was given, but was not deposited for collection until several days thereafter. In the mean time plaintiff’s company ordered other goods and gave a second check. Neither of the checks were paid. It appeared that the prosecutor in the criminal suit had consulted the attorney of his employers as to the prosecution. This attorney had previously recovered a judgment on behalf of his clients against the company which had given the checks. <em>Held, </em>that a verdict and judgment for plaintiff should be sustained.</p>

The charge was that he, by false representations, induced the defendant company to give further credit to the Home Supply Company. That case was returned to the court of quarter sessions and Mr. Reed was there tried on that charge, of obtaining this credit under false representations. He was acquitted and the costs of the prosecution in that case put upon Loosemore, who was the prosecutor on the record, and the one who made the information. Mr. Loosemore says that he never paid any costs or attorney’s fees. The record shows that he was sentenced to pay those costs. Somebody must have paid the costs, because, being in court at the time of his sentence, he would have been committed at once to jail if the costs were not paid.] [5]</p>

It is not necessary to prove express malice by positive and direct evidence. That is very difficult to prove in any case. Malice often is inferred from the circumstances of the case. Malice does not mean always spite, hate, ill-will; where there is an unlawful act or recklessness or carelessness, the law implies malice. Probable cause is such circumstances <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>as would induce a man of ordinary prudence to believe that the party has committed a criminal offense.</p>

It is the commonwealth that is always the prosecutor in every criminal case. It is to protect the commonwealth from wrong, or to punish a criminal where the public is interested and for the public good. The law rather favors a party making an information charging a crime, because it is to the interest of the public that every criminal shall be brought to justice; and, therefore, when a party makes an information charging another with a crime, and it turns out in the end that he was not guilty of that crime, it does not justify a suit against the man who made the information, if he acted in good faith and upon reasonable ground for believing that a crime had been committed, and that this party was guilty of that crime.</p>

We have not in evidence the original information or the -indictment in the court of quarter sessions. Somehow or another, it seems that those papers are lost. How they were lost does not appear here, but the clerk of the court of quarter sessions has testified that, after a diligent inquiry and investigation, he cannot find those papers. Therefore we have not before us the exact words of the indictment and of the information; but, from the evidence here, it seems that that information charged Reed with obtaining credit by a false representation. [What was the false representation? In all of these charges of obtaining goods under false representations there must be a lie, a falsehood, and that falsehood must have been known to be false by the party that made the representation, and it must have been for the very purpose of obtaining something, and have succeeded in obtaining that thing. Those are the essential elements to sustain a charge of obtaining goods under false pretenses.</p>

Now, the evidence here does not show that Mr. Reed made any representations whatever about that check. He did not give that check directly to the defendant firm. It was sent to one of the subagents, I believe, and by him, or some one, sent to the office.

Is there any evidence that Mr. Reed gave that check for any false purpose ? He gave the check, according to bis testimony, in the usual way of giving checks, and firmly believed, according to his testimony, that that check would be paid; and if it had been presented a day or two after it was drawn, according to the testimony of the cashier, it would have been paid, so that there was no falsehood or wrongful act on his part, according to the cashier’s testimony, in giving that check on June 16.] [6]</p>

We have a principle of law of this kind, that, where a man thinks of instituting a criminal prosecution, he may consult a reputable member of the bar, and if he states all the facts of the case, gives a full statement to the attorney, and the attorney advises him that it is a case for a criminal prosecution, and, in pursuance of that advice, he commences the prosecution, that is a protection to him, and that is a wise provision of the law. It prevents men, if they are prudent, running into prosecutions or making charges recklessly. They ought to go first and talk to an attorney, and take his advice, and then they must state fully all the material facts in the case. If a man does that, makes the information, and afterwards it turns out that the party is not guilty, the advice of the attorney is his protection. That is a well settled principle of law. But he must make a full statement of the case, and unless he gives a full, candid statement of all the facts, it is no protection whatever to him.</p>

He was simply the treasurer of this company; he did not obtain anything personally; it was no benefit to him for the Home Supply Company to get more meat, or to get further credit; he had no personal interest in it.] [8] What interest had Mr. Loosemore to make this information ? He was not interested in this bill that the defendants had against the Home Supply Company; he was merely an employee of that firm, I think, managing one of their establishments. He had no personal interest, therefore, in making that information. Now this bears on the other question, gentlemen, whether these defendants, the members of that firm, are responsible. If the information was made without probable cause, the question is then, whether the verdict, should be limited to Loosemore, or whether these other defendants are also to be held, and bearing on that is the fact that Loosemore had no personal interest whatever in the matter, and presumably he had no authority from the defendants to make that information, because, as the manager of a store, he would not be clothed with power to make an information binding the defendant firm. But how did he make that information, and under what circumstances ? According to the evidence Mr. Benham was the regular attorney of the.defendant firm—the collecting attorney for the firm—and he had gone to see Mr. Reed with Mr. Loosemore, to fay to collect this bill; had had a conversation with Mr. Reed before this prosecution was begun. Mr. Benham, as attorney of the defendant firm, had brought suit against the Home Supply Company and got judgment against that company for their bill. After that this information was made. For what purpose, and why made against Reed, and why should Loosemore make the information ? Neither Loosemore nor Reed had any personal pecuniary interest in this transaction. Now if Mr. Benham, as attorney for Nelson Morris &amp; Company, commenced a prosecution against Reed, and as their attorney advised Loosemore to make the information, and the defendant firm, knowing of the information being <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>made by the advice of their attorney, continued to prosecute that ease, and prosecuted it to trial in the court of quarter sessions, then Nelson Morris &amp; Company would become parties to the prosecution, and be liable as defendants in this suit.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b295-5" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[142,577,1180,1850]]]'>[As I have said, malice may be implied in many cases. There must be some proof, but not necessarily direct proof, of malice, because the two things—want of probable cause and malice—must combine to sustain a suit of this kind; but in many cases malice may be implied from the circumstances of the case. What was the object of this prosecution? Was it to collect this bill; to force Reed to pay this bill? If that was the object of it, it would be expressly malicious. No man has a right to begin a criminal prosecution for personal ends. It is only for the public good that a private prosecutor can make information, and where a party wants to collect a bill, or to force a party to pay a bill, and commences the criminal prosecution for the purpose of compelling the payment of that bill, without probable cause for a prosecution, it is a clear case of malice in law. There are perhaps too many informations made for false pretenses for the very purpose of compelling the payment of bills. This is a perversion of the law. The criminal law was never intended for the purpose of collecting debts, or compelling parties to pay debts. That is not the object of the criminal law. The object is to punish a man for doing wrong •—to protect the public—and if a party, in order to frighten a debtor into paying a bill, commences a criminal prosecution, where there is no probable cause for it, in the hope that the terror of a criminal prosecution will compel the party to pay, it is a manifest, clear perversion of the law, and would be evidence of direct malice. It is for you to say, under all the evidence in this case, gentlemen, why this prosecution was instituted.] [9] Reed was not responsible for that debt. He was simply the treasurer of that company, and not liable at all for that debt; but if he committed a wrong, he might be punished criminally for that wrong. Neither had Loosemore any particular interest in making this information. He was not affected by the alleged wrong of Reed. Was it done, the information made, and the prosecution carried on by Nelson Morris &amp; Company, through their agent, Mr. Benham ? If so, they are the real, substantial defendants in the case.</p>

It is noticeable at the outset of our examination of the testimony that no exceptions to it were taken by the defendants. This omission tends to show that they did not regard it as clearly inadmissible or inapplicable to the questions of fact to which it was directed. It may be said in this connection that a careful scrutiny and consideration of the testimony has satisfied us of its relevancy, and that the defendants exhibited good judgment in declining to take exceptions to it.</p>

Nothing appears in the charge as to other matters which can be justly designated as error. The same may be said of the answers to the points which were refused.</p>

The relation of Loosemore to Nelson Morris &amp; Company, the suit of the latter against the Home Supply Company for the recovery of the debt owing to it, the communications between Loosemore and the attorney of Nelson Morris &amp; Company together with Loosemore’s prosecution of Reed on a charge of false representation, were all matters for the consideration of a jury on the trial of the case at bar. Another matter pertinent to the questions of fact involved was the disposition of the suit against Reed in which the verdict was in his favor, and the costs of prosecution were put upon Loosemore, who admitted that he never paid any of the costs or attorney fees, and alleged that while the costs were paid he did not know who paid them.: As the debt sued for was the property of Nelson Morris &amp; Company, and Loosemore had no interest in it except such as an employee lias in the affairs of his employer, his prosecution of Reed in the court of quarter sessions, without suggestion or direction from his employers or their attorney, was an extraordinary proceeding, and especially so when it is conceded that the costs were paid by other parties.</p>
