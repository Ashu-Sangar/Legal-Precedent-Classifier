It is not at all certain that under the circumstances of this case it was the legal duty of the assignee to place any of the moneys of the estate at interest. But he has very commendably done so, and whatever interest he may realize in this way will of course belong to the creditors. Beyond this we think he is not liable. The testimony shows that he has been credited by the trust company with four per cent interest for one year on $4,800, less six per cent for thirty days on the sum of $1,734.23, thus making $183.33. He has also $2,700 yet on deposit on which he is to receive four per cent for one year, less six per cent for the portion of the year after the date of payment, if paid prior.

Against either a purchase money judgment or any lien having a waiver of the $300 exemption, the assignor could not have been properly allowed his exemption out of the purchase money of the lands, nor out of any rents as such.

The latter farm had been rented to Keen on the halves, by Mr. Slump, the assignor, on April 1, 1897, for two years. The assignment was made on December 28, 1897, and this farm was sold by the assignee on February 25, 1898, to Lewis Irwin. Mr. Keen having a lease on it which did not expire until April 1, 1899, the sale had to be made subject to this le^se, and it was so made. By the terms of this lease the landlord was to have half of the crops. The assignor had taken the landlord’s share of the wheat in the ground for 1898 under his $800 exemption, so that the assignee could not have realized this. As to the other crops grown on this place in 1898, Mr. Irwin, the purchaser, got the landlord’s half and the assignee realized nothing from it. It is claimed by the ex-ceptants that the assignee should have claimed and received the landlord’s half for this year, while the assignee contends that the landlord’s interest in Keen’s lease was sold with the farm, as it certainly seems to us would have been good business policy. There is some conflict in the recollection of several of the parties who attended the sale as to the precise nature of the understanding, but we think a consideration of the whole evidence on this point justifies the conclusion that the property was sold on the understanding that the landlord’s share of the 1898 crops should go to the purchaser. In this case the assignee would, of course, not be liable for them.</p>

The assignee left this farm, as well as the other real estate while unsold, largely under the oversight of Mr. Shimp, the assignor, as his representative. He made the settlements for the assignee with the tenant for the estate’s share of the crops, paid the taxes and expenses, and turned over the balance to the assignee. The wheat in the ground at the time of <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>the assignment went to the assignor under his exemption, and as this was the only wheat crop harvested during the assignee’s trust he had no wheat proceeds to return. From the other crops raised on this farm the landlord’s share realized by the assignee was $370.61. This is the only money shown to have been realized for crops by the assignee, and the testimony does not warrant the conclusion that he should or could have realized more. Out of this Mr. Shimp paid for him the taxes on all the real estate, and made other expenditures of which an itemized statement was furnished before the auditor, the whole expenditure aggregating $270.52, thus leaving a balance of $100.09, for which the assignee accounts. While this seems a large expenditure in proportion to the receipts and a comparatively small net return, we are unable to say that the expenditures were improperly made. The only ones about which we see that there might be question are payments for fertilizers, and a bill paid the assignor for work done in cleaning up a swamp on the large farm. The testimony, however, shows that it had been the custom for Mr. Shimp and the tenant, before the assignment, to use artificial fertilizers, and so far as shown the farming in this respect during the assignment followed the same methods as were usual on the farm before, nor does it appear that the amount or quality of the fertilizers used were different. The work done by Mr. Shimp in clearing up the swamp seems from the evidence to have been fairly and reasonably charged for and to have given a better appearance to the farm for the purposes of the sale, and presumably to have helped the sale.

His judgment was the first lien on the larger farm, and by renewal had also become a later lien on the other real estate. The interest on this judgment was in arrears at the time of the assignment, from April 1, 1896. On April 3, 1899, after he had received the purchase money for the larger farm, the assignee paid Dr. Ellmaker $5,309.43 on account of this judgment. It is contended by the exceptants that this lien was entitled to interest only up to March 21, 1898, the date of the confirmation nisi of the first sale by the assignee, and that the payment made is an overpayment.

As we have seen, it was the first lien on tract No. 1, the sale of which was not confirmed until November 2, 1898, and upon a marshaling of the assets of the estate for distribution it would have the first claim of the proceeds of that tract, which were $8,075.17, or more than enough to pay it in full, and would properly be payable out of that fund. Although it was also a lieu by revival on the lands sold at the earlier sale, there were prior liens against those lands which would have absorbed that fund. As a matter of fact, also, he was not paid until after the purchase money for the tract sold in October was paid, and hence may be said to have been actually paid out of that, as he should have been. Under these circumstances we think Dr. Ellmaker was entitled to receive the principal of his judgment with interest to November 2, 1898. This would have amounted to $5,082. He was paid $5,309.43 and hence has been overpaid $227.43. With this amount we surcharge the assignee.</p>

His widow, Mary E. Risk, as executrix, obtained an order of the orphans’ court for the sale of the remaining undivided one fourth. At the same time she and William Risk offered their several interests and the whole property was thus sold to Samuel Shimp. By a deed dated April 1,1882, Mary E. Risk, as executrix, Mary E.

The consideration was $6,901.20, of which one half was due her. She had agreed with Mr. Shimp prior to the sale to leave $3,000 in the property. At the settlement she received all over and above $3,000 in cash, but the evidence shows that she got nothing for the $3,000 except this judgment. It was directly from the vendee to her, the vendor of a half interest in the land, and the present holder derives his title from her. The evidence does not show the date when the title was actually passed and this judgment delivered to Mrs. Risk. From the fact that both the deed and this judgment are dated April 1, 1882, the inference might be made that it was on this day. If so a day intervened before the entry of the judgment on April 3. This day was, however, Sunday, and the parties live a long distance from the county seat, and a number of miles from the railroad. On the other hand the Vaughn mortgage was not executed until April 3, and was executed in Lancaster, so that Mr. Shimp was here on that day. His testimony is that lie gave Mrs. Risk her judgment, Mr. Vaughn’s check and the balance of the cash in settlement for the purchase money “ all at the same time. ” If this was on April 1, he must have had the Vaughn check two days before he gave the mortgage, which is unlikely.

And if the creditor has acquired no lien on the land or proceeds, he has no standing to prevent the assignor from claiming the exemption reserved in the deed of assignment.

In his report he says: “ The assignor claimed this exemption at the hands of the assignee, and selected, besides certain goods and chattels, one fourth acre of tobacco and the landlord’s half of certain wheat then growing on one of the farms assigned by him.” In another part of his report, he states that the “tobacco [was] then [at the time of the appraisement] harvested, but still remained on the premises unsold.” The auditor and counsel for the parties have disposed of this assignment of error by the discussion and solution of the question of whether the grain in the ground was severed before the sale of the land on which it was grown and thereby became personal property. The auditor holds that the appraisement and setting <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>apart of it to the assignor under his claim of exemption was a severance. We will dispose of the assignment by a consideration of the same question. The learned counsel for appellant virtually concedes that the auditor’s decision as to the tobacco was right under the authority of Jones’s App., <a href="/pa/102/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="102 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="502724" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0285-01">102 Pa. 285</a>, but he contends that under the same authority the auditor should have held that the wheat in the ground was not severed before the land was sold, and hence was not personal property. There is no exception to the finding of the fact above quoted, and, hence, we are not required to review it under the evidence submitted”to the auditor. According to that finding, the wheat reserved by the assignor was grown on one of the farms assigned. As the auditor has held that it was personal property, we will assume that it was grown on tract No. 1. If it may be successfully contended that the act of the assignee in having it appraised and set apart to the assignor was not a constructive severance of the grain, yet there was an actual severance and setting apart to the assignor of his share thereof in 1898 when.it was harvested in the summer of that year. This was prior to the sale of the land which occurred in the fall of 1898. In this view of the case the auditor’s conclusion is correct.</p>

The facts are fully found and reported by the auditor and need not be restated here. The auditor held that the holders of the mortgage had a right to insist upon the payment of the McMurdy (Risk) judgment of $8,000 so far as needed for their relief out of the fund produced by the sale of tract No. 1. With the exception of a small sum, this excludes the McMurdy judgment of $2,000 from participation in the fund for distribution. The reason assigned by the auditor for his position is that the McMurdy judgment having lost its lien on tract No. 1, the holder of the Andrews mortgage had the right, under the equitable doctrine of subrogation, to be substituted to the rights of the McMurdy (Risk) judgment against the fund raised by the sale of tract No. 1, and consequently to have his mortgage paid out of said fund in preference to the McMurdy judgment. The arguments of the auditor and of the learned counsel for the appellees in <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>support of the auditor’s decision are based upon the familiar doctrine that where a creditor has a lien on two funds of his debtor, and another creditor has a subsequent lien on only one of these funds, if the prior lien creditor resorts to the fund common to both liens and consumes it, he shall permit the subsequent lien creditor to use the broader security for the satisfaction of the restricted lien out of the funds which it cannot reach. Jt is contended by the appellees that this rule is applicable to the case in hand and controls it in favor of the mortgage creditor. The appellant does not deny the principle of subrogation asserted by the appellees, nor that it should be applied in a proper case, but he maintains that the auditor and the court below erred in holding that it was applicable to the facts of the case in hand. He contends that his equities are at least equal, if not superior to, those of the holders of the mortgage and that, therefore, he is entitled to the fund for distribution.</p>

In Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=38%20Pa.%20516" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="38 Pa. 516">38 Pa. 516</a>, Justice Strong, speaking for the court, says: “ This (subrogation) is an equity against the debtor himself, that the accidental resort of the paramount creditor to the fund doubly incumbered, shall not enable him to get back the other fund discharged of both debts.” In Ziegler v. Long, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20206" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="2 Watts 206">2 Watts, 206</a>, after asserting that the rule of subrogation is well settled, Justice Sergeant says: “ But this principle must be employed, like all other rules of equity, to the attainment of justice; it is not to be used to overthrow the equity of another person, and thus work injustice.” In Wallace’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20Pa.%20405" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="59 Pa. 405">59 Pa. 405</a>, it is said : “Subrogation is founded on principles of equity and benevolence, and though it may be decreed whore no contract or privity exists between the parties, it is not to be allowed except in a clear case, and where it works no injustice to the rights of others. The principle which governs in all cases of substitution is one of equity merely, and it is to be carried out in the exercise of a proper legal discretion, with a due regard to the rights of others; and it is not to be used to overthrow the equity of another; and thus work injustice.” Tn Budd v. Olver, <a href="/citations/?q=148%20Pa.%20197" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="148 Pa. 197">148 Pa. 197</a>, the court says : “Subrogation is a matter of grace, not of right, and is a creature of pure equity. It will never be de<a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>creed where it works injustice.” “The doctrine of subrogation,” says Justice Clank in Robeson’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=117%20Pa.%20638" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="117 Pa. 638">117 Pa. 638</a>, “is of purely equitable origin; its application is always controlled for the promotion of justice; it will never be enforced, therefore, to defeat a superior or even an equal equity in another.”</p>
    <p id="b178-5" data-blocks='[["BL_178.5",178,[267,622,1185,1078]]]'>Applying these well recognized principles of subrogation to the facts of the case in hand, we must determine the equities of the parties to this controversy. It will be conceded that if the McMurdy judgment had been revived and had still retained its lien at the time of distribution, it would have been paid out of the proceeds of the sale of tract No. 1, in preference to the McMurdy (Risk) judgment. This would have been so by reason of its legal, and not equitable, status. But having lost its lien and, hence, its right to participate in the distribution of the fund from tract No. 1 prior to the payment of the McMurdy (Risk) judgment, did this fact thereby create in the Andrews mortgage a superior equity entitling it to subrogation against tract No. 1? The mortgagee loaned his money to Shimp, took his mortgage and secured his lien on tracts Nos. 2 and 3 in 1882. On the day the mortgage was entered of record, the McMurdy (Risk) judgment was entered against Shimp which was the first lien on tracts Nos. 2 and 3 and the third lien on tract No. 1. At that time, the McMurdy judgment was the second lien against tract No 1, and a fund arising from a sale of it would have been applied to that judgment as against the McMurdy (Risk) judgment.</p>

From this state of the record and the fact that the mortgagee took a security for his debt that was restricted to tracts Nos. 2 and 3 and was a second lien thereon, it must be assumed that he did not anticipate the payment of his mortgage out of the proceeds of tract No. 1 by reason of an equity superior to that of the holder of the McMurdy judgment. At that time he had no lien on tract No. 1 oí the fund it might produce, and was not in a position to invoke the rule of subrogation against the McMurdy judgment. His rights against the debtor and his property were then clearly fixed, and he had no superior equity which would enable him to enforce his claim against tract No. 1, in preference to the McMurdy judgment. The mortgagee must <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>be regarded as having taken his mortgage subordinate not only to the prior lien but also to the superior equity of the appellant.</p>
    <p id="b179-4" data-blocks='[["BL_179.5",179,[177,464,1180,822]]]'>While conceding, as they must, this to be the status of the McMurdy judgment at the date of the entry of the mortgage, the appellees contend, and the auditor so held, that this condition of the rights of the parties had been changed by the failure of the appellant to revive his judgment, and that this act of omission on his part had so far inured to the benefit of the holders of the mortgage as to give them a superior equitable right to the fund from tract No. 1. In support of his position, the auditor argues, that as to the rights of the mortgage creditor the omission to revive the McMurdy judgment had the same effect as the payment of the judgment, and that the present rights of that judgment grow only out of the position it acquired at the date of the revival in 1889, and that the hardship which will follow the payment of the mortgage creditor out of tract No. 1 was created by the holder of the Mc-Murdy judgment himself.</p>
    <p id="b179-5" data-blocks='[["BL_179.6",179,[179,1294,1178,925]]]'>If this wore a question of lien only, the position of the auditor would be correct. The new or revived judgment of Mc-Murdy is effective as a lien on tract No. 1 only from March 22, 1889, the date of its revival. In this view, it would be the ordinary case of the holder of a paramount lien having two funds with which to satisfy his claim, and the holder of an inferior lion but one of two funds out of which to realize his claim. The rights of the junior lien incumbrancer to subrogation would be clear and would be enforced. But the creditor’s lien on more than one fund is not the only consideration that moves equity to interpose its powers and to enforce the right of subrogation. Before it interferes in behalf of the creditor, he must, as we have seen, show that his claim is one of benevolence, that its enforcement will work no injustice to another but will thereby attain the ends of justice, and that its equities are not only equal, but superior to, that of the contesting claimant. Subrogation never takes place to the prejudice of any other right: Graff &amp; Co.’s Estate, 1B9 Pa. 75.</p>
    <p id="b179-6" data-blocks='[["BL_179.7",179,[182,2226,1175,201]],["BL_180.1",180,[251,354,1185,1544]]]'>Viewed in the light of these principles, wherein does the mortgage claimant possess superior equities to the holder of the McMurdy judgment? As we have observed, he loaned his money and took his security with the knowledge of the <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>fact that the McMurdy judgment was a lien on tract No. 1, and that he could have no equitable claim through the Mc-Murdy (Risk) judgment against tract No. 1, superior to the appellant’s judgment. The records gave him notice of that fact. He was, therefore, not induced to part with his money or invest it upon the faith that this security would take precedence over the McMurdy judgment. On the contrary, he loaned his money to Shimp with the knowledge that all his rights to enforce repayment of it out of the proceeds of tract No. 1 were subordinate to those of the McMurdy judgment. What then was the effect of the holder of the McMurdy judgment permitting it to lose its lien on tract No. 1? It gave no precedence to the mortgage as a lien on the tract, nor are we able to see how it raised a superior equity in its behalf to the fund arising from tract No. 1. The failure to keep alive the lien of the McMurdy judgment did not injure the mortgage creditor, nor in any way prejudice his claim. It was a matter with which he had no concern and, having no lien on the tract bound thereby could not be advanced in the order of liens on the tract. If, however, he is permitted to take the fund for distribution by reason of the-McMurdy judgment having lost its lien, he will deprive the holder of that judgment of a fund to which the latter would otherwise be entitled. This would be the only effect produced by the neglect of McMurdy to revive his judgment and it would be most inequitable and unjust. The mortgage creditor never had a legal claim to the fund for distribution, and there is no reason in good conscience why equity should interpose in his behalf or award it to him to the prejudice of the rights of a claim which he, the mortgage creditor, must recognize as prior and superior to his own claim.</p>

In this view, the auditor overlooks the fact that the equity invoked in eases of subrogation is not against the creditor but the debtor. If the debtor had paid the McMurdy judgment, equity would, as against him, have subrogated the mortgage creditor and awarded him the fund, and thus have prevented the debtor from receiving the money while the mortgage debt remained unpaid. But in the present case, the refusal to subrogate the mortgage <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>creditor to tbe rights of the paramount creditor will not give the money to the debtor but to a creditor more meritorious than the mortgage creditor.</p>
    <p id="b181-5" data-blocks='[["BL_181.5",181,[122,519,1183,614]]]'>The auditor further asserts that the injustice that would be done McMurdy by the enforcement of his alleged lien will be occasioned by McMurdy himself by failing to revive his judgment. This assumes that McMurdy owed a duty to the mortgage creditor to keep his judgment alive. This would be true if the failure to do so did any injustice to the holder of the mortgage, but, as we have said, McMurdy’s action in not reviving his judgment in no way affected the mortgage or its lien. With equal or greater propriety it may be said that if the mortgage creditor desired to avail himself of tract No. 1 in payment of his claim, it was his duty to secure a lien on it instead of restricting his lien to tracts Nos. 2 and 3.</p>
