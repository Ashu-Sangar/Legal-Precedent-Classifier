Stull, one of the defendants, who was also one of the heirs of Jacob Stull, Jr., does not claim to have any deed from these six heirs; but he claims title by virtue of the statute of limitations, that is, he says that he has had possession of this land, a possession of such a character, for such a number <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>of years, that under the law he is still entitled to retain possession.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b272-5" data-blocks='[["BL_272.5",272,[311,474,1196,1748]]]'>Now, it is not necessary for me to explain to you what is meant by the statute of limitations. It has been in force in this country and in England, whence we got our laws, for many years; and it is a rule of law that is enforced for the purpose of quieting titles; and it means simply this, that while ordinarily a deed or grant is evidence of title to land in a party, where he has had open, notorious, exclusive, hostile and adverse possession of a piece of land for twenty-one years, the law presumes that he has a deed. Now, that is what is meant by the statute of limitations, that where a man has had possession of a piece of land of that character for that length of time, the law presumes that he has a deed; and if he produce proof of that kind, his title is just as good as though he produce a deed. And, as we have already said the reason of this is that titles may be secure. Ordinarily, then, that is the rule of law, that where a defendant in an action of ejectment produces testimony of that kind, he has made out the possession and the title; but where the controversy is between two heirs of a common ancestor, as in this case, the law requires something more of the one who relies on the statute of limitations. The law requires of him to prove, in addition to the facts I have mentioned, an ouster—that is the legal term used—and it simply means that he has put the other tenant out. Where a man dies seized of real estate and one of his heirs remains in possession of that real estate, the presumption is he is not only holding it for himself but for the other heirs; or where he is found afterwards in possession of that piece of real estate, the law presumes he is holding it for the other heirs; therefore, when he shows he has' had possession for twenty-one years, his title is not made out, because of that presumption; and he must go further and show that he has put the other heir out and kept him <em>out; </em>and if he shows that, then his title is just as good as it would be by proving the other facts as between himself and a stranger, because the law presumes he has a deed from that other heir.</p>

Stull had kept his coheirs off this land, that <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>would be sufficient. We have already said to you that the law will presume a deed after twenty-one years’ possession; and so the jury may prove an ouster by certain facts and circumstances. When a person does not produce a deed, but produces the facts and circumstances that I have mentioned to you, that is, that he has been in the open, notorious, hostile, adverse and continuous possession of the land for a period of twenty-one years, the law presumes that he has a deed. So where one heir has set up a title against the other heir, he does not have to prove the actual putting out of the other heir. If he can produce such facts as will warrant the jury in believing that the other heir has been put out and kept out, that is sufficient.</p>

Stull was adverse and hostile to the other heirs. [And there are many facts and circumstances in this case which, it is argued by the plaintiffs’ counsel, rebut the presumption that arises from the proof that they have given;] [5] and there are many facts that are argued by the defendants’ counsel corroborating their possession and showing that the possession was of the character required by law.</p>

The first thing the defendant must prove is that his possession was open and notorious, that is, that it was open and of such a character that it be<a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>came notorious in the neighborhood. He must show that it was hostile and adverse to these other heirs, that is, he must produce such a state of facts as to warrant you in saying that he was holding it against these other heirs, and it must be continuous, for a period of twenty-one years. And then there must be possession of the whole land, and the receipt of the profits of the land, such a course of conduct all through as would indicate that he was holding it against the other heirs.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b274-4" data-blocks='[["BL_274.5",274,[279,769,1184,662]]]'>Now, the defendant has offered in evidence here the proceedings in partition instituted in 1859, and he has asked us to say to you and he argues that that is proof that he was holding this land adversely to the other heirs, that otherwise it would have been included in the partition proceedings. You understand that where a man dies owning several tracts of land, or one large tract, one of the heirs may come and ask to have it divided among the heirs. Jacob R. Stull did this, and did not include in his petition this particular piece of land, and Mr. Ruppell argues that that is sufficient to convince you that Jacob R. Stull was, at that time, holding this piece of land adversely to the other heirs, that otherwise they would have said that piece of land must come in also.</p>

This is some evidence in the case for your consideration, along with the other evidence, and you will bear in mind that this petition was presented by Jacob R. Stull himself, and that it was by his act that it was left out of the partition. You will bear in mind that it was about the time when the proceedings in partition are shown to have commenced, in May, and bear in mind the arguments of counsel on both sides in relation to that item of testimony. It is one of the circumstances in the case which you may bring to bear in determining whether or not the holding by Jacob R. Stull was adverse to the other heirs. Was he holding it against their rights ? And so of the assessments and payment of taxes. I do not need to comment on that. You have heard the arguments of counsel on both sides, and it is one of the matters you can consider in determining this question.</p>

[But you must consider, in connection with that, all the other testimony in the case that will tend to rebut that presumption. It is a presumption, that is, you may presume from these facts, that the other heirs have been put out.

You will weigh the evidence and consider the arguments of counsel on both sides and determine whether or not he was holding it adversely to the other heirs. There must have been an intention on his part to hold it against the other heirs of Jacob Stull, Jr. We cannot say that this by itself, standing alone, should convince you that Jacob R. Stull’s possession was not adverse, because you have many other facts and circumstances in the case; and just like the proceedings in partition on the one side of the case, and just like the cutting and sale of timber and all those other matters, the fact of his having obtained deeds from four of the heirs is a strong circumstance in the case to aid you in determining the question as to whether he was holding this land during the time he held it, as against the heirs of Jacob Stull, Jr.] [7]</p>

The question was passed upon at a very early day by the Supreme Court of this state in Cluggage v. Swan, 4 Binney, 150, where the allegation was the same as in this case. The depositions were rejected, and we regard the ruling in that case as binding on us, not only because it has not been overruled or even questioned in any subsequent decision, but because of the careful consideration given the question by Justice Yeates and the soundness and convincing character of the reasoning employed by him.</p>

In this case there is no proof excepting that obtained through the instrumentality of the jurors. Obviously if the direct testimony of a juror as to what took place in the jury room is inadmissible, his declarations, as testified to by another witness, as to such matters, are inadmissible: Warren v.

Moreover, in our opinion, a relaxation of the rule not only involves the safety of parties to the suit, but the integrity and honesty of the jurors as well, subjecting them to the importunities and inquiries of interested parties after verdict, and involving them in controversies between themselves as to what actually occurred in the jury room, with a possible tendency to perjury. If the testimony of all the jurors is admissible to invalidate their verdict, then the testimony of one juror is; and if he be believed, that there was such misconduct as ought to invalidate it, then one juror can set aside the solemn act of the twelve and bring reproach upon the other eleven.

That they were heirs of Jacob Stull, Jr., who died seized of said land was admitted. The defendants claimed title to the land as heirs of Jacob R. Stull who was one of the heirs of Jacob Stull, Jr., and who the defendants allege acquired title to it by a continuous, exclusive, adverse and hostile possession of it for more than forty years. It may properly be stated here that four of the heirs of Jacob Stull, Jr., sold and conveyed their interest in the land to Jacob R. Stull, and that six of the heirs of Jacob Stull, Jr., never sold or surrendered their interest in it to him. The heirs who retained their interest in the land were not presumed to have lost it. They were tenants in common with Jacob R. Stull, and it devolved upon the defendants who claimed title under him to show such a possession and use of the land by their ancestor as operated as an ouster of his cotenants.</p>
