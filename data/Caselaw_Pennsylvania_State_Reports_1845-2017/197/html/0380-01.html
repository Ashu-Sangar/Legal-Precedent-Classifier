Another man called a “ scraper ” was employed at the same machine. It was the duty of the two men to place the machine in position to cut under the breast of coal to be taken out. The machines were placed in proper position by means of two jacks. It was the business of the scraper to secure the front jack and the runner to secure the rear jack. When the machine was in place the runner applied the current, and the scraper removed the loose coal cut by the knives. At the time of the accident the jacks became loose, because, as the plaintiff alleged, a sufficient hole had not been made in the roof to secure the rear jack firmly. Plaintiff stated that he was about to obtain a heavy pick to- make the hole larger when he was directed by the mine foreman to hold the machine in place with a bar. Plaintiff at first hesitated, but upon being told by the mine foreman that it would be right, <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>he took hold of the bar, when another workman turned on the current. As soon as the power was turned on the machine jumped and the knives cut off the plaintiff’s leg. The testimony showed that plaintiff was familiar with the machine, that he received proper instructions as to it, and at the time of the accident it was doubtful whether the superintendent was anywhere near.</p>

There is no evidence in the case that the superintendent participated in any manner in the direction or control of the work in which the plaintiff was engaged. Indeed it is at least doubtful whether the superintendent was present or in hearing when the order was given, or the injury to the plaintiff was received. If, therefore, there was any negligence which caused the accident, it was the negligence of the mine foreman, of the plaintiff, or of both. There is no evidence in the case on which negligence can be charged against the Patton Coal <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>Company or its superintendent. It follows that the defendant company is not chargeable for the injury the plaintiff received. We therefore affirm the judgment on the opinion and decree of the learned court below.</p>
