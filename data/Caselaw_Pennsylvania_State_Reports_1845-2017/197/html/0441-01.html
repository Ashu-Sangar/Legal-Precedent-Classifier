Carnagie, was injured on November 19, 1896, while in the employment of the defendant, in removing the false work of a bridge over the Ohio river. The false work consisted of braces or bents bolted together. The plaintiff had instructions in the work in which he had been engaged for several days, and there was no evidence that the appliances were not in proper condition, and such as were in common and general use in the business. The method of removing the bents was for a workman to go to the top of one bent and remove the bolts from the next adjoining bent. The particular bent which caused the accident had been loosened by plaintiff and a pulley rope had been attached to it. The bent was to be laid on the ground. The bent, however, stuck, when the boss of the gang ordered the plaintiff to push it off. This he was unable to do, and then the boss told him to sit down and put his feet against it. He did this and shoved it off. <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>Then, as many of the witnesses explained, it “ kicked up at tbe bottom ” and struck the bent upon which Carnagie was sitting and knocked it down, injuring him severely.</p>
