Referring to the third finding of the court, the master and examiner further finds that the well on the Stotler farm adjoining plaintiff’s property, and within 157 feet of his (plaintiff’s line) which was owned by the defendant and was commonly known as Stotler No. 2, continued to produce oil from the time it was completed in April or May, 1895, to May, 1897. No evidence was given as to the amount of its production from the time it was completed to July 1, 1895. From July 1,1895, to May, 1897, the total production was 22,182.62 barrels. The production and royalty paid to Stotler, who owned the land upon which it was located constantly diminished from 2,358.72 barrels in August, 1895, to 374.16 barrels in April, 1897.</p>

The failure of defendant to drill a well on the lower portion of plaintiff’s tract, near the creek, and his continued operation of other producing wells on tracts near to and adjoining the tract which he leased from plaintiff, thereby draining oil from plaintiff’s land, have rendered it impossible to ascertain the quantity of oil which might have been obtained from plaintiff’s land, if he had developed it in good faith and according to the obligation resting upon him.</p>

The plaintiff was to receive one eighth of the oil obtained from his land during the term of the lease. The defendant in February, 1895, commenced a well on the land of the plaintiff within fifteen or twenty feet of the southern line of his property. The well was completed in the spring of 1895, and produced about five gallons of oil per day. In March, 1895, the defendant commenced to drill a well on Stotler’s farm about 157- feet from the line of plaintiff’s property, which well was completed in May, 1895, and produced about 120 barrels of oil a day. From that time on the defendant made no effort to comply with the terms of his lease with the plaintiff, but directed his attention and best energies to the operation of the wells in close proximity to the plaintiff’s property. He refused to surrender the lease he had obtained from the plaintiff and persisted in his scheme for draining the oil from the land of his lessor. In the execution of this scheme he was successful, and when the drainage of the oil was accom<a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>plished lie abandoned the lease, and appeared to consider that his obligations to the lessor were canceled.</p>

This contention, however, is not supported by the decision referred to. The modifications of the decree appealed from in that case were slight and did not annul or in any manner abridge the appointment of the master and examiner whose duties were the same subsequent to the decision aforesaid as before the appeal on which it was based. It is plain enough that nothing appears in the decision of the court in Kleppner v. Lemon, <a href="/pa/176/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="176 Pa. 502" data-case-ids="882224" data-case-paths="/pa/176/0502-01">176 Pa. 502</a>, which in any degree qualifies or condemns the appointment of the master and examiner in the case at bar. It remains to inquire whether there was error in the conclusion arrived at by the master and approved by the court below. A careful examination and consideration of the findings of fact and conclusions of law embraced in the report has failed to convince us of error in either. We therefore dismiss the specifications of error.</p>
