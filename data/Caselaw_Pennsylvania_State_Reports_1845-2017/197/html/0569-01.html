On February 27, 1899, John L. Wentz and others incorporated the Lindsey Water Company to supply Clayville, a borough abutting against Punxsutawney. Prior to this time Wentz had bought from <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>the individual stockholders of the Punxsutawney Water Company a majority of the stock of that company. This stock he transferred to the Lindsey Water Company. On April 15, 1899, the Lindsey Water Company executed a mortgage, the description of the property in which covered the property of the Punxsutawney Water Company. On September 21,1899, after the institution of this proceeding, the Punxsutawney entered into an agreement with the Lindsey Water Company by which in consideration of $100 per month “ the Punxsutawney Water Company agrees to furnish the Lindsey Water Company with an ample supply of water for their customers until said company completes their lines, dam, reservoir, etc., and can supply their patrons with water from Clover Run. Conditioned, however, that in case at any time the wells or source of supply of the Punxsutawney Water Company might be diminished so as to injure the supply necessary for the use of said Punxsutawney Water Company and all of its patrons, contracts, etc., that the said Punxsutawney Water Company shall have the right to cancel this agreement, and cut off said water supply on twenty-four hours’ notice to the said Lindsey Water Company, or its agent or representative.”</p>

Wentz became the owner of a majority of the shares of capital stock of the defendant -company early in April, 1899, thereby obtaining control of the corporation and its corporate property and franchises, and it also appearing by the resolutions and minutes of the Lindsey Water Company, with which he was connected, that his purchase was in the interest of that company, and that the purchase money was provided for by it, and that thereupon a mortgage was executed by the Lindsey Water Company covering the property of the defendant company, of which the remaining stockholders who had not parted with their stock had notice, and that no objection or protest was made by said stockholders, and that the same persons who had been and were directors and officers of the defendant company became and were at the same time also directors and officers of the Lindsey Water Company; and that in pursuance with the agreement, <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>the taxes at tbe state department were, on the application of the defendant company’s treasurer, J. L. Wentz, adjusted and paid on the basis that on March 1, 1899, the stock of the defendant company had become the stock of the Lindsey Water Company, and that J. L. Wentz, the vendee of the stockholders of the defendant company, who was also treasurer of that company, together with the other persons who were directors of that company and also of the Lindsey Water Company, procured and enacted a resolution of the Lindsey Water Company by which a trustee was appointed, and thereupon a supplementary writing to the said mortgage, executed by E. J. Robinson, as president, and J. L. Wentz, as secretary of the Lindsey Water Company, by which all the stock acquired from the defendant company as aforesaid was impounded and subject to the indebtedness under the mortgage, and by special provision the dividends thereon to be applied to the indebtedness, and the method of voting the shares of stock aforesaid controlled in the interest entirely of the Lindsey Water Company and its mortgage indebtedness; these facts exhibit such a transaction and combination as violates the condition upon which the charter of the defendant company was granted, and the verdict must be for the complainant. <em>Answer: </em>We decline to instruct you as thus requested. The acts complained of did not affect the franchises or property of the respondent corporation, but merely resulted in the acquisition of stock from its shareholders. Whatever the intention of the promoter may have been originally, the consummation of the scheme resulted in the acquisition of stock alone, and, while stock is a representative of stock or its value, the transfer of stock is not a transfer of the property of a corporation.

If the jury believe from the testimony in the cause, including the option of February 2, 1899, and the transfer of the stock to Wentz as shown by said books of the defendant company, and the agency of said Wentz for the Lindsey Water Company, and the use made by the Lindsey Water Company, and the fact that the same persons were directors of both companies at the same time, and the stipulation in the supplementary mortgage as to the control of this stock with respect to the indebtedness under the mortgage, and the mode of voting the stock, and the application for adjustment of taxes at the <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>state department, and the adjustment and payment thereof; that the purpose of the transaction was to put the control of the defendant company and its property in the hands of the Lindsey Water Company, and that the stockholders not selling their stock with notice or knowledge of the purpose of Wentz to obtain control of the company, made no objection or protest thereto, then the defendant company has so acted as to incur the forfeiture of its charter rights, and the verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>This point is also refused. Had the effect of what was done resulted in interference with the rights of the borough of Punxsutawney or its citizens, and the jury would find the purpose of the transaction to be as stated, the point would be well taken, but the evidence fails to show any interference with these rights. The water sérvice to the borough and its inhabitants has not been interfered with. It, as much as ever, will possess the right at the expiration of twenty years to retake the plant. And, while another corporation owns a majority of the stock, and, as a consequence, controls the corporation, it owns neither its franchises nor its property. The interests of these water company stockholders, in common with the other holders of stock, are practically identical with those of the borough. [2]</p>

They did not purport or pretend to bind the corporation, and while the option contract for the sale of stock as signed, purported to include the property of the corporation, as well as the stock they held, that proposition was not accepted. The original intention, as appears by the testimony, was to purchase outright, and consolidate the Punxsutawney corporation with the Lindsey Water Company. It further appears by the testimony that that purpose was changed after the promoter took the advice of counsel, and discovered that it was either illegal or an imprudent thing to do, and instead, therefore, of acquiring the property and franchises of the respondent corporation, they acquired simply a majority of its stock, and, with a view of controlling the corporation, refusing to have anything to do with the matter unless they could purchase the controlling interest. Instead, therefore, of carrying <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>out the terms of the proposition contained in the stockholders’ optional contract, a new condition was imposed by the purchaser of the stock, to wit: a deduction from each share of its proportionate part of the debt of the corporation, and a transfer of the stock alone.] [8]</p>

Now, whether it had any right to do this, or the other acts complained of done and committed by it, is a matter between that corporation and its creditors on the one hand, and between it and the borough of Clayville and its citizens on the other; and whether its purchase of the Punxsutawney Water Company’s stock was legal or void is a matter between it and the other stockholders, and also the borough of Punxsutawney. But as it did not acquire title to the property and franchises of the Punxsutawney, it could not incumber them by a mortgage, and its purporting to do so did not require the Punxsutawney Company or its stockholders to move in the matter for the protection of their rights, and their failure to do so would not be such acquiescence as would work a ratification of such illegal act.] [5]</p>

What a majority of the stockholders did was to sell their stock, as was their right, and through the purchaser it passed into the control of the Lindsey Water Company; but the individual stockholders, as clearly appears ■from the testimony, sold to an individual, who purchased and paid for it with individual money, and, though such sales may have given to the Lindsey Water Company, subsequently acquiring the stock, a controlling interest in the Punxsutawney Water Company, the latter could not have prevented the sales, and, not having been a party to them, is not to be accountable for them, or for their effect. The Lindsey Water Company by acquiring <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>a majority of the capital stock of the Punxsutawney Water Company did not acquire the property and franchises of the latter. The transfer of a majority of the stock was not a transfer of the property of the company. The transfer was of the rights of the stockholders, and the existence of the corporation was in no manner affected by it. It is being continued, subject to the supervision of the commonwealth, with the right to go on in the exercise of its privileges and the performance of its duties until, by some act of its own, either of omission or commission, the penalty will be forfeiture. No misconduct of the Lindsey Water Company and nothing that one or more of a majority of the stockholders of the appellee may have done in disposing of their stock, can be charged to it. If it is to perish, it must be for its own sins and not for those of another.</p>
    <p id="b605-5" data-blocks='[["BL_605.5",605,[88,1074,1181,769]]]'>W e have no concern on this appeal with what the Lindsey Water Company is alleged to have done. Certainly nothing has been disclosed showing that the property of the appellee has passed to it. If it has undertaken to exercise control over the same, and to mortgage what it does not own, the appellee is not affected. All the rights of the latter, as they came from the commonwealth, are still secure and will be protected from invasion. Its duty, heretofore faithfully discharged to supply water to the territory and people named in its charter, still continues, and having maintained its distinct identity, existence and organization, the learned trial judge correctly told the jury that it could not be struck down upon the unsupported allegations of the complainant, no matter what the conduct of others may have been. All the assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
