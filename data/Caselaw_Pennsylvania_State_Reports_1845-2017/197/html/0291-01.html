He was making provision for safe investments for his widow’s benefit, and it is entirely improbable that he would direct the sale of his safest investment and the retention of one less secure.</p>

In it, however, there is no designation of the character of his interest in the company. Standing by themselves, these paragraphs are incomplete, and must, therefore, be read and construed together. And, as he refers to both “ income or divided profits,” in the fourth, and in the third to his interest as an investment, it seems reasonably clear that he intended to include these certificates of loan in the bequest of stock in the third paragraph, and, if so, it is safe to presume he also intended to include them in the bequest of the stock to his wife in the codicil.

Moffat, 18 Yesey, Jr., 390, as follows: ‘It is very clear that a person becoming entitled to an estate subject to a charge for his own benefit, may, if he chooses, at once take the estate and keep up the charge. Upon this subject a court of equity is not guided by the rules of law. It will sometimes hold a charge extinguished when it would subsist at law, and sometimes preserve it when at law it would be merged. The question is upon the intention, actual or presumed, of the person in whom the interests are united. In most instances it is, with reference to the party himself, of no sort of use to have a charge on his own estate, and when that is the case it will be held to sink unless something shall have been done by him to keep it on foot.’ ”</p>

    <p id="b325-5" data-blocks='[["BL_325.6",325,[112,768,1182,1337]]]'>In reaching the conclusion arrived at the learned court below had recourse to the third and fourth paragraphs of the will. It seems that in the third paragraph the testator provided as follows : “ I direct my executor to transfer to the trustee hereinafter named, all my stock in the Tide Water Pipe Line Company to be held by said trustee until the decease of my wife, and not converted into cash until her decease, as I have faith in the investment being secure and profitable.” In the fourth paragraph of the will the testator disposes of the residue of his estate as follows: “ As to the rest and residue of my estate real, personal and mixed (not hereinbefore specifically mentioned and bequeathed or devised), I direct my executor to convert them into cash as soon as the same can be done without unnecessary loss, and the money arising therefrom paid to my trustee in trust that it will hold the Tide Water Pipe Line Company, Limited, until the death of my wife, and pay to her all dividends or divided profits accruing thereon, and as to the remainder of my estate all that comes into my trustee’s hands I direct that the same shall bo by it invested in first bond and mortgages and hold the same so invested for and during the natural life of my beloved wife Sarah and pay to her at least semi-annually the entire income arising therefrom. After the decease of my Said wife I direct my trustee to pay out the principal as follows; and upon the conditions and for the purposes mentioned only.” Then follows the disposition of all the residue, one half being for charitable uses, and therefore ill given.</p>

It seems to us that the testator’s direction to his executor, in the third paragraph of the will, to transfer to his trustee all his stock in the Tide Water Pipe Line Company, Limited, to be held by the trustee and not converted into cash until the death of his wife, is, when considered in connection with the provisions of the fourth paragraph of the will, expressive of his determination that his interests in said company should be retained during the lifetime of his wife. These interests were known to him to be valuable and to constitute a desirable investment. It is not at all probable that he intended to direct the conversion of the important interest represented by the certificates of loan into cash as soon after his decease as was practicable. As the certificates of loan were quite as safe as the certificates of stock, if not more so, it is a fair inference, under the circumstances, that the former was included with the latter in the investment referred to in the third paragraph of the will. We therefore conclude that the learned court below did not err in holding that the certificates of loan and the certificates of stock constituted the investment in which the testator had confidence and passed under his bequest in the codicil to his widow.</p>
