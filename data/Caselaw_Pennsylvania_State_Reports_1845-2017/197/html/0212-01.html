The answer of the defendant to the charge is that no word or act of his at any time, caused or contributed to the alienation complained of, and that on discovering the husband’s purpose to abandon his wife he did all in his power to prevent the execution of it. The issue thus made required the jury to determine it upon the relevant and competent testimony in the case. If error appeared in the admission of irrelevant and incompetent testimony or in the rejection of evidence which was relevant and competent it was the province and duty of the court, on application of the injured party, to correct it.</p>

The first, third, fourth and fifth points submitted to the court by the defendant constitute the basis of the first, second, third and fourth assignments and amount to an assertion by him that there was no sufficient evidence to warrant the submission of the case to the jury. The defendant also alleges error in the affirmance by the court of the plaintiff’s second point “ as an abstract proposition of law.”</p>

It follows as a logical sequence that there was no error in the refusal of the court to affirm the defendant’s points as stated. As to the plaintiff’s second point which constitutes the basis of the fifth assignment it is sufficient to say that the answer to it harmonizes with the general charge relating to punitive damages.'1 It may also be said in this connection that the reduction of the verdict in the “ opinion and decree refusing a new trial ” evinced a purpose on the part of the court to limit the verdict to compensatory damages.</p>
