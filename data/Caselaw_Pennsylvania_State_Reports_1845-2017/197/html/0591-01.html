In 1872 Mr. Little opened an account in the bank and was one of its patrons from that time until it closed. He never had any conversations with either Mrs. Grayson or Mrs. Brown, and was never given any actual notice that the firm had been dissolved. He knew of the marriage of Margaret Hazlett to Dr. Wray Grayson, and knew that Mrs. Brown was a married woman, but did not learn of the death of Mrs. Yowell until lately, and never knew that Mrs. Hazlett was a member of the firm.

    <p class="summary" id="b624-7" data-blocks='[["BL_624.7",624,[302,1054,1185,819]]]'>“ Partnership is a contract of two or more persons to place their money, effects, labor and skill or some or all of them in lawful commerce or business and to divide the profits and bear the loss in certain proportions.” “ The two leading principles of the contract are a common interest in the stock of the company and a personal responsibility for the partnership engagements.” 3 Kent’s Commentaries, 24. If a firm makes a contract whereby it becomes indebted to a stranger to the partnership, the result is that not only the property of the firm, but the separate estate of each individual member of the firm can be taken to satisfy the firm creditor. Each individual member of a firm in a sense is- its surety, and assumes a personal responsibility for its engagements when he or she enters into the partnership contract. Hence, as stated in Story on Partnership, “ persons who enter into the partnership shall be of sound mind, sui juris and capable of making contracts.”</p>

Samuel Hazlett, the active member of the firm, that it is alleged he represented when he made the certificates sued upon, prior to the time the suit was instituted made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors and turned over all the assets of the bank, including its- entire capital stock, to his assignees. John H. Little, the creditor holding these certificates, believing that the assets of the bank would not pay him and the other creditors in full, brought this suit to enforce his claim against the individual members of the firm and to take in execution the property that belongs to them individually. It is not a suit <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>prosecuted for the purpose of taking in execution the property of the alleged partnership, that is already in the hands of the law; it is the separate estate of these two married women that he is after, and he can only succeed upon the assumption that their contract to be personally responsible for the engagements of the firm is valid and binding upon them.</p>

If, on January 1, 1876, it was agreed by and between the partners to continue the partnership and it was not by reason of that agreement terminated at that time, then the agreement thus entered into by Mary E.

Little, plaintiff, and against Samuel Hazlett, defendant, for the sum of $24,086.61. The facts ascertained by the court and included in its opinion are conceded by the appellant’s counsel to be substantially correct. No question of inaccuracy or insufficiency in the facts as found is raised, and on this branch of the case no special consideration is required. It therefore remains to determine whether the court below erred in entering and refusing to take off the compulsory nonsuit. A careful examination and consideration of the decisions relating to the question involved has satisfied us that the court below committed no error in refusing to set aside the compulsory nonsuit, and in determining that no cause of action was shown against Mary E. Brown and Margaret Gray-son. We therefore dismiss the assignment of error and base our affirmance of the judgment on the able opinion of the learned court below.</p>
