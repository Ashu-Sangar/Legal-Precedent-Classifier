What is a dedication? The most comprehensive definition of the law writers is that “ dedication is the giving of land, or an easement therein, for the use of the public by the owner.” And in the leading case of New Orleans v. The United States, 10 Peters, 662, it was said by the Supreme Court of the United States that “ it is not essential that the right of use should be vested in a corporate body. It may exist in the public, and have no other limitation than the wants of the community at large.” And this law of dedication applies to public squares and commons: Post v. Pearsall, <a href="/wend/22/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="22 Wend. 425" data-case-ids="2153297" data-case-paths="/wend/22/0425-01">22 Wend. 425</a>; Com. v.

And the dedication is to all the people, to the whole public, not of a county, but of the commonwealth. The doctrine of the law on this point is fully stated from the cases cited in 9 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 23, as follows: “ There can be no dedication to private uses, nor even to uses public in their nature, but the enjoyment of which is restricted to a limited part of the public.” See also Com. v. Alburger, <a href="/whart/1/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Whart. 469" data-case-ids="1829068" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0469-01">1 Whart. 469</a>, and Princeville v.

It was said by Judge Gibson in Com. v. Bowman, 3 Barr, 202, that “a county has no inherent right of property in a public square which has been dedicated not to its use only, but to the use of all the citizens of the commonwealth. Such a public square is as much a highway as if it were a street, and neither the county nor the public can block it up to the prejudice of the public or an individual.”</p>

And we therefore now proceed to a consideration of that branch of the case under our first general division of the subject.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b33-5" data-blocks='[["BL_33.5",33,[143,586,1183,1328]]]'>By an act of assembly of April 2,1856, the commissioners of Luzerne county were authorized to erect a new courthouse, and to locate it in or near the public square of the borough of Wilkes-Barre. See P. L. 1856, p. 225. Previous to this, by an act of May 5, 1855, the council of the borough of Wilkes-Barre had been authorized to issue bonds, not less than $10,000, and not more than $20,000, to be applied toward the payment of the cost of erecting a new courthouse. And this act contained a proviso that such new courthouse should be erected in the center of the public square. Under these acts the present courthouse was erected, and about one third of the total area of the public square was occupied. The right or title vested in the county by this legislation was in the nature of an easement. The legal definition of an easement is “a right which one proprietor has to some profit, benefit or beneficial use out of, in, or over the estate of another proprietor.” It is essential as a quality of an easement that there shall be two distinct tenements, the dominant to which the right belongs, and the servient upon which the obligation is imposed. It is a further essential of an easement that it be founded upon a grant by deed, or upon prescription which supposes one. It has been held, however, that a special statute may authorize the creation of a public easement. Among the incidents to easements based upon the decisions of some of our higher courts, we call attention to a few which seem to apply to the case now under consideration.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b33-6" data-blocks='[["BL_33.6",33,[144,1933,1181,509]],["BL_34.1",34,[275,372,1186,706]]]'>In Minneapolis Western Ry. Co. v. Minneapolis, etc., Ry.

It cannot be established by intendment or presumption.” In Race v. Ward, 82 English Common Law Rep. p. 713, Lord Campbell quotes, with approval, a decision by the House of Lords, in Dyce v. Lady James Hay, 1 McQueen’s Scotch App. Cases, 305, in which the Lord Chancellor said: “Neither by the Jaw of Scotland nor of England can there be a prescriptive right in the nature of a servitude, or <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>easement, so large as to preclude the ordinary uses of property by the owner of the lands affected.” In Jaqui v. Johnson, <a href="/nj-eq/27/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="27 N.J. Eq. 526" data-case-ids="536673" data-case-paths="/nj-eq/27/0526-01">27 N. J. Eq. 526</a>, the court of appeals of New Jersey, by Judge Knapp, said: “ It is the exclusive right of the owner of the servient tenement, suffering the burdens of an easement, localized and defined, to say whether or not the dominant owner shall be permitted to change the character or plan of the servitude.” In Jennison v. Walker, <a href="/mass/77/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="11 Gray 428" data-case-ids="2084793" data-case-paths="/mass/77/0428-01">11 Gray, 428</a>, it was held that “ where the right to an easement is granted, without giving definite location and description to it, the exercise of the easement in a particular course or manner, with the consent of both parties, renders it fixed and certain, and the dominant owner has no right afterwards to make changes affecting its location, extent or character.”</p>

Such a case, in our own state, was that of Baird v. Rice, <a href="/pa/63/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="63 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="1019026" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0489-01">63 Pa. 489</a>, involving the occupancy of Penn Square in Philadelphia, for new public buildings. When carefully analyzed, however, it will be found that the facts and the rules of law held applicable to them do not create a precedent for the present case. The dedication by William Penn was of a plot of land laid out specifically “ for buildings for public concerns,” and the court rested their conclusion in favor of the building on the ground that they were carrying out the express purpose of the dedication. The doctrine of this case was that, when not inconsistent with the purposes of the dedication, a state legislature may authorize the erection of county and municipal buildings upon land dedicated to a public square. Whether the legislature has the power to grant to a municipal corporation like a county, the right to take and occupy with a county courthouse the whole of a plot of land solemnly dedicated to the use of the people of the state as a public square, for purposes of health, amusement and recreation, may well be doubted, and the fact that no instance of the kind is recorded in any adjudicated case certainly tends to emphasize the doubt. The reasonable necessity which would justify the county of Luzerne in enlarging the courthouse facilities upon the present site should have reference not only to the wants of the county for <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>a courthouse, but also to the rights of the greater public for an open square. But it is not necessary in the present case to definitely fix the limit of legislative power in the direction referred to. For here there has been no legislation which contemplated or authorized the taking of the whole square, and its diversion to a new use and one different from that to which it was dedicated. If, as appears clear from the authorities already referred to, an easement cannot be established or enlarged by intendment or presumption, but must be clearly evidenced by the terms of the grant, what claim can the county have to more of the square than she has occupied and been content with for nearly fifty years ?</p>

The prayer of the bill was “ to restrain the county commissioners from using or occupying any part of the public square for the erection of a courthouse, and particularly any part not so occupied at the present time.” The exact nature of the title of the county to the square, and the necessary limitations upon that title imposed by the original dedication to the use of the public was not considered. The casual observation of Gibson, C. J., in Commonwealth v. Bowman, that it had been the custom in Pennsylvania “ to allow the county reasonable accommodations for its courthouse and offices ” upon the public squares of the county towns, was not intended to mean that the public squares could be entirely blotted out and closed up. A careful reading of the whole opinion, and of the question then under consideration, will show that any other construction of that case is imperfect, misleading and superficial.</p>

The address at the laying of the corner stone of the new building in 1856, was delivered by Hon. John N. Conyngham, then the president judge. He devoted considerable time to a description of the building, and calls particular attention to the fact it is to be fireproof, congratulating the people of the county upon the fact that now their public records are to be safely guarded and securely kept. What authority of law have the county commissioners for removing the records from such a building to others neither fireproof nor in any way fitted or intended for such use, but adapted either to the purposes of a public hall or an ordinary grocery or dry goods store? The only contingencies mentioned in the statute which will justify the commissioners in the removal of the records are when the courthouse shall be “unsafe, or shall have been destroyed, or under repairs.” Neither of these events has happened. The necessity for taking down the present court<a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>house does not exist. Another locality for the courthouse is available without expense to the county. Why should not the records remain where they are until a new and more commodious structure has been erected, and thus avoid the expense of renting other buildings and of two removals of the records themselves? But aside from any narrow or merely technical view of the subject, what is the true and the common sense aspect of the case which should govern the commissioners in the exercise of a sound discretion in reference to the public records?

The evidences of the title deeds to their homes; of the securities which vouchsafe their investments; of the last wills and testaments of their ancestors; of the liens which the mechanics hold upon the buildings which represent their labor; of the roads and highways which permit the movement of the people from place to place; of the naturalization which confers upon the foreigner the rights of American citizenship—all these and many other of the most valued rights of our people are guaranteed by the witness of these mute memorials, known as the records of the county.

Under these circumstances it seems clear that the courts should continue to be held and the records retained in the present building until the completion, upon another site, of the new structure. The discretion vested in the county commissioners is not without a limit. It must be a wise and sound discretion, and must be exercised not in defiance of public policy, but with a careful and scrupulous regard for it. If persuasion and reason fail, then stubborn resistance and inordinate self-confidence must be restrained by the strong arm of injunction.</p>

Thirty or more plans were submitted, by as many different architects, to the county commissioners in response to their notification that a courthouse was to be built. Two of the commissioners decided in favor of the Osterling plan. The third commissioner dissented from this decision, alleging that the Osterling plan was not the better one, and furthermore, that its approval was obtained by unfair, if not corrupt, methods resorted to by the architect and the two commissioners acting in collusion. In order to be more fully informed the judges referred the matter to a committee of the bar. This committee reported that while they personally preferred another one of the plans submitted, the Osterling plan would be their second' choice. And in reference to the charges of fraud and collusion, they found them not sustained by the evidence. The Osterling plan and the report were then submitted to the judges, who confirmed the report of the committee and approved the Osterling plan. It is now claimed by the defendants that this approval was a final adjudication, and that the court has not the jurisdiction to inquire further, as they are now asked to do in this proceeding, for an injunction. Speaking now for myself alone, and not for my learned colleagues, I do not believe that our approval of the Osterling plan can be construed to prevent the taxpayers of the county <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>from showing, if they can, that the plan contemplates a-building greater in size and more expensive in cost than is reasonably necessary, and, therefore, calling for the restraint of an injunction. The doctrine of res adjudicata does not apply to the case, because the parties plaintiff were not a party to the proceedings, and, as to them, there has been no judgment. Before a plea of res adjudicata can be sustained it must appear that there has been a trial at which the party appeared, or was bound to appear, that he was duly warned, had his day in court, and was defeated.

But aside from the strictly technical view of the question, we are of the opinion that the taxpayers should not be refused an opportunity to show that the plan adopted provides for a larger and more expensive structure than either the present or prospective necessities of the county justify or require. There is no imputation of corrupt motive or of official malfeasance on the part of the county commissioners, in this effort of the plaintiffs to restrain them from what is alleged to be an excessive outlay of the money of the people. And I do not believe that the commissioners, themselves, as the representatives of the people of the county, will insist upon the erection of a courthouse in exact accordance with the approved plan, if the testimony of competent and well informed witnesses shows conclusively that certain modifications of the plan are entirely possible without detriment to the main purpose, and are at the same time responsive to the dictates of an enlightened economy. And at this point we call attention to a rule adopted by the commissioners when the original advertisement for plans was made public. It is Rule 14 and reads as follows: “ The commissioners reserve the right to modify the plan which may be adopted in said com<a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>petition-, and to call for such additional drawings as the modifications may require.” And this brings us to the consideration of the evidence tending to show that the building proposed by the plan will be larger and more expensive than reasonably required.</p>

The custom of building courthouses upon the center square of our towns was not an unreasonable one in the primitive times when the need of public parks for recreation and rest had not been felt. But when the village has grown into the city, and the public square in the center of the town has become the focal point of business, it ceases to be the natural or proper place for the location of the courts. The people of the whole county, and not those of the city alone, are interested in having their legal business con<a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>ducted in an orderly, dignified and expeditious manner. There is no form of noise and interruption which does not culminate upon our public square. Several times during each year the sessions of the court are broken up by the blare of bands and the passage of parades. Street preachers and singers, organ grinders and vendors of patent medicines make it their favorite rallying point. The trolley cars come and go incessantly. Vagrants and idle people wander in its hallways, or float into the court rooms which are open to all comers. In fact the public square of a large and growing city is, in all respects, the wrong place for the courthouse of a great county like Luzerne. I have spent my entire life in this county, and a good part of it in its courts in the service of the people who have honored me with their confidence. I speak, therefore, not without experience, and certainly without any personal interest, when I declare my conviction, that to put a new and handsome courthouse upon the little plot of land which was dedicated to the public for their use and enjoyment as an open space, and to blot it out forever, would be a blunder without an excuse, and a wrong without a remedy.</p>

The title to spaces left open by the original plans of towns or by subsequent general dedication for similar purposes is in the commonwealth for the benefit of the <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>whole public, and the uniform course of decision has been that central squares in the laying out of towns were meant as much, perhaps primarily more, for public buildings than to secure space, and therefore the commonwealth may authorize their occupation in that manner without altering their original use.</p>

That was all around them in the neighboring wilderness, and what they sought was concentration for mutual protection and convenience. It was said by Justice Rogers in Rung v. Shoneberger, <a href="/watts/2/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="2 Watts 23" data-case-ids="1840039" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0023-01">2 Watts, 23</a>, that “in this state there are low ancient towns in which squares such as this do not form part of the plan. They are generally located at the intersection of the streets; and are intended as sites for the erection of buildings for the use of the public; such as courthouses, market houses, school houses and churches; sometimes they are designed as ornaments ; and at others they are intended for the promotion of the health of the inhabitants by admitting a free circulation of air.” See also Com. v. Bowman, <a href="/pa/3/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="3 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="400710" data-case-paths="/pa/3/0202-01">3 Pa. 202</a>, Com. v.

These cases are ample authority for holding that the occupation of a public square of the kind referred to by a public building is part of, or at least germane to, the use for which it was originally dedicated. We are, therefore, unable to agree with the learned court below that the proposed occupation of the square by a new courthouse is such an enlargement of an easement to the county of Luzerne as can only be authorized by a further specific grant from the commonwealth.</p>

L. 38, “ whenever the commissioners of any county are authorized and required to erect a courthouse, jail, or other county buildings, they shall submit the plans and specifications adopted by them to the judges of the court of common pleas of the proper county for their approval, and when it is obtained they shall let the work by contract .... which contract or contracts shall be made subject to the approval of the said judges.” By this act the control of the commissioners over the details of the execution of the projected improvement, theretofore without other limitation than the common-law remedies against abuse of discretion, was made subject to the supervision and approval of the court. The act names only the plans and specifications and the contracts as requiring submission, but these necessarily involve the size, arrangement, cost, location and other details as well, for no intelligent exercise of the power of approval is possible without .a .conside.ra.tiop of all these elements. The most desirable size <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>or arrangement may be rendered undesirable by its undue cost or by its want of adaptability to the most desirable location.

And the plan adopted by the commissioners has also been submitted to and approved by the court of common pleas but apparently not in the manner required by the act of 1895. The very important element of location, unfortunately the one most in controversy, was not included in the submission to the court. I find in the notes of testimony that when the proceedings in the court of common pleas, No. 698, May term, 1899, were offered in evidence in the present suit they were objected to by the appellee as irrelevant and immaterial, but were admitted by the court, “ the effect to be passed on later,” with the further remark of counsel for appellee that at the time of the approval of the plans the question of location was not before the court directly or inferential^. And it was said at the argument here, without challenge, that the court below had not approved the plan with reference to the location, and would not do so. Under these circumstances it is clear that the commissioners have not yet obtained the complete authority to proceed, required by the act of 1895.</p>

Even under the act of 1834 the discretion of the commissioners was within the supervision of the court so far as to prevent its abuse. If the judges should hereafter under the act of 1895 approve the plan, size, etc., with reference to a particular location, the question might afterwards arise whether the same judges sitting as a court in a case brought regularly before them, might reach a different decision. It was held in Comrs. of Northampton’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/57/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="57 Pa. 452" data-case-ids="1010450" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0452-01">57 Pa. 452</a>, that the court could not of its own motion withdraw its approval and enter a <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>new order suspending further proceedings. But that decision may be readily sustained on the general principle that a court cannot of its own motion reverse its judgment and enter a new one after the term. Interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium. But that is a different thing from reopening a decision or considering the subject-matter again on the motion of a party interested who has never had a day in court. The approval of a plan by the judges under the act of 1895 though done virtute officii is not strictly a judgment on lis mota between competent parties. It is beyond doubt that notwithstanding such approval the court would be bound to entertain a taxpayer’s bill to show that the proposed building would involve an increase of the municipal debt beyond its constitutional limit, and perhaps on other grounds. These questions we leave to be considered when they necessarily arise. For the present we merely hold that the injunction must be sustained for want of complete authority in the commissioners to proceed.</p>
    <p id="b48-5" data-blocks='[["BL_48.5",48,[261,1253,1186,874]]]'>It is greatly to be desired that an amicable agreement should be reached, which Avould terminate the controversy that blocks the accomplishment of what seems to be a conceded need. There is very great force in the remarks of the learned president judge of the court below that the noisy and bustling business center of the town is not intrinsically the best place for the courthouse, and in these days when the enlightened sentiment is everywhere growing that the serried ranks of buildings separated only by party walls and narrow streets should be broken by open spaces for light and health and enjoyment, it is strange indeed to find the most picturesquely beautiful city in the commonwealth tolerating the idea of closing up still further its central breathing spot. But these are matters which its own citizens must settle. They are far more interested than any outsiders, though the latter like other onlookers may sometimes see the points of the game more clearly than the players.</p>
