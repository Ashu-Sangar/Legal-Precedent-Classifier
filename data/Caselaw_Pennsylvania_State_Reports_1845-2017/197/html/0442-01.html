The question in such a ease is whether or not the defendant used ordinary care in the management of his business, and this is to be shown by the general customs of the trade, and not the particular practice of individuals.</p>

Plaintiff entered defendant’s employment on August 20, 1897; he was injured on August 30, 1897. The rivets used in fastening the iron plates together were heated at a furnace and were thrown from the furnace to the riveting gang. Before throwing the rivets the boy at the furnace always gave warning, and he had instructions not to throw rivets until notice was given to him to do so by the riveting gang. The space between the furnace and the riveting gangs was about 100 feet on the average. About ten o’clock in the evening on August 30, while plaintiff was engaged with the fitting up gang, a rivet thrown from the furnace struck him in the eye, inflicting frightful injuries. The usual signals and warnings had been given before the rivet was thrown, and it appeared that nothing intervened to obstruct the plaintiff’s view of the riveting gang or of the boy engaged in heating and throwing the rivets.</p>

But the negligence of this lad, if you find he was negligent, is not to be imputed to the defendants, if they notified him to do what he said they did notify him. The boy was instructed to give warning before he threw a rivet.

    <p id="b477-8" data-blocks='[["BL_477.11",477,[114,1139,1196,922]]]'>This is a suit by an employee against his employer to recover damages for an injury which he alleges he received through the negligence of the latter. The evidence in the case was submitted to the jury under instructions from the court which resulted in a verdict in favor of the defendant. On appeal to . this court it was claimed that there was error in the rulings referred to in the first and second assignments, in the answer to the defendant’s second point, and in the excerpts from the charge in the fourth to the eleventh assignments inclusive. We are not convinced of error in the rejection of the offers of evidence which constitute the subject of the first and second assignments, or in the affirmance of the defendant’s second point. In the eight excerpts from the charge nothing appears which can be construed as error. It is well to remember, however, that the excerpts are to be considered with the charge, and that the excerpts which ignore the parts of the charge immediately preceding and following them are not reliable without inspection of the charge in its entirety.</p>
