    <p id="b675-10" data-blocks='[["BL_675.15",675,[121,1617,1177,200]]]'>An injunction was granted and a decree was entered upon June 4, 1900, adjudging that the school directors of Parker township be perpetually restrained from collecting the eight mill building tax, purporting to be levied on July 22, 1897.</p>
    <p id="b675-11" data-blocks='[["BL_675.16",675,[121,1824,1179,249]]]'>The court below reached the conclusion that no regular tax had been levied by the school board for the year 1897, and that the minutes of the board of school directors of the township contained no record of a levy of a regular annual tax for the year 1897 for ordinary school purposes.</p>
    <p id="b675-12" data-blocks='[["BL_675.17",675,[122,2081,1178,253]]]'>The court also ruled that as the act of assembly required that the determination of the amount to be levied, and the levy itself, should be made by the school directors before July 1; a strict compliance with its requirements in this respect was necessary, and without it there could be no legal assessment of school tax.</p>

Where action is required to -be taken within a certain time, the mere failure of an officer or of a body to act within the set time is not fatal, and the requirement as to time may be held to be directory. This is in accordance with the ruling in Gearhart v. Dixon, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Pa.%20228" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="1 Pa. 228">1 Pa. 228</a>. In that case the school directors were required to levy the tax on or before the first Monday in May. This court said, in that connection, “ The act of assembly is directory as to the time, and if by accident or from any other cause, this duty was omitted, it could be performed in any reasonable time thereafter.” See also Com. v. Griest, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20Pa.%20416" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="196 Pa. 416">196 Pa. 416</a>, and cases therein cited.</p>

    <p id="b676-6" data-blocks='[["BL_676.6",676,[275,1305,1183,563]]]'>The real difficulty in this case is, that it does not appear that the regular tax was levied at all, for the pending year; and under the provisions of the 33d section of the act of assembly of May 8, 1854, the board of directors are prohibited from levying a special tax exceeding the amount of the regular annual tax for such year. The minutes of the proceedings of the board of school directors of the township show no levy or assessment for ordinary school purposes during the current year. In the language of the court below “no such levy was made on June 19, 1897, neither was it made on July 22, following or any other time.”</p>

But on July 22, an attempt was made to amend the minutes of June 19, so as to make the resolution read as follows: “ That we levy two mills in addition to our present millage, eight mills for ordinary school purposes, which shall be designated as the high. <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>school building and ground tax,” etc. We think the court below was right in holding that this is not a minute of a levy of a regular annual tax for such year, but is only a reference indicating that such action may have been taken at some other time and place; but nowhere in the minutes is there anything to show that such levy was actually made for the year 1897.</p>
