On May 12, 1899, the respondent presented a petition to have the proceedings suspended, averring that he had ceased the use of intoxicating liquors. Upon consideration of the testimony taken upon this application, the court on May 16, 1899, found that the respondent had “abandoned the use of intoxicating liquors and become habitually sober, and that he is now in a sound state of mind and competent to transact business and manage, control and care for his property;” and thereupon ordered “that the commission issued in this case, and the inquisition taken thereon, and the appointment of the committee and all proceedings relating thereto, be and they are hereby suspended until the further order of the court, and from this time, and until such further order, the said petitioner shall have and exercise all the powers, authority, control, rights and privileges that he would be entitled to have and exercise if the inquisition and proceedings hereby suspended had not been had.”</p>

It is quite clear, however, that this view of the case is not warranted by the amendatory act of June 15, 1897, the examination of which plainly shows that the reinstatements complained of were authorized by it. The suspension evidenced by the decree of May 15, 1899, was not an abandonment of the proceedings instituted on the 20th of March, 1899. It was intended and regarded as a test of the permanence of the reformation claimed by the appellant subject to the further order of the court. It was clearly within the power of the court to direct that the proceedings be suspended, superseded or determined as in the exercise of a sound discretion it was authorized to do. The reservation of the right to reinstate the suspended proceedings appears in the decree to which reference herein has already been made, and in the amendatory act on which the appellant’s counsel base their claim. No demand for a jury trial has been made by the appellant or his counsel, and neither of them has at any time denied that the alleged reformation on which the proceedings were suspended was sunk in the habitual intoxication of the appellant soon after his resumption of the habit which resulted in his first confinement. Upon a careful examination of the case we fail to discover in it any cause for setting aside the reinstatement of the proceedings complained of.</p>
