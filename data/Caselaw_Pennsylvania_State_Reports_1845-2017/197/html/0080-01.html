Upon the presentation of the bill a preliminary injunction was granted, and the cause came on for hearing on motion to continue said injunction. The bill alleges that the plaintiff, David Bly, is the owner of a gristmill located on White Deer creek, in Union county; that the mill has been located there for about seventy-five years. With the mill he owns some twelve acres of land, including a dam and water power furnished by said creek. The present <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>dam was constructed and the capacity of the gristmill enlarged about eighteen years ago. The plaintiff is a lower riparian owner and is entitled to the flow of water in White Deer creek for the purposes of his mill, practically unlimited, except for domestic use by upper riparian owners, unless the defendant companies have the right to appropriate a portion of the stream under their charters.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b110-5" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[274,721,1186,196]]]'>The water power furnished by said creek is ample to run the plaintiff’s mill about eight or nine months during the year; the other three or four months the water power is supplemented by the use of steam power.</p>

By petition to the court they have limited the amount of water they propose to take to two millions of gallons per day. They have purchased their mains and are digging trenches in which to lay them. The main pipe at the reservoir is sixteen inches in diameter. The defendant water companies contemplate furnishing a supply of water to the public in the borough of Lewisburg, to the borough of Watsontown and the borough of Milton. The borough of Lewisburg is in Union county, and is adjacent to Kelly township in said county and was originally a part of said township. The boroughs of Watsontown and Milton are in Northumberland county. The line between Northumberland and Union counties is the west bank of the Susquehanna river. Watson-<a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>town gets its present supply of water from said White Deer creek taken from a point below the plaintiff’s mill. Lewisburg gets its present supply of water from the Susquehanna river. The defendant companies endeavored to agree with the plaintiff, before proceeding to build their dam to take a portion of the water of White Deer creek and entering upon his lands, for the damages he may sustain. But no agreement was effected. They tendered him a bond in the sum of 85,500, which he declined to accept. The plaintiff then filed his bill and obtained a preliminary injunction restraining the defendants from proceeding with the laying of their pipes and appropriating a portion of the water of said stream, and thereby injuring his water power and mill property. The defendants filed the bond in court and presented a petition, limiting the amount of water they proposed to take to two millions of gallons per day, and obtained a rule upon plaintiff to show cause why he should not accept the bond. Whether the notice prescribed by the act of assembly in such case made and provided was given the plaintiff of the presentation of the bond for approval by the court and filing the same therein did not appear at the hearing. That the taking of the water proposed by said defendants from said creek will materially impair the plaintiff’s water power is quite clear from the facts as they appeared. The foregoing are the material facts as they appear from the bill and answer and the evidence taken upon the hearing.</p>

The question raised involves'the question as to what are the manifest restrictions of the charter rights of the defendants as to the supplying of the public with water’. If the charter rights of the company are so clearly restricted as to prohibit their exercising the right of eminent domain conferred by the charter, then the plaintiff may perhaps have some right to contest the <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>act of the defendants, under the provisions of the Act of June 19, 1871, P.

But when we get beyond this we assume something with which we have no business in a collateral proceeding; we assume to assert the rights of a third party, the commonwealth, who may or may not, at her own option, insist upon the observance of those rights.”</p>

Higbee, trading as the Higbee Construction Company, is the con<a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>tractor for the other said defendants, or one of them; that the defendants, or some of them, have threatened to dig ditches across the plaintiff’s mill race and property, and have already entered thereon for that purpose, to his irreparable injury and damage; that neither the said White Deer Mountain Water Company, nor the White Deer Creek Water Supply Company has any power, authority or right to supply water to the public outside of the said townships of White Deer and Kelly, in said Union county; that neither of the defendants has tendered or secured compensation to the plaintiff for the injuries thus done and threatened to be done to his private property. The bill further avers that said dam and reservoir will take the waters of White Deer creek at a point above the plaintiff’s property and above his dam and mill race, whereby his water power will be destroyed and irreparable injury will be done to him and his property. The bill contains additional averments but those recited raise the questions for decision and they are substantially admitted as averred, except that the defendants deny that their action will cause the plaintiff irreparable injury and that defendants have no authority to supply water outside of the townships of White Deer and Kelly. The bill prays, inter alia, for an injunction to restrain the defendants from taking the waters of White Deer creek for the purpose of supplying the same to the public in any municipality, borough or township other than the townships of White Deer and Kelly in Union county; and also to restrain them from entering upon the plaintiff’s premises and digging ditches and laying pipes therein until compensation therefor has been secured him. A preliminary injunction was awarded against the defendants.</p>
    <p id="b118-5" data-blocks='[["BL_118.5",118,[271,1867,1184,562]],["BL_119.1",119,[203,397,1180,459]]]'>At the hearing it was developed that the White Deer Mountain Water Company intended to supply the water to be taken from White Deer creek to the inhabitants of Watsontown, Northumberland county, separated from White Deer township, Union county, by the Susquehanna river, and also to supply the same in the borough of Lewisburg, in Union county, adjacent to Kelly township, but not adjacent to White Deer township, the former township lying between the latter township and Lewisburg. The present supply of water is obtained by the defendant companies from White Deer creek below plaintiff’s premises. It further appears that the day after the writ in this <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>case issued, tbe White Deer Mountain Water Company tendered a bond to the plaintiff which was refused, and that the day thereafter, the bond, with a petition for its approval, was filed in court. Tlie bond was not approved by the court until November 17, 1899, on which day an additional bond from the same company to the plaintiff was also approved. No bond to the plaintiff was tendered or filed for approval by the White Deer Creek Water Supply Company <em>or </em>by the Higbee Construction Company, the other two defendants.</p>
    <p id="b119-5" data-blocks='[["BL_119.5",119,[201,863,1183,1542]]]'>From this statement of the facts, it is apparent that when this bill was filed, on October 26, 1899, neither of the defendant companies had the right to appropriate the waters of White Deer creek at the point they were constructing their dam, and they were not justified in entering upon plaintiff’s premises to dig their ditches and to lay their water mains. Upon the filing of his bill, therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction, to he continued until the defendants satisfied the court that they legally had the right to appropriate the waters of White Deer creek and to enter upon his premises to lay their pipes. From the record it appears that on November 15,1899, the court below entered a decree that, upon the filing of an additional bond and the approval thereof by tbe court, the preliminary injunction should be dissolved as to all the defendants and that the plaintiff’s bill should be dismissed. This action of the court was clearly erroneous, at least as to the White Deer Creek Water Supply Company and its employees. It had not tendered or secured compensation to the plaintiff for its intended appropriation of his property and, therefore, should have been restrained by a permanent injunction. So far as tbe White Deer Creek Water Supply Company is concerned tbe bill must be reinstated and tbe injunction made permanent. The only questions, therefore, for consideration here are (1) the right of the White Deer Mountain Water Company to appropriate the waters of White Deer creek for the purpose of supplying the same to the public in any municipality, borough or township other than White Deer township, in Union county, and (2) the right of the plaintiff to have that question determined by a court of equity in a proceeding under the provisions of the act of June 19, 1871.</p>

The charter must be supported by this legislation or it falls. The certificate of incorporation as well as the letters patent issued to a corporation by the governor must conform to, and comply with the statutory requisites. There can be no authority or power conferred upon a corporation by the certificate or letters patent, except such as are clearly given by, or necessarily implied, from the language of the statute under which they are granted. Equally true is it that the rights and privileges of a corporation must be written in the charter or they do not exist. When a corporate body asserts its right to do a thing or to deprive an individual of his property, even for an adequate compensation, it must be able to show that the right is conferred by the plain and unequivocal language of its charter. The language of Chief Justice Black in Commonwealth v. Erie, etc., Railroad Company, <a href="/citations/?q=27%20Pa.%20351" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="27 Pa. 351">27 Pa. 351</a>, may be appropriately quoted in this connection: “ That which a company is authorized to do by its act of incorporation,” says the chief justice, “ it may do; beyond that all its acts are illegal. And the power must be given in plain words or by necessary implication. All powers not given in this direct and unmistakable manner are withheld. ... If you assert that a corporation has certain privileges, show us the words of the legislature conferring them. Failing in this, you must give up your claim, for nothing else can possibly avail you. A doubtful charter does not exist; because whatever is doubtful, is decisively certain against the corporation.”</p>
    <p id="b120-5" data-blocks='[["BL_120.5",120,[262,1824,1183,610]],["BL_121.1",121,[163,356,1182,1442]]]'>Under the act of 1874, corporations are divided into two classes: the first class, or those not for profit, the second class, or those for profit. The defendant is a corporation of the second class. The ninth paragraph of the 2d section of the act authorized the incorporation of companies for “ the supply of water to the public.” The eighteenth paragraph of the same section provides for the formation of companies for, inter alia, “the storage and transportation of water, with the right to take rivulets and land, and erect reservoirs for holding water.” The second clause of tire 34th section of the act provides that “ where such company shall be incorporated for the supply of water, they shall have power to provide, erect and maintain all <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>works and machinery necessary or proper lor raising and introducing into the town, borough, city or district where they may be located, a sufficient supply of pure water,” and for that purpose they were authorized, inter alia, to occupy, ditch and lay pipes through streets, etc., “ subject to such regulations in regard to streets, roads, lanes and other highways as is provided in the foregoing section for gas companies.” The 41st section of the act provides the manner in which damages for property taken by the water company shall be determined when the parties cannot agree upon the compensation for the damage done. The 3d section of the act provides the mode of incorporation and requires the charter to set forth, inter alia, “ the purposes for which it is formed,” and “ the place or places where its business is to be transacted.” A supplement to the act of 1874 was approved May 16, 1889, and it amended the ninth paragraph of the 2d section of the act so as to authorize the incorporation of companies for “ the supply of water to the public,” or “ the supply, storage or transportation of water and water power for commercial and manufacturing purposes.” Clause two of the 34th section of the act of 1874 was also amended by the act of 1889, so as to provide, inter alia, that such companies “shall have power to provide, erect and maintain all works and machinery or power for raising and introducing into the town, borough, city or district where they may be located, a sufficient supply of pure water, with water and water power as aforesaid.” The act of 1889 did not extend or change the territorial limits in which water companies were authorized to supply water under the act of 1874.</p>

L. 1860. If not so limited by the charter, then the plaintiff has no standing in this proceeding to contest the charter rights of the defendants.” In his argument to sustain the position that the defendant has the right to supply water to the public outside of White Deer township, the learned judge quotes, as applicable to water companies, that part of section 34 of the act of April 29, 1874, by which a gas company is authorized to supply gas light to the district where it is located, “and such persons, partnerships and corporations residing therein, or adjacent thereto as may desire the same.” He also cites the Act of July 2, 1895, P. L. 432, in support of his position. He further holds that the <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>plaintiff “ has no standing to raise the question in this case, and the provisions of the act of 1871 do not apply.”</p>

    <p id="b123-6" data-blocks='[["BL_123.6",123,[134,769,1183,875]]]'>Section 84 of the act of 1874 defines and limits the powers to be granted to water and gas companies. But it is done in two separate clauses of the section, and the rights and privileges conferred upon each must be ascertained from the clause in which they are granted. The first clause is devoted to gas companies and companies organized to supply heat and light to the public, and therein is granted to such companies the authority to supply with gas light, the borough town, city or district where they may be located, “ and such persons, partnerships and corporations residing therein, or adjacent thereto, as may desire the same.” The powers of a water company are conferred by the second clause, but the phrase just quoted or no similar expression appears in the clause. The inclusion of the phrase in the case of gas companies justifies the inference that its omission in the case of water companies was intentional. Hence it must be presumed that the legislature did not intend to confer such authority on water companies.</p>

But this was not the extent of the legislative enactment. The act went further and defined the powers of such companies so explicitly that they need and should not be misapprehended. The act provides that water companies incorporated under its provisions shall have the power to supply water in “ the town, borough, city or district where they may be located.” This language clearly and expressly limits the authority of a water company to the municipal or quasi-municipal division in which it is located. It can exercise its corporate functions in only a single territorial division, and that division is where it “may be located.” Such is the plainly written command of the statute, and it will permit of no other reasonable construction. The word “ district,” used in the act, having no qualifying adjective <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>to indicate its extent or meaning, is not to be construed as extending tbe territorial limits in which the corporation may supply water beyond those given it by the prior words used in that connection. It may embrace a township or a part of one of the political divisions mentioned immediately preceding it, but not two or more of them.</p>
    <p id="b124-5" data-blocks='[["BL_124.5",124,[275,657,1192,1336]]]'>That the right of eminent domain is conferred on water companies does not, as argued, enlarge the territory in which they may supply water, or show a legislative intention to grant them additional territory in which to exercise their corporate rights. It, in no way, affects or determines the territorial limitations of such companies. That right must be exercised for the purpose of enabling the company to supply water to the public within its charter limits. For the purpose of supplying water beyond those limits, the authority thus granted cannot be invoked to assist water companies in the appropriation of water to the injury of riparian rights. Nor is the defendant’s position strengthened by the fact that under the 2d section of the act of 1889 a water company has the right to appropriate water for its use outside the limits of the place where it is located. On the contrary it is a significant fact that tends strongly to support the opposite theory. That the right thus acquired needed express legislation to grant it affords a strong and convincing reason for withhplding the authority to furnish water outside the limits of the place where the company is located when it is not conferred by direct and positive terms in the statute. The same may be said of the provision in the second clause of the 34th section of the act of 1874 making streets, etc., subject to the regulations provided in the first clause of the section for gas companies. It shows a legislative intention not to extend the rights and. powers of gas companies to water companies, except where it is expressly so stated.</p>

The opinions of that department have been cited and they seem to sustain the contention of both litigants. There is one logical conclusion to be drawn from this conflict of opinion and that is that the language of the act under which the charters are granted does not plainly <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>and unequivocally confer the right on such corporations to supply water outside the place where they are located. This doubt of the right of the corporation to exercise such authority is of itself sufficient to warrant the denial of the right. “ In the construction of a charter,” says Chief Justice Black in Pennsylvania Railroad Company v. Canal Commissioners, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Pa.%2022" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="21 Pa. 22">21 Pa. 22</a>, “ to be in doubt is to be <em>resolved; </em>and every resolution which springs from doubt is against the corporation. This is the rule sustained by all the courts in this country and in England. No other has ever received the sanction of any authority to which we owe much deference. This court has asserted it times without number. ... If the usefulness of the company would be increased by extending them, let the legislature see to it. But let it be remembered that nothing but plain English words will do it.”</p>

It empowers corporations incorporated for “the supply, storage and transportation of water and water power for commercial and manufacturing purposes; ” to determine the character, design and construction of the works and the use to be made of the water and water power of such companies in order that the same may be supplied to the public to the best advantage; to locate, maintain and operate their works, machinery, dams, etc., under the act of 1874 and its supplements ; to contract for the construction and maintenance of their works, and to mortgage their property to secure the indebtedness incurred in the construction of their works, or as a guaranty for the performance of their contracts. It will be observed that this act does not define the territorial limits within which such companies may exercise their powers, nor in any way refer to the subject. Even, therefore, if it applied to water companies, instead of supply companies only, it would not affect the issue in this controversy.</p>

That right, as we have seen, was not given by the act. Has such authority been conferred by subsequent legis<a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>lation ? Our attention has not been called to any supplemental legislation that enlarges or extends the limits within which a water company may supply water beyond those fixed by the act of 1874. We have already referred to the act of 1889, and it is seen that it does not confer authority on water companies to supply water in territory adjacent to the place where they are located. Neither does the act of 1895 authorize water companies to exercise such rights.</p>

No other or greater powers can be conferred by the certificate than those authorized by the statute. It necessarily follows, therefore, that including in the defendant’s certificate of incorporation the language just quoted therefrom does not confer upon the corporation the power to supply water in adjacent territory.</p>

The White Deer Moun tain Water Company, the defendant, therefore, has no authority, under its charter, to supply water to the public in any municipality, borough or township other than White Deer township, in Union county, and, in carrying out the authorized purposes of its incorporation, the company is confined to the limits of that township.</p>

The right to condemn water depends upon the purpose for which the company may lawfully use it. It cannot take, by its right of eminent domain, the plaintiff’s property for a purpose for which, under its charter, it has no right to use it. The act of 1889 confers power upon the company to appropriate so much of the water of a stream within or without the place it is located, “ as may be necessary for its purposes.” But it does not grant the company the power under its right of eminent domain to condemn water for the purpose of supplying it to the public beyond the territorial limits to which its charter confines it.</p>

The private rights of the plaintiff in the waters of White Deer creek have been threatened, and if the water is taken by the defendant company he will be injured. The only authority claimed by the defendant to sustain its action in appropriating the water of the stream to its use is the franchise granted in its charter.
