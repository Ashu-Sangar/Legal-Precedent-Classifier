Expert testimony indicated that the fire had been burning for at least two hours before it was discovered at about 11:30 p.m., and that it was intentionally set and fueled by an accelerant. There was also evidence that the Appellant had sold some of the kitchen cabinets from the <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>house and had increased the insurance coverage on the house prior to the fire.</p>

As they were travelling on a road behind the property, the Appellant got out of the car and ran into the woods in the direction of the house, disappearing from her view.

At the outset, although 42 Pa.C.S. § 5914 was enacted in 1976 and made effective in June of 1978 as part of the Judicial Code, it is substantially a reenactment of legislation dating back to 1887, which itself had roots in the common law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At the time this precept was first incorporated into the Commonwealth’s statutory law, the rules of construction held that statutes in derogation of the common law were to be strictly construed.

Another rule of statutory construction, 1 Pa. C.S. § 1962, indicates that “[w]henever a statute is repealed and its provisions are at the same time reenacted in the same or substantially the same terms by the repealing statute, the earlier statute shall be construed as continuing in active operation.” Thus the rule of strict construction continues to apply, despite the fact that Section 5914 was enacted in 1976.</p>

And in analogy to this rule, it is held, that the wife, after the death of the husband, is competent to prove facts, coming to her knowledge from other sources not by means of her situation as wife, notwithstanding they relate to the transactions of her husband. The prohibition, where she is a competent witness, being divested of all interest, extends to confidential communications alone, <em>or such as come to her knowledge from her domestic relation.</em>

North Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/65/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="65 Pa. Super. 195" data-case-ids="625377" data-case-paths="/pa-super/65/0195-01">65 Pa.Super. 195</a> (1916), the court allowed the testimony of the former wife of the plaintiff, called as a witness by the defendant in a civil action, regarding facts which <em>could </em>have come to the knowledge of someone other than the witness. The court stated, “we are unable to see that the knowledge possessed by Mrs. Stewart as to the contents of the cellar of the house in which she lived was in any sense a confidential matter or that it was acquired in her relation to her husband as a wife____It was knowledge of a physical fact, not communicated by the husband or having any relation to or association with their relation as husband and wife.” Subsequent cases citing <em>F.A.

Nevertheless, we must conclude that, considered as a type of information distinct from “confidential communications” it can have no place in the current formulation of the common law privilege. Indeed, this must have been the case beginning with the passage of the Act of May 23, 1887, which, with respect to marriages continuing in existence, limited the prohibition to “confidential communica<a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>tions.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> It would be quite anomalous to hold that the prohibition is broader following dissolution of a marriage’ than it is where the marriage continues.

The Appellant’s argument begins with a standard dictionary definition of “communicate” as “to impart knowledge of; make known.” According to the Appellant, his acts imparted knowledge and information to his wife, therefore they constituted communications. He further asserts that he acted in reliance on the confidence that the marital relationship inspired. This latter assertion is followed by reference to the public policy behind the privilege, i.e., “the preservation of marital harmony and the resultant benefits to society.” Finally, the Appellant identifies decisions from a number of other jurisdictions holding that the marital communications privilege precluded testimony by one spouse regarding acts performed by the other in reliance on the confidentiality of the husband-wife relationship.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> He argues that the reasoning offered by the courts in <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>support of these decisions is persuasive and should be applied in the interpretation of Pennsylvania law.</p>

One person observing the actions or conduct of another may be said to acquire information from what he observes, but it is only if the actor intends to convey a meaning or message that communication is involved. The Commonwealth cites to authorities advancing the view that actions come within the privilege only when the acting spouse intends to convey a meaning to the observing spouse,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and argues that several of the cases cited by the Appellant are in fact consistent with this analysis.

Consequently, although they may be of some interest, they do not provide direct authority for discerning the contours of a common law rule. Second, as also observed in <em>Menefee, </em>“[njumerous conflicting decisions of other states and the divergent views of eminent textwriters evidence the fact that there exists a marked division of authority upon the subject.” <a href="/citations/?q=55%20S.E.2d%209" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="55 S.E.2d 9">55 S.E.2d at 13</a>.

Given that we do not find these terms to be identical, we cannot disregard the different terminology used in Section 9760 and Section 3731 as the Superior Court did in <em>Shartle. </em>As a matter of policy, the legislature has chosen to give credit “against the maximum term and any minimum term ... .for which a prison sentence is imposed .... for time spent <em>in custody </em>prior to trial, during trial, pending sentence and pending resolution of an appeal.” (Emphasis added).

The dissent addresses an issue that was never raised or argued by the Commonwealth, namely, whether the County Intermediate Punishment Act, 61 P.S. 1101-1114, which specifies the types of alternative sentencing options available to sentencing courts, is dispositive of what constitutes custody for purposes of Section 9760 of the Sentencing Act. Specifically, the dissent notes that Appellant "never had a right to, nor even a legitimate expectation of, a sentence consisting in whole or in part of home confinement/electronic monitoring for arson." Dissenting Opinion at 506. The dissent arrives at this conclusion by noting that Appellant was ineligible as a matter of law to receive a sentence of home confinement/electronic monitoring for his arson convictions as he was not eligible for a sentence of intermediate punishment, i.e., home confinement. Thus, the dissent would hold that because Appellant was not entitled to receive an ultimate sentence of home confinement pursuant to the Sentencing Code and the County Intermediate Punishment Act, he is precluded from receiving credit for time spent in such program as such program cannot be equated with custody for purposes of Section 9760.</p>

In that case appellant Conahan "never had a right to, nor even a legitimate expectation of, a sentence consisting in whole or in part" of inpatient treatment. As Justice Cappy notes in footnote 1 of the opinion, the Legislature had only recently amended the County Intermediate Punishment Act so as to permit sentencing courts the option of imposing intermediate punishment of this nature. <em>Conahan, </em><a href="/pa/527/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="527 Pa. 199" data-case-ids="1827677" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0199-01">589 A.2d at </a>1110 n. 1.

      <p id="b637-12" data-blocks='[["BL_637.2",637,[245,1927,1118,341]]]'>Also problematic is the fact that according to the dissent, as discussed in footnote 12, one could never receive credit for time spent in a home confinement/electronic monitoring program as a condition of bail.

After his second trial resulted in a guilty verdict, Appellant continued to be subject to electronic monitoring until his sentence was imposed. At that point, Appellant had been in the electronic monitoring program for a total of 518 days. In light of these circumstances, I believe that Appellant should, on the basis of equity, receive credit for the 518 days he spent in the electronic monitoring program.</p>

The version of Rule 4003 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure in effect in 1993, the time relevant here, is entitled “Release of Defendant on Defendant’s Own Recognizance or on Nominal Bail.” The rule thus speaks in terms of release. By no stretch of the imagination can release be consonant with either custody or imprisonment. Then-Rule 4013 also referred to bail as a form of release and, furthermore, recognized that release on bail could be subject to various conditions, as it stated that a person admitted to bail was obliged to, <em>inter alia, </em>“[cjomply with any <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>specific requirement of release which may be reasonably imposed by the issuing authority or court....” The 1996 amendments to the bail rules corroborate this understanding of the nature of bail. Indeed, this Court specifically recognized in those rules that home confinement is an appropriate nonmonetary condition of release on bail under Rule 4006. Notably, the Comment to Rule 4006 contains a listing of examples of appropriate conditions of release on bail, including “restricting the defendant to his or her residence or a supervised halfway house____”</p>

The fact that home confinement or electronic monitoring is required as a condition of bail does not alter the fundamental meaning of bail release. It is, of course, true that the condition acts as a restriction upon the defendant’s freedom; but so, too, do myriad other potential conditions of bail, such as a bond, a reporting requirement, surrendering one’s passport, a stay-away order, drug testing, etc. Such conditions are routinely welcomed, and even requested, as a desirable tradeoff to avoid placement in an institutionalized setting. To equate such restrictions of release with “custody” for purposes of computing a sentence of incarceration ignores the very nature of bail. Because appellant was released on bail, and therefore was not in custody, I would hold that he is ineligible for credit for time spent in the home confinement/electronic monitoring program. The majority disputes this analysis <em>(see </em>Op. at 501 n. 12) simply by ignoring the fact that restrictions of one sort or another, whether monetary or non-monetary, are nearly always imposed on individuals who are released on bail. The fact that the particular restriction involved in this case confines the individual to his home does not alter the fundamental fact that the individual is released on bail and, therefore, not in custody.</p>

Release on any form of bail necessarily restricts one’s liberty. But release to a home confinement program does not even begin to approach the sort of restrictions that necessarily attend an institutionalized setting. A defendant in a home confinement program is free to move about in his home, eat, watch television, sleep in his own bed, socialize with family and friends and otherwise enjoy the <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>comforts of his home at will.

Under the Sentencing Code, trial courts generally have a variety of discretionary sentencing options, including guilt without further penalty, probation (with various possible restrictions), intermediate punishment, partial confinement, and total confinement. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9721(a). Bail release to home confinement obviously has something in common with less restrictive sentencing alternatives such as intermediate punishment— albeit there is no rehabilitative or punishment component present in bail release where the concerns have to do with ensuring the defendant’s appearance and the safety of the public — but it has nothing in common with a sentence of total confinement. The trial court here determined that appellant’s conviction of arson endangering persons, a felony of the first degree punishable by up to twenty years’ imprisonment, 18 Pa.C.S. § 1103(1), required a sentence of total confinement in state prison for a minimum period of five years.

Bishop, </em><a href="/pa/183/0602-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="183 Pa. 602" data-case-ids="896135" data-case-paths="/pa/183/0602-01">183 Pa. 602</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.%2038" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="39 A. 38">39 A. 38</a> (1898), I find that it more closely follows the rules of statutory construction. The alternative (that is, <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>interpreting the principle of strict construction as the majority has done) results, in the post-marital context, in the statute being disregarded concerning the very subject which the legislature presumably intended it to control.</p>
    <p id="b647-4" data-blocks='[["BL_647.4",647,[215,556,1155,513]]]'>Thus, I would approach the issue before us as a straightforward question of statutory interpretation: Does the term “communications” as used in Section 5914 encompass conduct as well as verbal communications? Applying the principle that the words of a statute are to be construed according to their common and approved usage, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a), I would conclude that it does not. Accordingly, I agree with the majority that the trial court did not err in permitting Appellant’s ex-wife to testify about Appellant’s actions on the night of the fire.</p>
    <p id="b647-5" data-blocks='[["BL_647.5",647,[212,1102,1157,1001]]]'>Concerning the question of credit for time served, I must respectfully dissent from the analysis set forth by Mr. Justice Zappala. For the reasons articulated by Mr. Justice Castille in his Concurring and Dissenting Opinion, which I join, I do not believe the legislature intended that a defendant who has been sentenced to a period of total confinement in a state correctional institution should receive credit against such sentence for time spent in a home confinement/electronic monitoring program pursuant to the terms of a bail order prior to trial and/or pending appeal. As this Court observed in <em>Commonwealth v. Kriston, </em><a href="/pa/527/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="527 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1827737" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0090-01">527 Pa. 90</a>, <a href="/pa/527/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="527 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1827737" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0090-01">588 A.2d 898</a> (1991), “[n]umerous provisions of the Sentencing Code ... demonstrate a legislative intent that sentences of imprisonment are to be served in institutional settings.” <em><a href="/pa/527/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="527 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1827737" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0090-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/527/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="527 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1827737" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0090-01">at 94</a>, <a href="/pa/527/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="527 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1827737" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0090-01">588 A.2d at 900</a>. A similar understanding prevails in the federal system. <em>See Reno v. Koray, </em><a href="/us/515/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="515 U.S. 50" data-case-ids="1564550" data-case-paths="/us/515/0050-01">515 U.S. 50</a>, <a href="/us/515/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="515 U.S. 50" data-case-ids="1564550" data-case-paths="/us/515/0050-01">115 S.Ct. 2021</a>, <a href="/us/515/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="515 U.S. 50" data-case-ids="1564550" data-case-paths="/us/515/0050-01">132 L.Ed.2d 46</a> (1995) (concluding that a federal prisoner is not entitled to credit against his sentence for the period when he was released on bail).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_5_1" id="ref_footnote_5_1">1</a>

Like Mr. Justice Nigro, I would not foreclose the possibility that, in a particular case, circumstances may warrant the recognition of credit for time served to avoid a manifest injustice to the defendant. <em>See generally Kriston, </em><a href="/pa/527/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="527 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1827737" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0090-01">527 Pa. at 97-98</a>, <a href="/pa/527/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="527 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1827737" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0090-01">588 A.2d at 901</a> (awarding credit for the portion of the defendant's sentence served in an electronic home monitoring program to which the defendant had been transferred at the <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>unauthorized initiative of the prison warden). In my view, however, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that this is such a case. As the sole source of his mistaken belief that credit would be given for time spent on bail release, Appellant cites the Lackawanna County Home Detention Program Rules and Regulations, a copy of which is included in the reproduced but not the original record. Provision of this document to a defendant released on bail may have been erroneous; references to contact with the Probation and Parole Office and to payment of fines or restitution suggest that these rules and regulations were designed for inmates who are serving a form of intermediate punishment. Nevertheless, the document makes no reference to receiving credit for time served in the program, and I am not persuaded that this document, without more, would have warranted a justifiable expectation that such credit would be given or, more fundamentally, would establish a manifest injustice.</p>
