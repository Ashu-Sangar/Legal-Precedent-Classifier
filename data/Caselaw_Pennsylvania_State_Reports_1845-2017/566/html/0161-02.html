O’Rourke’s petition for review under Pennsylvania’s Whistleblower Law. The primary question presented is whether adverse personnel action taken against an employee of a public body as a direct result of his filing of a good-faith report of wrongdoing or waste violates the Whistleblower Law, although the employer did not harbor a retaliatory motive.</p>
    <p id="b274-10" data-blocks='[["BL_274.9",274,[272,1328,1164,579]]]'>Appellant, William O’Rourke (“O’Rourke”), has been employed by Appellee, The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (the “Department”), since the 1980s, performing various tasks related to the preparation and distribution of food to inmates at the State Correctional Institute at Dallas (“SCI-Dallas”). At all relevant times, his position was that of food service instructor (“FSI”) in the culinary department at SCI-Dallas, which relies heavily upon inmate labor to staff the kitchen and food service lines in the dining hall. Each FSI is responsible for training and supervising the work of a group of inmate-employees during a given shift.</p>

Larkins, the warden at SCI-Dallas; and Martin F. Horn, Commissioner of the Department (collectively, “Appellees”). The petition arose out of events that transpired in the culinary departmer t at SCI-Dallas beginning in April of 1996. Sometime prior to April of 1996, O’Rourke became aware of a scheme whereby thousands of pounds of meat products were being stolen from the culinary department and provided to certain inmates, who ran an illegal sandwich-making enterprise within the prison.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> According to O’Rourke, the inmate-employees smuggled these sandwiches out of the culinary department into the general inmate population and traded them for cigarettes, the de facto currency of the prison barter economy. After the meat products were stolen, the culinary department’s inventory books were fraudulently altered — at least in part by inmate-clerks and with the knowledge of some culinary department managers — to conceal the ongoing theft.</p>
    <p id="b275-4" data-blocks='[["BL_275.4",275,[225,1330,1155,829]]]'>O’Rourke prepared a report regarding the above-described activities, charging various co-workers and supervisors with theft and mismanagement. Skeptical that the culinary department management would take corrective action, O’Rourke submitted his report directly to Deputy Superintendent Stachelek. An investigation into the matter ensued, led chiefly by Captain Martin. According to the Commonwealth Court, Captain Martin ultimately reached the generous conclusion that FSM-II Docknovitch’s administration of the culinary department “bordered on the fringe of mismanagement.” On May 16, 1996, Captain Martin submitted his report to the warden, and various corrective measures were implemented, including placement of a lock on the freezer door, implementation of twice daily inventories, and a restriction that inventory accounting be performed by culinary department staff, and not inmate-clerks.</p>

According to O’Rourke, even the inmates were encouraged to commit petty acts of irritation and harassment, with the support of O’Rourke’s immediate supervisors in the department. Of particular concern were O’Rourke’s reassignment from kitchen duties to the food service line in the dining hall — a less desirable post due to a reduction in skilled tasks and supervisory duties — and O’Rourke’s removal from a list of employees eligible to work as a supervisor in return for extra pay and experience tending to lead to eventual promotion. O’Rourke contended that all of these adverse actions were carried out in an effort to chastise him for having revealed the above-described theft and mismanagement within the culinary department.</p>

Prior to trial, the Commonwealth Court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees as to all acts of alleged retaliation occurring prior to July 21,1996, based upon the 180-day statute of limitations, 43 P.S. § 1424(a)(providing that “[a] person who alleges a violation of this act may bring a civil action ... within 180 days after the occurrence of the alleged violation”). <em>See O’Rourke v.

The Commonwealth Court ultimately dismissed the petition by order dated August 25, 2000. In a memorandum opinion, the court set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law. On October 25, 2000, the Commonwealth Court denied O’Rourke’s post-trial motions. This timely appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[211,902,1154,1341]]]'>In its findings, the Commonwealth Court determined that many of the alleged retaliatory acts occurred before July 21, 1996, and hence were time-barred. Several others occurred or continued after such date, and hence were not. A representative sample, as found by the Commonwealth Court, includes: O’Rourke was kept off the acting supervisor list until late September of 1996 (having initially been removed from that list in April of 1996, shortly after filing his report), thus resulting in lost opportunities to perform supervisory duties and be compensated accordingly for approximately two months after July 21,1996; O’Rourke was assigned to work in the kitchen less frequently, and was more frequently stationed in the dining hall; on September 15, 1996, two fellow FSIs misplaced various food products while O’Rourke was assigned to kitchen work, an incident O’Rourke interpreted as staged to create a problem during O’Rourke’s kitchen shift; when O’Rourke returned to work following treatment for a lung condition, FSS Zambeto intentionally smoked several cigarettes in close proximity to O’Rourke, resulting in a written reprimand being issued to Zambeto; a note stating, “Burning supervisors will not further career,” was placed next to O’Rourke’s work schedule in the culinary office, and allowed to remain there by FSM-I Rapson; and O’Rourke was subjected to numerous incidents of petty conduct by co-workers and inmates such as name calling, whistling, and insults written on the schedule and on various memos.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>The Commonwealth Court ultimately concluded that some of the events O’Rourke interpreted as retaliatory — such as the misplacement of food products during O’Rourke’s kitchen shift — were not targeted at O’Rourke, but occurred for independent reasons. The court also held that, although O’Rourke was subjected to various types of harassment from inmates and co-workers, such activities did not materially affect O’Rourke’s compensation, terms, location or privileges of employment, and hence, were not compensable under the Whistleblower Law. Finally — and most pertinent to the instant appeal — the Commonwealth Court held that the Department was not liable for having removed O’Rourke from kitchen duties and from the acting supervisor list; it found that such measures were not motivated by a desire to exact retribution, but were carried out to reduce the heightened potential for conflict in the culinary department following O’Rourke’s April 16, 1996, report and the ensuing investigation by Captain Martin. Consequently, the court held that Appellees did not violate the Whistleblower Law, and dismissed the petition without reaching the question of damages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The pertinent question, therefore, is whether such actions were “separate and legitimate” for purposes of Section 4(c), when it is conceded that the adverse personnel decisions at issue were taken as a direct result of O’Rourke’s report of illegal activity. The answer depends upon the meaning of the word “separate.” If the intended meaning is “separate from a retaliatory motive,” then the Department’s actions were indeed “separate” because, as noted, the trial court found that they were taken to reduce the potential for conflict within the department. If, however, the term signifies that the employer must act with a rationale that is “separate from the report of wrongdoing,” a different result obtains, as the decisions at issue were concededly taken “in response to” the report of wrongdoing. The Whistleblower Law does not state which meaning is intended.

The first is contained in the requirement that, to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of a violation, the employee must allege “reprisal” by the employer. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 1424(b). Reprisal is essentially a synonym for retaliation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> This would tend to indicate that the term “separate and legitimate” — and in particular, the word “separate” — signifies “separate from a retaliatory motive,” as absent such motive, the employer’s action cannot properly be deemed reprisal. On the other hand, the statute broadly proscribes adverse employer action taken “because” the employee reported wrongdoing or waste. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 1423(a). Read in the context of such provision, the word “separate” appears to address more generally the presence, <em>vel non, </em>of any connection between the report of wrongdoing and the adverse action, independent of the employer’s subjective motivations. This would tend to indicate that, if the action was taken as a result of the report of wrongdoing, the resulting harm is compensable under the act, even if the employer’s <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>rationale is otherwise legitimate and non-pretextual. Such view is strengthened by the fact that the prohibited conduct is broadly defined to include not only retaliation, but also any discrimination against an employee occurring as a result of that employee’s good-faith report of wrongdoing. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 1423(a) (prohibiting discrimination <em>or </em>retaliation). Where an employee is singled out for inferior treatment as a result of having reported wrongdoing, it can reasonably be argued that such employee was subjected to “discrimination” for purposes of Section 1423(a), whether or not the employer’s actions proceeded from vengeful motivations. In view of the above, the language of the statute as a whole does not strongly favor one interpretation over the other, and hence, we turn to other statutory considerations for guidance.</p>

This is particularly significant because, if such illegalities are taking place, the employer and/or the individuals who benefit ordinarily have no incentive to reveal them and, additionally, may be adept at concealing them from the outside world. Therefore, the Commonwealth and its citizens benefit substantially when employees aid in the enforcement of legal and ethical codes “by raising substantiated claims of wrongdoing through protected procedural channels,” <em>Passaic Valley Sewerage Comm’rs v.

While there may be (as the Commonwealth Court found) compelling reasons to support the administrative action ultimately taken by the Department in the time frame in which it was accomplished, the circumstances prevailing prior to O’Rourke’s report of misconduct cannot be overlooked. From the Commonwealth Court’s findings, it is clear that there prevailed at SCI-Dallas an intolerable situation involving systematic theft of government property, which was condoned or deliberately overlooked by government employees in positions of substantial trust. O’Rourke’s report became the impetus for necessary corrective action, as well as the cause of a heightened potential for conflict in the post-corrective period.

Section 1426 of the Whistleblower Law, 43 P.S. § 1426, contains measures which are arguably penal, such as a civil fine and possible suspension from public service for up to six months. However, these measures are either modest or tied to a specific set of circumstances. In particular, civil fines may not exceed $500. Additionally, suspension from service is reserved for cases where the employer violated the act with the specific intention of discouraging the reporting of criminal activity. Even in that circumstance, suspension is within the court’s discretion.
