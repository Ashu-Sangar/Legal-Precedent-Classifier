The Lords were insured by appellee, Sphere Drake Insurance Company, which paid them $48,000 for damages incurred as a result of the fire. The Lords assigned their right of recovery to appellee, which subsequently filed a subrogation suit against PGW, the provider of natural gas service to the Lords, and appellant PFMC, seeking to recover the funds that it had paid to the Lords. PGW and PFMC asserted, among other things, that they were immune fi*om such an action under § 8553(d) of the Tort Claims Act.</p>

PFMC provides management services for the City and its subsequent contract with the City, which arose in conjunction with a City Ordinance, confirms that it exists for the sole purpose of managing PGW. The Mayor of Philadelphia selects PFMC’s Board of Directors and the City is responsible for indemnifying and holding harmless the directors, officers and employees of PFMC from all claims and liability arising in connection with their management of PGW.</p>

PFMC appealed to the Commonwealth Court, seeking to have <em>Modem Shoppers World </em>overruled.

Thus, PFMC is a “body corporate and politic” as contemplated in the Statutory Construction Act’s definition of a “local authority.” PFMC satisfies the second part of the “local authority” definition because it was created by the City of Philadelphia, a political subdivision, pursuant to statute. The parties stipulated that PFMC was incorporated by the Philadelphia City Solicitor’s Office— specifically, the then-City Solicitor and four of his Deputies— all of whom were acting within the scope of their duties. The incorporation took place pursuant to the Nonprofit Corporation Law, 15 Pa.C.S. § 5101 <em>et seq., </em>which provides that a nonprofit corporation may be incorporated “for any lawful purpose or purposes,” including for “civic” or “political” reasons. The City thus created and incorporated PFMC pursuant to a statute “for the sole specified purpose” of carrying out the civic and political function of managing and operating the City’s municipal gas utility, on a non-profit basis, on behalf of the City and for the exclusive benefit of its citizens. Because PFMC meets the definition of “local authority,” it falls within the scope of the larger definition of “local agency” under the Tort Claims Act.

In <em>Weinerman v. City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/f-supp/785/1174-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="785 F. Supp. 1174" data-case-ids="7412180" data-case-paths="/f-supp/785/1174-01">785 F.Supp. 1174</a> (E.D.Pa.1992), the issue before the federal court was whether the Philadelphia Housing Development Corporation (PHDC), an entity identical to PFMC in its structure, is a local agency immune from suit under the Act. Like PFMC, PHDC is a non-profit corporation. It was formed to provide services and activities to develop new housing employment opportunities, improve living conditions for the elderly, and improve housing and living facilities and home management skills in the City in general. Citing <em>Rhoads </em>with approval, the district court examined the degree to which the City and PHDC were intertwined and concluded that, in light of the substantial control the City exercises over it, PHDC is a local agency:</p>
    <blockquote id="b660-4" data-blocks='[["BL_660.4",660,[304,1065,1121,832]]]'>[PHDC’s] Board of Directors consists of ten directors who hold their directorships because of their status as City officers and twenty-five additional directors who are appointed by the Mayor. PHDC is required by the City’s office of Management and Budget to comply with directives that must be adhered to only by local governments or quasigovemmental agencies. Moreover, PHDC is exempt from all real estate taxes and municipal liens and claims and has the power to eradicate taxes, claims and municipal liens on property which it acquires. Should PHDC ever be dissolved, its property rights would vest in the City. Finally, it contributes on behalf of its employees to a pension plan under § 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. That provision applies only to plans established by a state government, its agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions thereof.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.5",660,[303,1923,1116,89]]]'>These facts establish that the PHDC is a local agency under the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act.</blockquote>

Certainly <em>Weinerman </em>and <em>Rhoads </em>do not bind this Court, but they are persuasive in that they, unlike <em>Modem Shoppers World, </em>are consistent with the purpose behind the Tort Claims Act.</p>

The City created PFMC, appoints its Board of Directors, and exercises substantial control over it. The assets of PFMC would vest in the City upon the dissolution of PFMC. PFMC employees participate in deferred compensation and defined benefit plans that are exclusively for City employees. As the <em>Modem Shoppers World </em>court itself recognized, PFMC’s sole source of income is the management fee paid it by the City. <a href="/pa-commw/164/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="643 A.2d 136" data-case-ids="1461153,7861291" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/164/0257-01,/a2d/643/0136-01">643 A.2d at 137</a>. That fact, combined with the fact that the City is obliged to indemnify PFMC’s directors, officers and employees and hold them harmless from all claims and liability arising in connection with PFMC’s management and operation of PGW, makes clear that any award of damages against PFMC is, in effect, an award against the City. In light of these facts, to hold that PFMC is not a loeal agency would be as contrary to the purpose of the Tort Claims Act as it is to the plain language of the Act. Accordingly, even if this Court needed to go beyond the plain language of the statute to decide this case, as Sphere Drake seems to believe, we would only be further convinced that PFMC is a local agency under the Act. That our holding is required by both the plain meaning of the statute and a consideration of the statute’s purpose reinforces our conclusion that <em>Modem Shoppers World </em>was wrongly decided.</p>

The parties agree that the Natural Gas Act explicitly grants PFMC the status of a local agency for Tort Claims Act immunity purposes. They differ, however, in their view of the relevancy of the Natural Gas Act here. PFMC argues that the passage of this Act is a clear indication <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>that the General Assembly does not agree with the holding in <em>Modem Shoppers World. </em>In PFMC’s view, the new Act effectively “overrules” <em>Modem Shoppers World. </em>Sphere Drake, on the other hand, argues that the Natural Gas Act has no retroactive effect and that its very existence proves that the prior statutory construct did not contemplate immunity for an entity such as PFMC.</p>
