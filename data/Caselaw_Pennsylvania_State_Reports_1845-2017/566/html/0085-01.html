The sole issue before our court is whether Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution requires the Commonwealth to obtain a determination of probable cause by a neutral, judicial authority before an agent of the Commonwealth may initiate a telephone call to an individual in his home and record that conversation. For the reasons that follow, we hold that Appellant Kirk Rekasie did not have a reasonable expectation that his telephone conversation would be free from consensual participant monitoring. Thus, we find that under the Pennsylvania Constitution, the Commonwealth was not required to obtain a determination of probable cause before recording the contents of a telephone call placed by a cooperative informant to Rekasie in his home.</p>

On June 23,1992, pursuant to an ongoing drug investigation, agents of the Attorney General’s Office and officers of the Cranberry Township Police Department seized 36.8 grams of cocaine from Thomas Tubridy. Tubridy told the agents that he received the cocaine from Vincent Rizzo, who lived in Florida. Tubridy also stated that Rekasie was Rizzo’s drug courier. Tubridy agreed to participate in an investigation of Rekasie and Rizzo and consented to have his telephone conversations with them taped.</p>

The fourth interception also occurred on June 26, 1992, when Tubridy called Rekasie at Rekasie’s home.

    <p id="b199-6" data-blocks='[["BL_199.5",199,[223,1252,1154,844]]]'>The Superior Court reversed. The Superior Court held that <em>Brion </em>was limited to the use of a body wire by a confidential informant in the home of a defendant and did not apply to the interception of telephone conversations. Accordingly, the Superior Court ruled that the trial court erred in suppressing the first five interceptions on the basis of <em>Brion. </em>It likewise found <em>Brion </em>inapplicable to the sixth interception because that interception occurred at a place of business rather than at a private residence. The court ruled that because the trial court made no factual findings regarding the circumstances surrounding the sixth interception, it could not determine whether the recorded party had a justifiable expectation of non-interception. Thus, it reversed the trial court’s order suppressing the first five interceptions and remanded to the suppression court for an evidentiary hearing as to the sixth interception.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Therefore, we must initially determine whether Rekasie held a reasonable expectation of privacy in his telephonic communication with Tubridy.

The analytical framework, which this court has applied in considering privacy expectations recognized under the Pennsylvania Constitution, has been less than clear. Thus, consideration of the proper analytical construct to be applied in resolving the issue before the court becomes necessary.</p>

Indeed, the United States Supreme Court in <em>White </em>specifically addressed the issue of whether the Fourth Amendment bars from evidence the testimony of governmental agents who related certain conversations which had occurred between the defendant and a government informant which the agents overheard by monitoring the frequency of a radio transmitter carried by the informant into, <em>inter alia, </em>the defendant’s home. The Court found there to be no justifiable expectation of privacy in the conversations.

Blystone, </em>respecting the nature of oral communications, remains controlling as to the expectation of privacy one may have in what one says to another. Citing with approval to authority from the United States Supreme Court in that Article I, § 8 case, <em>Blystone </em>noted that, “a thing <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>remains secret until it is told to other ears, after which one cannot command its keeping. What was private is now on other lips and can no longer belong to the teller.

Implicit in this observation about the very nature of privacy expectations in oral communications was the recognition that one’s listeners can, and often do, repeat the content of a conversation to anyone they choose. That reality, in turn, suggests that, at least in the absence of some recognized privilege, the speaker cannot be said to possess any reasonable expectation that the contents of the conversation itself will remain private once the words are related to another.</p>

The scant protection afforded by the statute, i.e., the requirement of one-party consent, is rendered superfluous when viewing the right to privacy in this context. Following the majority’s analysis to its logical conclusion, there is no constitutional precept preventing the government from tapping any individual’s telephone line for any reason.

That number provides a strong, sometimes conclusive inference as to whom is being called, unquestionably a private matter. The caller certainly evidences no intention to shed his veil of privacy merely because he chooses to use the telephone to make private contacts. In modern-day America, the telephone call is a nearly indispensable tool used to conduct the widest range of business, government, political, social, and personal affairs. Certainly the vast majority of calls are unrelated to criminal enterprise, and yet the vast majority of callers would not think of allowing the destination of their every call to be recorded by the police.... In any case we do not hesitate to say that a caller and the person he calls expect and are entitled to as much privacy in the fact they are talking to one another as in what they say to each other.</blockquote>

The majority’s attempts to cloud this clear pronouncement of the law are unavailing. It is simply beyond cavil that one’s expectation of privacy in the <em>contents </em>of a conversation is greater than any expectation of privacy in the telephone numbers one dials. I therefore cannot agree that the citizens of this Commonwealth reasonably expect the government to intercept telephone conversations that occur in their homes merely because speaker phones and extension lines have facilitated the means of doing so. Our right to privacy does not rise and fall with technology, but rather is grounded in our state constitution, which has afforded the right to privacy the utmost protection. The future holds more subtle and effective means of invading privacy than we have ever imagined. Rather than relinquish our privacy rights in the face of modem innovation, we should fiercely protect them.</p>

As no prior judicial approval was obtained in the instant case, the recording of the telephone conversation Appellant engaged in from his residence should have been suppressed.</p>

Now that the Commonwealth may record an individual’s statements made in his home over a telephone line without any prior judicial determination of probable cause, why would the Commonwealth ever bother sending an informant into the home in order to intercept conversations? By way of a simple telephone call, the Commonwealth can now record any conversation at its discretion without having to obtain the judicial approval needed to record a face-to-face conversation.</p>

I simply cannot agree, however, that it is unreasonable for a person who receives a telephone call to conclude that others are not listening in on the conversation. Moreover, as Mr. Justice Zappala notes in his dissent, the majority’s analysis ignores Brion’s holding that “an individual can reasonably expect that his right to privacy will not be violated in his home through the use of <em>any </em>electronic surveillance.” <em>Brion, </em><a href="/pa/539/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="652 A.2d 287" data-case-ids="474153,7866155" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0256-01,/a2d/652/0287-01">652 A.2d at 289</a> (emphasis added).

In my view, the constantly expanding ways in which the Commonwealth is able to intrude upon our private affairs calls for heightened, rather than diminished, protection of our constitutional rights. Requiring the Commonwealth to obtain a judicial determination of probable cause prior to interception of an individual’s telephone conversation is not so heavy a burden as to outweigh a citizen’s fundamental constitutional right to be free from such intrusion.
