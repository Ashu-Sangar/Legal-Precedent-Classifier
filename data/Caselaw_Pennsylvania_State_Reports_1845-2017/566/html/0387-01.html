In 1984, Cynthia Winters purchased an automobile insurance policy from Liberty Mutual. The policy listed only Cynthia as a “named insured.” Timothy Rupert was listed as a “driver.” In 1988, Cynthia and Timothy married. In 1991, Cynthia executed a “Rejection of Stacked Uninsured Coverage Limits” form for the policy. The waiver’s validity, at the time of execution, is not at question here.</p>

On January 20, 1997, Cynthia died. On January 22, 1997, Timothy changed the policy to remove her name, thus making him the sole named insured on the policy. Timothy renewed the policy on May 22, 1997. The policy number did not change through the life of the policy.</p>
    <p id="b499-7" data-blocks='[["BL_499.7",499,[222,1771,1155,419]]]'>On July 29, 1997, Timothy was seriously injured when a car struck him while he was standing next to his own vehicle. An uninsured motorist operated the vehicle which struck Timothy Rupert. It is undisputed that Timothy’s insurance included $300,000 of uninsured coverage per accident. It is also undisputed that the policy covered two vehicles, thus, if a valid waiver to stacking was not signed, Timothy Rupert would be covered for his damages up to $600,000.</p>

Rupert’s argument is based upon the plain language of Section 1738(e).</p>
    <p id="b502-11" data-blocks='[["BL_502.9",502,[273,1176,1161,470]]]'>At first blush, Section 1738 appears to interchange the terms “first named insured” and “named insured”.

Likewise, Section 1738(e) also mandates the signature of the first named insured. My reading of the plain meaning of Section 1738(d) and (e) is that the signature of the first named insured evidences the insurer’s fulfillment of its obligation of offering and informing the named insured of his or her right to waiver. Given this plain meaning of the statute, I find that, for purposes of Section 1738, the signature of the first named insured on a valid waiver at the inception of the policy is <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>evidence that each named insured under the policy was fully aware of the options regarding stacked policy limits.</p>

Yet this language appears nowhere in section 1738. Moreover, under this expansive view, a rejection form signed “at the inception of the policy” indefinitely binds all future insureds, including those added long after the original first named insured is removed from the policy; these subsequent insureds are not even minimally afforded constructive knowledge of the option to reject stacked coverage. This troubling result does not follow if the insurer has obtained a rejection form from the current first named insured, whose signature would reject coverage for all those insureds currently on the policy.
