Appellant, Leroy Stallworth, was convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree and burglary. At the conclusion of the penalty phase of Appellant’s trial, the jury found the existence of two aggravating circumstances: that the defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6), and that at the time of the killing, the defendant was subject to a court order restricting in any way his behavior towards the victim pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 61 (relating to protection from abuse), 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(18). The jury also found two mitigating circumstances. The jury then returned a sentence of death.</p>

Appellant and his estranged wife, the victim Natasha Stall-worth, were separated and living apart, each with new partners. They had a six year old daughter, who resided with the victim. Appellant frequently watched and cared for the child. Appellant and the victim often argued over matters concerning their child and eventually, the victim sought financial support from Appellant for her care. Appellant threatened the victim on several occasions, saying that he would kill her if she ever restricted his right to see their daughter.</p>

As a consequence of this dispute, the victim obtained a protection from abuse (PFA) order restricting Appellant’s behavior toward her and also restricting Appellant’s access to his daughter. Appellant was not served with notice of the PFA order prior to the victim’s murder.</p>

Approximately twenty minutes after phoning the victim, Appellant arrived at her home, kicked in the door and shot her twelve times about the head and body with his 9mm handgun. Police arrived to find Appellant barricaded inside the victim’s home. After some negotiation, Appellant surrendered and was taken into custody.</p>

Thus, the evidence of record was more than sufficient to sustain Appellant’s convictions for first degree murder and burglary. We now turn to the specific allegations of error raised by Appellant.</p>

Appellant complains that Dr. Ross’ testimony went beyond the scope of his qualifications as an expert in that he gave testimony regarding “crime scene reconstruction,” which was not a stated basis for his testimony.

Appellant has focused on isolated instances where Dr. Ross conceded that although he was rendering an opinion within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty regarding the evidence, there might be alternative explanations. For instance, in the example cited by Appellant, Dr. Ross testified that to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, blood drops found on the victim’s shoe came from a contact transfer. N.T. January 21, 1999 at 1023-1024. Dr. Ross also indicated that the blood could have gotten on the shoe in another manner, but that he did not observe any evidence of the classic patterns that would so indicate any other explanation. Thus, he concluded to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, that the blood on the shoe was the result of a contact transfer. This was appropriate. It is not necessary that an expert testify that his conclusions are stated beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v.

Here, Dr. Ross testified that blood found on the left side of Appellant’s shoe was the result of a contact transfer. Dr. Ross noted that the end of the stain had a feathery edge to it which indicated that Appellant’s shoe came into contact with the victim’s blood and that this contact could have occurred by rubbing against the body, kicking, dragging, or by coming into contact with blood on the floor. Looking at Dr. Ross’ testimony in context, it is clear that the pertinent aspect of the testimony was that the stain was caused by a contact transfer, not how the transfer occurred.</p>

Specifically, Appellant notes that Dr. Ross identified much of his work as the application of common sense. Appellant’s Brief at 56. This, however, misconstrues Dr. Ross’ statements. Only on two occasions did Dr. Ross use the phrase common sense. First, when asked to provide a general background for the field of bloodstain analysis, Dr. Ross stated, at the outset, that everyone has a common sense understanding of bloodstains. He then went on to explain, generally, about swipe patterns, conical patterns, impact spatter, projected blood patterns, castoff patterns, flow patterns, and forceful impact spatter. Dr. Ross never indicated that the average layperson has a <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>“common sense” understanding of the flow patterns he went on to describe and explain in detail.</p>
    <p id="b482-5" data-blocks='[["BL_482.4",482,[270,447,1161,739]]]'>The second reference Dr. Ross made to “common sense” was in reference to pine needles that were discovered throughout the victim’s clothing. Dr. Ross was asked if this was significant and he stated, “Sure. From a reasonable certainty, or even from common sense, obviously if she’s got pine needles all over her, she’s moving about the room.” N.T. January 21, 1999 at 1071. Appellant points to this isolated passage as demonstrating that much of Dr. Ross’ conclusions were the result of common sense. This argument is entirely without merit as Dr. Ross explained in great detail how each of the flow patterns and stains found at the crime scene depicted certain events that occurred during the murder, none of which was purported by Dr. Ross to be within the common knowledge of the average layperson.</p>

The Commonwealth points out that if the legislature intended that a defendant actually be served with notice of the PFA or have knowledge of the order to be “subject to” such order, it could have so stated.

Appellant claims, in the alternative, that the Commonwealth failed to give proper pretrial notice of its intention to introduce “prior bad act” evidence as required by Pa.R.E. 404(b). Although it does not appear that the Commonwealth gave specific notice of its intent in this regard, the record reveals that counsel for Appellant indicated to the court that he had received all of the police reports in discovery; these reports contained the evidence introduced by the Commonwealth regarding prior threats made by Appellant. Additionally, the Commonwealth provided an offer of proof as to each witness’s testimony and Appellanl was able to articulate an objection regarding each witness. On at least one occasion, upon counsel’s objection, Appellant was offered additional time to deal with the evidence if needed. In''addition to the foregoing, Appellant does not now claim that he was prejudiced by the Commonwealth’s failure to give specific notice of this evidence, rather, he merely notes that the Commonwealth did not strictly comply with the rule.

Although Section 6104 of the Judicial Code provides a hearsay exception for public records, the statute refers to "a record of governmental action or inaction," 42 Pa.C.S. § 6104(a), and “a record ... disclosing the existence or nonexistence of facts which have been recorded pursuant to an official duty ...," 42 Pa.C.S. § 6104(b).
