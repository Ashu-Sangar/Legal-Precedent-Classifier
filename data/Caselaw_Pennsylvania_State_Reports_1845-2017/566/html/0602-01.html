(“Employer”) since 1968, when he worked as a switchman at Employer’s facility in downtown Pittsburgh; he remained in that location until 1984. In this <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>capacity, Claimant was responsible for maintaining and repairing line switching equipment, which included diesel engines, generators, air compressors, and other machinery associated with emergency power. Through the course of his employment as a switchman, Claimant was exposed to considerable occupational noise, making it difficult to communicate to coworkers without shouting, and was not initially permitted to wear protective devices for his hearing. In 1984, after being assigned as a switchman to Employer’s power plant, Claimant began wearing employer-provided hearing protection, which helped to reduce, but not eliminate, his occupational exposure to noise. Claimant, however, was occasionally unable to wear protective devices for his hearing, as doing so would hinder his performance of certain job functions.</p>

Moreover, Claimant admitted that he had noticed problems with his hearing shortly after beginning work for Employer, explaining that his wife had repeatedly asked him to undergo a hearing evaluation, he experiences difficulty hearing people over the telephone, he cannot hear well in the presence of background noise, and he must increase the volume on a radio to hear it. Claimant also admitted an awareness that exposure to loud noises could damage one’s hearing and that he experienced such exposure in the course of his employment.</p>

Bell, M.D. In a report issued to Claimant’s attorney on that day, Dr. Bell set forth a preliminary opinion that Claimant suffered a loss of hearing secondary to industrial noise exposure. On September 25, 1995, evidently relying upon this preliminary opinion, Claimant filed a claim petition for bilateral hearing loss occasioned by continuous occupational exposure to noise and also sent Employer notice of his injury by certified mail. Employer filed an answer to the petition, denying all material allega<a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>tions, and asserting that Claimant had not provided it with notice of the work injury in the manner dictated by Section 311 of the Workers’ Compensation Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Dr. Bell concluded, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Claimant was exposed to an occupational noise hazard that caused his hearing loss. Claimant also offered a report by Donald B. Kamerer, M.D., F.A.C.S., who concluded that Claimant’s binaural hearing loss, calculated according to the American Medical Association’s Guidelines, was nineteen percent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Employer offered no evidence in response to the claim petition.</p>

The WCJ explained, however, that Claimant’s existing knowledge of his disability triggered the notice period on February 23, 1995, the effective date of the amendments to the Act allowing compensation for partial hearing loss. As notice of Claimant’s injury was not provided to Employer until September 25, 1995, the WCJ concluded that Claimant had not satisfied the notice provisions of Section 311 and, correspondingly, denied the claim petition. Affirming, the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (“Board”) found sufficient evidence to support the WCJ’s finding that Claimant knew of his hearing loss and its relation to his employment in 1990, and that he knew or should have known of its compensability as of February 23, 1995, thus commencing the 120 day notice period of Section 311.</p>

The Commonwealth Court reasoned that Employer’s examination of Claimant in 1990 for a commercial driver’s license and the corresponding notice to Claimant that he suffered some hearing loss, contrary to the WCJ’s statement, did not afford Claimant knowledge or notice that such hearing loss was work-related or that he suffered sufficient hearing loss exceeding the ten percent threshold required for benefits under Section 306(c)(8)(iii) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 513(8)(iii). <em>See Socha, </em><a href="/a2d/725/1276-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="725 A.2d 1276" data-case-ids="11645385" data-case-paths="/a2d/725/1276-01">725 A.2d at 1281</a>.

    <p id="b718-4" data-blocks='[["BL_718.4",718,[269,643,1164,1079]]]'>Presently, the parties maintain their disagreement concerning whether the Commonwealth Court’s traditional approach to the discovery rule remains viable in partial hearing loss cases. Significant to our view of the appropriate basis for the present disposition, Claimant argues that resort to the discovery principle is unnecessary in light of Section 306(c) (8) (ix)’s alignment of the date of injury with the date of claim filing. In response, Employer invokes the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion that Section 306(c)(8)(ix)’s definition should apply only to calculation of benefits determinations, noting the absence of any reference to Section 311 among the terms of that subsection. According to Employer, the terms “injury” and “date of injury” should be afforded materially different interpretations, precluding any equation between the “date of injury” under Section 306(c)(8)(ix) and the “occurrence of the injury” for purposes of the notice provision of Section 311. Employer further argues that Section 308(c)(8)(ix) was intended solely to resolve the difficulties often associated with determining a claimant’s average weekly wage for a hearing loss claim, since the moment of the occurrence of the compensable injury is incapable of precise ascertainment.</p>

      <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 513(8)(ix) (stating that “[t]he date of injury for occupational hearing loss under subclause (i) of this clause shall be the earlier of the date on which the claim <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>petition is filed or the last date of long-term exposure to hazardous occupational noise while in the employ of the employer against whom the claim is filed”). The concept of injury is intrinsic to the integrated workers’ compensation scheme, and certainly, in crafting Section 306(c)(8)(ix), the General Assembly would have been aware that multiple consequences would flow from its designation of a specific date for such event. Therefore, the natural effect of the prescription of a date of injury under Section 306(c)(8)(ix) would be to govern all consequences resulting from this form of determination for Section 306(c)(8)(i) claims, including the establishment of the timing of the occurrence of the injury for purposes of Section 311’s 120-day notice requirement. <em>See generally </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1953 (directing that an original statute and subsequent amendment are to be construed on a unitary basis). Employer’s contrary approach is merely to identify a salutary effect of a single consequence of the date-of-injury specification (ease of benefits calculation), and to contend that this must, then, represent the General Assembly’s sole purpose.

Employer's suggestion lhat the term “date of injury'' was intended as a term of art applicable solely to the calculation of benefits under Section 306(c)(8)(i) is a strained interpretation of the Act. In instances in which the General Assembly has intended to employ words as terms of art specific to particular enactments or portions thereof, it has generally accomplished this by providing specific direction and using the term of art in the enactment. <em>See, e.g., </em>Act of October 27, 1995, P.L. <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>744, § 4(b), <em>as amended, </em>43 P.S. § 954(b) (specifically defining "employer” for purposes of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act); 75 Pa.C.S. § 1542(a) (defining a "habitual offender” for purposes of license revocation). Here, the limitation must be inferred. Moreover, the calculation-of-benefits term of Section 306(c)(8)(i) does not itself employ the phrase "date of injury," further weakening the strength of any inference that the Legislature intended a directed application. We further note Employer's argument that Section 31 l’s 120 day notice period should be deemed to have commenced upon the enactment of the 1995 amendments. Such an argument, however, is based upon the questionable presumption that the Legislature contemplated that one in Claimant's position should be charged with knowledge of the legislative enactment as of the date it became effective.

Applying this rule to the instant case, Claimant notified Bell Atlantic well within Section 311’s time limits because Claimant was not informed by his doctor that he suffered from a ten percent hearing loss due to industrial noise exposure until September 6, 1995 and Claimant filed his claim petition on September 25, 1995.
