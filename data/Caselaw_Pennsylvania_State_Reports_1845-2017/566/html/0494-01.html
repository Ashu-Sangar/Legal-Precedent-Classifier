At issue is the insurers’ obligation to indemnify the manufacturers for the costs of cleaning up environmental pollution caused by the manufacturers. The insurance policies cover pollution if it was “sudden and accidental,” but not otherwise. The manufacturers maintain that according to the usage in the industry, those words mean “unexpected and unintended.” The trial court and Superior Court disagreed, holding that the common meaning of the words “sudden and accidental” is unambiguous and does not cover pollution which occurred gradually over a long period of time whether or not the pollution was unexpected and unintended. The trial court <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>therefore granted the insurers’ demurrer and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. Superior Court affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b609-4" data-blocks='[["BL_609.4",609,[215,462,1156,1609]]]'>Appellants have a second claim. They argue that according to principles of regulatory estoppel, a form of judicial estoppel, summary judgment was inappropriate. Their complaint alleged that in 1970 the insurance industry, including the defendant insurers, submitted to the Pennsylvania insurance department a memorandum which asserted that the disputed language — excluding coverage for pollution unless it was “sudden and accidental” — would not result in any significant decrease in coverage. The complaint alleged, moreover, that the insurance department relied on the industry’s representation when it approved the disputed language for inclusion in standard comprehensive general liability policies without a reduction in premiums to balance a reduction in coverage. The trial court rejected this claim, stating that “Sunbeam could not reasonably establish that the Department relied on the explanatory memorandum submitted to it by the insurance industry.” While the Superior Court majority affirmed this holding, President Judge McEwen dissented on the grounds that in reviewing the dismissal of a complaint based on preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, the averments of the complaint must be taken as true. A preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer should be sustained only in a case that clearly and without a doubt fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The dissenting opinion stated that likelihood of proof is irrelevant; a preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer must be rejected if the facts as pleaded state a claim for which relief may be granted under any theory of law, citing <em>Willet v.

Whether or not the court regarded proof of the insurance department’s reliance on the insurance industry’s memorandum as likely or probable, the fact remains that the reliance was properly pleaded. In evaluating a preliminary objection in the nature of a <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>demurrer, properly pleaded facts are deemed to be' admitted. <em>County of Allegheny v.

Judicial estoppel is an equitable, judicially-created doctrine designed to protect the integrity of the courts by preventing litigants from “playing fast and loose” with the judicial system by adopting whatever position suits the moment. <em>Gross v. City of Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/a2d/686/0864-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="686 A.2d 864" data-case-ids="7356448" data-case-paths="/a2d/686/0864-01">686 A.2d 864</a>, 867 (Pa.Cmwlth.1996). Unlike collateral estoppel or res judicata, it does not depend on relationships between parties, but rather on the relationship of one party to one or more tribunals. In essence, the doctrine prohibits parties from switching legal positions to suit their own ends. <em><a href="/a2d/686/0864-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="686 A.2d 864" data-case-ids="7356448" data-case-paths="/a2d/686/0864-01">Id.</a> </em>Thus, having represented to the insurance department, a regulatory agency, that the new language in the 1970 policies — “sudden and accidental” — did not involve a .significant decrease in coverage from the prior language, the. insurance industry will not be heard to assert the opposite position when claims are made by the insured policyholders. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit recently reached the same conclusion in <em>Essex Chemical Corp. v. Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co., </em>No. 00-1839 (March 7, 2001, unreported memorandum opinion) (following New Jersey Supreme Court’s application of the doctrine of regulatory estoppel based on insurance industry’s identical representations made to New Jersey’s insurance commission).</p>

Focusing on the emphasized portion of the quotation (the remainder of the sentence mentions a new exclusion not at issue in this case), the memorandum appears to state that coverage was to be continued for both gradual and abrupt pollution or contamination as it had theretofore been provided in existing comprehensive general liability policies. The policies provide coverage for damages arising out of an occurrence, defined as “an accident, including injurious exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage that was neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.”</p>

The words of an insurance policy are to be interpreted in their natural, plain, and ordinary sense, and only if the policy language is ambiguous is resort to be made to extrinsic evidence. <em>See Madison, </em><a href="/pa/557/0595-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="557 Pa. 595" data-case-ids="56742" data-case-paths="/pa/557/0595-01">557 Pa. at 608-09</a>, <a href="/a2d/735/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="735 A.2d 100" data-case-ids="11533791,56742" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/0100-01,/pa/557/0595-01">735 A.2d at 108</a>. While certainly reference to trade usage is available to explain material terms of certain specialized contracts, it should not be utilized to create a variance from the agreement. <em>See generally </em>21A Am.Jur.2d Customs and Usages § 25 (1998)(stating that “parol or extrinsic evidence of a usage or custom is not admissible where the intent and meaning of the parties as expressed in a contract are clear and unambiguous, especially where the purpose of the evidence is to contradict, vary, modify, qualify, or override the plain, unambiguous terms”). Moreover, I disagree that the form of custom and usage alleged is a relevant consideration in the present context, involving, not specialized terms of a document negotiated between participants in some particular trade or industry, but the standard terms of a comprehensive general liability policy offered to a widely diverse business public. Rather, I agree with the <em>en banc </em>decision of the Superior Court, which con-<a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>eluded that the terms “sudden and accidental” should be interpreted according to their ordinary usage, should be viewed as clear and unambiguous, and should be deemed to include a temporal element connoting an event that is abrupt and lasting only a short time. <em>See Sunbeam Corp. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em><a href="/a2d/740/1179-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="740 A.2d 1179" data-case-ids="11555854" data-case-paths="/a2d/740/1179-01">740 A.2d 1179</a>, 1186-88 (Pa.Super.1999) <em>(en banc).

Significantly, as aptly noted by the trial court (the Honorable R. Stanton Wettick, Jr.), the representations alleged would have occurred thirty years ago, and the Insurance Department did not alter its regulations and approval practices after it obviously must have become aware of the interpretation that the insurance industry subsequently accorded to the “sudden and accidental” clause, nor has it sought to intervene on behalf of Appellants herein. I would also note that such an application of the regulatory estoppel theory has not been previously recognized by the appellate courts of this Commonwealth; indeed, most other jurisdictions have rejected arguments in this context based upon regulatory estoppel. <em>See generally SnyderGeneral Corp. v. Great American Ins. Co., </em><a href="/f-supp/928/0674-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="928 F.
