For the following reasons, we hold that the sanction of dismissal by the trial court was improper and, accordingly, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b515-4" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[224,486,1155,998]]]'>On March 27, 1996, appellant Donald Scott Burke was working as an assistant manager at the Mardi Gras Restaurant in Ohio Township. Richard Graham, who was seventeen years old at the time, was also working at the restaurant on that day as a busboy. The Commonwealth charged that, at approximately 6:00 p.m. that evening, appellant approached Graham and asked him to participate in a sham robbery. Graham agreed. At approximately 11:30 p.m., Graham met appellant on the second floor of the restaurant and appellant gave Graham money from the restaurant’s cash registers. Graham bound appellant’s hands and feet and hid the stolen money outside. Graham then reentered the restaurant and threw a rack of glasses down the steps leading to the second floor. When one of the restaurant’s owners, John Connolly, and other employees responded to the commotion, Graham told them that two men had run down the stairs and knocked him over. Connolly subsequently discovered appellant on the second floor of the restaurant with tape on his hands and feet, his legs tied, and a napkin stuffed in his mouth.</p>
    <p id="b515-5" data-blocks='[["BL_515.5",515,[225,1508,1154,574]]]'>Ohio Township police were the first to arrive at the scene. Appellant and Graham each gave an oral statement to township officers that two men had robbed the restaurant at gunpoint and then escaped through the restaurant’s side door. These statements were reflected in an Ohio Township Police Incident Report. In addition, appellant and Graham provided Ohio Township police with handwritten statements which were consistent with their oral statements. Later that night, the Ohio Township police requested the assistance of the Allegheny County police, who thereafter assumed jurisdiction over the investigation.</p>

Based on this statement, Graham was charged as a <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>juvenile with various offenses relating to the incident. On the day of Graham’s hearing in Juvenile Court on these charges, he entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth by which these charges, as well as an unrelated drug charge, would be dismissed in exchange for his testimony against appellant.</p>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[272,643,1159,686]]]'>On July 18, 1996, appellant was charged with theft by unlawful taking,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> false reports to law enforcement authorities<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and criminal conspiracy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> On August 2, 1996, appellant made an informal request for pre-trial discovery and inspection. Almost three months later, on October 24,1996, appellant filed a Motion to Compel Discovery and Inspection, in which he specifically requested that the Commonwealth disclose a variety of items, including material evidence favorable to the accused; written, oral or recorded confessions or inculpatory statements; and Graham’s prior criminal record and information regarding any charges pending against him. Thereafter, the Commonwealth represented to the trial court that it had complied with the discovery requests.</p>
    <p id="b516-6" data-blocks='[["BL_516.5",516,[269,1354,1158,259]]]'>Appellant waived his right to a jury and proceeded to a bench trial before the Honorable Jeffrey A. Manning. During the defense’s cross-examination, Graham testified that he had provided the police with a handwritten statement on the night of the incident. The following exchange then took place:</p>

    <p id="b517-5" data-blocks='[["BL_517.5",517,[216,446,1152,582]]]'>Later in the proceedings, the defense asked for a copy of the handwritten statement appellant had given to the police on the night of the robbery. The prosecutor initially represented that she did not have this statement either. Shortly after this exchange, however, the prosecutor produced appellant’s handwritten statement. Defense counsel again expressed concern that the Commonwealth also had Graham’s statement in its possession but had failed to turn it over. The trial court then ordered the Commonwealth to conduct a thorough search for Graham’s statement and adjourned the proceedings to the following afternoon.</p>
    <p id="b517-6" data-blocks='[["BL_517.6",517,[216,1055,1150,420]]]'>The next day, the prosecutor informed the trial court that she had found Graham’s handwritten statement. In addition, the prosecutor reported that she had found four other items responsive to appellant’s pre-trial discovery request which had not previously been furnished to the defense: an Incident Report, Supplementary Investigation Report and Complaint Record completed by the Ohio Township Police Department and the handwritten statement of Melodie Manojlovich.</p>
    <p id="b517-7" data-blocks='[["BL_517.7",517,[214,1501,1150,580]]]'>The prosecutor attempted to explain the failure to deliver these materials sooner as an unintentional oversight resulting from the fact that two police “jurisdictions” — Ohio Township and Allegheny County — were involved in the case and had failed to adequately communicate with each other on the matter. The prosecutor noted that she had repeatedly asked the Allegheny County police for the documents, and had been told that they did not have them. After the documents were found, she further noted, the Allegheny County police officer she spoke to could not explain why they had not appeared in the pre-trial discovery.</p>
    <p id="b517-8" data-blocks='[["BL_517.8",517,[213,2108,1151,258]],["BL_518.1",518,[271,320,1162,413]]]'>With respect to whether this circumstance amounted to a discovery violation, the prosecutor cited two cases, <em>Commonwealth v.

The trial court responded by stating that, for discovery purposes, “[t]he Commonwealth includes the district attorney and all police agencies involved in the prosecution of the case.” For this reason, the trial court found that the Commonwealth had violated its discovery obligation.</p>
    <p id="b518-5" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[269,756,1163,998]]]'>On the question of the appropriate remedy, the prosecutor requested a continuance to allow the defense an opportunity to review the materials. Appellant, on the other hand, moved for a judgment of acquittal “on the basis of the misconduct of the prosecution.” T.T. at 111. The trial court considered the acquittal motion as a motion to dismiss based upon prosecutorial misconduct and granted the motion, dismissing all charges against appellant. The trial court specifically found that the prosecutor’s failure to discover the evidence sooner was not intentional; in the court’s view, however, the prosecution had been “grossly negligent.” The court then held that the tardy disclosure violated the Commonwealth’s due process obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em><a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">373 U.S. 83</a>, <a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">83 S.Ct. 1194</a>, <a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">10 L.Ed.2d 215</a> (1963), and its progeny, as well as its obligations under Rule 305<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial court further concluded that dismissal of the charges was the only appropriate remedy. In its opinion, the trial court explained why it believed dismissal was required:</p>
    <blockquote id="b518-6" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[311,1769,1123,521]],["BL_519.1",519,[258,323,1112,312]]]'>The witness whose statements had been withheld [Graham] had already testified, been cross-examined and was released from his subpoena. The defendant was deprived of the right and opportunity to effectively cross-examine the Commonwealth witnesses, particularly his alleged accomplice. Because this defendant was deprived of that important right through the failure of the prosecution to abide their solemn obligation, the only appropriate remedy was the dismissal of the charges. If the non-disclosure had truly been something beyond the control of counsel, then perhaps the <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>declaration of a mistrial or some lesser remedy would have been appropriate. Here, however, the prosecution’s conduct in failing to exercise the minimal level of due diligence necessary to insure that its obligations were carried out, was so egregious, dismissal was the only appropriate remedy.</blockquote>

    <p id="b519-6" data-blocks='[["BL_519.5",519,[216,721,1157,1123]]]'>On the Commonwealth’s appeal, the Superior Court reversed. The Superior Court disagreed with the trial court’s finding that the prosecutor’s failure to secure the evidence at issue was the product of “gross negligence.” In the Superior Court’s view, the record revealed “no lack of diligence by the prosecution in obtaining and disclosing evidence” because the prosecutor’s initial investigation failed to uncover these statements and, when specific inquiries were made of police, the response had been that these items did not exist. Citing this Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Montgomery, </em><a href="/pa/533/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="533 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="1837460" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0491-01">533 Pa. 491</a>, <a href="/pa/533/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="533 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="1837460" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0491-01">626 A.2d 109</a> (1993), the Superior Court noted that the prosecution cannot be deemed to have violated discovery rules when, despite reasonable inquiry, it fails to discover and disclose evidence it neither possesses nor is aware of, such as evidence exclusively in police control. In addition, while the Superior Court agreed that the defense was entitled to examine the late-disclosed evidence and that a remedy for its nondisclosure was appropriate, it disagreed with the remedy fashioned by the trial court. In the Superior Court’s view, dismissal was far too extreme a remedy; the appropriate remedy was a continuance.</p>

On the question of <em>Brady </em>materiality, appellant argues that the tardy disclosure prejudiced him because he was unable to cross-examine Graham with his prior statement. Furthermore, appellant notes that <em>Brady </em>material is more effective to the defense the sooner it is disclosed. Finally, on the question of remedy, appellant argues that “[n]o remedy short of dismissal is adequate to protect the rights of the accused.”</p>
    <p id="b520-5" data-blocks='[["BL_520.4",520,[271,872,1159,1149]]]'>The Commonwealth does not dispute that at least some of this evidence was subject to disclosure under <em>Brady </em>and/or Pa.R.Crim.P. <em>305 </em>— e.g., Graham’s statement to the police which, if believed, would be exculpatory, and appellant’s own statement to police. The Commonwealth also no longer argues that its failure to discover and disclose these statements is excused because the evidence was in the possession of the police, rather than the prosecutor. The Commonwealth argues, instead, that the Superior Court correctly found that the remedy of dismissal was inappropriate here. This is so, the Commonwealth contends, because the trial court did not even attempt to determine if appellant suffered actual prejudice from the non-disclosure. The Commonwealth argues that no such prejudice arose since the undisclosed statements were cumulative and consistent with the information already provided to appellant. In addition, the Commonwealth argues that the fact that the prosecutor was not personally in possession of the discovery materials is certainly relevant to the question of the appropriate remedy here, and weighs in favor of something short of a discharge. The claimed negligence of the prosecutor, the Commonwealth argues, does not warrant such an extreme sanction.</p>

In <em>Smith, </em>the Commonwealth deliberately withheld <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>from a capital defendant: (1) the existence of an agreement with its chief witness pursuant to which he received lenient treatment at sentencing on unrelated charges in exchange for his testimony, and (2) material, exculpatory physical evidence that it had discovered mid-trial. The physical evidence consisted of grains of sand that were found between the toes of the murder victim at her autopsy. The sand was consistent with Smith’s defense that the crime had been committed in Cape May, New Jersey, by others, and not by him in Pennsylvania, as the Commonwealth had alleged. At trial, when a Pennsylvania state trooper testified on cross-examination that granular particles which looked like sand had been removed from the victim’s body, the Commonwealth implied that he had fabricated his testimony and the trial prosecutor recommended to his superior that he investigate the feasibility of prosecuting the state trooper for perjury. While the trial was still in progress, the state police discovered the adhesive “lifters” that had been used to remove and retain the sand from the victim’s feet. The Commonwealth, however, failed to disclose this evidence and, indeed, continued to suppress the evidence for over two years while the case was on direct appeal to this Court. <em><a href="/pa/532/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="532 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1835908" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0177-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/532/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="532 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1835908" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0177-01">at 182-83</a>, <a href="/pa/532/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="532 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1835908" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0177-01">615 A.2d at 323-24</a>.

    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[273,518,1159,1121]]]'>The prosecutor’s conduct in the matter <em>sub judice </em>does not approach that of the prosecutor in <em>Moose, </em>let alone resemble the deliberate, bad faith prosecutorial misconduct which warranted dismissal under <em>Shaffer, McElligott </em>and <em>Smith. </em>There is no evidence here pointing to deliberate overreaching by the prosecutor. Indeed, it is not even apparent that the undisclosed evidence differed in quality from information already made available to appellant. For example, several hours after Graham gave his written statement to the Ohio Township police relating as true the false robbery scenario he and appellant had concocted, he orally recounted the same version of events to the Allegheny County police, who took notes summarizing his statement. These notes were disclosed to appellant prior to trial. Relying on these notes, appellant’s trial counsel cross-examined Graham at length regarding the “exculpatory” version of events he had given to police on the night of the incident. Given the cumulative nature of the late-disclosed evidence, it cannot plausibly be argued that the prosecution intentionally sought to suppress these materials in an effort to bait appellant into seeking a mistrial or to deprive appellant of a fair trial.</p>
    <p id="b528-6" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[270,1682,1158,687]]]'>In addition, as noted above, the trial prosecutor relied upon the <em>Bonacurso </em>line of cases from this Court, which held, consistent with the language of Rule 805, that the prosecutor is under no obligation to disclose evidence known only to the police and not the prosecution. Although <em>Kyles </em>makes clear that such is not the law respecting exculpatory information, the existence of the <em>Bonacurso </em>cases corroborates that there was an absence of prosecutorial overreaching here. The prosecutor’s explainable misunderstanding of her <em>Brady </em>obligation militates against the view that she deliberately failed to pursue and locate evidence known only to the police in an effort to provoke appellant into seeking a mistrial or to deprive appellant of a fair trial.</p>

      <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>Rather than prosecutorial misconduct, it appears that this case primarily involves miscommunication between the police departments involved in the investigation and/or police mishandling of the evidence. The materials were compiled by the Ohio Township police. The Allegheny County police, however, assumed jurisdiction over the investigation several hours after the incident. The prosecutor relied exclusively upon the Allegheny County police to supply her -with evidence responsive to the defense’s discovery requests. The prosecutor suggested that there may have been some confusion between the departments as to whether the Ohio Township police had, in fact, turned over the items in question to the Allegheny County police. It was also suggested that Graham’s handwritten statement may have been misfiled by the Allegheny County police in a file on an unrelated matter involving the Mardi Gras restaurant. Whatever may have been the reason for the nondisclosure here, it is apparent from the record that it did not result from deliberate misconduct by the prosecutor designed to compel appellant into moving for a mistrial or to deprive appellant of a fair trial.</p>
