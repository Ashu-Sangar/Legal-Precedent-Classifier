The Comment to the Rule reinforces that unambiguous meaning, while also making clear that the Rule was designed to effect a change in the law previously adopted in the Superior Court, and reflected in <em>Valley Peat. </em>We cannot simply ignore the language of the Rule, and the occasion for its existence, in favor of equities that appellees would prefer we balance.

Rule 1972(7) also permits, as a disposition without reaching the merits, a party to move to quash “for any other reasons on the record.” Quashal is not proper here. Clearly, a judgment of <em>non pros </em>dismissed with prejudice is a final, appealable order because it fully disposes of the case. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 341(b)(1) (“A final order is any order that: disposes of all claims and of all parties [.]”). Moreover, the appeal was timely filed, the Superior Court had jurisdiction over the appeal, and appellant does not articulate any other ground for quashal under Rule 1972(7). Accordingly, we conclude that quashal is inappropriate; the proper consequence of the failure to file a Rule 3051 petition is a waiver of the substantive claims that would be raised.</p>
