    <p id="b532-11" data-blocks='[["BL_532.10",532,[270,1006,1162,1165]]]'>Appellee John L. Thompson, who suffered work-related injuries while in the employ of appellant Craig Welding and Equipment Rental (“Craig”), received workers’ compensation and medical benefits through Craig and its workers’ compensation carrier, appellant USF &amp; G Company (“USF &amp; G”). Thompson also filed and settled mid-trial a product liability action against the entities who manufactured, distributed and/or owned the equipment on which he was injured. Following the settlement, appellants filed a Petition to Suspend Compensation and Enforce Subrogation Lien pursuant to § 319 of the Worker’s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 671. A workers’ compensation judge granted the petition and the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board affirmed, both adjudicative bodies finding that the statutory right of subrogation was absolute. A divided Commonwealth Court panel reversed in a published opinion, finding that the “equities” it perceived defeated the employer’s statutorily mandated right of subrogation. This Court granted review to consider the proper scope of the right of subrogation provided by § 319. For the reasons that follow, we vacate the order of the Commonwealth Court and remand for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>

Eleven days after the collapse, Craig conducted an inspection and tear-down of the Omni 60 to determine the cause of the accident. USF &amp; G retained an expert who was present during the inspection and tear-down. William Craig, owner of appellant Craig, a Craig employee, the owner of the crane, a representative of the manufacturer and appellee’s father were also present at the inspection. According to a report submitted by USF <em>&amp; </em>G’s expert, the design specifications of the aerial platform required that the tip boom’s chain anchor plate be secured by five bolts to the lower end of the scaffold boom. Three of the bolts with lock washers still attached had backed out of the plate and were found in the bottom of the housing. A fourth bolt was severed in two, and the fifth bolt was never found. The expert opined that the collapse resulted from four of the bolts working loose and the remaining bolt failing due to overload and fatigue cracking. When the inspection was concluded, William Craig took possession of the three undamaged bolts and the two damaged pieces and certified in a memorandum that he had possession of the bolts from the damaged Omni 60.</p>

Pettibone Texas Corporation subsequently was added as an additional defendant. The matter went to trial in November of 1993 at which time appellee called as a witness the USF <em>&amp; </em>G expert who attended the inspection and tear-down of the Omni 60. The expert testified that the tip boom collapsed because its chain anchor plate was attached to the crane by only one bolt which broke as a result of overload. He further testified that the three intact bolts found in the crane housing had backed out of the chain anchor plate either because they were not properly torqued during maintenance or because the manufacturer failed to anticipate that the Omni 60 would be subject to vibrations during normal use causing the bolts to back out on their own. The expert also stated that, if he had the bolts, he could compare them to the bolts required by the <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>design specifications and ascertain whether they were the correct grade of bolts, determine if they were the original bolts installed at the time of manufacture or replacement bolts installed by the owner, and could measure for any elongation in the bolts. By the time of trial some five years since the inspection of the platform, however, William Craig had inadvertently lost the bolts. No party had requested to inspect the bolts between the August 1988 inspection and the spring of 1993.</p>
    <p id="b534-5" data-blocks='[["BL_534.4",534,[264,812,1165,1430]]]'>On November 18, 1993, the third day of trial, the product liability defendants filed a motion in limine requesting that appellee be precluded from presenting any evidence of medical or indemnity benefits paid by USF &amp; G as workers’ compensation carrier for Craig as a sanction for appellee’s inability to produce the bolts at trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The trial court ruled that the loss of the bolts substantially deprived defendants of the ability to prepare a defense and granted the motion in limine. At the request of the trial court, counsel for USF &amp; G and Craig, who were not parties to the product liability action, were present at the time the motion in limine was argued and granted. The same day, appellee settled his product liability action for $300,000. The settlement was structured in a way that was obviously intended to defeat the employer’s subrogation right: specifically, $200,000 was apportioned to appellee John Thompson and designated as compensation for pain and suffering, while $100,000 was apportioned to his wife for loss of consortium. On February 2, 1994, the trial court entered an order approving the terms of the settlement, including the parties’ designation and allocation of the settlement funds. The court stated that the settlement was exclusive of all medical bills and lost wage payments because those claims were precluded by the court’s in limine ruling. The court also opined, gratuitously in light of the fact that the issue was not before it, that USF &amp; G’s “subrogation claim has been completely compromised by its insured’s destruction of vital evidence in the case.”</p>

The panel majority concluded that appellants were barred on “equitable grounds” from enforcing their statutory subrogation right. The majority analogized the situation to a personal injury claimant who inadvertently destroys or loses a defective product, noting that such a plaintiff “may be barred from recovering any damages from the alleged tortfeasor.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The majority <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>saw no reason why an employer and its compensation carrier who lose the defective product, as William Craig did here, should be entitled to what it viewed as “disparate treatment.” The majority also found that appellants’ failure to intervene in the product liability action to protect their subrogation interest, particularly after the trial court in that matter precluded evidence of lost wages and medical expenses in response to Craig having lost the bolts, was another factor weighing in favor of denying subrogation on “equitable” grounds. In reaching its decision, the majority distinguished <em>Winfree v.

The lower courts had denied the employer subrogation because it did not fully cooperate with the employee in the third party negligence action. In evaluating the equitable estoppel claim, this Court noted that the employer’s actions had to be viewed in the context of the negligence action, since the employer had been joined there as a third-party defendant. Since the employer and employee were in adversarial positions in that litigation, it was reasonable for the employer to be less than fully cooperative. Furthermore, we noted, acceptance of the estoppel argument would place the employer in the “dubious position of cooperating with its employee and running the risk of being found solely liable for vigorously pursuing its own exoneration and losing its subrogation rights.” Stating that we would not subject employers to this choice, we held that the statutory right of subrogation remained absolute under the circumstances of that case. <em><a href="/pa/520/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="520 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="1815600" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0392-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/520/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="520 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="1815600" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0392-01">at 399</a>, <a href="/pa/520/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="520 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="1815600" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0392-01">554 A.2d at 488</a>.</p>

When the General Assembly adopted subrogation as a statutory matter in the workers’ compensation <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>context, it provided for no equitable exceptions that would eliminate the employer’s subrogation right.

    <p id="b542-4" data-blocks='[["BL_542.4",542,[267,697,1164,1325]]]'>It is not difficult to see why the General Assembly might reach such a conclusion. The Workers’ Compensation Act balances competing interests. The Act obliges subscribing employers to provide compensation to injured employees, regardless of fault, either through insurance or self-insurance. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 501. In exchange, employers are vested with two important rights: the exclusivity of the remedy of worker’s compensation and the concomitant immunity from suit by an injured employee, <em>see </em>77 P.S. § 481; and the absolute right of subrogation respecting recovery from third-party tortfeasors who bear responsibility for the employee’s compensable injuries. <em>See Curtis, </em><a href="/f-supp/348/1062-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="348 F.

This leads to the conclusion that an employer who complies with its responsibilities under the Workers’ Compensation Act should not be deprived of one of the corresponding statutory benefits based upon a court’s <em>ad hoc </em>evaluation of other perceived “equities.” Had the General Assembly intended to introduce such uncertainty into an otherwise balanced and certain scheme of relative responsibility, it could have done so expressly or by use of less certain language.

Here, due to Craig: Welding’s loss of evidence vital to Claimant’s third-party action, the trial court determined that the defendant tortfeasors’ ability to prepare a defense was prejudiced.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Since Craig Welding’s spoliation of the evidence was the solé cause of the prejudice, the trial court ruled that Claimant was precluded from presenting any evidence regarding lost wages or medical bills<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>— damages to which Appellants would have a right of subrogation. Moreover, because Craig Welding’s conduct cost Claimant the opportunity to secure a substantially larger settlement or trial verdict, the trial court fashioned the parties’ settlement to preclude Appellants from subrogating any of the settlement proceeds by eliminating any recovery for lost wages or medical bills. Thus, the trial court provided equitable relief not only for the defendant tortfeasors by reducing their liability, but also for Claimant by taking into account his lost opportunity of securing a larger recovery.</p>
    <p id="b546-4" data-blocks='[["BL_546.4",546,[267,1284,1164,631]]]'>Despite the fact that Craig Welding’s conduct substantially reduced Claimant’s potential recovery at trial, the majority would nevertheless add insult to injury by allowing Claimant’s recovery to be further reduced by Appellants’ subrogation claim, which is approximately $105,000. The result of the majority’s decision is that all parties, with the exception of Claimant, benefit from Craig Welding’s conduct: Appellants benefit by receiving their full subrogation rights and the defendant tortfeasors benefited at trial since their liability was reduced by at least $113,000, if not substantially more. Claimant, however, is forced to suffer a loss of $105,000 through no fault of his own.</p>

      <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>Moreover, Appellants’ inaction at trial provides further support for precluding subrogation on equitable grounds. Although counsel for USF &amp; G and its claim personnel were present for both the argument regarding the lost evidence and the trial court’s ruling that barred Claimant’s recovery for lost wages and medical bills, counsel did not attempt to intervene or otherwise protect Appellants’ subrogation interest. Instead, counsel sat silently by while the trial court explicitly prevented Claimant from recovering any damages for lost wages or medical bills-the exact damages to which the majority finds Appellants have a right of subrogation.</p>

The circumstances of this case clearly show why equity principles should, as this Court has long held, continue to apply to subrogation claims under § 319.</p>

Claimant presented the testimony of an engineer who was hired by USF &amp; G to be present at the inspection of the crane in 1988. At the time of inspection, the engineer was of the opinion' that the accident was caused by bolts that had malfunctioned. At trial, due to Craig Welding's loss of the bolts, the engineer could not determine whether the bolts were original equipment on the crane or had been replaced post-manufacture. The engineer also could not determine whether the bolts failed due to their design or from improper maintenance.</p>
