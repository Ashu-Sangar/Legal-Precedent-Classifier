    <p id="b325-10" data-blocks='[["BL_325.10",325,[208,1441,1157,736]]]'>This matter arises from the medical malpractice action initiated by Loretta Mulligan, her husband Thomas Mulligan, and Mark Gurevitz against Dr. Severino Piczon and Community Medical Center for alleged negligence in performing orthopedic surgery. Dr. Piczon and Community Medical Center held primary professional liability coverage in the amount of $200,000.00 each. The CAT Fund provided malpractice coverage for both defendants pursuant to the Health Care Services Malpractice Act, Act of October 15,1975, P.L. 390, No. Ill, as amended, 40 P.S. § 1301.101 et seq. As participating health care providers in the CAT Fund, each was entitled to up to $1,000,000.00 of coverage under the Act.

On November 16, 1998, a status conference was held by telephone, and the matter was re-listed for conference on December 7, 1998.

On that date, Robert W. Waeger, the CAT Fund’s Deputy Director, sent a letter by facsimile to the trial court stating that the CAT Fund’s Office of Chief Counsel had made a number of efforts to locate authority that would support an order directing an employee of the CAT Fund to attend the trial. The letter further stated, “[t]herefore please accept this as notice that a <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>representative of the Fund will not be attending the trial of the Mulligan case, which is scheduled to begin on March 15, 1999.” The letter indicated that Jo Ann Dittman, a claims attorney who was an authorized CAT Fund representative, would be available by telephone. The CAT Fund did not file any motion or request seeking reconsideration of the trial court’s order or that the order be vacated.</p>
    <p id="b327-5" data-blocks='[["BL_327.4",327,[218,720,1151,259]]]'>On February 25,1999, the trial court issued a Rule to Show Cause why Waeger and Dittman should not be held in contempt for a violation of the attachment order by virtue of the letter of February 22, 1999.

    <p id="b327-6" data-blocks='[["BL_327.5",327,[216,1012,1156,579]]]'>On the day of the hearing, the CAT Fund filed a response to the rule to show cause entitled “Preliminary Objections of Non Parties to the Court’s Jurisdiction and Objection to Sua Sponte Rule to Show Cause Why a Contempt Citation Should Not Be Entered.” The CAT Fund asserted that the trial court did not have the authority to issue the attachment order because (1) it lacked jurisdiction over the CAT Fund and its representatives, (2) the trial had not begun, and (3) neither Pa. R.C.P. No. 212 nor the Lackawanna County local rules authorized the trial court to order attachment or to issue a contempt order.</p>

On March 12, 1999, the trial court entered an order making the rule absolute. The order provided that the CAT Fund would be subject to a fine of $1.00 per day for each day that a designated representative did not attend the trial of the malpractice action, commencing on March 15, 1999. The fine was to be made payable to the Lackawanna County Law Library. The order further stayed imposition of any fine pending appeal, while specifying that the other proceedings in the malpractice action were not stayed. The trial court also entered a separate order certifying that the order making the rule absolute involved a controlling question of law as to which there was substantial ground for difference of opinion and that <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>immediate appeal could materially advance the ultimate termination of the matter. 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b328-5" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[276,436,1159,778]]]'>On appeal, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the trial court’s order. The Commonwealth Court determined that a trial court has the authority to compel attendance of persons over whom it has personal jurisdiction at pre-trial settlement conferences.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> It further determined that a trial court may order attendance at other stages of the proceedings upon reasonable notice. The court noted that Lackawanna County R.C.P. No. 212 requires that the attorneys for each party appear at the pre-trial conference, and that, if the attorney does not have complete settlement authority, the party or a person with full settlement authority must accompany the attorney to the pre-trial conference or be available by telephone during the conference. The rule was found to authorize the trial court to exercise jurisdiction over non-parties, including the CAT Fund.</p>
    <p id="b328-6" data-blocks='[["BL_328.5",328,[276,1238,1159,462]]]'>The court found that the trial court’s jurisdiction necessarily extended into the trial phase in order to facilitate settlement during the course of the trial. The court reasoned that in the absence of a CAT Fund representative with full authority to settle the case, settlement negotiations would be frustrated. The court concluded that it was not an abuse of the trial court’s discretion to order a CAT Fund representative to be present at trial when the CAT Fund had exclusive control over the settlement negotiations.</p>

The CAT Fund asserts that it has been granted the power to evaluate a case and adjust a medical malpractice claim by the General Assembly, and that if the authority of the trial court is extended so that the CAT Fund can be punished for discharging its executive function, this would violate the separation of powers of the government branches.</p>

They assert that the common pleas courts have the power to order attendance of such persons or their designated representatives at pre-trial settlement conferences and other proceedings pursuant to their authority by the adoption of local rules and/or issuance of court orders with appropriate notice. Further, they contend that the separation of powers doctrine was not violated by the trial court’s attachment order, which was designed to effectuate a reasonable settlement, or by sanctioning the CAT Fund for a violation of the order.</p>

Thus, the CAT Fund appropriately acceded to the trial court’s reasonable and largely symbolic one-dollar per day fine, to be paid to the Lackawanna County Law Library, thereby clearing tech<a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>nical questions from the discussion in an effort to focus the Court on its core concern.
