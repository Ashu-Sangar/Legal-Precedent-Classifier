Nonetheless, the court found that these facts did not yield the conclusion that the FDA classification need not be disclosed to ensure informed consent. The Superior Court reasoned that the FDA’s Class III classification constitutes a conclusion by the FDA that the screws have at least unknown characteristics, which are clearly “risks”. Specifically, the Class III certification was a determination that there was insufficient evidence of safety and effectiveness to warrant FDA approval. Even if these unknown characteristics are not “risks”, the court continued, they nevertheless qualified as “facts” regarding the surgical procedure, which directly address the medical issues of a particular surgery. The court found that a reasonable person, if adequately informed, might opt for a more conventional FDA-approved mode of treatment, and concluded that at the least, an issue of fact remained for the jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The parties dispute the appropriate classification of the device at issue, the "TSRH System”. Appellees contend that the TSRH System was sold as a Class II device, but that this classification was specific to an intended use in long bones, such as tibias and femurs. Appellants claim that the TSRH System was a Class II device approved for use in the spine, specifically, the ilium and the sacrum, but never for use in <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>long bones. Appellants further claim that in Appellee’s case, four bone screws were utilized, bilaterally in the sacrum (S 1) and the lowest lumbar vertebrae (L 5), and thus the two lower screws would be considered a cleared Class II use by the FDA, while the two higher screws would be considered an "off-label" use. Despite this discrepancy, both parties indicate that when the screws were used in the pedicles of the portion of the spine at issue here, they were designated as a Class III device. Thus, for purposes of this opinion, we will refer to the bone screws as a Class III device. Parenthetically, we note that on July 27, 1998, nearly six years after Appellee’s surgery, the FDA classified certain previously unclassified pedicle screw spinal systems into Class II and reclassified other pedicle screw systems from Class III to Class II for certain intended uses. <em>See </em>Rules and Regulations, 63 Fed.Reg. 40025 (1998).</p>

Methodist Hospital, </em><a href="/f-supp/869/1202-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="869 F. Supp. 1202" data-case-ids="7849227" data-case-paths="/f-supp/869/1202-01">869 F.Supp. 1202</a> (E.D.Pa.1994), determined that the FDA regulatory status was relevant to an informed consent claim. The plaintiff's expert in <em>Corrigan </em>opined that the screws were “investigation<a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>al, meaning that they had not been proven to be safe and effective.” <em><a href="/f-supp/869/1202-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="869 F.

The court in <em>Corrigan </em>concluded that use of the screws in surgery was a surgical risk that a jury may find to be material. <em>Id. </em>n. 3. Like the courts in <em>Bone Screw Litigation, we </em>are not persuaded by the reasoning in <em>Corrigan.</em>

Coker, </em><a href="/sw2d/963/0726-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="963 S.W.2d 726" data-case-ids="11852539" data-case-paths="/sw2d/963/0726-01">963 S.W.2d 726</a> (Tenn.1998), the court addressed a statute of limitations issue, and adopted the appellant’s assertion that the use of bone screws was “experimental” without engaging in any meaningful analysis of that term. In <em>Retkwa v. Orentreich, </em><a href="/misc2d/154/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="154 Misc. 2d 164" data-case-ids="904897" data-case-paths="/misc2d/154/0164-01">154 Misc.2d 164</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=584%20N.Y.S.2d%20710" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="584 N.Y.S.2d 710">584 N.Y.S.2d 710</a> (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1992), the court determined in a conclusory manner that the FDA status of an unapproved injectable drug was relevant, analogizing to <em>Gaston, <a href="/ariz/121/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="121 Ariz. 33" data-case-ids="724904" data-case-paths="/ariz/121/0033-01">supra,</a> </em>which involved a clinical investigation. The court in <em>Stover v. Ass’n of Thoracic &amp; Cardiovascular Surgeons, </em><a href="/pa-super/431/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="431 Pa.

Finally, <em>Cosom v. Marcotte, </em><a href="/a2d/760/0886-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="760 A.2d 886" data-case-ids="11188730" data-case-paths="/a2d/760/0886-01">760 A.2d 886</a> (Pa.Super.2000), followed the Superior Court’s reasoning in <em>Southard, </em>which we reject today.</p>
