On February 12, 1990, appellee Zoning Hearing Board of Hazel Township (“Board”) granted a special exception to the School District for the construction of a senior high school in an area zoned residential. On February 15, 1993, the Board granted variances and accessory uses for the construction of adjacent athletic fields and tennis courts. In <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>granting the variances, the Board placed certain restrictions on the design of the fields to minimize their impact on the surrounding area, including requiring that no exterior lighting be installed, trees be planted to screen a neighboring property, no lavatory facilities be built, no dugouts and scoreboards be constructed on the ball fields, and the fields not be utilized for football practice.</p>
    <p id="b293-4" data-blocks='[["BL_293.4",293,[211,715,1152,744]]]'>On April 4, 1994, the School District submitted an application to the Board seeking a waiver of some of the restrictions in the February 15, 1993 variance order. Specifically, the School District sought to add certain amenities to its baseball field, including dugouts, water fountains, a scoreboard and a backstop. At a hearing, neighbors expressed concern with the proposal. In response to these concerns, a School District official stated that the baseball field would only be used for school-related purposes. The Board granted the request on April 25,1994, but limited the use of the baseball field to team practice and interscholastic competition. The order stated: “Upon approved completion of the aforementioned structures and dimensions, it is understood that the baseball field can then be used for practice and interscholastic competition.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The proposal would allow the School Board to rent the field to an unspecified number of organizations for baseball games and practices that could start in the afternoon and continue until dark.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Again, certain of the neighbors raised concerns with the proposal. After a <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>public hearing, the Board denied the request. The Board specifically found that residential structures and properties adjacent to the athletic field would be adversely affected by the proposed expanded use. The Board also noted that the School District had failed to submit guidelines to the Board concerning the management of traffic levels, availability of parking spaces and bathroom facilities, and provision of security services at the field.</p>

The School District likens its power regarding use of its facilities to its power to determine the location of school buildings — a power which, it argues, this Court has recognized cannot be limited by local zoning or land use restrictions. <em>See, e.g., School Dist. of Philadelphia v.

The permissive authority under § 7-775, at best, is related to its maintenance and control of its properties — not its core educational function. This is not to say that the permissive power is unimportant: § 7-775 permits the School District to make constructive use of its facilities when those facilities would otherwise sit idle. The incidental power granted, however, cannot be exercised at the expense of the health, safety and general welfare of the community in which a particular school is located. To hold otherwise would allow ball fields normally precluded from being built at all because of adverse neighborhood effects to be built and then used for non-school functions merely because the school district is the owner. At least in the manner in which the School District’s challenge has been preserved here, the local regulation at issue reserves entirely to the School District the power to control its property for school-related-activities. To conclude that the School District has <em>carte blanche </em>respecting non-school-related activities, with no obligation to exercise the same diligence as the zoning hearing board to consider the health, safety and general welfare of the community, is not a legitimate interpretation of the Public School Code.</p>

      <p id="b300-7" data-blocks='[["BL_300.7",300,[266,1878,1155,468]]]'>. The Commonwealth Court employed similar reasoning in <em>Skepton, <a href="/citations/?q=486%20A.2d%201022" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="486 A.2d 1022">supra</a> </em>— a case it relied upon in deciding this appeal. In <em>Skepton, </em>the appellant contractor began renovation of one of the school district's facilities without a borough permit. The borough sought to prohibit the continuation of the work. Skepton argued that the Fire and Panic Act, 35 P.S. §§ 1221 <em>et seq., </em>the Public School Code of 1949, 24 P.S. §§ 1-101 <em>et seq., </em>and the Administrative Code of 1929, 71 P.S. §§ 51-732, preempted local regulation of school construction. The court rejected Skepton’s arguments, holding that "since the [Department of Education’s] regulations and the borough’s building code regulate predominately different concerns of school building construction, state and local powers are not in actual, material conflict.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=486%20A.2d%201022" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="486 A.2d 1022">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=486%20A.2d%201022" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="486 A.2d 1022">at 1025</a>.</p>
