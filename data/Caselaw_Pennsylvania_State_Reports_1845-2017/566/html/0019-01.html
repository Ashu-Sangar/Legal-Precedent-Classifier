He drove to a pay phone and called her and asked if he could come over to see her. Omatick declined, telling him that she was tired and was going back to sleep. Appellant continued to drive around the area of Omatick’s apartment, ultimately deciding to get out of the car and approach the apartment to “see what was going on there.” (N.T., 8/6/97, at 424.) As Appellant got out of the car, he retrieved a .40 caliber handgun. Upon approaching the apartment, he heard what he believed to be Omatick and a man engaged in sexual relations. At that point, according to Appellant, he “just snapped.” (N.T., 8/6/97, at 425.) He forced his way into the apartment and fatally shot Omatick, who was naked, as she came down the stairs. Appellant proceeded upstairs toward the bedroom, fired a shot through the bedroom door, kicked open the door, and fatally shot Pistininzi. Appellant drove to his father’s home where he called 911 and reported the crimes. The state police arrived and transported Appellant to the police barracks were he subsequently gave a statement detailing the crimes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Appellant contended that he was guilty only of voluntary manslaughter because he acted in the heat of passion after hearing what he believed to be Omatick engaged in sexual relations with another man. The jury nonetheless convicted Appellant of two counts of first-degree murder and Appellant was subsequently sentenced to two consecutive life sentences.

      <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>Here, White’s testimony contained double hearsay because it relayed Appellant’s out-of-court statement through Omatick’s out-of-court statement.

The so-called provocation consisted of the fact that, as he was trespassing upon Ms. Omatick’s porch in the middle of the night, the armed appellant heard sounds which convinced him that Ms. Omatick <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>and Mr. Pistininzi were having sexual relations inside her residence.

The Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence (and the corresponding Federal Rules of Evidence), which will apply at the retrial ordered by the majority, specifically recognize that a party forfeits any hearsay objection to the out-of-court statement of an unavailable witness where, as here, the party’s own misconduct caused the witness’s unavailability.

To the contrary, a fair inference arising from Ms. Omatick’s statement that appellant had told her that he would kill her if he caught her with another man was that, in Ms. Omatick’s eyes at least, her broken relationship with appellant was troubled and did not end amicably. This fact, in turn, was relevant to suggest that these were not heat of passion killings, as appellant claimed in retrospect, but killings that were motivated by a long-simmering and deep-seated malice and ill-will arising from appellant’s jealous refusal to accept the termination of his relationship with Ms. Omatick.

The only question raised in defense was whether the victims “seriously provoked” appellant in a legally relevant way such that the killings could be deemed to have been the product of a “sudden and intense passion.” In my view, as a matter of law, the victims did nothing that could quality by any stretch of the imagination as legal provocation. The alleged act of “provocation” arises from appellant’s claim that he heard sounds that led him to believe that Ms. Omatick was having sexual relations with another man. Of course, appellant heard these sounds only after “sneaking up” uninvited to Ms. Omatick’s residence in the middle of the night, and eavesdropping from her porch, while wielding a loaded semi-automatic handgun. Furthermore, appellant placed himself in that position only after Ms. Omatick had told him over the phone that she did not wish to see him that evening. At the time appellant “snuck up” on Ms. Omatick, the two were no longer paramours and were no longer living together; nor was there any cognizable legal connection between them.</p>

Indeed, the only provocation here arose from appellant’s conduct. This is not a case where a defendant walks into his own bedroom, for example, only to be surprised to find his wife with another man. Appellant had no “right” to be where he was when he heard the “provoking” sounds. Nor did appellant suddenly stumble upon the alleged provocation; rather, his actions in the middle of this night amounted to stalking his former paramour. Furthermore, the fact that appellant brought a loaded semi-automatic handgun with him heavily suggests, not that he “stumbled upon” upon a provoking act, but rather that he was aggressively seeking a confrontation, one that he was fully prepared to handle with deadly force.

In my view, it is misconduct the type of which operates to waive or forfeit any confrontation/hearsay-based objection to relevant, out-of-court statements the victim made before appellant killed her. There is something deeply offensive about the notion that one can murder another and then object to admission of the victim’s statements on the ground that the witness is “unavailable” for confrontation at trial. Appellant already had his confrontation with the victims; he selected his .40 caliber semi-automatic as the arbiter of his dispute. In light of these circumstances, I would hold that Ms. Omatick’s relevant statement was admissible for the truth of the matter asserted, and not merely as evidence of her state of mind. Thus, I would affirm the trial court’s ruling on this additional, distinct ground. That appellant received a windfall in the <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>statement being admitted for a more narrow purpose certainly does not entitle him to relief.</p>
    <p id="b150-5" data-blocks='[["BL_150.4",150,[268,437,1164,905]]]'>Finally, I would note that, after the trial in this matter, this Court embraced the concept of forfeiture of confrontation by wrongdoing when it adopted Rules of Evidence, which included <em>verbatim </em>the “Forfeiture by Wrongdoing” exception to hearsay contained in Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(6). Thus, the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence now state, as an exception to the hearsay rule, the constitutional waiver doctrine described above. Pa.R.Evid. 804(b)(6) provides that, “[a] statement offered against a party that has engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness” is not excludable on hearsay grounds. This Rule, which became effective October 1, 1998, will be available at the retrial the majority now orders. That the statement upon which the majority grants relief should be admissible upon retrial for a broader, relevant purpose further demonstrates the error in the majority opinion reversing and precipitously granting a new trial.</p>
