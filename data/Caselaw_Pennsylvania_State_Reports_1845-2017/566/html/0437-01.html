Appellants Mark A. Criss and Kathryn J.

Appellee contended that she had acted reasonably by mailing the notice of appeal with the U.S. Postal Service in Pittsburgh on December 22, 1998, which, according <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>to Appellee, allowed sufficient time for the notice of appeal to be delivered to the Prothonotary, only thirty miles away, by December 28, 1998. Therefore, Appellee argued that she should not be precluded from appealing from the arbitration award because of the unforeseeable delay in the mail service. Appellants claimed, however, that Appellee had acted negligently by mailing the notice of appeal on December 22nd because she should have known that the U.S. Postal Service delivers mail slower during the holiday season and consequently, that the notice of appeal would not have been delivered to the Prothonotary by December 28th.</p>

Furthermore, the Superior Court advised the trial court that if it found that Appellee had mailed the notice of appeal within sufficient time for the notice to arrive at the Prothonotary’s office by December 28,1998, it should grant Appellee’s Motion for Leave.

Pa.R.C.P. 1308. Unlike the Rules of Appellate Procedure, which in certain instances <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>specify that filings can be deemed filed on the date they are deposited in the U.S. Mail, the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure do not so provide. In fact, Rule of Civil Procedure 205.1 specifically provides that “[a] paper sent by mail shall not be deemed filed until received by the appropriate officer.” Pa.R.C.P. 205.1. Moreover, appellate courts do not have the authority to enlarge the time for filing a notice of appeal. Pa.R.A.P. 105. Therefore, as Rule 1308 now stands, for an appeal from an arbitration award to be deemed timely filed, the prothonotary of the court where the action is pending <em>must receive </em>a notice of appeal within thirty days from the date the prothonotary notes on the docket that the arbitration award has been entered and the parties have been notified of the award.</p>

Therefore, the <em>Bass </em>Court expanded the limited exceptions for allowing an appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to permit such an appeal where the appellant proves that: (1) the appellant’s notice of appeal was filed late as a result of non-negligent circumstances, either as they relate to the appellant or the appellant’s counsel; (2) the appellant filed the notice of appeal shortly after the expiration date; and (3) the appellee was not prejudiced by the delay. <em>See id. </em>at 1135-36 (allowing appel<a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>lant to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>where appeal was filed four days late because appellant’s attorney placed the notice of appeal on the desk of the secretary responsible for ensuring that appeals were timely filed and the secretary became ill and left work, not returning until after the expiration of the period for filing an appeal); <em>see also Cook v.
