We vacate the post-conviction court’s order and remand for further proceedings. <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>On April 3,1987, Appellant Craig Williams (“Williams”) shot and killed Gordon Russell, a pedestrian who was returning from a grocery store. In Williams’ ensuing prosecution for first-degree murder and related offenses, the Commonwealth’s theory of the case was that the bullet was a stray one that had been aimed at Erica Riggins, a woman who previously had fought with Jean Hargrove, Williams’ pregnant girlfriend. In the guilt phase defense, trial counsel presented testimony from several witnesses who claimed that the fatal shot was fired by Ms. Riggins; however, the testimony of such witnesses was conflicting, manifested internal inconsistencies, and found little support in the physical evidence. At the penalty phase of trial, the parties stipulated to Williams’ three prior felony convictions. Based on such stipulation and the trial record, the Commonwealth proceeded upon the aggravating circumstances of a significant history of felony convictions involving use or threat of violence, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9), and creation of grave risk to others, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7). Williams offered testimony from three witnesses in mitigation: his mother, Jean Hargrove, and Christine Williams, a nurse who had cared for Williams as he recovered from a surgery. The jury found the grave risk aggravator and no mitigating circumstances and sentenced Williams to death, following which the trial court denied post-trial motions. Substitute counsel was appointed for purposes of perfecting an appeal.</p>

The petition contained a lengthy recitation of facts designed to portray trial counsel as ineffective in failing to prepare adequately for both the guilt and penalty phases of trial. The petition asserted that trial counsel waived valid objections; called witnesses without previously having interviewed them; put forward a jumbled and inconsistent defense; failed to make arguments predicated upon the evidence in support of a lesser degree of guilt; began assembling a penalty phase presentation on the eve of the guilt verdict; and put forward a truncated and inadequate presentation of mitigating circumstances to the sentencing jury. Williams offered to establish that trial counsel pressured Jean Hargrove and Erica Riggins to pay legal fees for Williams’ defense, withheld legal services for reasons related to compensation, and labored under a conflict of interest by virtue of his acceptance of legal fees from actual and prospective witnesses. Further, Williams contended that trial counsel failed to develop substantial, available mitigating evidence in the form of circumstances surrounding the offense, including distress and confusion on the part of Williams concerning the altercation between Jean Hargrove and Erica Riggins; undeveloped family history; and attention deficit disorder, impulsiveness, and brain damage constituting an extreme mental or emotional disturbance. Additionally, in the amended petition, Williams asserted that the Commonwealth violated Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 352 by failing to notify Williams in writing of the existence of aggravating circumstances; the trial court improperly instructed the jurors that they must unanimously find mitigating circumstances contrary to <em>Mills v. Maryland, </em><a href="/us/486/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="486 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="6217594" data-case-paths="/us/486/0367-01">486 U.S. 367</a>, <a href="/us/486/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="486 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="6217594" data-case-paths="/us/486/0367-01">108 S.Ct. 1860</a>, <a href="/us/486/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="486 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="6217594" data-case-paths="/us/486/0367-01">100 L.Ed.2d 384</a> (1988); trial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek a proper jury instruction in this regard; trial counsel was ineffective at <em>voir dire </em>in failing to ask venirepersons whether they viewed a first degree murder verdict as automatically requiring a sentence of death; and trial counsel was ineffective for failing to preserve issues related to the racial composition of the jury, <em>see Batson v.

Finally, Williams sought leave of court to file supplemental pleadings, affidavits, and memoranda in support of his eligibility for post-conviction relief.</p>
    <p id="b669-4" data-blocks='[["BL_669.4",669,[208,725,1152,1013]]]'>In response to the amended petition, the Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss, asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>prejudicial delay in the assertion of the alleged conflict of interest on the part of trial counsel, particularly in view of trial counsel’s death; a failure on Williams’ part to proffer evidence by way of affidavit or otherwise which would establish such conflict; previous litigation of claims of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness in the penalty phase of trial; the absence of an affidavit of an expert witness to support the claim of ineffectiveness in failing to present mental health evidence in mitigation; the validity of the jury instructions challenged under <em>Mills; </em>the absence of any requirement of notice of aggravating circumstances at the time of Williams’ trial; the absence of any requirement for life qualification of venirepersons; and the trial court’s acceptance of reasons offered by the district attorney for peremptory challenges exercised.

In addition to appointed PCRA counsel, an attorney for the former Center for Legal Education, Advocacy and Defense Assistance (“CLEADA”) appeared and asserted that he had been authorized to act as co-counsel for Williams; however, the PCRA court declined to recognize such representation. After argument, the PCRA court announced its intention to dismiss the petition and subsequently issued formal notice of such intention pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 1509(C)(1), identifying as the reason for dismissal <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>that “[t]he issues raised in the PCRA Petition filed by your attorney are without merit.”</p>

The eight affiants included Williams’ father, mother, brother, and sister; a childhood friend; Jean Hargrove; Erica Riggins; and Dr. Henry Dee, a licensed psychologist and neuropsychologist. The general tenor of the documents was in support of central averments of the amended petition. Several of the affidavits bolstered Williams’ post-conviction description of the course of events surrounding the killing of Mr. Russell, emphasizing, in particular, that Williams was distraught and confused by the altercations between Hargrove and Riggins and set out at most to frighten Riggins by initiating the gunfire that resulted in Mr. Russell’s death. Most of the affiants provided statements indicating that Williams was of good character but suffered from a traumatic childhood, aggravated by an alcoholic, abusive father. Various affiants described episodes involving head injuries to Williams and stated that Williams manifested persistent difficulties with distraction and control over his emotions. The affidavit and report of Dr. Dee indicated that Williams suffers from organic cerebral impairment and undermined intellectual and social functioning “of a long-standing nature,” which was related to Williams’ offense in terms of his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct and mitigating factors involving major mental health illness. The affidavits of Jean Hargrove and Erica Riggins contain assertions that the affiants made substantial payments to trial counsel; that trial counsel failed to speak with witnesses about the case; and, in general, that trial counsel pursued a course of withholding legal services as a means to obtain compensation. In Ms. Riggins’ affidavit, she also asserted that she appeared at the time of trial hoping to testify in support of the defense, but, at the direction of the assistant district attorney prosecuting the case, was restrained from entering the courtroom or approaching trial counsel. Most of the affiants indicated that they had not been contacted, interviewed at any length, and/or prepared for trial testi<a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>mony by trial counsel.

In his concurring opinion, Mr. Justice Castille criticizes affordance of any latitude in terms of the detail in description of appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness in the post-conviction setting. We recognize, however, that the difficulty facing post-conviction counsel is that claims of appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness are generally derivative claims, predicated on the failure to raise and preserve an asserted instance of trial error or ineffectiveness on the part of trial counsel. Therefore, a primary avenue of proving appellate counsel’s lack of stewardship frequently lies in establishing the strength and obviousness of the underlying claim. Thus, it is not surprising that post-conviction appellate briefs often devote primary focus to development of the underlying claim. This may be particularly the case where the petitioner has not been afforded a post-conviction hearing and thus has not had the opportunity to develop the claim of appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness by exploring on the record counsel's reasons for failing to raise and preserve the underlying claim.</p>

The requirement that parties actually argue and develop the distinct legal claims they merely identify is not a “hypertechnicality”: it is an indispensable necessity for effective appellate review. The Rules of Appellate Procedure direct that a party must not only include its issues on appeal in the Statement of Questions Involved, Pa.R.A.P. 2111, 2116, but must also provide an argument as to each question, which should include a discussion and citation of pertinent authorities. Pa.R.A.P. 2119. The reasons for such a bedrock requirement are self-evident. This Court is neither obliged, nor even particularly equipped, to develop an argument for a party. To do so places the Court in the conflicting roles of advocate and neutral arbiter. The Court is left to guess at the actual complaint that is intended by the party. The practice of fashioning arguments for a party is also unfair to the would-be responding party, which will only learn upon receipt of the Opinion that the Court perceived the argument, and thus will have been deprived of an opportunity to respond. The result is a decision on the issue without the benefit of helpful advocacy from either side. This is not a model for sound decision-making.</p>

This Court has declined to apply the rule in many instances, often involving situations where the failure to raise a claim below might have fallen within the realm of defense trial strategy, or when the absence of a contemporaneous objection made it difficult to resolve the issue on the limited record presented. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

In my view, in order to avoid a finding of waiver, the appellant’s discussion section must not only address each prong of the ineffectiveness standard as it relates to trial counsel but must, at the very least, include a properly-layered assertion that all prior appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to raise trial counsel’s ineffectiveness.</p>
