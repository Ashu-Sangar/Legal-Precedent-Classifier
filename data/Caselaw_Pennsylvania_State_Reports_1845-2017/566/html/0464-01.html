On their faces these cases seemingly support the proposition that when an insured knows of an insurable harm incurred prior to the purchase of an insurance policy, the insured has suffered a “known loss” and the damage is no longer a mere risk and is deemed uninsurable. However, these cases are distinguishable from the matter sub judice given that in both <em>Smith </em>and <em>Judge </em>the courts were confronted with insureds who had given less than candid answers to explicit and specific questions on their insurance applications. In the present case, appellants were never explicitly asked whether a pollution problem existed and never volunteered such information. <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>Nonetheless, this distinction is one of little moment, particularly where, as here, we are presented with a sophisticated insured, possessed of its own experienced legal and insurance departments, “faced with mounting evidence that it will likely incur responsibilities to the extent of the insurance which is sought.” <em>Rohm and Haas, supra </em>at 1258.

The fraud defense is subject to a settled, exacting standard befitting a doctrine that would undo the actual agreement between the parties because of wrongdoing by one of the parties. The insurer must prove by clear and convincing evidence: (1) a fraudulent misrepresentation, (2) made with a “deliberate intent to deceive,” and (3) which is material to the risk contractually assumed by the insurer. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 1179. Although the only principled basis for a known loss defense is a similar concern with fraud, the Superior Court construction of it, approved by the majority here, is far less exacting. This novel formulation apparently would not be subject to the clear and convincing evidence standard of fraud, nor would it require a misrepresentation made with a deliberate intent to deceive. Instead, the standard, such as it is, is one of multiple laxity: The insurer need <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>merely “show” (assumedly by a preponderance of the evidence) that the insured “was charged with knowledge” that “reasonably shows” that the insured “was or should have been aware” of a mere “likely exposure” to losses that would reach the level of coverage. There is no requirement under this formulation that the insured have knowledge of an existing legal liability to a third party, which is the actual risk being insured against in this sort of coverage. Instead, the majority focuses on mere “losses,” and then requires only a “likelihood” of exposure to the level of coverage. The majority does not explain why it embraces these multiple vacillations to undo the parties’ agreement, rather than reasoning from our actual experience with fraud cases in the insurance area.</p>
    <p id="b594-4" data-blocks='[["BL_594.4",594,[267,1033,1167,1334]]]'>Appellants accurately argue that the formulation of the known loss doctrine embraced by the majority simply “bypasses” the fraud standard, permitting a forfeiture of coverage pursuant to a lesser standard of proof, and “without proof of a false statement or statement made in bad faith, an intent to deceive, or detrimental reliance.” Brief of Appellants, 29. Appellants further accurately note that the majority’s new rule is contrary to the well-established law and policy in this Commonwealth, which disfavors rules of general application that result in the forfeiture of insurance coverage. <em>See, e.g., Brakeman v. Potomac Ins.

Appellants also argue that this formulation is “unprecedented” in Pennsylvania (as it certainly is), and is far out of step with decisions of other courts nationwide (as it most certainly is). When such an unprecedented new doctrine resulting in a forfeiture of coverage is applied retroactively, as the majority does here, appellants rightly note that it “strike[s] at the heart of the settled expectations under many existing third-party liability insurance contracts in the Commonwealth.”, Brief of Appellants, 29-30. The majority does not address these legitimate concerns. The Court should come to terms with these ably argued realities and, at a minimum, make some attempt to justify the néw course, before approving such a radical change in the law and applying it retroactively to the insurance agreements in this case.</p>

Since the defense sounds in the same sort of misconduct/misrepresentation as fraud, and also involves a forfeiture of a contractual right by judicial intervention, I believe it should be evaluated similarly, including its being subject to a clear and convincing evidence standard of proof. With respect to the elements of the defense, I would require that the undisclosed knowledge that triggers the defense should consist of actual (not imputed) knowledge of the existing legal liability, which is the subject of the later claim for indemnification — here, the liability retroactively arising after CERCLA’s enactment. It is this legal liability which is the risk of loss being insured against; thus, it is only a nondisclosure as to this existing loss that could be said to amount to a material misrepresentation.</p>

It is that very risk of loss, of varying degrees of likelihood, which creates the market for this insurance in the first place. And the insurer, a powerful and sophisticated party, well knows that. The peril being insured against by the policies here was not the certain arsenic damage at the Whitmoyer site, but rather the attenuated risk of third party legal liability — here for government-ordered remediation of the contamination — later arising <em>ex-post facto </em>from that pollution. That loss, and its catastrophic extent, was not at all “known” or knowable at the time these policies were issued.

Although it is unclear whether the environmental contamination, which was of public record, was specifically relayed to the excess carriers, it was indisputably not hidden by appellants. At the times appellants secured their excess coverage — with appellants failing to volunteer the fact of contamination and their insurers failing to ask about or condition the issuance of the policies upon the absence of contamination — appellants were not faced with any actual lawsuits or other existing bases of liability that threatened to trigger the various excess insurance policies. Nor was there any evidence to suggest that appellants had actual knowledge or “could be charged with knowledge” that the pollution they discovered was at that time remotely likely to result in third party liability that would exhaust their primary insurance coverage and trigger their various and escalating excess comprehensive liability policies. In point of fact, throughout appellants’ ownership of the facility, no claim arose from the arsenic contamination to trigger the excess coverage.

The costly environmental remediation loss here was not something that existed all along, known to and undisclosed by appellants, and then sprung upon their sophisticated, but understandably unsuspecting, insurers. Instead, the controlling fact is one that the majority inexplicably deems to be irrelevant: the unforeseeable passage, years later, of CERCLA. It was CERCLA’s strict liability provisions and its retroactive application alone that created the liability for which appellants sought coverage. The passage and effect of CERCLA was <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>not known or knowable to appellants any more than it was to their insurers.

Unlike the majority, I would not casually adopt, and retroactively apply, an extra-contractual judicial doctrine that would fault appellants in retrospect for failing to foresee the passage and unprecedented implications of CERCLA.

The insurer is fully equipped to protect its own interests in the application process. I would not use the imprimatur of the judiciary to absolve an insurer for its failure to adequately protect its interests.</p>
    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[218,1252,1152,523]]]'>In any event, even if I could agree with the majority’s new requirement that insureds in this Commonwealth are now required to speculate as to what their insurers might someday claim is material, and then volunteer information relevant to those speculations, I would still hold that appellants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the fraud defense. In my view, the proof here does not support a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the failure to volunteer here concerned “material” information or was motivated by a “deliberate, fraudulent intent to deceive.”</p>

Furthermore, the circumstantial evidence belied any claim of intent to deceive. Without external prompting, Rohm and Haas immediately disclosed the existence of the Whitmoyer contamination to Commonwealth authorities (who promptly made it public), to <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>its neighbors, to its primary insurer and to its insurance broker who arranged the excess coverage with appellees. The fact that their primary insurer did not reject coverage after the disclosure is objective proof that appellants had no reason to believe that the fact of pollution was material to issuance of the excess coverage. Nor did appellants ever fail to answer accurately any question actually posed by their insurers respecting the facility; the insurers simply failed to ask. This objective evidence hardly constitutes conduct warranting a jury finding of clear and convincing evidence of an intent to deceive.</p>
    <p id="b602-4" data-blocks='[["BL_602.4",602,[266,925,1164,1165]]]'>Furthermore, in my view, any accurate assessment of appellants’ alleged intent to deceive must account for the change that CERCLA wrought in the liability scheme for environmental contamination. If CERCLA had existed in 1965, the failure to volunteer information of the contamination would be exponentially more suspicious — but still less suspicious than would be a failure of the insurers even to inquire into the existence of such pollution. But CERCLA did not then exist. It is also a fact that, throughout the period when appellants were purchasing and increasing their excess general liability policies, they were never faced with any non- or pre-CERCLA claim that remotely implicated their excess coverage. It is also a fact that, at the time the insurers issued these policies, they were not concerned enough with environmental contamination as a possible basis for third-party liability as to make specific inquiries into the existence of environmental pollution. The indisputable landscape existing at the times the policies were issued, as contrasted with the abrupt change in the risk of liability occasioned by passage and application of CERCLA, are further objective facts, unaccounted for in the majority opinion, that preclude any finding of an intent to deceive the insurers as to any material fact.</p>

    <p id="b603-5" data-blocks='[["BL_603.5",603,[222,538,1153,475]]]'>Finally, the majority finds that the trial court erred in directing a verdict on the insurers’ late notice defense. The majority states that twenty-four years elapsed between the acquisition of Whitmoyer and appellants’ claim for coverage and that there was sufficient evidence of prejudice resulting from this delay (in that certain potential witnesses had died, memories had likely dimmed, and relevant documents allegedly had been lost or destroyed) as to warrant its presentation to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b603-6" data-blocks='[["BL_603.6",603,[221,1046,1155,196]]]'>In my view, the majority’s analysis in this regard is flawed because, once again, it fails to account for the importance of CERCLA. The specific contractual notice clause at issue reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b603-7" data-blocks='[["BL_603.7",603,[264,1276,1113,258]]]'>Notification of Claims — The Assured upon knowledge of any occurrence likely to give rise to a claim hereunder shall give immediate written advice thereof to the person(s) or firm named for the purpose in the Schedule.

    <p id="b603-8" data-blocks='[["BL_603.8",603,[220,1565,1157,796]]]'>The majority’s focus upon the contamination, as opposed to the prospect of third party liability, which was the actual risk being insured against, betrays the same misapprehension of the policies that renders its known loss analysis flawed. The mere fact of contamination did not ineluctably suggest that there would be a third party liability claim at all, much less a claim that was likely to reach the excess policies. In point of fact, there was no prospect of a claim under the policy until after 1986 at the very earliest, which is when the EPA notified appellants that they were potentially responsible parties for the costs associated with a cleanup at the site, under the retroactive application of the strict liability provisions of CERCLA. Before that time, there was no basis to conclude that there was likely to be a claim that would reach the excess policies.</p>

The inquiry into "known losses," for purposes of excess third party liability coverage, hardly encompassed an inquiry into whether there was then mere environmental pollution at any of appellants’ facilities.</p>
