The release executed in <em>Charles </em>merely provided that the plaintiffs recovery was limited by the <em>pro rata </em>share of Giant Eagle’s liability, and did not contain language similar to that voluntarily adopted by Appellant in the instant case. Here, in contrast to <em>Charles, </em>the clear and unambiguous language of the Release specifically provided that Appellees, the non-settling defendants, were to obtain the benefit of the Release.

Appellant signed the Release, the terms of which the trial court carried out precisely. While Appellant may not have contemplated the final result when she executed the Release, it is clear that in the absence of fraud, accident or <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>mutual mistake, the verdict was properly molded in accordance with the Release. Based on the plain meaning of the language in the Release, we hold that Appellees were entitled to invoke the Release provision that reduced Appellant’s recovery by the greater of the consideration paid by CDC for the release or CDC’s <em>pro rata </em>share of fault. Accordingly, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>
