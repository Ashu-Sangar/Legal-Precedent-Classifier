The order clearly involves a controlling question of law — whether Appellee is entitled to the Comironwealth’s records, including potentially privileged material, regarding jury selection in Appellee’s murder trial. Moreover, as evidenced by the respective arguments of the parties and the lack of Pennsylvania case law on this issue, there is a substantial ground for a difference of opinion regarding this issue.

In addition, a claim that counsel was ineffective must be made at the earliest stage at which the defendant is no longer represented by counsel who was allegedly ineffective. <em>Commonwealth v. Chmiel, </em><a href="/pa/536/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="536 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="1843135" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0244-01">536 Pa. 244</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="639 A.2d 9" data-case-ids="1843135,7858443" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0244-01,/a2d/639/0009-01">639 A.2d 9</a>, 12 (1994). Here, Appellee represented himself <em>pro se </em>at. a post-trial ineffectiveness evidentiary hearing. Thus, Appellee had to raise trial counsel’s ineffectiveness at that hearing in order to preserve the claim. Appellee, however, did not do so. Thus, any claim that trial counsel was ineffective would have been waived because Appellee cannot claim his own ineffectiveness for not arguing trial counsel's alleged ineffectiveness. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Auker, </em><a href="/pa/545/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="545 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="465173" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0521-01">545 Pa. 521</a>, <a href="/pa/545/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="681 A.2d 1305" data-case-ids="465173,7867898" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0521-01,/a2d/681/1305-01">681 A.2d 1305</a>, 1319 (1996)(a defendant may not claim his own ineffectiveness).</p>
