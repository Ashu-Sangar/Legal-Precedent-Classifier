    <p id="b160-9" data-blocks='[["BL_160.8",160,[274,833,1159,634]]]'>This is a direct appeal from the sentence of death imposed upon Paul Rizzuto, (hereinafter “Appellant”) by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. The sentence of death followed Appellant’s conviction of murder in the first-degree for the killing of his 79-year-old neighbor, Mary Laurenzi. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has jurisdiction over direct appeals in cases where the penalty of death is imposed. 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 722(4) and 9711(h)(1). After due consideration, and for the reasons that follow, we now affirm the conviction for first-degree murder and vacate the sentence of death, remanding this matter to the trial court for a new penalty hearing.</p>
    <p id="b160-10" data-blocks='[["BL_160.9",160,[270,1506,1161,844]]]'>A discussion of the factual background leading to Appellant’s conviction follows. At approximately 5:45 p.m. on January 3,1994, the Philadelphia Police responded to a call, placed by Appellant, concerning an elderly woman who had been injured in her home. Upon arriving at the home of Mary Laurenzi, the officers discovered Mrs. Laurenzi lying on her kitchen floor bleeding from a severe head wound. Investigating the assault on Mrs. Laurenzi, the police discovered no signs of forced entry into the house, nor any weapon consistent with the nature of the injury. There were no signs of disarray indicative of a burglary. As Mrs. Laurenzi was unable to speak, she offered no insight into what had occurred. Mrs. Laurenzi was transported to the hospital where, without regaining consciousness, she was pronounced dead on January 18, 1994. Death was ruled a homicide caused by blunt force trauma to the back of the head.</p>
    <p id="b161-4" data-blocks='[["BL_161.3",161,[224,321,1151,735]]]'>
      <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>Through the investigation into Mrs. Laurenzi’s death the following details about her life were revealed. According to her relatives, Mrs. Laurenzi was quite capable of managing her affairs. Mrs. Laurenzi had always taken care of her own finances. She was capable of driving her own car for local errands, although she preferred to have a relative drive her when traveling greater distances. Mrs. Laurenzi enjoyed the support of her extended family, as they regularly drove her places, cared for the maintenance on her vehicle and frequently visited with her. Mrs. Laurenzi spent every weekend with her sister, Ramona DePierri, in New Jersey. During the Christmas and New Year holidays immediately preceding her death, she visited with her son, Bernard Laurenzi, in Albany, New York, and then joined her sister in New Jersey.</p>
    <p id="b161-5" data-blocks='[["BL_161.4",161,[224,1081,1151,473]]]'>Through interviews with her family, it was discovered that she had recently paid Appellant to complete a few small jobs around her house. One of those involved repairing a lock on her door. As this repair occurred while Mrs. Laurenzi was visiting her sister in New Jersey, she gave Appellant a key to her house. During the initial interview with police the night Mrs. Laurenzi was discovered, Appellant presented himself as a caretaker for Mrs. Laurenzi. Her relatives disputed this representation.</p>
    <p id="b161-6" data-blocks='[["BL_161.5",161,[225,1578,1152,790]],["BL_162.1",162,[277,319,1159,198]]]'>Mrs. Laurenzi’s relatives related to police that in the days preceding her death she had been upset about two things. While visiting with her son at Christmas, she told him of an odd exchange with Appellant regarding her social security check. Mrs. Laurenzi was waiting for her social security check, concerned that it was not in the mailbox as expected. When she asked Appellant if he had seen the mailman, and told him of her concern, Appellant admitted that he had her check. Appellant explained that he had taken it into his house for safekeeping. When she related this incident to her son, it was apparent that Mrs. Laurenzi was upset by Appellant’s actions. Mrs. Laurenzi planned to tell Appellant to stay away from her mailbox. The other matter worrying Mrs. Laurenzi over the holidays were the recent receipt of overdraft notices on her checking account. Her family related to police that <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>Mrs. Laurenzi had been extremely upset upon receiving the overdraft notices and determined to confront- the bank immediately. Her family convinced her to wait until after the holidays to address these problems.</p>
    <p id="b162-5" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[272,541,1164,725]]]'>On January 2, 1994, Anthony Picardo picked up his aunt, Mrs. Laurenzi, at Mrs. DePierri’s home in New Jersey and transported his aunt to her own home in Philadelphia. During the drive, Mrs. Laurenzi again expressed her dismay over the problem with her checking account. Mrs. Laurenzi was adamant about her plan to personally visit the bank the next morning and deal with the problem. It was approximately 7:00 p.m. when Mr. Picardo left Mrs. Laurenzi’s house. About 8:00 p.m., Mr. Picardo received a phone call from Appellant. Appellant told Mr. Picardo that Mrs. Laurenzi’s phone was out of order; additionally, Appellant explained that Mrs. Laurenzi could not locate her pocketbook. Appellant asked Mr. Picardo to search his car for the missing pocketbook. Mr. Picardo’s search was unsuccessful.</p>
    <p id="b162-6" data-blocks='[["BL_162.5",162,[267,1296,1166,777]]]'>Mrs. DePierri also received a phone call from Mrs. Laurenzi around 8:00 p.m. on the evening of January 2, 1994. Mrs. Laurenzi called from Appellant’s house, explaining that her own phone was out of order, and relating the disappearance of her pocketbook. Mrs. DePierri’s search for the pocketbook was equally unsuccessful. Mrs. DePierri believed that Mrs. Laurenzi had the pocketbook as it contained her house keys, which obviously had been in her possession when she first arrived home. Mrs. Laurenzi was concerned about the pocketbook as it contained a check Mrs. DePierri had just written to Mrs. Laurenzi. Mrs. Laurenzi insisted the check be can-celled immediately. Mrs. Laurenzi told Mrs. DePierri that the Bell Atlantic Telephone Company had been called and as soon as the problem was corrected Mrs. Laurenzi would call and inform her sister.</p>
    <p id="b162-7" data-blocks='[["BL_162.6",162,[266,2106,1161,254]],["BL_163.1",163,[228,314,1154,207]]]'>The police learned that an employee of Bell Atlantic, Joseph Marino, had seen Mrs. Laurenzi on the morning of January 3, 1994. Mr. Marino arrived at the house about 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd in response to the work order received by Bell Atlantic at 7:47 p.m., January 2, 1994. Mr. Marino discovered that the <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>phone line on the rear outside wall of the house had been intentionally cut. Mr. Marino repaired the severed line and Mrs. Laurenzi signed the repair sheet. Mr. Marino left the property at 9:50 a.m.</p>
    <p id="b163-5" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[228,563,1154,750]]]'>On January 3,1994, sometime between 10:00 a.m. and noon, Appellant’s wife, Barbara Rizzuto, observed Appellant with the anti-auto theft device known as “the club” in his hands. Appellant .was walking away from Mrs. Laurenzi’s house when Barbara observed him, and she inquired as to why he had the club. Appellant answered that he oiled it in response to Barbara’s complaint that it was sticking. Barbara then observed Appellant place the club in the trunk of their car. Another neighbor, Steven Croft, saw Appellant on Mrs. Laurenzi’s steps around noon on January 3, 1994. Mr. Croft recalled the encounter because although he and Appellant had not spoken to each other for over a year, Appellant engaged him in conversation as if their recent discord had never occurred.</p>
    <p id="b163-6" data-blocks='[["BL_163.5",163,[227,1363,1155,644]]]'>Late in the afternoon of January 3, 1994, Appellant called his friend Mr. James Smith and invited Mr. Smith to dinner. During dinner Appellant told Mr. Smith that he was concerned about Mrs. Laurenzi. Appellant stated that he had not seen her since 11:00 a.m. that morning and that no lights were on in her house, although it was quite dark. At Mr. Smith’s urging Appellant phoned Mrs. <em>DePierri </em>about his concerns. Mrs. DePierri asked Appellant to check on Mrs. Laurenzi, and to break into the house if necessary. Mr. Smith assisted Appellant in gaining entry to Mrs. Laurenzi’s home through a window. Upon discovering Mrs. Laurenzi in the kitchen, Appellant phoned the police, and notified Mrs. DePierri.</p>
    <p id="b163-7" data-blocks='[["BL_163.6",163,[227,2050,1154,305]]]'>Given Mrs. Laurenzi’s deep concern about her overdrawn checking account, the police inquired about the matter with her bank. It was discovered that Appellant cashed three checks drawn on Mrs. Laurenzi’s account made payable to him. It was also determined that Mrs. Laurenzi did not write the checks.</p>
    <p id="b164-4" data-blocks='[["BL_164.3",164,[276,312,1157,622]]]'>
      <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>In following up on the matter of the checks, the police learned that Appellant had cashed the checks at Nikki’s Consumer Services, a check-cashing agency. Mr. Trub, an employee of Nikki’s, testified to an odd coincidence, that on several occasions when Appellant presented checks, the phone lines at Nikki’s were dead. This was remarkable because the standard procedure at Nikki’s is to call and verify a check before cashing it for the customer. Thus, Mr. Trub was unable to verify the authenticity of the checks presented by Appellant prior to cashing them. It was later discovered that the phone line had been deliberately severed at a location on the outside of the building.</p>
    <p id="b164-5" data-blocks='[["BL_164.4",164,[273,960,1161,624]]]'>During November and December of 1993, Nikki’s cashed several checks for Appellant, drawn on the accounts of Mrs. Laurenzi and Appellant’s wife, Barbara Rizzuto. Nikki’s eventually learned that there were insufficient funds to cover the checks. By the end of December 1993 Nikki’s was out of pocket more than $5,000 due to the checks presented by Appellant. Mr. Trub pursued Appellant for the deficiencies. Appellant directed Mr. Trub to resubmit the checks for payment, showing him a deposit slip on Mrs. Rizzuto’s account indicating a balance of $53,000. It was later determined that the deposit slip was false. Mrs. Rizzuto testified that Appellant was not permitted to write checks on her account.</p>
    <p id="b164-6" data-blocks='[["BL_164.5",164,[270,1609,1159,466]]]'>On January 5, 1994, Mr. Smith was awakened by the sound of a car engine. Looking out his window, Mr. Smith observed Appellant in the front seat of Mr. Smith’s car. Although Appellant had his own set of keys for the car, Mr. Smith asked him not to take the car on that particular night. Appellant left the scene without discussion. A few days later, Appellant phoned Mr. Smith and they discussed the assault on Mrs. Laurenzi. Appellant told Mr. Smith that he had flashbacks and did not know if he was responsible for her injuries.</p>

John Jachinowicz testified that Appellant called and admitted that he was responsible for the assault on Mrs. Laurenzi. Appellant stated that he was “on the run”. Mr. Jachinowicz imme<a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>diately went to Appellant’s home and discussed the phone call with Barbara Rizzuto. Together, Mr. Jachinowicz and Barbara called Detective Citino of the Philadelphia police to report Appellant’s message.</p>
    <p id="b165-5" data-blocks='[["BL_165.4",165,[219,554,1149,475]]]'>On January 9,1994, Detective Citino arranged for the police in Brigantine, New Jersey to arrest Appellant, who was believed to be hiding in Brigantine at his parents’ summer home. After Appellant was arrested, a search warrant was obtained for the home in Brigantine. A search revealed Mrs. Laurenzi’s bank statements in the freezer, with copies of the forged checks, and Barbara Rizzuto’s checkbook. Appellant had traveled to New Jersey in Mrs. Laurenzi’s car. The car keys were found in the living room of the house in Brigantine.</p>
    <p id="b165-6" data-blocks='[["BL_165.5",165,[218,1062,1151,302]]]'>While awaiting trial for the murder of Mrs. Laurenzi, Appellant confessed to a prison associate, Michael D’Alessandro. In discussing their respective cases, Appellant told Mr. D’Alessandro that he had stolen checks from Mrs. Laurenzi and when it appeared that his forgeries would be discovered he killed her in an effort to cover his crimes.</p>
    <p id="b165-7" data-blocks='[["BL_165.6",165,[216,1404,1156,958]]]'>Appellant was tried before a jury commencing on April 25, 1996. On May 8, 1996, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to first degree murder. The following day a penalty hearing was conducted. The Commonwealth presented evidence of one aggravating circumstance, that the murder was committed to prevent the victim’s testimony against the defendant in another criminal proceeding. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(5). In mitigation Appellant presented evidence of his character and the circumstances of the offense. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(8). Also in mitigation, it was stipulated that Appellant had no prior criminal record. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(1). The jury found one aggravating factor present and no mitigating factors. On May 10, 1996 the jury returned a verdict of death. After denying post-verdict motions the trial court formally imposed sentence on November 17, 1998. A hearing was completed on January 29, 1999 addressing Appellant’s post-sentence allegations of ineffectiveness of trial counsel. These ineffectiveness claims were denied. This appeal followed.</p>

A few weeks before the murder, she had given him a key to her home. On the day Mrs. Laurenzi was discovered, Appellant was seen outside her home with an anti-theft device known as “the club”. This device was sufficient to cause the severe injury to the back of Mrs. Laurenzi’s skull. The day Mrs. Laurenzi was assaulted she planned to visit her bank, where <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>she would have been shown the checks written on her account payable to Appellant. Prior to visiting the bank, Mrs. Laurenzi was required to wait for a telephone repair. It was later determined that her telephone line had been deliberately severed. The coincidence that Mrs. Laurenzi suffered telephone service disruption due to a deliberate act, as did Nikki’s check cashing service, at a time advantageous to Appellant, creates the logical inference that Appellant was responsible for the severed phone lines at both places.

Although this behavior allegedly manifests at a time critical to the trial of this case, it is an unsubstantiated assertion of Appellant. Even if we assume, for the sake of argument, that Mr. Smith made the statement, standing alone, without a context of where and to whom it was uttered, the assertion does not support a finding that he suffered from an illness affecting his ability to recall events previously observed. Nor does Appellant offer credible evidence that Mr. Smith’s prior hospitalizations were for anything other than alcohol dependency, a condition that Mr. Smith readily conceded.

None of the remarks by the Commonwealth in closing were intended to inflame the passion of the jury causing a verdict premised on bias and hostility. As there was no misconduct, counsel had no basis to raise an objection and therefore the claim of ineffectiveness on this point fails. <em>Rainey; Weiss.</em>
