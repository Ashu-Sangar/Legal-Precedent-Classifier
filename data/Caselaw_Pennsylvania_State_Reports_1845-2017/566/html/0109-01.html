On February 26, 1997, appellant was drinking copiously<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in a bar with friends when James DiAmicis and friends entered. Mr. DiAmicis greeted appellant’s date, whom he knew, angering appellant and leading to a minor confrontation. When appellant left the bar, he and a couple of his friends waited outside until Mr. DiAmicis left later with one of his friends. Appellant drove his pickup truck across the parking lot into the car of DiAmicis’s friend, then reversed his vehicle and headed for the exit. As he drove out, he changed direction to run over Mr. DiAmicis, killing him, then washed his truck at a car wash. The next morning at work, appellant borrowed a <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>coworker’s car and fled to Colorado where he was apprehended two months later on a fugitive warrant and returned to Pennsylvania.</p>

The Commonwealth therefore concludes that appellant was not entitled to a jury instruction on criminal negligence, there was no trial error, and the judgment of sentence should be affirmed. Contrary to the Commonwealth’s contentions, however, <em>McCurdy </em>does not mandate a different conclusion as the issue in that case did not involve the applicable mens rea requirement for vehicular homicide offenses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In <em>Heck, </em>this court addressed a related issue where the offense was homicide by vehicle (not DUI related), 75 Pa.C.S. § 3732. Explicitly, that statute, like the one at issue here, requires only that the death be caused unintentionally. We held, however, that the minimum level of culpability is criminal negligence, stating that <em>Commonwealth v. Field, </em><a href="/pa/490/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="490 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="1763815" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0519-01">490 Pa. 519</a>, <a href="/pa/490/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="490 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="1763815" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0519-01">417 A.2d 160</a> (1980), had already established that 75 Pa.C.S. § 3732 was not a strict liability offense and that 18 Pa.C.S. § 302 establishes criminal negligence as the minimum level of culpability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b222-5" data-blocks='[["BL_222.4",222,[266,922,1165,793]]]'>The logic of appellant’s argument is sound. The motor vehicle code, 75 Pa.C.S. § 3732, defines vehicular homicide, the offense at issue in <em>Heck, </em>as follows: “Any person who unintentionally causes the death of another person while engaged in the violation of any [motor vehicle law except DUI] is guilty of homicide by vehicle, a misdemeanor of the first degree, when the violation is the cause of death.” The basis of appellant’s conviction, 75 Pa.C.S. § 3735(a), DUI-related vehicular homicide, states: “Any person who unintentionally causes the death of another person as the result of a violation of section 3731[DUI] is guilty of a felony of the second degree when the violation is the cause of death.... ” The material language is identical. If we adhere to the rationale of <em>Heck, </em>it would follow that 75 Pa.C.S. § 3735 requires proof of criminal negligence.</p>

The trial court’s refusal to charge on criminal negligence as an element of homicide by vehicle — DUI-related could not have contributed to the jury’s verdict as the court charged the jury on criminal negligence as it pertained to the involuntary manslaughter charge<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and the jury convicted appellant of that offense. The jury’s finding of guilt as to involuntary manslaughter necessarily included a finding of criminal negligence.

On the other hand, to suggest as the [djissent does that our legislature intentionally chose to disregard the social utility of the driver’s conduct is to impute to the legislature a harshness and shortsightedness which we cannot. While there is always some risk associated with driving an auto, we do not think that the legislature in its collective wisdom intended to abrogate the possibility of a finding that the risk taken was reasonable under the particular circumstances.</blockquote>

The Pennsylvania General Assembly has clearly moved beyond the comparatively comfortable framework of the MPC in terms of the imposition of absolute liability in the criminal law context. Correspondingly, and as gradations are enhanced and penalties are increased, the constitutional stakes are raised. <em>See Cordoba-Hincapie, </em><a href="/f-supp/825/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="151" data-cite="825 F.

The salutary effect is an approximation of the common law and MPC restraints upon strict liability by inserting the middle-ground concept of negligence into the pertinent offenses. <em>See generally </em>Packer, <em>Mens Rea and the Supreme Court, </em>1962 Sup.Ct. Rev. at 110 (1962)(argu-ing that “the idea of criminal responsibility based upon the actor’s failure to act as carefully as he should affords an important and largely unutilized means for avoiding the tyranny of strict liability in the criminal law”). The difficulty, however, is that, based upon the reasoning provided, there is no assurance that the General Assembly intended such middle ground to be achieved, and, indeed, much of the evidence not expressly taken into account by the Court simply is to the contrary. Thus, the appearance arises that the Court may be functioning as a lawmaker, rather than within its constitutional role as interpreter of the lawful enactments of the Legislature. This problem is compounded as it becomes increasingly apparent in various contexts that some form of strict liability is legislatively intended, for example, in instances in which <em>per se </em>methods of proof are employed. Ultimately, in light of the breadth of criminal offenses reposited in the Crimes Code and other statutes, I believe that the constitutional questions will need to be squarely confronted.</p>

As evidenced by the legislative amendments to 75 Pa.C.S. § 3732 and the enactment of 75 Pa.C.S. § 3735.1, when the legislature intends to require proof of criminal negligence for an offense, it puts the words in the statute. In 1996, the legislature enacted 75 Pa.C.S. § 3735.1, which creat<a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>ed a new criminal offense for “aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence.” Section 3735.1 provides:</p>

The inclusion of the term “negligence” in this statute demonstrates a clear legislative intent to require proof of criminal negligence for a conviction. More tellingly, in December of 2000, the legislature amended the statute for homicide by vehicle, 75 Pa.C.S. § 3732.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Formerly, the statute read:</p>

The deletion of “unintentionally causes” from the former statute and its replacement with “recklessly or with gross negligence” further illustrates that when the legislature intends proof of criminal negligence as part of the <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>elements of an offense, specifically in connection with violations of the Vehicle Code, it does so in clear and unmistakable language.</p>

Respecting 75 Pa.C.S. § 3735, we should read the legislature’s decision to leave this section unchanged as indicative of a legislative intent not to require proof of criminal negligence. If the legislature wished to require proof of criminal negligence to establish a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. § 3735, it could have done so either in 1996, when it enacted 75 Pa.C.S. § 3735.1 to require proof of negligence for aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence, or in 2000, when it amended 75 Pa.C.S. § 3732 to require proof of criminal negligence for a conviction for homicide by vehicle.
