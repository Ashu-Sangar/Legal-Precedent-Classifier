    <p id="b566-7" data-blocks='[["BL_566.5",566,[269,504,1161,1120]]]'>The analysis in <em>Cook, </em>which is cited extensively in <em>D.M., </em>was clearly rooted in Pennsylvania’s heightened privacy considerations pursuant to Article 1, Section 8 as interpreted by this Court in <em>Matos. </em>Moreover, our conclusion in the original <em>D.M. </em>opinion was consistent with both <em>Matos </em>and <em>Cook. </em>The facts in <em>Matos </em>were almost identical to the facts of the instant case, except in this case, the man was allegedly carrying a gun instead of drugs and did not abandon anything as he was fleeing the police. We have previously indicated that a radio call regarding a man with a gun does not create a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. <em>Commonwealth v. Jackson, </em><a href="/pa/548/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="548 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="960543" data-case-paths="/pa/548/0484-01">548 Pa. 484</a>, <a href="/a2d/698/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="698 A.2d 571" data-case-ids="12009044,960543" data-case-paths="/a2d/698/0571-01,/pa/548/0484-01">698 A.2d 571</a> (1997); <em>Commonwealth v. Hawkins, </em><a href="/pa/547/0652-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="547 Pa. 652" data-case-ids="468737" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0652-01">547 Pa. 652</a>, <a href="/a2d/692/1068-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="692 A.2d 1068" data-case-ids="11919670,468737" data-case-paths="/a2d/692/1068-01,/pa/547/0652-01">692 A.2d 1068</a> (1997). Thus, there are no facts in the instant case justifying a departure from <em>Matos. </em>In addition, the instant case is distinct from the situation in <em>Cook, </em>since in that case we emphasized that it was the police officer’s firsthand observations of suspicious activity rather than the ensuing flight that created a reasonable suspicion. In this case, there were no comparable firsthand observations on the part of the police officer creating a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot.</p>
