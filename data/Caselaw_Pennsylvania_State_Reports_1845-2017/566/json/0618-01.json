Should Pennsylvania recognize, as a case of first impression, the concept of \u201ctaint\u201d on the competency of the children\u2019s testimony when the defense established an objective source of \u201ctaint\u201d through affidavits and exhibits as mandated in State v. Michaels, 136 N.J. 299, 642 A.2d 1372 (1994)?\n2. Did the Superior Court err in affirming the trial court\u2019s three procedural violations and factual finding of competency?\n3. Did the Superior Court\u2019s decision to prohibit cross-examination of the children on their recollection of their statements to third parties, to prevent expert testimony on the issue of reliability, and to conclude the 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 5985.1 hearsay statements possessed particularized guarantees of trustworthiness violate the mandate in Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990) and applied in Commonwealth v. Vining, 744 A.2d 310 (Pa.Super.1999)?\nIt is further ordered that WE GRANT the Motion for Admission of Thomas A. Pavlinic, Esquire Pro Hac Vice and that WE GRANT Petitioner\u2019s Application to Present Post Submission Authority.",
