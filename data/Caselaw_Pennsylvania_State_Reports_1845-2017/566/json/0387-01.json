        "text": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM:\nThe Court is evenly divided on the question certified by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The following Opinions are filed herewith.\nJustice ZAPPALA files an Opinion in which Chief Justice FLAHERTY and Justice CASTILLE join.\nJustice CAPPY files an Opinion in which Justice NEWMAN and Justice SAYLOR join.\nJustice NIGRO did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nOPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nWe granted certification of a question of law to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in this case to address the following issue:\nDoes the requirement in 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1738(e) that a valid stacking waiver \u201cmust be signed by the first named insured\u201d mean that a valid waiver must be signed by the current first named insured on a policy, thus imposing a continuing obligation on insurers to acquire a new stacking waiver if the first named insured on a policy changes, or does \u00a7 1738(e) merely require that a valid waiver only must be signed by the first named insured at the time the waiver is signed?\nFor the reasons that follow, I would answer this question by stating that the validity of a waiver of stacking uninsured motorist coverage is determined at the inception of the policy.\nBefore analyzing the question at hand, I note the relevant factual history of the case, as presented to us by the Court of Appeals. In 1984, Cynthia Winters purchased an automobile insurance policy from Liberty Mutual. The policy listed only Cynthia as a \u201cnamed insured.\u201d Timothy Rupert was listed as a \u201cdriver.\u201d In 1988, Cynthia and Timothy married. In 1991, Cynthia executed a \u201cRejection of Stacked Uninsured Coverage Limits\u201d form for the policy. The waiver\u2019s validity, at the time of execution, is not at question here.\nIn 1993, Timothy Rupert was added as a named insured under the policy, while Cynthia remained listed as the first named insured. On January 20, 1997, Cynthia died. On January 22, 1997, Timothy changed the policy to remove her name, thus making him the sole named insured on the policy. Timothy renewed the policy on May 22, 1997. The policy number did not change through the life of the policy.\nOn July 29, 1997, Timothy was seriously injured when a car struck him while he was standing next to his own vehicle. An uninsured motorist operated the vehicle which struck Timothy Rupert. It is undisputed that Timothy\u2019s insurance included $300,000 of uninsured coverage per accident. It is also undisputed that the policy covered two vehicles, thus, if a valid waiver to stacking was not signed, Timothy Rupert would be covered for his damages up to $600,000.\nThe Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1701 et seq., outlines the insurance required to operate a motor vehicle. Every motor vehicle insurance policy must offer optional uninsured motorist coverage. See 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1731. This provision allows the insured to reject this coverage only by signing a rejection form, as mandated by 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1731(b). See Donnelly v. Bauer, 553 Pa. 596, 720 A.2d 447 (1998) and also see Salazar v. Allstate Insurance Co., 549 Pa. 658, 702 A.2d 1038 (1997). Where more than one vehicle is insured against uninsured drivers, the policy limits are \u201cstacked.\u201d This is provided for by 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1738, as follows:\n\u00a7 1738. Stacking of uninsured and underinsured benefits and option to waive\n(a) Limit for each vehicle. \u2014 When more than one vehicle is insured under one or more policies providing uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, the stated limit for uninsured or underinsured coverage shall apply separately to each vehicle so insured. The limits of coverages available under this subchapter for an insured shall be the sum of the limits for each motor vehicle as to which the injured person is an insured.\n(b) Waiver. \u2014 Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), a named insured may waive coverage providing' stacking of uninsured or underinsured coverages in which case the limits of coverage available under the policy for an insured shall be the stated limits for the motor vehicle as to which the injured person is an insured.\n(c) More than one vehicle. \u2014 Each named insured purchasing uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage for more than one vehicle under a policy shall be provided the opportunity to waive the stacked limits of coverage and instead purchase coverage as described in subsection (b). The premiums for an insured who exercises such waiver shall be reduced to reflect the different cost of such coverage.\n(d) Forms.\u2014\n(1) The named insured shall be informed that he may exercise the waiver of the stacked limits of uninsured motorist coverage by signing the following written rejection form:\nUNINSURED COVERAGE LIMITS\nBy signing this waiver, I am rejecting stacked limits of uninsured motorist coverage under the policy for myself and members of my household under which the limits of coverage available would be the sum of limits for each motor vehicle insured under the policy. Instead, the limits of coverage that I am purchasing shall be reduced to the limits stated in the policy. I knowingly and voluntarily reject the stacked limits of coverage. I understand that my premiums will be reduced if I reject this coverage.\nSignature of First Named Insured Date\n(2) The named insured shall be informed that he may exercise the waiver of the stacked limits of underinsured motorist coverage by signing the following written rejection form:\nUNDERINSURED COVERAGE LIMITS\nBy signing this waiver, I am rejecting stacked limits of underinsured motorist coverage under the policy for myself and members of my household under which the limits of coverage available would be the sum of limits for each motor vehicle insured under the policy. Instead, the limits of coverage that I am purchasing shall be reduced to the limits stated in the policy. I knowingly and voluntarily reject the stacked limits of coverage. I understand that my premiums will be reduced if I reject this coverage.\nSignature of First Named Insured Date\n(e) Signature and date. \u2014 The forms described in subsection (d) must be signed by the first named insured and dated to be valid. Any rejection form that does not comply with this section is void.\nThe terms \u201cnamed insured\u201d and \u201cfirst named insured\u201d are not defined in the MVFRL. The MVFRL does define the term \u201cInsured\u201d as any of the following:\n(1) An individual identified by name as an insured in a policy of motor vehicle insurance.\n(2) If residing in the household of the named insured:\n(i) a spouse or other relative of the named insured:\n(ii) a minor in the custody of either the named insured or relative of the named insured.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1702.\nTimothy Rupert argues that the waiver form signed by Cynthia Rupert was no longer a valid waiver because, at the time of his accident it did not conform with the requirement of Section 1738(e) that the form be signed by the first named insured and dated, since Cynthia\u2019s name no longer appeared on the policy. Rupert\u2019s argument is based upon the plain language of Section 1738(e).\nAt first blush, Section 1738 appears to interchange the terms \u201cfirst named insured\u201d and \u201cnamed insured\u201d. Section 1738(c) allows each named insured the option of waiving stacked coverage. Section 1738(c) also states that premiums for \u201can insured\u201d should reflect the difference in cost. I see no conflict in terms here, as each named insured must categorically be an insured. Conversely, any insured that is not a named insured is not entitled to the waiver option provided in Section 1738(b).\nPursuant to Section 1738(d), each named insured must be informed of the option to waive stacked coverage. The statute mandates the notification be presented in the specific manner of the prescribed form described in Section 1738(d)(1). That form calls only for the signature of the first named insured. Likewise, Section 1738(e) also mandates the signature of the first named insured. My reading of the plain meaning of Section 1738(d) and (e) is that the signature of the first named insured evidences the insurer\u2019s fulfillment of its obligation of offering and informing the named insured of his or her right to waiver. Given this plain meaning of the statute, I find that, for purposes of Section 1738, the signature of the first named insured on a valid waiver at the inception of the policy is evidence that each named insured under the policy was fully aware of the options regarding stacked policy limits.\nChief Justice FLAHERTY and Justice CASTILLE join this Opinion.\nOPINION\nCAPPY, Justice.\nThe certified question asks us to resolve whether 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1738(e) requires a valid stacking waiver to be signed by the current first named insured, or merely by the first named insured at the time the waiver is signed. The Opinion of Mr. Justice Zappala determines that \u201cthe validity of a waiver of stacking uninsured motorist coverage is determined at the inception of the policy.\u201d Opin. of Zappala, J. 566 Pa. at 388, 781 A.2d at 132. This conclusion lacks support in the statutory language, violates the legislative goal of ensuring knowledgeable rejection of coverage, and invites troubling repercussions.\nThe legislature placed the burden of obtaining a valid rejection of stacked coverage on the insurance company: The rejection forms in \u00a7 1738(d) must be signed and dated by the first named insured, or else the rejection of stacked coverage is void. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1738(e). It is evident that the General Assembly sought to ensure that policyholders would be given full information regarding availability of stacked coverage before deciding whether or not to reject it. Cf. Salazar v. Allstate Insurance Co., 549 Pa. 658, 702 A.2d 1038, 1044 (1997) (sections 1731, 1791 and 1791.1 describe information that insurer must provide \u201cin order that the insured may make a knowing and intelligent decision on whether to waive [uninsured motorists] benefits coverage.\u201d).\nThe first named insured\u2019s signature on the form rejects \u201ccoverage under the policy for myself and members of my household ....\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1738(d). By employing this language, the legislature adopted the fiction of \u201cconstructive knowledge\u201d as to all other insureds \u2014 that is, if the first named insured rejected stacked coverage, then it would be presumed that all other insureds had knowledge of the option, and acquiesced in the rejection of coverage. Thus, notice to the first named insured is all that the statute requires.\nThe question with which we are presented in this matter involves the effect of a valid waiver by the first named insured. The Opinion of Mr. Justice Zappala finds that the validity of a waiver of uninsured motorist coverage is determined \u201cat the inception of the policy\u201d. Yet this language appears nowhere in section 1738. Moreover, under this expansive view, a rejection form signed \u201cat the inception of the policy\u201d indefinitely binds all future insureds, including those added long after the original first named insured is removed from the policy; these subsequent insureds are not even minimally afforded constructive knowledge of the option to reject stacked coverage. This troubling result does not follow if the insurer has obtained a rejection form from the current first named insured, whose signature would reject coverage for all those insureds currently on the policy. In light of the legislative goal of ensuring knowledgeable rejection of coverage, and the conclusive effect of the first named insured\u2019s signature' upon other insureds, it is of paramount importance that any new first named insureds receive the notice prescribed by \u00a7 1738.\nTherefore, in response to the certified question, I would hold that 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1738(e) requires that a valid stacking rejection form must be signed by the current first named insured.\nJustice NEWMAN and Justice SAYLOR join this opinion.\n. We may accept questions of law upon certification from the United States Courts of Appeals pursuant to our Internal Operating Procedures. See Coady v. Vaughn, 564 Pa. 604, 770 A.2d 287 (2001), and also Fiore v. White, 562 Pa. 634, 757 A.2d 842 (2000).",
