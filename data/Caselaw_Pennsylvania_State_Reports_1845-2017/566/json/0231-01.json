Specifically, did the Superior Court err in failing to remand on the following issues:\n(A) Whether Petitioner is entitled to a new trial because of the prosecutor\u2019s failure to disclose a critical criminal history pertaining to its sole identification witness which would have severely impeached his credibility.\n(B) Whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing to call available exculpatory witnesses, both of whom would have provided critical testimony contradicting and impeaching that of the prosecution\u2019s only identification eyewitness.\n2) Did the trial court err in permitting into evidence and then instructing the jury that Petitioner was not licensed to carry a firearm, where this evidence was unsupported in the record, had no relevance, and only caused unfair prejudice.\nIn addressing question (1), the parties shall also present argument on the following issue:\nShould the Court reconsider the practice initiated in Commonwealth v. Hubbard, 472 Pa. 259, 372 A.2d 687, 695 n. 6 (1977), of requiring that \u201cineffectiveness of prior counsel must be raised as an issue at the earliest stage in the proceedings at which the counsel whose effectiveness is being challenged no longer represents the defendant.\u201d",
