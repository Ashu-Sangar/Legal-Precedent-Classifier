Lackawanna Coal Co., Ltd.\nDeed \u2014 Construction\u2014Avoiding uncertainty \u2014 Description\u2014 Grant of coal \u2014 Veins as unit \u2014 Identity\u2014Finding of fact \u2014 Appeal.\n1. A deed of coal specified the property conveyed as a \u201cvein or stratum of coal\u201d beneath a tract of land specifically described, and \u201cis the one lately found by the borings\u201d of a coal company mentioned, \u201cand is supposed to be a part of the same vein or stratum of coal\u201d now being worked \u201cthrough a tunnel on lands\u201d of other persons named. The borings mentioned showed that at the depth of 266 feet there was exposed coal 3 feet in thickness beneath which was slate three feet four inches in thickness and then coal five feet in thickness. There was no other coal exposed except traces. On a bill in equity plaintiffs claimed that the upper or three-foot layer of coal was a separate vein, and did not pass by the deed. Defendants claimed that the two layers constituted a single vein. The court below found that the weight of the evidence warranted the conclusion that the coal in controversy was part of a single vein and it was admitted by defendant at the argument of the appeal that there was evidence to support such a finding. The court further found that, \u201cface to face with the coal as it so presented itself, they [the parties] dealt with it as a unit; as such, the identity of the thing granted is free from doubt, any other conclusion would avoid the deed for uncertainty, as it would be impossible to determine which of the two parts was intended to be conveyed.\u201d Held, that plaintiff\u2019s contention was unfounded, and that the bill was properly dismissed.\n2. A finding of the court below, supported by the weight of the evidence, will not be reversed on appeal.\nArgued February 23, 1920.\nAppeal, No. 90, Jan. T., 1920, by plaintiff, from decree of C. P. Lackawanna Co., Oct. T., 1918, No. 18, dismissing bill in eguity, in case of Thomas H. Hull et al. v. Lackawanna Coal Co., Ltd.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Stewart, Moschzisker, Frazer, Walling, Simpson and Kephart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity to enjoin working vein of coal. Before Newcomb, J.\nFrom the record it appeared that both parties claimed title from Maria B. Hull and others, from whom defendant took a deed dated June 8, 1894. The grant in the deed described the property as a \u201cvein or stratum of coal\u201d beneath a tract of land specifically described, and \u201cis the one lately found by the borings\u201d of the Pennsylvania Coal Co-, and \u201cis supposed to be a part of the same vein or stratum of coal\u201d now being worked \u201cthrough a tunnel on lands\u201d of persons named.\nThe record of \u201cthe borings\u201d called for in the deed, together with map of the borehole, was in evidence and free from dispute. What had been thus \u201cfound,\u201d in the' order of position from the surface downward, was the following:\nSurface sandstone, 70 feet\nConglomerate, 11 feet\nCoal, 0 feet 3 inches\nStrata (stratified rock), 76 feet 3 inches\nCoal, 0 feet 5 inches\nSandstone, 107 feet 6 inches\nCoal, 3 feet 0 inches\nSlate, 3 feet 4 inches\nCoal, 5 feet 0 inches\n\u25a0Slate, 2 feet 6 inches\nSand slate, 2 feet 0 inches\nSandstone, 45 feet 0 inches\nConglomerate, 5 feet 0 inches\nPlaintiffs claimed that the upper or three-foot layer of coal found at a depth of 266 feet and separated by three feet four inches of slate from the five-foot layer of coal, was a separate vein and did not pass by the deed.\nThe controlling findings of the court below are set forth in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nThe bill was dismissed. Plaintiffs appealed.\nError assigned was, inter alia, decree dismissing bill.\nH. C. Price and S. B. Price, with them C. B. Price, for appellants,\ncited: Barnhart v. Riddle, 29 Pa. 92; George v.
