Florence Addicts lived with her up to the time of her death, and, by her will, became her sole legatee and devisee, designated by the testatrix as the \u201cdaughter of my heart.\u201d The claim of the Commonwealth, disallowed by the court below, is for collateral inheritance tax upon her estate, and it was properly disallowed under the Act of April 22, 1905, P.
