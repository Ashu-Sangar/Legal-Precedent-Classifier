        "text": "Per Curiam,\nWilliam P. Horn, while serving as note clerk for the First National Bank of Easton, embezzled $39,081.73 of its funds. His embezzlements were committed in 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915 and 1916, when he was under bond in the sum of $5,000, with the appellee as his surety. After his last embezzlement he was elected cashier of the bank and his bond was increased to $20,-000, with the same surety. As cashier he embezzled no moneys and caused no loss to the bank by \u201cdishonesty\u201d or \u201cbad faith,\u201d but in this action it seeks to hold the surety liable on the increased bond, covering only his cashiership, for the losses it sustained by his embezzlement as note teller. This it cannot do, and the correct conclusions of the learned court below were: \u201cFirst. Under the provisions of the bond in suit and the renewals of the same, the defendant company is not liable for more than $5,000 and interest. Second. The dishonesty of William P. Horn, for which the defendant is liable, occurred during his employment as \u2018note clerk,\u2019 and the fact that during his employment as \u2018cashier,\u2019 he concealed his embezzlement by forging notes and placing them with the genuine notes of the bank, will not make the defendant liable for the amount for which it had bonded him as cashier.\u201d\nJudgment affirmed.",

Where a surety company insures a bank against any loss ts the amount of $3,000 resulting from the \u201cdishonesty\u201d or \u201cbad faith\u201d of a note clerk, and this contract continues for five years, when the note clerk is promoted to be the cashier of the bank, and the bond is increased to $20,000, the bank cannot hold the surety company liable on the increased bond for a loss resulting from the employee\u2019s dishonesty while he was note clerk.\n2. In such case, the fact that the employee during his employment as \u201ccashier\u201d concealed his embezzlement as \u201cnote clerk,\u201d by forging notes and placing them with the genuine notes of the bank, will not make tbe surety company liable for tbe amount for which it bonded him as cashier.\nArgued May 3, 1920.\nAppeal, No. 47, Jan.
