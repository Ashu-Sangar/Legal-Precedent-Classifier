If the former incumbent attacks such person\u2019s right to occupy the office, he must do so by quo warranto proceedings, and not by mandamus.' If in quo warranto proceedings he establishes his right to the office, and the council refuses to admit him, he may then proceed by mandamus.\nArgued April 27, 1920.\nAppeal, No. 6, J an. T., 1921, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. Lackawanna Co., Jan. T., 1920, No. 769, for defendant, on demurrer to return on petition for mandamus, in case of Com. ex rel. Raniero Giombetti v. James P. Conroy, Burgess, et al., Councilmen of the Borough of Winton, Lackawanna County.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Moschzisker, Frazer, Walling and Simpson, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for mandamus. Before Edwards, P. J.\nThe prayer of the petition was for a peremptory mandamus to compel defendants to recognize petitioner as a member of the borough council of Winton. The court granted an alternative writ of mandamus to which defendants made return. The relator demurred to the return. The court held that the proper remedy was quo warranto, sustained the demurrer, and entered judgments for defendants. Relator appealed.\nError assigned was judgment, quoting it.\nDavid J. Reedy, with him John Memolo, for appellant.\nE. C. Amerman and Martin F. Lally, for appellees, were not heard.\nMay 26, 1920:"
