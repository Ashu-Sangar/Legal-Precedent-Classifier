    "head_matter": "Lockhart\u2019s Estate.\nWills \u2014 Trusts and trustees \u2014 Active trust \u2014 Violation of rule against perpetuities \u2014 Time to raise question.\nWhere a testatrix creates a valid trust for life, the trust fund will be paid over to the trustee at the audit of the executor\u2019s account, even if the ultimate disposition of her estate transgresses the rule against perpetuities. The proper time to raise the question as to the alleged violation of the rule, will be upon the death of the life tenant.\n'Argued March 24, 1920.\nAppeal, No. 263, Jan. T., 1920, by William A. Lockhart, a brother of testatrix, from decree of O. C. Phila. Co., Oct. T., 1918, No. 213, dismissing exceptions to adjudication, in estate of Josephine Lockhart, deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Moschzisker, Walling, Simpson and Kephart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nException to adjudication.\nFrom the record it appeared that the testatrix bequeathed and devised her residuary estate to her executor in trust to pay one-half of the net income to her mother, and the other half to her stepfather, William Gardner Crowell, for life, with right of survivorship; and after the decease of the survivor to pay two-thirds thereof to a stepbrother and the other one-third to his \u201clawful issue,\u201d for their support, maintenance and education; on the death of the stepbrother all income was to be paid to his \u201clawful issue\u201d for the above purpose, one son, however, to receive his father\u2019s full share. The trust ceased with the death of the stepbrother and his lawful issue and the estate passed to charities. Josephine Lockhart\u2019s mother predeceased her.\nAt the audit of the executor\u2019s account, Wm. A. Lock-hart, a brother of the full blood of testatrix, claimed that the trust for life was void on account of the will violating the rule against perpetuities.\nThe auditing judge (Gest, J.) found as follows:\n\u201cThe auditing judge, after a careful consideration of the will, can discover nothing in it to bring it within the cases adduced by counsel, and, as he is clearly of opinion that the trust is good for the life of William Gardner Crowell at least, no useful purpose would now be accomplished by a discussion of the technical questions that may be raised at his death. The claim of William A. Lockhart is dismissed.\u201d\nExceptions to the adjudication were dismissed in an opinion by Lamorelle, P. J. William A. Lockhart appealed.\nErrors assigned, inter alia, were (1) dismissal of exception to above finding, and (8) decree dismissing exceptions and affirming adjudication.\nAlbert T. Bauerle and John G. Kaufman, for appellant.\nTheodore F. Jenkins and Horn R. Kneass, for appellee, were not beard.\nMay 3, 1920:"
