The case was twice tried. The verdict for the plaintiff on the first trial, for $9,472.05, was set aside as being against the weight of the evidence. On the second' trial the verdict for the plaintiff was for $24,504.65, and we are of one mind, from an examination of the record, that there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the court below in setting it aside and granting a new trial.\nAppeal dismissed.",
