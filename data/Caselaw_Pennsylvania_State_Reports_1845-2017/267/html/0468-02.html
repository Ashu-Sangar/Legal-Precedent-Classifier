In 1896 the Kane Flint Bottling Company (herein called “the company”) was a Pennsylvania manufacturing corporation, located at Kane, in which Father George Winkler, rector of the Catholic Church at that place, was interested as a stockholder. The defendants, M. J. and John Fitzgerald, were also located at Kane and engaged in the oil business as Fitz<a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>gerald Brothers. At the solicitation of Winkler they purchased stock of the company to the amount of $6,000. While the stock was taken in the firm name, M. J. Fitzgerald (herein called “the defendant”) transacted the business, and almost immediately became president, general manager and treasurer of the company, and managed its business for about twenty years; in fact, he is still president. Financially it was a failure and in need of funds when he took charge and so continued until it went out of business in 1917. Father Winkler, because of his calling, did not at first wish to be known as interested in the company, so his stock was taken in the name of another, but he was interested in its welfare and often conferred with the defendant about its affairs. They discussed its need of money and Winkler, from time to time, gave checks to Fitzgerald Brothers, which were deposited in their bank account, and, in turn, they gave their checks to the company for which they took its notes in their firm name. They gave Winkler the sealed judgment notes of Fitzgerald Brothers for his above-stated checks. Five of the latter notes Were given August 26, 1901, payable in one year, and assigned to the use-plaintiff in 1917. In 1918, by leave of court, the judgment in this case was confessed on the five notes against the defendants, amounting in all to $12,773.13, which the defendant petitioned the court to open, averring, inter alia, that the loans from Winkler were in reality made to the company but passed through the defendants’ hands, so he would not be known in the transaction, and that their notes were given to him at his request as memoranda of his loans to the company. The use-plaintiff answered denying the averments in the petition, upon information and belief. Depositions were taken on behalf of defendant, but plaintiff submitted no evidence, except some exhibits in connection with the cross-examination. It was stated at bar that Father Winkler was sick in California.</p>

      <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>A careful examination of the record leads us to the conclusion that the order opening the judgment cannot be sustained. The entire defense rests on the uncorroborated testimony of the defendant, M. J. Fitzgerald, for while his son and brother were sworn they gave no important testimony. The answer, being on information and belief, need not be overcome by the evidence of two witnesses, or what is equivalent thereto, yet it stands as a denial and places the burden of proof on defendants (Riegel v.

Super. 37" data-case-ids="285488" data-case-paths="/pa-super/7/0037-01">7 Pa. Superior Ct. 37</a>. Unfortunately defendant’s evidence does not satisfy the requirements; while in the main it accords with his petition, occasionally his answers throw doubt upon it. For example, he was asked: “Q. For what purpose did you receive the money represented by these notes from Father Winkler? A. To lend to the Kane Flint Bottle Co., to conduct their business and pay their bills from time to time.” In other answers he says the money was loaned direct from Winkler to the company; but his testimony fails specifically to aver a contemporaneous agreement that the notes in suit should not be collected. Moreover, he sets up as a reason for giving the notes that Winkler might have something to show his money was loaned through defendants to the company; yet their notes to him import an absolute' obligation, with no reference whatever to the company. And, on the <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>other hand, the company’s notes, made direct to Fitzgerald Brothers, contain no reference to Winkler, who has not and never had a scrap of paper, or the slightest evidence, to show any claim against the company, except the verbal statement now made by the <em>defendant; </em>it is, therefore, a certainty that the notes in suit were not given as memoranda to show loans from Winkler to the company.</p>
    <p id="b500-4" data-blocks='[["BL_500.5",500,[272,768,1150,1357]]]'>While it appears, at the inception, Winkler sought to avoid an open connection with the company, as stockholder or creditor, yet that reason had ceased before the notes in suit were given, for at that time he was an open stockholder, and so shown on the company’s books, and has remained such to' this day, and in recent years he has been one of its officers. So the alleged reason for defendants giving these notes to Winkler did not exist when they were given. Furthermore, defendants never treated the notes they took from the company as belonging to Winkler. They renewed them from time to time as they saw fit, without consulting him and, in fact, never exhibited or offered them or any of them to him. They made loans to the company of their separate funds and mingled the notes taken therefor with those defendant claims represented the Winkler loans, so that when defendant was asked, “Can you pick out the specific notes that you took for the money advanced to you that you got from Father Winkler, advanced by you to the Kane Flint Bottling Co.,” he answered, “I can’t, for I let them all run together”; and later said, “We have any amount of them.” But the notes from the company to the defendant, produced by them at the hearing, correspond neither in dates, numbers nor amounts, with those they had given Winkler.</p>
