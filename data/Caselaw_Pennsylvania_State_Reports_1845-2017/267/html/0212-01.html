The owner of one of two twin houses, with a division wall separating them may lawfully replace his own building with a new one; and, if properly done, he will be in the exercise of a right and not liable to the adjoining owner. If, however, the division wall has supported both buildings for over 21 years, the neighbor has an easement of support in the wall which the other cannot destroy.</p>

In an action of trespass for negligence to recover damages for injuries resulting from the demolition of a building, it appeared that plaintiff and defendant owned adjoining three-story houses separated by a division wall. The houses' had been built by the owner of the land and sold to separate parties. Defendant, in the year in which he bought his house, tore it down and erected on the site a two-story garage. This exposed the division wall above the second'story of plaintiffs’ house. In rebuilding defendant built his new wall wholly upon his own property. The old wall was discovered to be loosely constructed and of defective material, with holes through it near the rafters. Evidence for plaintiff tended to show that defendant so removed the joists from the old division wall as to make additional holes therein; that in rebuilding he overloaded it and neglected to protect the exposed part of the wall, or to place flashing between it and the roof of the garage; that plaintiff resided on the third floor of his house, and kept a shop in the lower floors, in which he repaired and stored furniture and materials therefor; that rain and snow came through the holes in the exposed wall, filtered down between the new and old walls, and injured plaintiff’s goods. Two building experts testified it was a custom for one who exposed a division or party-wall, to protect it by a permanent covering of some suitable material. Plaintiff’s evidence was contradicted, except that relating to the custom. <em>IL'eld, </em>(1) that the case was for the jury, including the proof as to the alleged custom, as that depended upon parol evidence.</p>

In such a ease it was reversible error for the court to charge that “plaintiff was under no legal obligation to protect the party-wall on defendant’s side, after being exposed by defendant’s act; but this obligation rested entirely on defendant”; for, except as <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>the jury found there was a general custom to that effect, the obligation did not rest upon defendant to protect the so-called party-wall, although he might still be liable if the jury found against him on the other allegation of negligence; but the court could not assume the evidence of the custom or the negligence complained of.</p>

Some forty years ago, the owner of the lot on the south side of Chelton avenue, west of Pulaski avenue, Philadelphia, built thereon a three-story double house, called twin houses, of stone and brick construction, with a division wall of like material separating the two houses. He sold each house to a separate purchaser, with the centre of the wall as the dividing line. Thereafter plaintiff bought the west house in 1910, and defendant the east house in 1916, removing it the same year to make room for a new two-story brick garage. This exposed the division wall, which was found loosely constructed and of defective material; in fact, there were holes through the wall, especially near the rafters. In erecting his garage, defendant built a new wall two stories in height, adjoining the old wall, which left the third story of the latter exposed to the weather; and the evidence for plaintiff is to the effect that the defendant so removed the joists of his old building from the division wall as to make additional openings therein; that, at the second floor of the garage, he inserted steel beams into the old wall by which it was overloaded and greatly damaged; also that he entirely neglected to protect the exposed wall, or to place flashing between it and the roof of the garage. Plaintiff resided on the third floor of his house and occupied the balance thereof as a store and shop wherein he made, repaired and stored furniture and materials therefor; and the evidence on his behalf tends to show that the rain and snow came <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>through the exposed wall, and also went down between the new and old walls and filtered through the latter, by reason of which large quantities of water entered plaintiff’s building doing great injury both to it and its contents, for which plaintiff brought this suit. Each side submitted evidence and the jury found for the plaintiff ; this appeal by defendant is from judgment entered upon the verdict.</p>

Plaintiff’s claim is based upon charges of negligence, and he contends it was defendant’s duty to protect the exposed wall by a permanent covering of some suitable material. This is supported by the evidence of two building experts to the effect that such is the general custom and duty of one who has exposed a division or party-wall. Plaintiff further contends that defendant was negligent in leaving an opening between the roof of the garage and the old wall by making holes <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>through the latter in the removal of the joists and by overloading it with the new girders, etc. The evidence as to these contentions was conflicting, except as to the alleged custom and that depended upon the credibility of parol evidence, and, with the other questions, was for the jury. In the main the case was well tried, but the affirmance of plaintiff’s second point (9th assignment), viz: “Plaintiff was under no legal obligation to protect the party-wall on the DeLong side, after being exposed by DeLong’s acts; but this obligation rested entirely on the defendant in this case,” was error. ■ For, except as the jury found there was a general custom to that effect, the obligation did not rest upon defendant to protect the so-called party-wall, although he might still be liable if the jury found against him on the allegation of negligence; but the court could not assume the existence of the custom or of the negligence complained of.</p>
