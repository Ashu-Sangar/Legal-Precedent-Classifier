A testator, who had no lineal descendants, bequeathed to a brother a sum of money “if living at the time of my death.” The brother died in the lifetime of testator, leaving a ¡son. Subsequently, one of the executors, a trust company, wrote to its counsel, saying that its coexecutor desired to pay the legacy to the son of the legatee, and that it would do so if counsel deemed that course proper. Counsel replied, acknowledging receipt of copy of will, and stating that “any devise or legacy in favor of a brother or sister of a testator who died before the latter, in case he leaves no lineal descendants, goes to the surviving brother or sister, unless the will directs otherwise. Under these circumstances, as testator left no children, and as the legatee left but one child, the legacy will be payable to the latter,” On receipt of the letter the trust <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>company, without making any inspection or examination of the will, paid the legacy to the son of the legatee. <em>Held, </em>(1) that, as the brother died in the lifetime of the testator, and as the will stipulated that the legatee must be living at the time of testator’s decease, the legacy lapsed; (2) the payment was made under a mistake of fact, and could be recovered from the person to whom it was paid; (3) the fact that the payee had spent the money, or had set the fund aside for the benefit of his mother, could not relieve him from repayment.</p>

    <p id="b195-3" data-blocks='[["BL_195.4",195,[173,536,1150,476]]]'>That the present testator did “direct otherwise” is apparent, for he expressly provides that, in order to take, the legatees must be living at the time of his decease; in other words, that the legacies, respectively, shall lapse if either of the brothers predeceases him. This is th.e plain meaning of the will, leaving no possible room for legal construction to the contrary; and, when the letter from counsel is read attentively, it is clear he advised on the law as we have stated it.</p>
    <p id="b195-4" data-blocks='[["BL_195.5",195,[175,1030,1157,1304]]]'>True, immediately after his correct legal advice, Mr. Johnson adds: “Under these circumstances, as Benjamin S. Kunkel left no children, and as William F. Kunkel left but one child, the legacy will be payable to the latter”; but he evidently assumed, as a matter of fact, that Benjamin S. Kunkel’s will did not “direct otherwise,” and the fourth assignment of error complains because plaintiffs were refused permission to show that, at the time the letter was dictated, the writer thereof “did not have before him the will of Benjamin S. Kunkel and did not look at the will or know that the legacy was conditional.” We see no necessity for ruling on this assignment, however, for, as already said, it is apparent Mr. Johnson made no mistake of law; his mistake was a misapprehension of the facts (referred to in his letter as “circumstances”) to which the law, as he correctly stated it, was to be applied. The phrase “under these circumstances,” which Mr. Johnson uses, to square with his preceding statement of law and subsequent advice as to payment, can refer only (since he mentions no circumstances concerning the provisions of the will) to an assumed set of circumstances, or facts— in regard to testator’s expressed wishes — which he plainly misapprehended.</p>

As to this, it is apparent the mistake was made by thinking, and acting upon the hypothesis, that the will did not provide against a lapse in case of death of the legatee in the lifetime of testator, whereas the fact is directly to the contrary. This of course, presents a mistake of fact; and the opinion of the court below, dismissing plaintiff’s motion for judgment n. o. v., does not rule otherwise. It is there said: “The facts are not in dispute” and, “The letter [of Mr. Johnson] states a recognized rule of law,” but the opinion goes on to announce, as a general principle, that a “mistake of fact cannot be pleaded successfully where all the parties concerned knew or had means of ascertaining the facts”; and, acting on this theory, the learned trial judge concludes by saying, “We are unable to discover any fact warranting the entry of judgment in favor of plaintiffs.”</p>

Recovery was allowed on the theory that the mistake was one of fact, arising through carelessness in reading the will. While this issue was submitted to the jury, the court states (p. 529) : “Undoubtedly their conclusion was correct — no one could read the will attentively without being forcibly impressed...... that a blunder had been made......; the final answer here was not only consistent with the evidence, but it is not apparent how there could have been any escape from it.” In other words, the point as to the character of the mistake might have been ruled as a matter of law; and the circumstance that plaintiff had ready and ample means of information, which, if taken advantage of, would have avoided the wrong payment, was not sufficient to prevent recovery.</p>

Ency. of Law, 624, “Where money is paid under mistake of fact, it is no defense to an action for its recovery that the mistake arose through the payer’s negligence, if such negligence caused no harm to payee”; but defendant contends that, since he had parted with the $5,000 prior to a demand for its return, the negligence of plaintiffs, in paying the money, has caused him such harm as to estop them from recovery. This contention has no merit. Union Trust Co. v. Gilpin, <a href="/pa/235/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="235 Pa. 524" data-case-ids="984843" data-case-paths="/pa/235/0524-01">supra,</a> (p. 527), shows an offer to prove defendant had “meantime spent the money so that repayment would now be a hardship,” and it was held immaterial, the court saying (p. 529) : “There is neither reason nor authority to support the theory that the mere fact of the money having been spent amounts to an alteration of defendant’s legal position.” We see no reason here for departing from that position; if defendant spent the money, presumably he has either the things which it purchased or the benefit therefrom; or, if, as intimated in a refused offer of proof, he set the fund aside for the benefit of, or gave it to, his mother (for whose support he had a contingent legal liability), this cannot fairly be said to represent a loss to him, which bars plaintiffs. In brief, while no doubt there was negligence connected with the payment, and Mr. Johnson’s letter may have misled the trust company into its carelessness, yet there is no evidence the legacy was intentionally paid without regard to, or waiving the controlling facts. Plaintiffs derived no benefit from the transaction, and no facts <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>appear which, in equity and good conscience, either entitle defendant to retain the money or estop plaintiffs from recovery; the court helow erred in ruling otherwise.</p>

The court below held that they could not recover it back, because it had been made under a mistake rof law. A majority of this court held that the payment was made under a mistake of fact, and, therefore, can be recovered back. I am unable to understand how it is possible to say that the payment was made under a mistake of fact. No facts in the case are in dispute, and it conclusively appears from the testimony submitted by the plaintiffs themselves that at the time they made the payment they were not mistaken as to any fact in connection with it. By the will of the testator the sum of $5,000 was given to his brother, William F. Kunkel, if living at the time of his death. The brother died before <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>him, leaving the appellee as his only child, to whom the appellants paid the sum of $5,000, which would have gone as a legacy to his father if he had survived the testator. There was no mistake as to any of the facts at the time the payment was made, for there was no question as to them; but there was, however, a legal question involved, and that was the right of the appellee to receive, under the will of his uncle, the sum which the executors paid him. They could pay it to him only if the will authorized them to pay it, and this involved the construction of that instrument, which admittedly was purely a matter of law. A copy of it was sent to Mr. Johnson, who acknowledged its receipt, and, with it evidently before him, he advised the executors that they could pay the appellee. This was a legal misconstruction of the testator’s will, of course inadvertently made, but nevertheless it was a mistake of the law applicable to the provisions of the will under the undisputed facts in the case, the material one being that William F. Kunkel had died before the testator, and, as a matter of law, the legacy to him had lapsed. Even good Homer sometimes nodded. If the payment was made under Mr. Johnson’s advice, it was clearly made under a mistake of law; if it had been made without his advice, it would still have been under a mistake of law, for the executors had a copy of the will in their possession, and, as they are conclusively presumed to have had knowledge of its provisions, the construction of them, under the undisputed facts, involved only legal questions.</p>

A reference may be made to the first and principal one cited. In Union Trust Company of New York v. Gilpin, the construction of the will of the testator was not in question. The money paid by the plaintiffs was paid under a mistaken identity of a trustee, which was, of course, a mistake of fact, and on that ground alone a recovery was <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>sustained, tbe court below saying, wbat we approved, that “Tbe payment was tbe result of a mistake on tbe part of some officer of tbe trust company in failing to note tbe identity of tbe trustee named in tbe first paragraph” of testator’s will.
