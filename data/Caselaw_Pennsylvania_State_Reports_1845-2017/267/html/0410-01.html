Certificates of membership in beneficial associations are not insurance policies -within the meaning of the Act of May 11, 1881, P. L. 20; hence, when the application for membership and laws of an association of this kind are by reference made part of the contract of membership, they must, if obtainable, be placed in evidence by plaintiff in a case against the association, unless he gives a good and legally sufficient reason for not doing so, or defendant produces them. Of course, if it be shown the association in question is conducting an insurance business that will suffice.</p>

The character of the business of an incorporated association having the name of “Fraternities Accident Order” must be determined by the proved facts, although the presumption is that the business is what the association, in its certificate of membership, declares it to be; but this is prima facie only, and may be overcome by evidence.</p>

In an action upon a contract of membership of such an order, to recover death benefits, it is reversible error for the court to rule as a matter of law that the certificate of membership was a “contract of life insurance,” notwithstanding the presumption to the contrary, and the fact that the evidence depended upon to make out plaintiff’s case, both in this and other respects, was largely oral, which required the issues to be submitted to the jury — particularly the question whether the “Fraternities Accident Order” was actually carrying on an insurance business.</p>

The latter’s certificate remains the contract or application of the order, the casualty company merely undertaking to carry out its terms.

That is to say, should the jury find such facts as, under our authorities, constitute the doing of an insurance business, then the absence of the application and by-laws will be excused, and, if the other facts essential to her case are proved, the verdict must follow for plaintiff; on the other hand, should facts sufficient to show the doing of an insurance business be not established to <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>the satisfaction of the jury, then, since in that event plaintiff will be in the situation of having failed to either produce the entire contract or account for its absence, she cannot recover, and the court must instruct accordingly. Finally, should the proofs on the point under discussion be legally insufficient to justify their submission to the jury, this, for the same reason, will end the case in favor of defendant; but, of course, if the membership application and laws of the order are offered and accepted in evidence, and the casualty company defends thereon, that will put a different aspect upon the case — which, since it has in no sense been developed, we are not at present in a position to discuss.</p>
