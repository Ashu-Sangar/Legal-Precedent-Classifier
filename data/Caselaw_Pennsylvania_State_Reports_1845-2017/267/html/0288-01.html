It attempts to describe a lot, but beyond the fact that it is located on Main street in the Borough of Duryea nothing appears. The number, block, depth and width are left blank; no adjoining property is mentioned or other means of identification. It does not, so far as it goes, correspond with the property described in plaintiff’s bill, which includes one lot and part of another. True, the option contains the added words, “and improved silk mill and all silk machinery, tools and equipment formerly Dutton Silk Co. mill.” That might be a sufficient description of the silk mill, but not of the lot; in fact, the contract does not state, unless by inference, that the mill is located on the lot in question; even if so considered, we do not know what amount of land, or how large a lot goes with the mill. That is, treating the description of the mill as sufficient there is nothing to indicate what amount of land if any is to be conveyed with it. Plaintiff is not praying for a conveyance of the silk mill but of certain lots whereon he claims it is located; but there is no allegation that the mill covers the entire lots, and, as at best the contract sufficiently describes nothing but the mill, he is not entitled to a decree for a conveyance of the lots. As the description of the lot is manifestly bad and that of the mill not sufficient to include the lots set out in the bill, there is at least such a doubt as to preclude specific performance of the contract. Certainly defendant could not compel plaintiff to accept a deed for the property described as in the option. Equity will not decree the specific performance of a contract unless its terms are clear and capable of ascertainment from the instrument itself (Hammer v. McEldowney, <a href="/pa/46/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="46 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="420624" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0334-01">46 Pa. 334</a>; Reilly v.
