Where, in a negligence ease, defendant sets up a release of damages executed by plaintiff, and the latter seeks to have the jury disregard it, and the essential facts in regard to its execution are in dispute, the burden is on plaintiff to prove the facts upon which he relies, beyond a reasonable doubt, by evidence which is clear, precise and indubitable, and by witnesses who are credible, who distinctly remember the facts to which they testify, and narrate the details exactly.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b285-5" data-blocks='[["BL_285.8",285,[165,1202,1154,501]]]'>2. The requirement that the statements of the witnesses must be indubitable, or true (so far as the appellate court is concerned with its application to the preliminary consideration of the evidence by the court, to judge of its sufficiency to go to the jury), simply means that, disregarding counter attacks on plaintiff’s proof, such statements must have the appearance of truth at least to the extent of being free from manifest inconsistencies, or marks of inherent <em>unreliability; </em>of course, every slight departure or variation in testimony will not condemn the proofs as insufficient. The trial judge, in such cases, in passing upon the sufficiency of the evidence to measure up to the required standard, acts as a chancellor.</p>

In an action against a street railway company by a husband and wife to recover damages for personal injuries suffered by the wife, defendant set up as a defense a release executed by both plaintiffs in presence of defendant’s agent and another disinterested subscribing witness, not produced at the trial. The facts set up by plaintiffs, but mostly denied by defendant, were in effect that on the morning following the accident the husband informed defendant of the accident. A few hours later a claim agent of defendant called at plaintiff’s residence and in the presence of the husband took a written statement from the wife in which a claim wa^ made against defendant for the sum of $25 to cover damages suffered by reason of the accident. When upon the stand, the husband more than once denied that any such claim had been made, asserting he was “positive about that,” also ’saying he was “positive” the subject of a settlement was not even discussed at the time, or until the third visit of the agent. He also emphatically denied that his wife had signed any statement whatever concerning the accident; but, when shown the writing containing his own signature as a witness, he retracted his former testimony, with the excuse that the matter had been so long ago he could not remember. He did not allege any irregularity in connection with the procurement of this paper. The testimony of the husband and wife was all that was offered as to the subsequent execution of the release, and they differed from each other in several material respects. The release was executed seven days after the accident, after several visits by defendant’s agent, known to them as an adjuster of claims representing defendant, and resulted in the payment to plaintiff of the sum of $20, an, amount midway between $15 origi<a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>nally offered by defendant and $25 first claimed by plaintiffs. There were two subscribing witnesses, one defendant’s agent and the other an entirely disinterested witness. The latter was not produced at the trial, it being testified on plaintiff’s behalf that she was dead, although it appears by affidavit since filed that the witness is still alive. Both husband and wife testified they executed the release without reading it, and in ignorance of its contents. The husband’s excuse was that his wife was crying at the time he put his signature thereto, and when he asked the agent “What is on this paper?” the latter “flew up like a wild tiger, just as much as to say 'What do you ask me that for, what do you think I am?’ ” Then, plaintiff said: “I simply signed it.” After this he was asked: “Did you read it before you signed it?” to which he replied : “No, sir, he wouldn’t let me,” but made no further explanation. There were also allegations by plaintiff that the paper was folded in such a way that he could not observe its contents, and that the agent told him it was a “receipt” for money paid to date, ■and he would return later, and make other payments, to culminate in a final settlement. The husband was a man of fair English education, a bookkeeper by profession, engaged at a salary of $3,000 a year as an auditor of accounts, and trained to be “accurate and careful.”</p>

The case is treated as though there were no evidence of fraud present; and this apparently because of the insufficiency of the testimony as to plaintiff’s unconsciousness ; for, if plaintiff were really in a state of unconsciousness, when the release was taken from him, and defendant knew it, the obtaining of the paper under such cii’cumstances would, in itself, be a fraud. This authority is valuable here, for it clearly rules that tbe trial judge, in such cases, acts as a chancellor in passing on the legal sufficiency of the proofs (pp. 576-7) — as to Avhether or not they measure up to the standard required — and, if he considers the evidence not of a quality to be reasonably found “indubitable,” he should not submit it to the jury.</p>

Plaintiff testified a man called at her house, claiming he was a friend of the car conductor who had caused the accident, and said he had come to see her in regard to getting the former reinstated in his position. At a second interview, this man inquired how much expense she had been put to, and, when told $5, gave her the amount, asking for a receipt. He produced a paper, folded in such way plaintiff could not read it; neither did he read it to her, but designated the place where he desired her to sign. Plaintiff did not know the man was a representative of the company. This testimony was fully corroborated by a disinterested witness. We said (p. 541) that defendant’s agent not only misrepresented the true character of the release, but “prevented” its contents from being known, and this, taken with the other circumstances in the case, constituted such fraud as to avoid the instrument. However, we there expressly recognize the authority of Pa. R. R. Co. v. Shay, <a href="/pa/82/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="82 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1047995" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0198-01">82 Pa. 198</a>; and DeDouglas v.

These facts, <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>■with other apparent differences, distinguish the case from the one now on appeal.</p>

Judgment, entered on a verdict for plaintiff, was affirmed. A payment of $150 had been made at the time the release was signed; but plaintiff presented evidence to show he was then in an enfeebled mental condition, as the result of a “head operation,” necessitated by the accident; that the representative of defendant informed him the '$150 was a gratuity from his employers, “to put” him over the holidays, and the word “release” was not mentioned; that a document was placed before him with only the signature line exposed; and he was hurried in the execution of the paper, which the representative of the company stated was merely a receipt. We said (p. 335) the evidence was sufficient to justify the plea that plaintiff’s mind “was so enfeebled at the time he signed the paper he could readily have been made a dupe of designing persons,” and this, together with the other evidence in the case, was ample to sustain a finding that he was deceived and defrauded into the execution of the alleged release, adding, “the fact that plaintiff did not read or require the paper to be read to him” could not (under the peculiar circumstances) be given binding effect, for he had not been afforded a “fair opportunity for examination” thereof, and had been deceived as to its contents. We there note the distinction between cases where the effort is to “reform” and those in which the attempt is to “set aside” written instruments; also, in the latter class of cases, <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>the difference between those where either the “element of frand or mental enfeeblement” appears, and instances where snch elements are lacking. Here, in the pending case, the effort is to set aside the release, and, while frand in its procurement is alleged, the evidence depended upon to prove that element fell short of the legal standard required for the purpose, as already shown in our review thereof, and as we shall hereinafter briefly discuss. The facts at bar and those in the last cited case differ in many apparent respects.</p>

At trial, there was ample evidence, — both lay and expert,— to sustain plaintiff’s contention that the release had been executed when he was mentally incapable; and the issue was decided accordingly. All that is said in the opinion of the court below, affirming judgment on the verdict (adopted per curiam) must be read with the peculiar facts of the case in mind. This definition, relevant here, is there approved: “Indubitable proof is evidence that is not only found to be credible, but of such weight and directness as to make out the facts alleged beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>

Plaintiff admitted some money was given him by his employers; but said it was at a time when he was suffering intensely from the effects of an amputated arm. The agent of defendant, who called to get the release, did not make known to plaintiff who he was, and the latter did not know him; he told the injured man that he was going to give him a “little money,” as a “present” from his employers, “to help Aim out on expenses.” Plaintiff had no recollection of signing the release, — which contained only his mark — or any other paper, and he denied that the man, who brought the money, said anything about a settlement of his claim against defendant. He was corroborated by his wife.

He testified the agent of the company, which insured defendant, got his signature by pretending to have a telephone conversation with his, plaintiff’s, doctor, an eminent eye-specialist, “in which the agent quoted the doctor,” who had just examined plaintiff, as saying the latter’s right eye, “would come out all right, and he would soon be able to resume his work.” The injured man, relying on the information thus conveyed to him, as to his physical prospects for the future, signed the release; whereas the pretended conversation was an absolute falsehood, and plaintiff soon afterwards lost the sight of his eye. We sustained a judgment entered on a verdict against defendant; for the evidence was ample in every way to show a direct case of fraud in the procurement of the release.</p>

On appeal, affirming judgment in his favor, we said that, since defendant’s own, principal, witness had proved the alleged release to have been procured under such circumstances as to destroy entirely its effectiveness, it was “not in a position successfully to maintain plaintiff had failed to produce sufficient evidence to that end.” While the statement just quoted is sufficient to distinguish the case from the one now before us, yet another distinguishing point between the two is the illiteracy of Palkovitz, as compared with the plaintiff at bar, who is a man of fair English education, a bookkeeper by profession, en<a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>gaged, at a salary of $3,000 a year, as an auditor of accounts, which work had trained him to be “accurate and careful,” as he admitted on the stand.</p>

The first mentioned requirements mean that the witnesses must be credible, distinctly remember the facts to which they testify and narrate the details exactly (Lindemann v. Pittsburgh Eys. Co., supra); and, to the extent we are at present concerned with the last requirement — that the statement of the witnesses must be indubitable, or true (that is, so far as we are concerned with its application to the preliminary consideration of the evidence by the court, to judge of its sufficiency to go to the jury) — it simply means that, disregarding counter-attacks on plaintiff’s proofs, they must have the appearance of truth, at least to the extent of being free from manifest inconsistencies, or marks of inherent unreliability. Unfortunately for plaintiff, this cannot be said of the testimony upon which he depends, and the court below erred in law when it refused so to hold.</p>

In many such cases the injured party is led to believe he is or will be without means to pay expensive doctors’ bills or prosecute still more expensive litigation ; and neither he nor the members of his immediate family then know the extent of the injury, or are in a mental condition to enable them accurately to weigh the suggestions made or to appreciate the selfishness of the intruder, and hence are easily misled into signing papers which are their undoing. Releases thus obtained are generally for grossly inadequate sums, and agreements to have the ambulance chaser prosecute a suit to recover damages for the injury, are usually so drawn as to irrevocably give him inordinate contingent fees, and to leave the parties who sign them liable to other litigation if they settle with the defendant. The claim adjuster minimizes the injury, and out of a boundless ignorance does not hesitate to assert positively that under no circumstances can damages be recovered, and the runner out of a like ignorance with equal positiveness asserts that a recovery is certain if his ambulance chaser is employed; each specifies cases wherein his judgment has been proved sound, and at times neither hesitates to so state his case as to convey the impression that no small measure of his success grows out of his influence with the courts. By flattery, persuasion and well expressed though <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>often imaginary sympathy, one or tbe other obtains the confidence of the injured party, though ostensibly dealing with him at arm’s length, and through the confidence thus acquired gets the paper signed. For the reasons thus briefly outlined, which do not relate to this case but to the subject generally, I would, were the matter res nova, unhesitatingly hold that the burden of proof of full knowledge and fair treatment was upon those who rely upon papers obtained under such circumstances ; as it is not, the remedy, if one is to be applied, must be obtained by legislation.</p>
