During the construction,- the broom corn was removed to near-by bams, and, upon the completion of the buildings, it was removed to the new warehouse, No. 1 receiving the broom corn for immediate use, and No. 2 that for storage. During the construction period the change on the policies was provided for by a “binder,” and when the new warehouses were completed the binders were removed and specific insurance was taken out on No. 1 and No. 2; and the old policies were put in force “to cover as originally written.” Later the contents of No. 2 were destroyed by fire, and it was claimed that the loss was covered by the original policies, or that the company was estopped from asserting the contrary, because a counterman, an employee of the insurance company’s subagent, said, when the binders were cancelled and the new arrangement was made, that “the form was broad enough to cover any warehouse around there, <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>that is a frame warehouse.” The policy provided that the company should not be bound by any waiver of any condition of the policy by an agent or other representative unless the same were endorsed thereon or added thereto.

During the period of construction, the broom corn was removed to near-by barns, and upon the completion of the buildings it was returned to the two new warehouses. No. 1 contained the broom corn for immediate use and No. 2 that for storage. When the broom corn was deposited in barns during the construction, the change on the policies was provided for by a writing called a “binder,” and, when the new warehouses were completed, the binders were removed and specific insurance was taken out on No. 1 and No. 2; and the old policies were put in force “to cover as originally written.” Later, the contents of building No. 2 were destroyed by fire and it is claimed that the loss was covered by the original policies of insurance, containing the above clause, or that the company was estopped from asserting the contrary, because of statements made by the counterman, an employee of the defendant’s subagent.</p>

Recovery can be had only when <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>the loss is brought fairly within the terms of the contract or by reasonable intendment covered by it. If doubt exists as to the meaning, it should be resolved in favor of the assured rather than in the interests of the insurer. The Standard Policy Act does not modify this principle, as the subject-matter of insurance is expressed in the language of the insurer. The plain provisions of the policy insured broom corn, contained in the frame warehouse building 100 feet from the factory building. This language is clear and unambiguous and cannot be construed to mean otherwise than what it says. Had it been an agreement of sale, it could hardly be contended that it would include broom corn in another building. If it was not the continuing presence of the broom corn in the building mentioned, why the necessity of adding the words “but not removed” after “broom corn...... held in trust or on consignment or sold,” and why was authority given to make additions, alterations and repairs to the building and this policy to cover the same (broom corn), if the insurer did not intend to limit its liability to broom corn contained in the frame warehouse building detached about 100 feet from the factory building? The language was not merely descriptive of the subject-matter, but the words used, with other facts quoted, make it a direct provision not only as to location at the time of insurance but also that the things insured would continue to remain there: Lycoming County Ins. Co. v. Updegraff, <a href="/pa/40/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="40 Pa. 311" data-case-ids="477976" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0311-01">40 Pa. 311</a>; Haws v. St. Paul F. &amp; M.

It may be that a policy can be framed so that statements with regard to the use and character of the building will be merely descriptive or an identification of the risk at the time of insurance, and not á warranty that there shall be no change during the life of the policy: Wood on Insurance, 444 and 446; but this is not such a case, as the primary object was the insurance of the merchandise as it was contained in such building.</p>

One would scarcely consider the language as an expression of a considerate judgment on a question of so much importance. There was no limit as to the location of the warehouses. It might have included such houses at any place in Ateo. It in no way considered the risk or hazard to be encountered and whether the company was assuming more or less by reason of the location of the warehouse.

Nor do we consider the adjustment of the terms as an assertion of the acceptance of the policies under conditions that could apply only to both new buildings. Specific insurance was thereafter taken out on the broom corn in building No. 1 and building No. 2, and when the binders were cancelled the endorsement on the policies read “Policy to cover as originally written.” This covered the broom corn in the warehouse as first described and afterwards rebuilt. The rerating did not affect the insurer’s liability as first undertaken. The offer to prove by custom that the policy covered contents of building No. 2 was properly rejected. There was nothing on the record to show that the counterman or subagent had authority to waive by parol the conditions of the policy, nor was there any attempt to prove such custom. As the record stood, it was not error to reject the offer.</p>
