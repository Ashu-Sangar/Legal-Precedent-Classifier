The defendant refused to accept the deed and refused to pay the stipulated purchase price, claiming that the premises were subject to an encumbrance, in that <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>Lot No. 25, one of the lots to be conveyed, was entirely included within the lines of Federal Lane as originally laid out and that Lot No. 6 was crossed for its entire width by the lane, an unopened street, approximately eighty feet in width.</p>
