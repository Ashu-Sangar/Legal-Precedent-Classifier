Power, <a href="/pa/263/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="263 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="1047418" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0287-01">263 Pa. 287</a>.

It appears by tbe third paragraph of tbe bill that some of tbe owners of tbe property are minors. Louis Mandel and Paul Mandel can, therefore, have but a share or part in it. That such is tbe fact is expressly alleged in tbe first paragraph. Tbe plaintiffs’ prayer is, accordingly, that specific performance of tbe contract be enforced as to a portion only of its subject-matter. Tbe agreement provides for tbe sale of a piece of land in its entirety, and not in parts. Tbe whole transaction was predicated upon its approval by tbe orphans’ court. . That condition has not yet been fulfilled. Tbe defendants’ failure to press to final disposition tbe petition for approval pending in that court may or may not give ground for an action against them at law for damages, but it does not have tbe effect of entitling tbe plaintiffs to a decree in equity for tbe carrying out of an arrangement different <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>entirely from that contemplated by the agreement between the parties.</p>
