      <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>The will of George T. Oliver gives all of his estate to three trustees, in trust to pay his debts and after their payment to distribute the estate in their hands to the beneficiaries named in the will. It gives the trustees power to manage the property and to make certain payments in their discretion, and provides that, in ten years from the death of the testator, or at any time before that date the trustees may deem expedient, the trust shall terminate; and it gives, devises and bequeaths the equal one-sixth part of his estate then in the hands of the trustees to each of his children, naming them, and authorizes his trustees in their discretion to make distribution in whole or in part at any time before the expiration of ten years. The will then continues: “Upon the death of any of my children leaving issue, the share of each child shall be distributed to each of his or her children, and upon the death of any of my children without issue, such share shall be distributed to his or her heirs, being of my blood or such thereof as such child shall have designated by his or her last will and testament.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b464-4" data-blocks='[["BL_464.5",464,[294,1501,1148,315]]]'>It is contended by the plaintiffs that the effect of these provisions is to give each of the children a vested interest in one undivided sixth of the property, subject to the trust; and on the part of the defendant that the interests of the plaintiffs are contingent upon their living until the distribution is made.</p>

In the latter case the gifts are clearly contingent, at least until the time of distribution, and in the former they were vested at the death of the testator. There is a general rule recognized in a multitude of cases which refers a period of survivorship to the death of the testator in the ab<a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>sence of a fair indication in the will that the testator meant otherwise: Stoner v. Wunderlich, <a href="/pa/198/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="198 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="920291" data-case-paths="/pa/198/0158-01">198 Pa. 158</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b465-3" data-blocks='[["BL_465.5",465,[220,410,1149,313]]]'>The word “surviving” or “living” is not used in this will, but the phrase “that upon the death of my children,” which must mean “if my children should die,” has precisely the same effect in a different form, that of applying one rule to children who survive and another to those who do not.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b465-4" data-blocks='[["BL_465.6",465,[217,741,1152,760]]]'>The whole case, therefore, turns upon the question whether or not there is anything in the will which indicates that the testator referred the death of his children spoken of by him to a period after his own death. There is but one clause of the will which seems to bear upon the matter, one way or the other, and that is the provisions that upon the death of any of his children without issue their share shall go to the heirs of his blood, “or such thereof as such child shall have designated by his last will and testament.” We are unable to see how the testator could have meant that any of his children in his lifetime should designate those of his heirs of the blood of the testator to whom he desired that any part of the testator’s estate should go.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b465-5" data-blocks='[["BL_465.7",465,[217,1512,1150,476]]]'>We are of opinion, therefore, that these words contain a clear indication that the testator did not contemplate the death of his children before himself, but their death before the distribution. If this view be correct, the estates of the children are contingent. We think it doubtful if the testator meant to produce this result by the words of his will, but we must take them as they are. In this view of the meaning of the will, the plaintiffs cannot recover.</p>
