The State Camp of Pennsylvania of the Patriotic Order Sons of America, plaintiff, was incorporated by special Acts of February 27, 1867, P. L. 285, and of March 18, 1869, P. L. 396. Thereafter it established a local camp at Weiss-port, Carbon County, known as Washington Camp No. 122 of the State of Pennsylvania of the Patriotic Order Sons of America, of which defendant, Charles F. Kelley, was duly elected treasurer for the year beginning Febru<a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>ary 10, 1902. On that day he gave bond to plaintiff in $2,000 for the faithful performance of his duties as such, with appellants as sureties, conditioned: “That if the above bounden treasurer shall and will from time to time, and at all times hereafter, for and during the above-mentioned term of office, and for and during any one or more subsequent terms for which he may hereafter be elected treasurer of the said camp, and until he shall deliver all the property which he may have received as such treasurer, to his successor in office, or to such other person or persons of said camp, as its authorized officers may direct, well and faithfully perform and discharge all and singular the duties now required or which may hereafter be required of him as treasurer aforesaid, by the constitution, charter, local laws, rules and regulations of said camp, at the expiration of said term of office, or at the expiration of any subsequent term for which he may hereafter be elected, and whenever he shall cease to be treasurer, upon request to him or them made, shall make and give unto said auditor or auditors as shall be appointed by the said camp, a just and true account of all such sum or sums of money, goods, and chattels, and other things, as have come unto his hands, charge, or possession, as treasurer aforesaid, during the term above mentioned, or during any subsequent term for which he may hereafter be elected, and shall and do pay and deliver over to his successor in office, or to such person or persons as said camp or its authorized officers may direct, all such balance or sums of money, goods, and chattels, and other things, which shall appear to be in his hands, and due from him to the said camp, then this obligation to be void, or else to be and remain in full force and virtue, and we hereby empower any attorney of any court of record of Pennsylvania, or elsewhere, to appear for us and confess judgment in favor of the above-named obligee for the said sum of two thousand dollars.”</p>

      <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>The local camp was then an unincorporated association, but was chartered by the court two months thereafter, to wit: in April, 1902. However, the affairs of the society continued the same after as before its incorporation, with the same members, officers, property, etc., and with no change in the duties or liabilities of the treasurer. In fact the bond makes no reference to the status of the local camp as to being incorporated or otherwise, its corporate name being “Washington Camp No. 122, Patriotic Order Sons of America.” The valuable papers of the local camp, including the bond, were placed in the custody of Kelley as treasurer and kept by him in the camp’s safe or box. By successive reelections he was continued as treasurer until 1917, when he became bankrupt and it was discovered that he had misappropriated $3,733 of the local camp’s funds. Thereupon, by leave of court, judgment for $2,000 was entered on the bond, which appellants petitioned the court below to open, and permit them as sureties to make defense. The petition admits the execution of the bond and that Kelley was elected and continued as such treasurer until 1917; but avers: “That the said bond was never tendered to the said Washington Camp No. 122 nor was it ever accepted by it. That there is no money due on said bond to the State Camp of Pennsylvania of the Patriotic Order Sons of America. That there is no money due on said bond to the said Washington Camp No. 122. That the conditions of the said bond have been duly and fully complied with.” Plaintiff filed an answer specifically denying these averments; thereupon testimony was taken and the court below, upon due consideration, discharged the rule to open the judgment; from which we have this appeal.</p>

The court, sitting as a chancellor, will not grant such application on mere technical ground nor to enable the defendant to interpose a technical defense: McKee v.

He who seeks relief from a regular judgment must allege and prove that it is unjust. Here the formal change of the beneficiary from an unincorporated to an incorporated association made no practical difference and, hence, its interposition here is purely technical, as is also the suggestion that the chai’ter omits from the name of the local camp the words “of the State of Pennsylvania,” and neither could avail if properly pleaded. Moreover, it is not a question of what might have been interposed before judgment but of what is sufficient to move the conscience of the chancellor after judgment.</p>
