They were advised that they would be held liable for the accident occurring to Marie Brolasky and were recognized as the contractors doing the work. It was not an attempt to notify <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>defendant, nor to charge defendant through its agents. However, plaintiff had every advantage of its position that the record was prima facie evidence. The case was submitted to the jury and it was decided adversely to plaintiff’s contention that defendant had not provided sufficient safeguards or was careless in the construction of the work. It is now contended binding instructions should have been given for appellant. This was not possible. The record of the former trial was not conclusive. Admitting for the purpose of this case, that it was prima facie evidence, it was only such as to the facts therein contained. The contractor was liable to the owner under the indemnity clause for the acts of the subcontractor, but it was not liable to third persons for injuries occasioned by the negligent acts of the same subcontractor. The owner, here plaintiff, recognized the subcontractor as doing the work, from the notice it served. If it wished to affect the indemnitor, contractor, notice should have been given. When recovery was had and this action was brought for recoupment, it must appear that the wrong complained of by the indemnitee was within the terms of the contract as we have discussed them. This was not done by the record of the former trial alone. It showed certain facts, — that Marie Brolasky was injured by the carelessness of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company’s servants, who failed to maintain a safe station. The statement of claim in the present case charging acts within the contract was not self-proving. It required evidence to connect defendant with the wrong complained of within the terms of the contract. While the former trial showed an unsafe station, it was necessary in this case to show that it was unsafe because defendant or its representatives failed to provide proper, sufficient and necessary safeguards, through which failure plaintiff was compelled to pay a sum of money for an accident occasioned thereby. Plaintiff, realizing this, offered evidence to bring the case within the terms of the contract, by showing the acts of <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>the servants of Gray &amp; Sons, the subcontractors, for whom defendant was liable. There was evidence from which the jury might have found either way and their verdict was conclusive of the question. The trial court could not have given binding instructions in any event for plaintiff. We have considered all the assignments of error and find no merit in any. They are dismissed.</p>
