Where in an action by a husband and wife against a street railway company to recover damages for injuries to the wife, defendant sets up as a defense a release executed by the husband and wife, the court will not hold that the husband was the agent of the wife in the matter of the execution of the release, and that, having stood silent, she is bound by his acts, where the evidence for the wife, although contradicted, tends to show that the negotiations leading up to the release were carried on by the husband, and not by her; that, at the time of the actual execution of the paper, the wife said she was ill in bed, as a result of the accident; that she wrote her signature where designated by her husband, when the paper was so folded she could not see its contents; and that she was informed by defendant’s agent that the document was a simple receipt for money, and had no idea that it was a release. To so hold would be apt to prove destructive of the family relationship, which the law always sedulously guards.</p>

In such case, the evidence showed that the release was witnessed by the 'signature of a woman, who, the wife testified, was dead. Her statement was accepted as true, and the case was submitted to the jury, who returned a verdict for $3,000 in favor of <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>the wife. The court subsequently directed a new trial “unless the plaintiff [the wife] within ten days files a stipulation that she will accept in full satisfaction of her claim the sum of $2,000......to be paid within thirty days, after notice of the filing of said stipulation......If said stipulation is filed, and payment of said amount with interest, from the date of trial, is not made...... within thirty days, then judgment to be entered on the verdict.” Defendant did not file the stipulation and judgment was entered on the verdict. On appeal there was filed in the Supreme Court a petition, praying that in the event of the court not entering judgment n. o. v. for defendant, it shall either grant a new trial upon the ground of after-discovered evidence, or remit the record to the court below to pass upon such application. Appended to the petition was an affidavit of the subscribing witness to the release, stating that she was alive and willing to testify of facts, which if true, would show that the release was executed by both husband and wife at a time when the latter was well and about, that they both had full knowledge of its contents, and that no fraud had been practiced upon them. <em>Held,, </em>that the Supreme Court would remit the record with permission to the court below to consider the after-discovered evidence, and with direction to enter such order or judgment as law and right required.</p>

Such an order effectually opens the judgment and reinstates the motion for a new' trial, with leave- to the trial court to act thereon as “right and justice under the law may require.” The ease after such order is entered, stands as though no proceedings in the trial court had been taken after the rendering of the verdict.</p>

While, on the other appeal, we reversed and entered judgment for defendant, the distinctions just referred to bring us to a somewhat different conclusion here.</p>
    <p id="b309-3" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[168,703,1148,529]]]'>To begin with, according to the testimony relied upon by Mrs. Ralston, the negotiations leading up to the release were carried on by Mr. Ralston, not by her. Next, at the time of the actual execution of the paper, plaintiff said she was ill in bed, as a result of the accident, and Avrote her signature, where designated by her husband, when the paper was so folded she could not see its contents ; finally, that she was informed the document was a simple receipt for money, and had no idea it was a release.</p>
    <p id="b309-4" data-blocks='[["BL_309.5",309,[168,1253,1148,472]]]'>The material facts of plaintiff’s testimony are denied; but, accepting her story as true, defendant contends that, she having stood silent, the husband ought to be considered, under the circumstances, as her agent, and the wife held bound by his acts, as well as her own. We cannot adopt this theory — it would be too apt to prove destructive of the family relationship, which the law always sedulously guards: Paul v. Kunz, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20Pa.%20501" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="188 Pa. 501">188 Pa. 501</a>, 507-8.</p>

At <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>trial, plaintiff testified that the person last mentioned was dead; her word was not questioned, and Mrs. Beck-man’s death was accepted as a fact by all concerned. There has been a petition filed in this court, which prays that, in the event of our not entering judgment n. o. v. for defendant, we shall either “grant a new trial, upon the ground of after-discovered evidence, or remit the record to the court below to pass upon such application.” An affidavit of Mrs. Beckman is appended to this petition, from which it appears that she is alive and will testify to facts which, if true, show the release to have been executed by both Mr. and Mrs. Ralston at a time when the latter was about and well; further, that they had full knowledge of its contents, and no fraud was practiced upon either of them. Consideration of appellant’s petition, and the answer thereto, which latter is most general, convinces us as to the propriety of the order we shall enter at the end of this opinion; before going further into that subject, however, there is one other point which we deem it wise to discuss.</p>
    <p id="b310-4" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[261,1409,1147,810]]]'>The jury awarded the present plaintiff $3,000 and her husband $2,000 damages.

In that instance the evidence shows $250, of the amount claimed by plaintiff, to be “a sort of premium for prompt payment.” The court directed the deduction of that amount from the verdict, “within ten days,” by a remittitur, and, in default thereof, a new trial; further, if defendant did not pay the reduced verdict within the time set, judgment was to be entered in full. In disposing of an assignment of error, attacking this procedure, we said, in effect, that it merely represented an effort on the part of the court below to carry out the spirit of the arrangement between the parties — as to a deduction for prompt payment, adding, “the order providing for it [the carrying out of such arrangement] was made for the benefit of the defendant”; we, therefore, overruled the assignment.</p>

York Rys. Co., <a href="/pa/225/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="225 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="965264" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0419-01">225 Pa. 419</a>, 426; also see Kuhn v. North, 10 S. &amp; R. 398, 409. Under such circumstances, the court below in effect certifies that, on consideration of the evidence, it cannot in good conscience support a verdict beyond a certain limit, and hence it gives plaintiff the choice between accepting the amount fixed or a new trial. A subsequent stipulation, such as we now have before us, that, if the reduced amount is not paid within a set time, judgment shall be entered for the original (excessive) verdict, is inconsistent with what, in the absence of further explanation, we must assume to be the grounds for the reduction. Moreover, if such orders become general, the practice is likely to work unjust discrimination between litigants; for example, a defendant, who is financially unable either to pay or secure payment of a reduced verdict within the given period, will be penalized, whereas one similarly situated in all other respects, but financially able to comply with the court’s stipula<a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>tion, will escape this penalty.
