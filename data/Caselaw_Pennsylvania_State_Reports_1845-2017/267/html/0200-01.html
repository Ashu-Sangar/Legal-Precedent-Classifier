Ferry street is 69 feet 2 inches wide between house lines, and the first rail of the trolley tracks is 27 feet <em>4 </em>inches from the north house line.

On the evidence, the court below very properly submitted these issues to the jury, and they were found against defendant; but appellant contends plaintiff confessed she willingly joined the driver of the automobile in testing a known danger, which, in itself, should put her out of court. Let us see how far this is true.</p>
    <p id="b233-5" data-blocks='[["BL_233.6",233,[181,2188,1148,211]],["BL_234.1",234,[284,328,1152,1668]]]'>On cross-examination, Miss .Minnich testified she knew a trolley car was “about due at that time”; defendant’s attorney then said, “But you were willing to take a chance with him in going across there without stop<a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>ping or slowing np to see if there was a car coming,” adding the query, “Weren’t you?” to which she answered, “Yes, sir.” This incident in the examination was called to the attention of the jurors by the trial judge, who told them to consider it. In so doing, however, they, no doubt, very properly took into consideration the fact that the words of plaintiff’s so-called confession of fault were really those of her cross-examiner, and that Garr, who was driving at a moderate speed, not only had his machine under apparent control, but was indicating a sense of care and responsibility by sounding his horn, while Miss Minnich was also keeping a lookout for danger; furthermore, the jurors had a right to regard the fact that the intersection in question is not peculiarly disadvantageous, so far as opportunities for view are concerned, nor, like a railroad crossing, inherently perilous. Plaintiff was not obliged to anticipate she was taking a chance on a trolley car advancing upon her without warning, at the negligent rate of 25 miles an hour (Simon v. Lit Bros., <em><a href="/pa/264/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="264 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1048503" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0121-01">264 </a></em><a href="/pa/264/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="264 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1048503" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0121-01">Pa. 121</a>), particularly when the near side of the street was a designated and usual stopping place; we cannot say, as a matter of law, she meant to suggest a willingness so to do — that was for the jury to decide. When all the elements present are given due weight, it is in no way apparent that plaintiff in any real sense joined the driver in testing a danger, or that, on cross-examination, she expressed a willingness to take any other or greater chance than every automobile passenger must take when traveling upon built-up city streets, in approaching a trolley line.</p>
