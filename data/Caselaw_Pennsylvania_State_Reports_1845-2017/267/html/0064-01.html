    <p id="b97-3" data-blocks='[["BL_97.4",97,[169,638,1150,639]]]'>A short time prior to September 20,1916, and apparently for the purpose of taking advantage of the fact that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company had reduced its rate, defendant filed a new schedule increasing its rate between the points named, to become effective on that date, before which time a number of interested parties filed with the commission complaints there-against. Pending the hearing of these complaints, and during the period after said effective date, plaintiff, as required by law, paid defendant at the increased rate, being entitled to demand reparation if ultimately it should be decided to be unreasonable.</p>

This was overruled. (2) That, since the complaints were regarding a joint rate, though “made up of two separately established locals or proportionals,” the Pennsylvania Railroad Company should also have been made a party to the proceedings. Upon this point the commission said: “The [local] portion of this through rate imposed by the Pennsylvania is not questioned by either the complainants or the respondents” ; and again: “It is practically conceded by both respondent and complainant that the Pennsylvania local rate is reasonable......To compel the Pennsylvania Railroad Company to appear would be of no particular purpose......Whenever a through rate is adjudged unreasonable, and it is made up of separately imposed proportionals or locals, it may be reduced to a reasonable rate by an order directed against the proportional or local found to be unjust or unreasonable,” citing Interior Iowa Cities Case, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20I.C.C.%2064" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="28 I.C.C. 64">28 I.

No order of reparation was then made because the machinery of the law, so far as it relates to this branch of the investigation, looks only to an inquiry into the reasonableness of the rates objected to, and hence, as will hereinafter be pointed out, the statute requires reparation to be applied for, and granted or refused in a later proceeding.</p>

Defendant attempted to re-raise the question decided in the first proceeding, but this it could not then or thereafter do, not because the facts and laAV there laid down were res ad judicata in the usual acceptation of that term, but because, by article YI, section 31, of the act, defendant’s failure to appeal made all those rulings “conclusive upon all parties affected thereby.” Hence, as between these parties, it was conclusively determined the complaints were in form sufficient to comply with the statute, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company was not a necessary party to the proceedings, and defendant’s proposed new rates were unreasonable. Had an appeal been taken, most of the matters now complained of would have been considered and determined by the Superior Court, for section 24 of the same article requires it then to decide whether or not “the order appealed from is unreasonable or based upon incompetent evidence materially affecting the determination or order of <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>the commission, or is otherwise not in conformity with law.”</p>

This contention, however, overlooks article Y, section 5, which provides that “If, after hearing, upon complaint ......the commission shall determine that any rates which have been collected......by any public service company complained of, were......unjust and unreasonable......the commission shall, upon petition, have the power and authority to make an order for reparation, awarding......the amount of damages sustained in consequence of said unjust, unreasonable or unlawful collections.” This plainly requires the petition for reparation to be filed after the final decision on the question of the reasonableness of the rates. The rehearing referred to in article VI, section 14, is one regarding which a decision has already been made, and not, in the present instance, to the question of reparation, which had not been determined when it is alleged the rehearing should have been asked, and the limitation regarding which, as a new proceeding, is that set forth in article V, section 5, viz: “within two years from the time when the cause of action accrued.” Appellant’s contention in effect is that, because plaintiff asked too soon for an order of reparation, and did not ask for a rehearing, which could only have resulted in another statement that the request was premature, therefore the fifteen days’ limitation, which applies only to applications for a rehearing, effectually defeats the petition when made at the right time and in the right way. The fallacy of this is made all the more manifest when it is remembered the first complaint was made before the effective date of the new schedule, and hence before any collections for which reparation could be ordered; and also, until after <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>the case was finally determined, perhaps years later on appeal, the extent of the excess payments could not be fully known. If it be asked why the legislature required the two proceedings to be kept separate, this record furnishes the answer. Many parties were interested in having the rate determined to be unreasonable, some of whom, being public bodies and not shippers, intervening on behalf of the public generally, never could get reparation. «Each claimant was alone interested in the reparation to be made to him. To hear both matters together would tend to confusion and not to orderly procedure ; would impose upon every party thereto, including defendant, much unnecessary delay and expense; would, if jury trials were permitted on the question of the reasonableness of rates, perhaps result in different rates being held reasonable by different juries; and would be founded on the thought that every carrier, though knowing from its own books the extent of its liability, would not refund when the unreasonableness of its rate had been finally determined.</p>

It cuts off no defense, interposes no obstacle to a full contestation of all the issues, and takes no question of fact from either court or jury. At most, therefore, it is merely a rule of evidence. It does not abridge the right of trial by jury, or take away any of its incidents.

This it did not do, though it made such a motion for other reasons, and hence cannot now be heard to complain on this ground. Indeed the question seems to have been raised for the first time in defendant’s requests for conclusions of law presented after the closing of the evidence. It was then too late; but plaintiff, before the exceptions were decided or final judgment entered, obtained a rule to show cause why the statement should not be so amended as to remove the objections. This rule was made absolute, and the amendment made, and the only objection now suggested is that it should not have been allowed after the evidence was closed and the findings filed.

The rate in force prior to September 20, 1916, was the only rate under which collections could be made until changed in the manner prescribed by law. When defendant undertook to change it, objections were made thereto before the effective date specified in the new schedule, and this put upon appellant the burden of proof of the propriety of the change. The commission was of opinion it did not carry this burden, decided the rate to be unreasonable, and that the technical objections to the proceedings were invalid. From this decision defendant had the right to appeal, but not having done so the findings became conclusive. Plaintiff then petitioned for an order of reparation, which was duly made. It is immaterial upon what evidence the commission fixed the sum named in the order, for in a suit to recover the amount thereof, defendant could offer evidence to reduce or wholly defeat it; the only effect, and that a valid one, being that the sum named was prima facie correct. It is difficult to understand in this case how the commission could have fixed any other sum, since defendant could collect only at the rate specified in the schedules on file and valid, either because no objections were made thereto or if made the rate was sustained by the commission, and hence in determining the new rates to be unreasonable, with no other rate advanced by appellant, it necessarily determined also that the prior rate was the only valid one, and that the excess collection under the new was improperly retained by defendant and hence measured plaintiff’s damages. When suit was brought, instead of offering .countervailing evidence, defendant chose to stand on the reeved and <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>orders of the commission, and the court below, upon this evidence, made so by the statute, found as facts that the rate charged was unreasonable and plaintiff was damaged in the sum named in the order of reparation; and, if we assume the court could inquire into the reasonableness of the rate, it would not aid appellant, for there was sufficient evidence to sustain the findings actually made, and for that reason we cannot review them. Moreover, the ascertainment of this sum was a matter of pure arithmetic, with the basic accounts and calculations alike unchallenged, and with no suggestion of the existence of any other data which could or should be substituted therefor. Indeed the shipments and excess payments were expressly admitted at the trial, and, as shown above, the unreasonableness of the rate was conclusively determined in the first proceeding before the commission.</p>
