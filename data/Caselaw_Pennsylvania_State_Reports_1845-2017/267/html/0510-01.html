It has been frequently ruled in this State that when accountants make voluntary distribution amongst next of kin they do so at their own risk. If any additional authorities are necessary than those set forth in the report of the auditor, White’s Estate, <a href="/pa/163/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="163 Pa. 388" data-case-ids="859062" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0388-01">163 Pa. 388</a>, could be mentioned as an authority wherein the facts are not entirely dissimilar from the case at bar. The facts in that case disclose that an auditor was appointed to make distribution of funds in the hands of the executor, but no notice thereof was given to William White Buckley, an infant and nonresident of the State. A bill of review was granted. Mr. Justice Williams, delivering the opinion for the appellate court, said: “It was doubtless the result of haste and thoughtlessness on the part of the children of the testator, and of a mistaken confidence in his professional opinion on the part of the attorney and auditor. But whatever the fact may be as to the manner in <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>which the proceedings were conducted, the conclusion is inevitable that it was not such an adjudication as could conclude the infant against whom it was rendered without a hearing and without notice. As a settlement of the accounts of the executors it may be conclusive, at least it is not now questioned, but as a decree of distribution it was a nullity so far as the interest of the petitioner is concerned.” Thus in this case in so far as an attempted distribution of the estate is concerned it is entirely void.' It was not disputed that the elder accountant at least knew of the birth of the child and of a visit he paid his mother in the City of Altoona. The mere fact that the accountants had heard nothing from him for a number of years raised no legal presumption of his death; Blair County never was his home. There was no testimony offered to show that the son and claimant was absent or unheard of at his last place of domicile for the statutory period of seven years, in accordance with the Act of 1885, P. L. 155, and, therefore, there was no presumption of death arising. “The place where his absence is to be taken account of is his home, or the place where he customarily stays, rather than a locality far distant”: Shultz’s Est., <a href="/pa-super/46/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="46 Pa.

    <p class="summary" id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.5",540,[262,1635,1146,261]]]'>The accountants rely mainly on the Act of 1903, P. L. 70, interpreted by them to mean that where an estate of the mother of an illegitimate has been actually paid and received by the collateral heirs the illegitimate child is debarred from any participation in the estate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b540-5" data-blocks='[["BL_540.6",540,[259,1908,1146,480]],["BL_541.1",541,[157,333,1151,476]]]'>An act was passed in 1901, P. L. 639, to regulate and define the legal relations of an illegitimate child, or children, its or their heirs, with each other and the mother and her heirs. This act was amended by the Act of 1903, the title of which is, “To amend an act, etc., ......where the estate of such illegitimate or mother has not been actually paid to and received by collateral heirs or the Commonwealth.” Section 4 is as follows: “The intent of this act is to legitimate an illegitimate <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>child and its heirs, as to its mother and her heirs; but is not intended to change the existing law with regard to the father of such child, or their respective heirs and legal representatives. This act shall apply to all cases, now pending, where the estate of such illegitimate or its mother has not been actually paid to and received by collateral heirs or relatives or the Commonwealth, as well as to all such cases happening after the passage of this act.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[158,831,1150,698]]]'>It seems quite obvious that the intent of the legislature was that this law applied to all cases then pending where there was not an actual payment to the collateral heirs, as well as to all cases of illegitimacy in the future. There is no intended inclusion of all cases of illegitimacy where money had been paid to and received by collateral heirs. If that were so one could with very little difficulty or inconvenience render the act practically nugatory by filing an account and making a payment to collateral heirs; the illegitimate child would in that event be entirely debarred. This was not the intent of the legislature, nor does the language bear such an interpretation.</p>
