[The answer proceeds to deny the averments of the petition and sets up the existence of a by-law as follows: “51. The books, accounts and records of the company shall be open to inspection by any member of the board of directors at all times. Stockholders may, in the discretion of the board, inspect the books of the company at such reasonable times as the board of directors may by resolution designate.” It is contended by the learned counsel for defendants that this by-law leaves the whole matter to the discretion of the directors. ■ No such claim can be sustained, and no such by-law can oust the jurisdiction of a court. It is against public policy to adopt such a construction, and, under the facts of the present case, it cannot be considered as a defense to relator’s claim. The fact that he may have voted for its adoption is immaterial.] (1) The answer then goes on to give the history of defendants’ side of the contention, and refers to the criminal suit and to the prior attempts at an examination of the defendants’ books, but the whole matter is summed up in the twenty-eighth paragraph of the answer as follows: “Twenty-eighth: That the said corporation have been willing at all convenient times that the said Henry Wilde and the said accountant, acting with the said Henry Wilde, should have free and complete access to the books and accounts of the said defendant corporation without any process of law whatever, but they have objected and do object to the said Everett Kent examining the same or have anything to do with the same, on account of threats that he has made, the charges of fraud and corruption and dishonesty on the part of the managers and directors of the said company, and do not care to trust their books and accounts in his hands but that there is another attorney employed by the said Henry Wilde, to whom they have no objection whatsoever and are willing to permit an examination by the <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>said plaintiff, the said accountant or any other proper accountant and by the said other attorney or any other reputable attorney that the sa?id Henry Wilde may employ, without process of law for the said purpose.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b361-3" data-blocks='[["BL_361.4",361,[169,546,1155,1030]]]'>The sum and substance of the answer is that they are willing to have the relator and his accountant and any other attorney except Everett Kent examine the books. In volume 10 of Cyc., page 958, it is said to be the law that a stockholder is not confined to a personal inspection by himself, but may exercise this right through an agent, attorney, solicitor, counsel or expert. A reference to the cases that we cited in our former opinion in this case shows that the above is a correct statement of the law in Pennsylvania. [Com. ex rel. Sellers v.

Com. ex rel. Sellers, <a href="/pa/113/0563-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="113 Pa. 563" data-case-ids="457588" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0563-01">113 Pa. 563</a>: “He had a right to a reasonable personal inspection of them, and with the aid of a disinterested expert might make such extracts as were reasonably required in the preparation of the bill he proposed to bring.” Mr. Justice Clark, however, did not say in that case that the question as to whether the expert' was disinterested or not was to be decided by the defendant. There are two other cases in Pennsylvania where allegations of the same character were made to prevent a mandamus. In Kuhbach v. Irving Cut Glass Co., <a href="/pa/220/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="220 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="1005856" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0427-01">220 Pa. 427</a>, the syllabus is: “Where a stockholder furnishes <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>sufficient data to warrant the conclusion that there is mismanagement and that the affairs of the company are not conducted in a proper manner and in the interests of the stockholders, he has a right to demand of the officers of the company permission to examine the books, records and accounts of the corporation so that he may protect his interests by a bill in equity or otherwise; and if the demand is refused and he makes application to the court to enforce it, a mandamus should be awarded. The mere fact that the relator in such a proceeding is a stockholder in a competing company, is not of itself sufficient to deprive him of the relief which he seeks by mandamus; nor is an offer by the defendant company to buy the relator’s stock at a price fixed by t'he company a sufficient answer to his demand for an inspection of the books and papers of the company.” That case is also a demurrer to the return. The court then awarded a peremptory mandamus. Mr. Justice Mestrezat, in that opinion, calls attention to the fact that the averment was simply made on belief, and that it did not aver that it could be supported by proof; but in the subsequent case, Hodder v. George Hogg Co., <a href="/pa/223/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="223 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="960946" data-case-paths="/pa/223/0196-01">223 Pa. 196</a>, Mr. Justice Potter, at the bottom of page 198, said as follows: “It is also there held, that the averment of an intention to file a bill in equity to restrain the officers from mismanagement, and the need of information to that end is sufficient ground for granting the mandamus; and also that the fact that t'he petitioner is interested in a competing company is not a good and sufficient reason for refusing it.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b362-4" data-blocks='[["BL_362.5",362,[274,1954,1152,481]]]'>We think, therefore, that whether there is an averment of ability to prove or not would be immaterial. [Mr. Kent' is a reputable member of this bar. If he should be guilty of unprofessional conduct, it would be the subject of discipline by the court, independently of the present proceeding. The relator has a right to his services as counsel, and it would be intolerable to allow the dictation of the. defendants to prevent him from acting.] (2)T</p>
