To recover damages for injuries caused by the falling of a wall, left standing after a fire, the burden of proof to show negligence by defendant is on plaintiff — who, in this case, is the mother of a child that trespassed on the adjoining property of a third person, and was killed by the wall being blown over on it.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b592-9" data-blocks='[["BL_592.10",592,[314,1812,1148,172]]]'>2. The mere falling of a wall raises no presumption of negligence. The rule of res ipsa loquitur, or of absolute control, does not apply to such case in the courts of Pennsylvania, although the rule is different in other states.</p>

The maxim of res ipsa loquitur applies chiefly to the series of accidents where the rights of the parties injured are closely allied to the rights of the public generally, and the information or means of information as to the occurrence itself is, or was, wholly within the control of the injuring parties.</p>

The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, or of absolute control, as established in this State, is that the evidence of negligence appears when the detailed explanation of the circumstances immediately preceding the accident, the description of the injuring appliance <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>and the testimony from experience show that the thing which happened would not have happened had the injuring appliance or thing been securely in place or properly eared for.

The wall, 59 feet long, 26 feet high, 13 inches thick, was connected with another wall at right angles on the south; a pier stood on its western side at the north end. A lot of H. B. French was on the east. A part of this lot, on the side adjoining the standing wall, was an open yard, enclosed at the southern end by a high board fence, with a large closed gate, and a smaller gate cut into the larger one. The small gate was open for some time before the fire and through it ingress and egress might be obtained. It had been nailed shut quite often, but boys just as often broke it open. Trespass notices were posted on the high fence, and iron fences were erected on Ludlow street, blocking traffic along the destroyed buildings. Children occasionally played in the <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>open yard of the French lot immediately adjoining the standing wall; people sometimes walked across the open space or stopped in it near the wall. Children had been chased from this yard at various times since the fire. Between twelve and one o’clock, Sunday, March 10,1918, these six little boys went into the yard through the small gate and built a fire beside the wall; there was a high wind prevailing; its peak velocity was 47 miles an hour at one time, and its average, for the hour, 32 miles. At, or near, 12:45 p. m., a part of the wall fell, from the wind pressure, across the open yard of the French lot; it killed three of the boys. Plaintiff charged defendant with negligence in permitting the wall to stand without being strengthened or supported. From a judgment in plaintiff’s favor, this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b597-3" data-blocks='[["BL_597.4",597,[153,1126,1153,755]]]'>To establish negligence, it must appear that some duty has been unperformed, and without the violation of the duty there can be no negligence. A duty may be imposed either through the relation of the parties or by statute, and, where there is a duty or an obligation, some right exists in another. Speaking generally of the wall left standing after the fire and with regard to an undoubted right in another, it was appellant’s duty not to negligently, that is, carelessly, commit or omit any act whereby a person or his property might be injured. The standard by which the performance of this duty may be judged is ordinary care under the circumstances, or the conduct of an ordinarily careful person, in relation to the particular duty under consideration.</p>

The part of the wall left standing after the boys were killed bore marks evidencing the close proximity of flames during <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>the fire. Expansion and contraction of the wall from the fire and water weakened if, and, from this cause, or from improper construction, there was not sufficient adhesion between the bricks. Disintegration of the mortar could be seen in the part of the wall left standing after the accident and, no doubt, the same condition existed before the fall. Large beams that had been supported by the wall before the fire had their supports on the opposite ends destroyed, causing the beams to sag and further reduce the strength of the wall. On the trial experts declared the Avail to be defective and unsafe unless properly shored or braced. The jury has so found, and the evidence was sufficient to sustain the finding. Just here it is proper to remark, defendant, in compliance with her obligation of ordinary care, claims she performed such acts which under the law should excuse her from liability? Through her agent, an experienced builder, she employed a competent contractor to tear down or remove such walls or portions thereof as were dangerous. The work was done under the supervision (of two capable builders, representing the Bureau of Building Inspection. It was also supervised by defendant’s agent who declared the walls left standing safe and sound; they were examined by other builders, not employed by defendant, for the purpose of determining t'heir strength, and these men declared the walls safe and sound and suitable in every way to be incorporated in another building. It is not necessary to do more than read these divergent lines of testimony to be convinced the case was for the jury. Defendant was charged with a nondelegable duty to use ordinary care to make her property reasonably safe; if her witnesses had been given full credit by the jury, a finding that she had satisfied the law’s demand would have been sustained; but it was for the jury to decide. The jury found the wall to be defective, and unsafe to remain standing Avithout being properly braced or guarded; in so finding it declared that defendant had not performed <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>lier obligation of ordinary care under the circumstances, —that those employed by her, either through lack of proper inspection, incompetency or misjudgment, failed t'o ascertain the true condition of the wall, as described by plaintiff’s witnesses. This very important dispute in the evidence was submitted under proper instructions from the court.</p>

If the occurrence of the accident should have been foreseen, the intervening cause will not interrupt the connection between the original cause and the injury. High winds are not of infrequent occurrence, and this particular wind was termed an ordinary wind occurring three or four times in a year. It was not an unusual one and it was for the jury to find under all the evidence whether it was likely to have occurred and should have been provided against. We cannot say that the intervening cause was vis major.

The case must not be confused with those where the injured person is a trespasser on the injurer’s property.

Ordinarily, the tender age of a child cannot have the effect of raising a duty where none otherwise existed, and the rule throughout the United States is that the mere fact a trespasser is a child will not create or impose on the owner of a property any duty to keep his premises safe; especially is this true in this State, where the owner does not erect on his premises an attractive appliance, or permit the land to be used as a playground for such length of time as to presuppose an invitation or permission to occupy the premises in this manner. When so used, ordinary care must be exercised to keep the premises in safe condition. Of course, this does not mean occasional or intermittent occupancy of another’s ground by children as a playground — or almost every foot of open or fenced land, would be under the exception to the general rule, and the general rule would then be the exception. The amount of use that will bring otherwise private ground within the playground rule must depend to a large extent on the circumstances of each case. It may be said that the use contemplated is such as to cause the place to be generally known in the immediate vicinity as a recreation center, and its occupancy should be shown to be of such frequency as to impress it with the obligation of ordinary care on the part of the owner. In the case at bar the open lot was frequented <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>by boys every Sunday for four Sundays, and possibly at one or two other times. The court below was clearly right in holding that this was not often or continued enough to presuppose an invitation to use the lot' as a special or general recreation place, or to stamp it as a playground, and the court below was correct in holding that this child and the other children playing there were trespassers so far as tbe owners of the French lot were concerned.

So far as an adjoining owner is concerned, it is the duty of the owner upon whose land something is erected, which has become dangerous because of a conflagration, to take ordinary precautions so that no injury shall befall the adjoining owner, his property, or persons rightfully thereon. If he neglects this duty, and injury results, liability follows. The duty is alike under all circumstances where a right exists in another to use ordinary care to guard against the falling of a wall injured by fire: 1 Corpus Juris, sec. 27, p. 1211, and notes 95 and 96; 1 Thompson on Negligence (2d ed.), sec. 1060, p. 967.

This defendant would be liable to the French owners for any injury inflicted by neglect to their persons or property, or others rightfully there. So much is certain. Can she answer the parents of these children by saying: “I admit my liability to the owners of the French property for injuries inflicted against their person and property, but my liability to you for your loss on their ground extends no further than their liability to you”? What peculiar attribute of property is lodged in one landowner that he can take unto himself the benefits of a defense peculiarly applicable to the person and property of an adjoining landowner to escape liability for an injury he inflicts on a trespasser on land of the adjoining owner? Under the law he has absolutely no right of property in the adjoining lot, and, as to this lot, he is just’ as much a stranger to the title and ownership as trespassing children. By reason of being adjoining lot owners, certain mutual duties devolved upon each-other, as, for instance, the right of lateral support, and other matters.; but these obligations create no property right by which he could participate in the immunity from liability inuring to the owners of the adjoining lot and thus be absolved from liability.

The circumstances present the case, technically, of a trespasser injuring another trespasser, and of the relative rights between the two.

Without such interest, what standing have you to assert a trespass on another’s land? As to you the invasion was lawful. You were a trespasser when you entered the French lot; as a trespasser, I had an equal right there with you.

She is not compelled to anticipate that some stranger would come within reach of her neglect. One engaged in the commission of a negligent act will not’ be liable for injuries resulting therefrom to another who, so far as he knows, or has reason to expect, is not within range of his negligent act; for illustration, A and B own adjoining farms; A negligently permits a tree to stand with decayed limbs and branches overhanging B’s land; X, a casual trespasser on B’s land, is injured by a limb blown from the tree; A is without notice of X’s presence, under or near the tree, and there is nothing to put him on notice; A is under no duty to anticipate X’s presence and would not be liable for the injury. Appellant’s duty to the adjoining owners did not extend to strangers or persons whom she had no reason to expect on the premises. She was entitled to some notice; she had the undoubted right to protect herself, and was entitled to be informed in some way that the lot' was made use of by others than the owners and those lawfully on the premises.

These facts are known to the owner. We have also the fact that children occasionally played there and that others used the property, and her own testimony shows that children were chased from the premises, and warning signs were placed on the fence. Whether this was sufficient to charge defendant with notice was for the jury, even though it was not shown plaintiff’s son was among the persons from whose conduct notice might be implied. The duty of defendant, who knew, or had reason to know, that the premises were being used by others than those having a lawful right thereon, was to exercise ordinary care to guard against the wall falling. She could not carelessly do, or omit to do, any act whereby others known to be within range of the effect of such acts would suffer injury. This in substance is the principle underlying, Brown v. Lynn, <a href="/pa/31/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="31 Pa. 510" data-case-ids="985074" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0510-01">31 Pa. 510</a>; Daltry v. Media Co., supra; Mullen v.

In all such cases it must be made to appear affirmatively that the appliances or circumstances which caused the injury were under the control of the injuring party, and that by the use of ordinary care an accident could not happen. In other words, the failure to provide proper care being the negligent act, when the accident occurs it can only come through one channel, that is, the negligent act. It is in effect’ the accident proving its own cause. It stands as its own accuser. It applies chiefly to the series of accidents where the rights of the parties in-&gt; <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>jured are closely allied to the rights of the public generally, and the information, or means of information, as to the occurrence itself is, or was, wholly within the control of the injuring parties. But this doctrine of exclusive control has not been established in this State in its entirety; what has been determined here is this, that the evidence of negligence appears when the detailed explanation of the circumstances immediately preceding the accident, the description of the injuring appliance and the testimony from experience, show that the thing which happened would not have happened had the injuring appliance or thing been securely in place or properly cared for. The causal connection is supplied, as is done in many other instances, by affirmative proof that the accident would not have happened had the thing been reasonably cared for, so that in reality it is affirmative proof, the degree of proof required being slight because of the duty imposed and the care required. There was no necessity to apply either of these doctrines in the present case, and under the law and the facts neither should have been applied. Therefore, the court committed reversible error when it charged the jury as it did in the 9th point and answer as follows: “The fact that defendant left this wall of the height and length described to you by the witness, standing unsupported after the fire, and that it afterwards fell, is a prima facie evidence of negligence. [Answer.] That is so, but just take it at its exact weight, that statement, that it is some evidence to be considered with other evidence. It is first blush evidence, and the fact that it fell without any explanation, would raise a presumption that it was carelessly handled or carelessly treated by the defendant. Of course that presumption is only one of the things in the case that must be considered with the others.”</p>
