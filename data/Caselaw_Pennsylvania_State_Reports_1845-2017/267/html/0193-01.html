D.

In the opinion of the court it was said (page 393): “Mr. Lines was not only the beneficial owner of the securities prior to and at the time of his decease, but, under the reserve power of modification, revocation, etc., he had absolute control of the disposition to be made of the securities upon his decease. At any time prior thereto, he could have modified or revoked the trust in favor of the beneficiaries named <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>in the deed. It is true the legal title to the securities was in the trust company, but, aside from mere compensation for its services, as custodian of the property, the company had no beneficial interest therein. In any proper sense of the term, the securities were the personal property of Mr. Lines. They were Ms to enjoy during his lifetime, and his to dispose of, in any manner he saw fit, at any time prior to his decease.” It would seem to follow from the language just quoted that if conditions had been reversed and the trustee located in Pennsylvania and decedent in another state the property would not have been taxable here.</p>

The trust here was to continue until the beneficiary reached the age of thirty years and during that time his only right to any part of the fund, beyond the income, depended upon the dis<a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>cretion of the trustee, who had power to use a portion of the principal previous to that time if he saw fit to do so.

The beneficiary was without control over it, and could have acquired no control until the expiration of the time fixed for its duration. Under the circumstances, the situs for t'he purpose of taxation under the direct inheritance tax act is the jurisdiction in which the trust was created and held and the property located.</p>

The distinctions between the facts here, and those existing in the cases cited in the majority opinion, are as stated therein; but, so far as this act is concerned, they are distinctions without a difference, the real distinction being between the acts there construed and the Act of 1917. Each of those cases doubtless would have been decided just as this one, had the language of the acts been the same. It is true that in the respect under consideration the language of this act is the same as that of the Collateral Inheritance Tax Act of May 6, 1887, P. L. 79, and that we held the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam applied to cases arising thereunder; but this was not because we therein construed the Act of 1887 in accordance with its plain meaning, but because we were compelled to limit that plain meaning owing to the fact that' its title, viz: “An act to provide for the <em>tetter collection </em>of collateral inheritance taxes” did not clearly express a purpose to extend the collateral inheritance tax laws; and hence we had the option of holding the act unconstitutional because of article III, section 3, or of limiting its application to cases covered by the <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>prior statutes which imposed the tax. In accordance with our invariable rule we chose the latter alternative. The Act of 1919, however, has no defect in its title, which is, “An act for the imposition and collection of certain inheritance taxes,” is clear and explicit in its terms, and is within the scope of legislative power; and hence I would enforce it in the present instances, not because the fact's are somewhat different from those appearing in prior cases under other acts, but because they are clearly within the expressed intention of the legislature as set forth in this act.</p>
