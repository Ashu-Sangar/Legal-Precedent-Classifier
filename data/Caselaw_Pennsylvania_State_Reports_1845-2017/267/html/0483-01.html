The trial judge says, in his opinion entering judgment for defendant, that the fingers were partially closed; but any support which this statement has must have come from what plaintiff’s witnesses indicated by use of their own hands. However, since there is nothing to show what these indications were, they are of no assistance to appellant on this review. “When witnesses, by the action of their hands or otherwise, undertake to indicate time, space, distance or anything else,......counsel eliciting the evidence should be careful to have an intelligible explanation placed upon the record, so that the testimony may be understood on review; otherwise, whenever the notes are not clear, we must give them the interpretation which supports the verdict”: Com. v.

Of course, if in any given instance the evidence depended upon by a plaintiff so strongly indicates heedlessness that the conclusion of contributory negligence is inevitable, the presumption to which we refer would count for naught; but, here, as before stated, we cannot agree such to be the case.
