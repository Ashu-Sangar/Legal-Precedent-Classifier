Along both sides and under this road the Locust Mountain Coal Company owns the coal; under the road and on either side it consists of three veins, the uppermost 25 feet thick, the next two seven feet thick. It runs near the surface and can be removed only by stripping, the usual method of mining being impossible by reason of the pitch of the veins and the stratification between them in this locality. To remove the coal, a partial destruction of the road by the stripping operation was necessary, and defendants, after consultation with the several supervisors, built a new road, making a change in the route from Krebs Station to Shenandoah, increasing the distance a little over a half mile. Thereafter, defendants excavated across Krebs Road to a depth of 14 feet for about 50 feet'; whereupon, in 1913, the Union Township supervisors filed this bill, praying for a mandatory injunction to compel the restoration of the public road to the condition that existed before the excavations and obstructions were made. On October 27th the preliminary injunction then granted was continued because of the proceedings to open a new road, and, upon agreement of defendants to pay the cost thereof, the injunction was so modified as to permit the company to extend the work of excavation north and south. The basis of the order was an agreement signed by the attorneys in the case, and then defendants continued their excavation, stripping along the Krebs Road for a distance of 550 feet to a depth of about 60 feet, in the Townships of Union and West Mahoning. The proceedings to vacate and supply the whole or a part of the Krebs Road, as instituted by the parties, were set aside; the one instituted by defendants by the Superior Court: see Krebs Road, <a href="/pa-super/64/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="64 Pa.

There is nothing to <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>show how Krebs Road originally became a public highway. If, in the original taking, the right of property in any aspect had been injuriously affected, the ownei would have been entitled to damages; but, as the ownership of the coal is not in dispute, it is clear that when the road was laid out the owner had full dominion and control over the coal with the right of an absolute owner to it, subject, however, to the easement in favor of the public. He has the right to mine and remove it, but the removal must be done in such manner as not to injure the surface of the highway, or create a condition whereby injury may follow later. The servient estate must always be in such condition that the road may be continued as a highway for the traveling public in the future. From the undisputed facts this servient estate owed to the road above such support as will at all times preserve and keep it from subsiding.</p>

C. L., sec. 108, p. 123. But above and beyond this reasonable use of the public, the owner undoubtedly retains the right to use his land; and so it has been held, where one owns the fee in the minerals under the surface of the highway, and the mines on the surface adjacent thereto, they may work such mines, but must do so in such way as’not to cause the road to subside: 17 Eng.

When counsel in this case agreed that the road should be vacated, thus permitting the coal company to continue the nuisance and the public to be deprived of the use of the highway for travel, they clearly exceeded any authority they had as attorneys and they attempted to do something which even the supervisors had no power to do; and the same may be said as to supplying the road vacated. To permit such an evasion of a legislative mandate as to highways would be to create an easy method to have important highways changed to suit the convenience of a few persons without notice to others interested who might be injured thereby.
