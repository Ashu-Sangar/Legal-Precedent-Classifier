The action is brought to recover, and the verdict allows, damages for the death of plaintiff’s decedent while employed by Sturges &amp; Son, of Phoenixville, Pa., to assist in painting the water tower at the Textile Machine Works, Wyomissing, Pa. He and another by the name of Friday had been engaged in painting three sides of the tower for several days prior to the 5th of December, 1916, and, on the morning of that day, before they began to paint the remaining side and by way of preparation for so doing, they swung a scaffold, suspended by ropes from the top of the tower, between 40 and 50 feet above the ground and about six feet below an arm which extended out from the tower and upon which there were fastened three wires of the defendant company conveying electric currents to the Textile Machine Works. All of these wires were naked and uninsulated, and carried a high voltage. Contact with any one of them would be likely to result in immediate death. Notice had been given to the defendant of the work going on, and it had promised to turn off the current; but this was not done, and plaintiff’s decedent was apprised of that fact. He had worked for Sturges <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>&amp; Son for eight or ten years, was informed of and famil- ' iar with the danger, and had been warned to keep away from the wires until notified that the current was turned off and that the wires were dead. Notwithstanding his knowledge and the warning spoken of, he and his companion swung the scaffold in such a way that one of the wires was but six inches above the head of the decedent standing upon the scaffold. The testimony does not show how he came in contact with the wire, but he evidently did. Indeed, the thumb and index finger of his right hand were burned “to a crisp,” — demonstrating that he must have reached up and either tried to take hold of one of the wires or came in accidental contact with it. When this deplorable occurrence happened, the decedent had not yet started to paint. The plaintiff alleges negligence on the part of the defendant company in the location of the wires with reference to the tower, and in the failure to turn off the current as it had been requested and had promised to do. The defendant, on the other hand, asks for judgment on. the ground of contributory negligence in the decedent, or else for a new trial.</p>

R. R. v. Weiss, <a href="/pa/87/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="87 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="1057842" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0447-01">87 Pa. 447</a>, 449; Spear v. R. R.

Of course, it is not necessary that the plaintiff’s case disprove contributory negligence on the part of the decedent ; it is enough if it does not disclose any such: R. R. Co. v. Rowan, <a href="/pa/66/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="66 Pa. 393" data-case-ids="432445" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0393-01">66 Pa. 393</a>; McManamon v.

In the present instance we have the undisputed fact that the plaintiff’s decedent was well aware of the dangerous character of the wires and had been warned to keep away from them. It is suggested on the part of the plaintiff’s counsel (and we agree) that, the decedent having knowledge already, the Avarning added nothing to it or to his duty of care. If there had been nothing more than the warning, there would be little to be said on this subject. But he was not only warned of the .danger of the wires as they were: he was promised that the current would be turned off and that he would be notified when it was turned off; and still further, he was ordered to keep away from the wires until notified that the current had been turned off. With all this and although there had been no notice given him of the turning off of the current, he swung the scaffold in the manner already described and placed himself upon it. He was bound to reckon with ordinary contingencies and their consequences. It is testified by one of plaintiff’s principal witnesses that “Many a time a man puts his hand up above his head and doesn’t even realize he is doing it.” Going on a swinging scaffold high above the ground, he Avas bound to foresee that he might, by some unsteadiness of the scaffold or other cause, be prompted <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>to raise his hand and intentionally or unintentionally attempt to grasp one of the wires, or at least come in contact with it. There is a peculiar appositeness to this; case in what was said in Haertel v. Penna. L. &amp; P. Co.r <a href="/pa/219/0640-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="219 Pa. 640" data-case-ids="1002799" data-case-paths="/pa/219/0640-01">219 Pa. 640</a>, 642, of the case there before the court: “There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that he encountered the wire as an obstruction, that it needed to be displaced in any way......much less that it was required for his support in consequence of his being placed in sudden peril.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b190-4" data-blocks='[["BL_190.5",190,[296,892,1154,854]]]'>And again: “There being no substantive testimony ......upon which it would have been competent for the jury to find that decedent was not guilty of contributory negligence, the nonsuit was properly ordered.” The question of the deceased’s conduct is decided, not by what occurred immediately when the accident happened, of which there is no testimony, but by his act in putting the scaffold and himself within reach of a manifest danger, in the face of his own knowledge, his warning, and his order to keep out of the way. <em>His </em>presence on the scaffold so close to the wire was therefore not simply a condition of the occurrence of the accident (see 13th <em>&amp; </em>15th Sts. Pass. Ry. Co. v. Boudrou, <a href="/pa/92/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="92 Pa. 475" data-case-ids="491070" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0475-01">92 Pa. 475</a>), but an act of contributory negligence which proximately caused the occurrence and bars a recovery in this suit.</p>
