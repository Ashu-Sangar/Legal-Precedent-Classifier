In pursuance of the authority so obtained the property was advertised and sold publicly to Creighton D. Bloom on December 21, 1918, and the assignee delivered to the purchaser a deed therefor, dated January 13, 1919. The property thus sold was occupied by William D. Rhodes and Florence, his wife, who refused and neglected to deliver possession thereof to the purchaser.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b536-6" data-blocks='[["BL_536.6",536,[304,879,1148,1024]]]'>The issue here is whether the original assignor is entitled to retain possession as against the purchaser. Whatever title William D. Rhodes and wife had, passed to his assignee, David F. Rhodes, and this title by sale and deed passed to the purchaser, the petitioner. No other rights are involved, and if the proceedings were illegal or defective ample opportunity was afforded to any person in interest to object thereto. It comes with bad grace at this time for the assignor to attack the validity of his own action with the hope of reaping a benefit therefrom. If this trust was a defeasible one it does not now lie in the mouth of the assignor to disaffirm his own act, and so attempt to endanger the purchaser’s title. He conveyed his interest in the property; it was sold by his action, and the money devoted to pay Ms debts. But notwithstanding, the assignor wants to keep the property and deprive the purchaser of his money. This court will not lend any assistance to the consummation of such a plan.</p>
