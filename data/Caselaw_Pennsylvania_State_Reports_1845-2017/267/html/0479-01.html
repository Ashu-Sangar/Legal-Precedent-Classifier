The general rule is that a gift of the income of land without interposition of a trustee, and with no gift in remainder, is a gift of the land itself. If, however, a testator intends a spendthrift trust to attach to property given to a daughter for life under an earlier clause, this intent necessarily cuts down the legal estate to an equitable one subject to the trust created by the later clause of the will.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b507-7" data-blocks='[["BL_507.7",507,[166,1009,1153,540]]]'>2. Where a testator gives to his daughter for life “the net rents, issues and profits” of real estate, subject to necessary expenditure for taxes, water rents, insurance and repairs, and also a money legacy of $10,000, and after making other devises and bequests to children and grandchildren named, as well as to third persons, directs that the income, legacies and devises so given “for the benefit” of his daughter and other persons mentioned, “are to be for their separate respective and exclusive use and benefit,” so that they shall not be sold or parted with by way of anticipation, nor subject to judgments, debts or liabilities of the beneficiaries, the daughter takes an equitable estate for life with the legal estate vested in the trustees.</p>

The contention of the daughter is that the first paragraph of the will gave her a life estate, entitling her to the income free from any trust.</p>

Appellant excepted in the court below to the conclusion of the auditor and there argued the case on its merits without raising the question of jurisdiction. Having done so, and the court having passed upon the questions raised by the exceptions as if the case were properly before it, the objection to the <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>jurisdiction cannot be raised for the first time in this court: Hurt v.

    <p id="b510-4" data-blocks='[["BL_510.5",510,[303,495,1150,1462]]]'>The remaining question is whether the court below erred in holding appellant’s life estate was merely equitable and not subject to the spendthrift trust. The general rule is that a gift of the income of land without interposition of a trustee and with no gift in remainder is a gift of the land itself. If, however, testator intended the spendthrift trust to attach to the property given to the daughter for life under the former clause, this intent necessarily cuts down the legal estate to an equitable one subject to the trust created by the latter clause in the will. That such was testator’s intention does not seem to admit of serious doubt. The original gift was not of the gross income, but merely the “net” revenue after all carrying charges and incidental expenses were deducted. This situation distinguishes the case from the ordinary one of a life estate in the property itself created by a gift of all income therefrom: Deniston v. Deniston, <a href="/pa/263/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="263 Pa. 224" data-case-ids="1047486" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0224-01">263 Pa. 224</a>, 229-30. The appointment of trustees and the subsequent provision that the income, legacies and devises “of every kind and description” given “heretofore and herein” for the benefit of testator’s daughter, and the further provision creating a spendthrift trust as to all such property, make it clear that testator intended to give, not an absolute life estate in the property, but merely the net income subject to an active trust intended for the daughter’s benefit: Wolfinger, Exr., v. Fell, <a href="/pa/195/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="195 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="914132" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0012-01">195 Pa. 12</a>; Deniston v.
