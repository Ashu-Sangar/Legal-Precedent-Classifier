Where such transfer is entered on the books of the corporation, he ceases to be liable for future calls; the consent of the corporation is, in effect, a novation, a release of the transferor’s liability; and, unless there is some statutory regulation, the assignor is no longer liable for future calls on stock subscribed for by him, or held in his name.</p>

It is not illegal for an attorney to procure disinterested persons to sign a certificate of incorporation with the understanding that when the charter is granted the subscription is to be assigned to the real owners. In such case, the law must be complied with as indicated herein.</p>
    <p id="b36-5" data-blocks='[["BL_36.6",36,[260,2267,1147,153]],["BL_37.1",37,[188,348,1148,483]]]'>Unhappily the case was not submitted to the jury along the lines above set forth. Among other things, the trial judge said: “Mr. Cox, who it is admitted was <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>the attorney for the corporation,......would be a proper party to receive that paper, and if he did receive it as the attorney for the corporation, that would be a good delivery, and you would be justified in so finding. It would be an act which an attorney could do under the authority of his employment, and then if, for any reason, the paper is lost and cannot be produced, that is no fault of the defendant.” This authority as an attorney should have been found by the jury from the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b37-6" data-blocks='[["BL_37.5",37,[184,843,1152,1195]]]'>Further on the court charged the jury: “Now, if that transfer of all his interest was made as stated, and you find that to be true, then you come to consider the effect of it. The defendant was one of the original incorporators of the corporation. If his twenty shares of stock went into, and was considered by those who received it as a part of, the capital stock, then he would not be responsible upon that capital stock. If it was accepted, if his assignment or transfer of it was accepted by the corporation, or those who controlled it, then under the law there could be no recovery against him on that stock, or any unpaid portion of it, in the absence of proof that a demand had been made upon him prior to the time the corporation went into the hands of the receiver.” This also was error, for defendant would be liable even though his stock “was considered, by those who received it, as a part of the capital stock,” unless the assignment of his interest in the company or the stock was accepted by some one authorized to receive it; and, if it was not so accepted, defendant would be liable if a call were made upon him, by order of court, after “the corporation went into the hands of the receiver.”</p>
    <p id="b37-7" data-blocks='[["BL_37.6",37,[183,2049,1150,371]],["BL_38.1",38,[263,325,1149,362]]]'>Another important question not passed on by the court below is as to whether a call had been made. As we have stated, the directors may make calls in such amounts and at such times as in their judgment they deem wise and proper, but if the stock was subscribed with the understanding that it was to be then paid in cash, it is immediately due and the subscriber may be <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>proceeded against without further notice. The minutes make no reference to this, except where it is stated the shares of stock shall be of the par value of $100 and shall be nonassessable. Inasmuch as the statute of limitations was interposed as a defense, it was important to know exactly what the facts were in regard to the stock, so far as related to this matter.</p>
    <p id="b38-4" data-blocks='[["BL_38.5",38,[259,709,1151,580]]]'>The claim for the amount certified by the appellee as being in his hands as treasurer at the date of incorporation is clearly barred by the statute. The minutes show the treasurer was succeeded by another more than six years prior to the institution of this action; if the corporation had any claim against him, it should have proceeded to collect it. Not having done so within six years, the corporation and the receiver afterwards appointed are barred. But it appears in the evidence that the money was in the hands of his successor. Whether that is true is not now material.</p>
    <p id="b38-5" data-blocks='[["BL_38.6",38,[258,1309,1148,152]]]'>The first and second assignments are sustained, the judgment is reversed so far as the claim upon the stock is concerned, and a new venire awarded.</p>
