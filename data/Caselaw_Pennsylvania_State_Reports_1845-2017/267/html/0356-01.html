Insolvency and fraud need not be averred, though they may be, but acts must appear which are prejudicial and harmful to the corporation’s rights. Sufficient responsible data should be given to enable them to determine the question with some hope of success.</p>

If the officers, through misconduct or otherwise, fail to proceed, after receiving due and sufficient notice, and there is not time to remove them and elect other officers, the shareholder, upon showing his effort to induce the corporation to proceed, and that he left nothing undone which he might have done to prevail on the corporation to bring such action, may institute proceedings in equity for relief.</p>

It was incumbent on complainant, Passmore, to set forth facts necessary to give him standing to assert rights that are ordinarily enforced by the corporation. The lease was between the corporation, of which he was a member, and the traction company as lessee. If the lessee company, through its officers, by fraud or mismanagement, wronged the lessor and its members, it should be re<a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>dressed through the duly appointed agents, the board of directors, of the latter corporation.

He states in substance that a bill in equity was filed in the District Court of the United States by complainant as a stockholder of the Kutztown &amp; Fleetwood Railway Company against the Allentown &amp; Reading Traction <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>Company; that large sums of money had been expended by the traction company that had not been adequately accounted for on the books of the company; and the reports of the Allentown &amp; Reading Company at Harrisburg were not according to the books. Based upon this information, the Kutztown &amp; Fleetwood Company was asked to secure an accounting and procure a receiver for the Allentown &amp; Reading Company. No official action was taken on this letter and we do not wonder that such was the case. There is no charge of wrongdoing, or injury, or acts prejudicial to plaintiff, or of mismanagement, fraud or carelessness. Each specification of the letter might be explained with entire satisfaction and without the slightest intimation that anybody had done wrong. While the latter states money was spent <em>“not </em>adequately accounted for on the books of the company,” what might have been inadequate to Pass-more might be entirely adequate to defendant. It does not charge that the money was not spent, or that it was diverted, or misapplied, or in anywise unfairly dealt with. It merely charges what to plaintiff seems to be an inadequate system of keeping accounts; that the reports to the auditor general and the books do not agree, is not evidence of fraud. A very simple explanation may show that for taxing purposes it was necessary to make changes. It is unnecessary to go into detail as to why this should be, or to explain the various methods of keeping books, to emphasize the point in question. The charges as made were insufficient. The stockholder not having exhausted his remedy before applying to the courts, his action must fail at the threshold of the suit.</p>
