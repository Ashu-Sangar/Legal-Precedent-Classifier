Subsequently, on March 31, 1919, a mandamus was issued, which, instead of combining the principal amount with ascertained interest to date of confirmation, and commanding payment thereof, plus interest on the aggregate from that date to the day of payment, simply called for the principal sum of the award “with interest from December 9, 1909.” The mandamus was presented to the city treasurer and marked “Presented for payment” on April 3, 1919. On May 20, 1919, claimant entered with proper notice a rule to amend the writ, so as to provide for the principal amount “with interest thereon at <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>the rate of 6 per cent per annum from December 9, 1909, to September 13, 1918, and interest on the aggregate total from September 13, 1918, to date of payment, together with costs.” This rule was made absolute July 7, 1919, and the mandamus amended accordingly. On July 15, 1919, the city entered a rule to strike from the writ the amendatory words, alleging they changed the award. At the same time it moved for a rule to vacate the confirmation of the report, set aside the mandamus and allow an appeal nunc pro tunc, alleging as ground therefor that no deduction for rent had been allowed by the jury of view, as should have been done under a ruling by the Supreme Court made since the confirmation of the award. On January 22, 1920, the court entered orders discharging both of the city’s rules. Thereupon the city took three appeals, alleging error in amending the mandamus, and in discharging the two rules.</p>

Superior Ct. 204</a>, 207. When an outstanding writ of execution is altered or interfered with in any final manner by the court from which it issued, if the immediate proceeding, leading to such action, is had on rule, or in other formal manner, with notice and opportunity to be heard given to the opponent (as in the present instance), the determination reached falls within the definition of a final judgment (Henry’s Est., <a href="/pa-super/28/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="28 Pa. Super. 541" data-case-ids="858964" data-case-paths="/pa-super/28/0541-01">28 Pa. Superior Ct. 541</a>, 543), and the party aggrieved need not move to set aside the order in question, but may appeal directly therefrom.</p>
    <p id="b253-6" data-blocks='[["BL_253.6",253,[147,1487,1153,687]]]'>Of course, where execution is issued, or subsequently altered, without a rule or other formal proceeding affording defendant an opportunity to be heard, proper practice requires that he promptly move the court below to set aside the execution or revoke the order complained of (Bailey v. Wagoner, 17 S. &amp; R. 327), before an appeal lies — this, in justice to the court of original jurisdiction and for the benefit of the appellate tribunal. Even in such case, however, if enough appears upon the record to decide the dispute involved, it is not always essential to move the court below in the premises before taking an appeal: Duncan v. Harris, 17 S. &amp; R. 436.</p>

If dissatisfied, defendant should have appealed from the order permitting the amendment; for, in a case like this, where the whole dispute concerning such amendment was presented to the court on claimant’s motion, if the date of the order discharging defendant’s rule — to strike out the amendatory words — is considered as prolonging the time for appeal, then the statutory period could always be extended by the simple expedient of entering a rule to set aside, just before the expiration of six months from the date of the original order; which practice, it stands to reason, cannot prevail.</p>

Superior Ct. 185</a>, 186-7), and so far as they involve record facts, or issues of law based thereon, they were passed upon and duly adjudicated when final action was had on the report of the board of view by confirmation, and on claimant’s rule to amend by making it absolute; none of the matters thus determined will be inquired into again: Long v.

Defendant’s whole case is avowedly an attempt to have the execution and judgment of confirmation set aside so that it may be afforded an opportunity to put in a defense on the merits, such as suggested by us in Pa. Cc. v. Phila., supra; which, we must assume, the city solicitor knew he had a right to present when the case was before the viewers. If defendant was denied such right at that time, it should have appealed, within the statutory period, from the judgment of confirmation; not having done this, it is now too late: Brown v. Independent School District, <a href="/monaghan/1/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="1 Monag. 111" data-case-ids="254546" data-case-paths="/monaghan/1/0111-01">1 Monaghan 111</a>, and 16 Atlantic Reporter 32, 36.</p>
    <p id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.5",255,[181,1235,1152,590]]]'>Appellant’s contention that the endorsement of the mandamus by the city solicitor — “interest upon said writ is properly payable up to this date, April 3, 1919, to be computed from the 9th day of December, 1909”— makes it, “in addition to being a writ of execution,” also “a contract between the parties,” which cannot be changed in any manner without the “consent of the city,” does not impress us. Moreover, this point is not suggested by the statement of questions involved and the record fails to indicate it was raised in the court below; therefore, we shall not further consider it.</p>
