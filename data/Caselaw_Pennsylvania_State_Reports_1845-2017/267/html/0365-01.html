    <p id="b395-3" data-blocks='[["BL_395.4",395,[170,1085,1151,1127]]]'>There was evidence to show the necessity for the resale and that, owing to the lack of shipping facilities, the article could not be sold elsewhere than in Lisbon. The sale took place through an experienced broker for the very best price obtainable. This evidence was not objected to because it did not show good faith or that the circumstances under which the sale was made were not calculated to produce the best price obtainable or to procure the best market price, nor for the reason that the evidence was but the opinion of the witness, or because it did not appear that appellee used reasonable efforts to secure the best price obtainable. It was objected to because the witness had no knowledge of the market condition. This objection was not well taken as the price obtained through a fair sale would establish a market condition for that sale, and certainly would be the best price obtainable as agreed upon by the parties. When the sale is unfair and damage results because the sale is below the market price, this latter price becomes important in establishing the vendor’s loss.</p>
