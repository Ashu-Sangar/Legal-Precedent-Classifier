Plaintiffs are real estate brokers and defendánt is a practicing attorney. The property, known as Nos. 731-733 Arch street, Philadelphia, was owned by the First National Bank of Camden, N. J., of which defendant was attorney, and the title to the property stood in his name as trustee prior to 1918, when it was sold by the sheriff, to perfect the title, and bid in by defendant as attorney. The sheriff retained the deed with the understanding that it would be made direct to whoever might be decided upon, or whoever might become the real purchaser, as the property was for sale. Meantime, plaintiffs and defendant negotiated with reference to the former finding a purchaser for it, at the price of $75,000, when they were to receive a commission of two per cent, amounting to $1,500. They procured a purchaser, named Silberman, with whom defendant, as attorney for the bank’s <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>president, David Baird, entered into a written agreement for the sale of the property. Later, for reasons not here important, the sale to Silberman was not consummated and he forfeited the $1,000 paid as hand money. On defendant’s refusal to pay the commission, plaintiffs brought this suit. The case turned largely on questions of fact, as to which the evidénce was conflicting, and the jury found for plaintiffs. This appeal by defendant is from judgment entered upon the verdict.</p>
    <p id="b133-3" data-blocks='[["BL_133.4",133,[159,805,1153,703]]]'>There is nothing in the record to justify a reversal. Plaintiffs’ evidence is to the effect that defendant individually contracted with them and as such promised to pay the commission, without disclosing an agency, and the first intimation they had that he was acting for another was when he signed Baird’s name to the Silberman agreement by himself as attorney, and that he then said, “Well, we made this sale [by the sheriff] for the purpose of making title; you can look to me for the commission.” On the contrary defendant contends that plaintiffs knew of his agency from the first and that he contracted with them as such; if so, he would not be individually liable, but that was a question of fact.</p>
    <p id="b133-4" data-blocks='[["BL_133.5",133,[162,1518,1151,636]]]'>He further contends that by the terms of their agreement the commission was not earned until the prospective purchaser accepted and paid for the property; this plaintiffs deny, and it was also a question of fact. If, as they contend, it was the ordinary case of procuring a customer with whom defendant was willing to contract, and the jury so found, then the commission was earned without reference to the final outcome of the sale: Nock v.

So one, having charge of real estate as attorney, may by special parol agreement obligate himself personally to pay a broker’s commission for its sale, provided such agreement is original and not collateral to a primary obligation created by or on behalf of the owner.
