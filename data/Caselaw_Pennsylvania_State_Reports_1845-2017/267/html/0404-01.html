The assignment of it was accepted by the appellee “according to its full tenor and effect.” In view of these words appellants claim the right to enter judgment against the appellee; but this overlooks the fact that it signed no warrant for the confession of judgment. The warrant to confess judgment given by the original lessee is not the warrant of the appellee, his successor, and the judgment entered against it was properly stricken off as not being self-sustaining: Stewart v.
