The statute goes on to provide, moreover, that “causes of action based upon gross negligence or incompetence shall not be affected by the immunities granted by this section.” Thus, Section 603 creates a limited immunity — an immunity which is expressly inapplicable to several enumerated types of conduct. In our view, the phrase “no person” is broad enough to include all officials of the Commonwealth and its governmental components whether “high” or otherwise, as well as private persons. We therefore conclude that the use of the phrase “no person” evidences an intent on the part of the legislature that the limited immunity granted by Section 603 will apply to all Commonwealth and governmental officials and will supersede common law official immunity in cases to which Section 603 applies. Thus, a suit against even a “high <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>public official” may be maintained if it appears from the complaint (a) that the cause of action is based upon acts done pursuant to the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966, and (b) that the acts complained of are not within one of the categories of conduct to which limited immunity is granted by Section 603.</p>

We are satisfied that the complaint, despite its patent prolixity, makes allegations of gross negligence or incompetence as to the defendants Shovlin, Burke, McEwen, and Hughes in the performance of acts pursuant to the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966.

The reference to persons, on the other hand, includes both high public officials, who have absolute immunity at common law, and individuals not protected by such immunity. Because section 603 would provide immunity for some individuals who were not immune at common law, it is less apparent that the Legislature intended for the immunities provided in section 603 to supplant the common law immunity enjoyed by high public officials.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a>

The grant of immunity in section 603 implies that public officials may be held liable for conduct which is in bad faith, malicious, or without reasonable cause. I conclude that this was what the Legislature intended. The balance struck by this section is reasonable and supports the conclusion that the Legislature intended the immunities provided by this section to substitute for the common law immunity. The constitutional policy in favor of providing a remedy, see Pa.Const. art. I, § 11, lends further support to the conclusion that the limited immunity provided in section 603 supplants the common law official immunity. Given the still extant doctrine of sovereign immunity, individuals would have no remedy for tortious conduct by high public officials if common law official immunity applies.</p>
