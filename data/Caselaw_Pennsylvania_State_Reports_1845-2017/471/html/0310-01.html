Appellant, Lindred Dean Craig, and Brooks had fought twice earlier that evening. Twenty minutes after the last fight, they again met on the street. Another scuffle ensued, decedent staggered and fell, and appellant ran from the scene. Appellant was tried and convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree.

The jury foreman announced the verdict in these words: “We, the jurors . . . find the defendant first count of murder guilty.” Apparently, at this announcement, there was a spontaneous expression of approval by one or more of the spectators. However, the court was preoccupied with the defects in the announced verdict. When questioned by the court, the foreman indicated that the issue of degree was overlooked in its deliberations. The court informed the jury that its Verdict was improper for that reason, reiterated the possible degrees of guilt, and returned the jury for further deliberations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Our review satisfies us that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying this motion.

Even the trial judge was unaware of this incident until brought to his attention.” There is no indication that the jury was any more aware of the incident. Nor is there any indication that the jury was in any manner influenced by the incident. Within eleven minutes, the jury had completed its second deliberation. The court further questioned the foreman when the jury returned. The gist of this colloquy is that the question of degree had been decided in the first session but, through oversight, the original verdict was misworded.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> On this <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>record, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to grant the mistrial motion.</p>

Upon a review of the record, we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction. Appellant and the victim had fought previously on the evening of the stabbing. During these scuffles, appellant was heard to make threats to kill the victim while the victim repeatedly expressed his unwillingness to fight. When the two met again, a third fight ensued. Witnesses saw the two men grapple, the victim stagger away, fall to the ground, and the appellant run away. When the detective arrived on the scene, he was told that the appellant did it. A medical examination revealed that death was caused by the puncturing of the organs in the upper left chest by a sharp instrument.</p>
