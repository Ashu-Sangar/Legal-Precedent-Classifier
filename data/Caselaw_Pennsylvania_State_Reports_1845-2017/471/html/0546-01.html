Upon approaching the automobile, Officer Kurtz ordered the driver, appellant Harry Mimms, to step out of the car. After Mimms had alighted from the vehicle, Officer Kurtz noticed a large bulge under Mimms’ sports jacket. Fearful that the jacket might be covering a weapon, the police officer conducted a frisk of appellant’s outer clothing. The frisk resulted in the discovery of a loaded .38 caliber revolver and five live rounds of ammunition. Based on this evidence appellant was indicted for carrying a concealed deadly weapon and for unlawfully carrying a firearm without a license. A motion to suppress was denied, and after a trial, at which the revolver was introduced into evidence, Mimms was convicted on both counts. The Superior Court affirmed the conviction,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and we granted allocatur. Because we conclude that appellant’s revolver was seized in a manner which violated the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, we reverse the Superior Court and remand the case for a new trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The court sustained the officer’s action in opening the door as reasonable and not inconsistent with the fourth amendment on the ground that the intrusion was minimal. <em>See also United States </em>v. <em>Ware, </em><a href="/f2d/457/0828-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="457 F.2d 828" data-case-ids="734122" data-case-paths="/f2d/457/0828-01">457 F.2d 828</a> (7th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v.

In the case at bar, the vehicle was detained for having an expired license plate. Presumably, Officer Kurtz would have been justified in opening appellant’s door to inspect the vehicle identification number. In my view, the difference, if any, in the “degree of intrusion” occasioned by this type of conduct and that instantly held invalid is constitutionally insignificant.</p>
