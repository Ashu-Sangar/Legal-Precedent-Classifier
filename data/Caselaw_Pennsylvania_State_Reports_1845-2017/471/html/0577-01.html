She had not been sexually molested and nothing was reported missing from the house. Despite an intensive police investigation it was not until approximately a year later that the first break-through came towards a solution of the case. On April 25, 1973, in the course of investigating individuals with a prior history of “violence, sexual motivation or surreptitious entry,” police were at Susquehanna Township High School, located in the immediate vicinity of the scene of the crime, talking with friends and classmates of one Ronald Hoffman, one of the individuals with such a record of criminal activity. One of Hoffman’s associates who was interviewed was the appellant, William Cunningham, a 17-year-old Special Education student in the 11th grade.</p>

Following that examination, which was preceded by proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings and the signing by appellant of a polygraph waiver form, appellant first implicated himself by admitting that he was present at the home of the victim on the day in question, that he observed Ronald Hoffman stab the victim, but that his function was merely that of a lookout while Hoffman burglarized the home.</p>

The defendant was advised of his constitutional rights and told that he could be charged with murder. During the interview, after being confronted with certain inconsistencies in his prior statements, the appellant broke down and admitted that Hoffman had not been involved in the commission of the crime but that he, Cunningham, was the sole perpetrator. The interview was concluded at 4:15 P.M., after the District Attorney had suggested that the appellant’s parents be called. Although appellant objected, his parents were then brought to the District Attorney’s office. They employed an attorney who appeared and conferred with the appellant. At 6:30 P.M., a formal stenographically-transcribed confession was given in the presence of the appellant’s attorney and it is this statement which was presented at trial and whose admissibility is now being questioned.</p>

The very concept of attenuation necessitates the conclusion that preceding events are legally unrelated. Because we believe that the counseled confession of June 13, as a matter of law, was purged of any prior illegality, evidence relating to allegédly coercive influences surrounding the involuntary statement of June 7 is irrelevant.

I cannot agree with the majority’s suggestion that the presence of counsel necessarily renders a confession voluntary and purges the confession from the taint of prior illegalities. Both claims are properly resolved only after an evaluation of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the confession. The majority unwisely departs from the fundamental principle that no single factor is determinative of these questions.</p>

Appellant is entitled to a new trial because the trial court erred in excluding evidence concerning the use of a polygraph examination on June 7 as a coercive factor which led to his June 13 confession. Evidence that a defendant was given a polygraph examination before confessing is relevant to the determination whether the confession was voluntary in the totality of the cir<a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>cumstances.

I cannot agree that the determination that a second confession is free of the taint of prior illegalities affects the relevance of the events which preceded the confession when the voluntariness of the confession is at issue. The majority has confused two distinct doctrines which have different purposes and applications. Appellant’s experience with a polygraph examination on June 7 was part of the totality of the circumstances which led to his later confession and was therefore relevant to the jury’s consideration of the voluntariness of his subsequent confession. By its holding today, the majority has unjustifiably curtailed appellant’s right to a jury determination of a crucial issue in the case.</p>

The interview, which lasted about one hour, was conducted at the high school with the consent of appellant’s parents and in the presence of an assistant principal.

In <em>Miranda, </em>the Court did not consider the effect of counsel’s presence upon the mental state of an individual who may already have been subjected to the debilitating effects of psychologically coercive police interrogation techniques.

I cannot agree that within moments of the arrival of an attorney, with whom the accused may have never met before, the impact of all that has previously occurred behind closed police doors magically evaporates. If, for example, an accused has been subjected to prolonged in-custody interrogation, his opportunity to briefly confer with counsel will not necessarily erase all that preceded the attorney’s arrival on the scene. The world of in-custody police interrogation is not so simple as the majority would have it.</p>

The use of a polygraph examination in the interrogation process, standing alone, does not render a confession involuntary. <em>Commonwealth v.

In Pennsylvania, even if the suppression court determines a confession is voluntary and therefore admissible, a defendant has the right to contest voluntariness before the jury. Like a suppression court, the jury decides whether a confession is voluntary on the basis of the totality of the circumstances. Here, the defense’s theory was that in light of the coercion on June 7, as well as other circumstances, appellant’s confession on June 13 was also involuntary.</p>

Ed. 2d 589">31 L.Ed.2d 589</a> (1972), Detective Krimmel, a prosecution witness, testified that the defendant had taken a polygraph test. The testimony was elicited to prove that the defendant’s confession was voluntary. He did not testify as to the results of the test. On cross-examination, the witness was asked what occurred during the period after the examination and before the confession. He replied that Detective Kowalczyk told the defendant “he was lying and needed a lawyer.” Id. at 270, <a href="/citations/?q=277%20A.2d%20325" class="citation" data-index="252" data-cite="277 A.2d 325">277 A.2d at 334</a>. Later in the trial, Detective Kowalczyk testified to the same effect. On appeal, the defendant contended that it was prejudicial error to admit Detective Kowalczyk’s testimony concerning the polygraph examination. We held that since the inference of an unfavorable test result was first brought out by defendant’s cross-examination, admitting the later testimony was not prejudical error. An examination of our holding might suggest that Detective Krimmel’s original testimony, in <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>which he stated that defendant had taken a polygraph test without referring to the results of the test, was not prejudicial. However, it does not appear that the defendant challenged the admissibility of Detective Krimmel’s testimony. Thus, <em>Camm </em>did not resolve whether evidence that an accused took a polygraph test before confessing is admissible on the question of voluntariness.</p>

Appellant states that his polygraph expert would testify that the police lied when they suggested that the polygraph machine indicated that appellant had not been truthful. This, too, is relevant to the voluntariness inquiry. Deception concerning the results of the polygraph test would indicate that there was a strenuous effort to induce a confession. Thus, it lends support to the defense theory that the atmosphere and interrogation were psychologically coercive.</p>
