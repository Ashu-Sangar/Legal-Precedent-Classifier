The Pennsylvania officers contacted the base on March 15 and requested the military personnel in charge to have Shadron available for questioning the next day. On arrival at the Wichita Falls Airport, Cole and Packler were picked up by a military vehicle and taken to the security headquarters of the base where Shadron and some Air Force military policemen were awaiting them in an interrogation room.

That investigation had sharply focused on Shadron as a suspect. As a member of the armed forces, he had returned to his military base, a location where Pennsylvania police could not intrude without permission. The record shows that the assistance rendered by the military officers to the Pennsylvania police consisted of making Shadron available for questioning, supplying a room for that purpose, and cooperating in the search of appellant’s quarters.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> These were but normal courtesies which officers in the nation’s military establishment might be expected to extend to state officials in the circumstances.

This witness also testified that Shadron “said he was going to go back in and take it all, and he would burn the house down with Mr, Bennett in it and make it look like an accident.” Two days before Bennett’s death, Shadron tried unsuccessfully to persuade another witness to join him, saying that “One of us could knock him out . . .” and, if necessary, “take care of him with a pillow,” or “turn the gas stove on and it would eventually catch fire and blow up and there would be nothing left.” On the night of the <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>murder, Shadron asked this unwilling friend to wish him luck because he was going to “do it” later, Finally there is the fact that Mr. Bennett was stabbed to death and that the gas stove in the victim’s home had been left burning when the marauder departed.

The record is devoid of any testimony indicating that the military did anything directly relating the occurrences there other than supplying a form for the defendant to sign consenting to the search of his room and a Colonel Marsano telling the defendant, after the defendant had orally agreed to a search of his room, that he might as well sign the written consent to a search because the authorities could get a search warrant anyways [sic]. It is true military personnel were present at all times but they did not conduct any of the crucial happenings . . .” Opinion of the court en banc at 5-6.</blockquote>

Because we conclude that no violation of the posse comitatus act occurred in this case, we need not consider the Commonwealth’s second contention, viz., whether an exclusionary rule applies to evidence seized in violation of the statute. For cases which have dealt with this issue, see, e. g., <em>United States </em>v. Walden, <a href="/f2d/490/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="490 F.2d 372" data-case-ids="228740" data-case-paths="/f2d/490/0372-01">490 F.2d 372</a> (4th Cir. 1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Danko, </em><a href="/kan/219/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="219 Kan. 490" data-case-ids="530540" data-case-paths="/kan/219/0490-01">219 Kan. 490</a>, <a href="/kan/219/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="219 Kan. 490" data-case-ids="530540" data-case-paths="/kan/219/0490-01">548 P.2d 819</a> (1976).</p>

The argument as presented to us is couched in terms of ineffectiveness of trial counsel in not requesting a charge on the underlying felonies or taking a timely exception to the failure of the trial court so to charge. The issue was, however, raised by trial counsel in support of his motion for a new trial. The court decided the matter adversely to the defendant on the merits, not on the ground of waiver. Thus ineffectiveness, assuming it was present, resulted in no prejudice to the defendant. We note, moreover, that the trial took place more than six months prior to the announcement of this Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clair, </em><a href="/pa/457/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="457 Pa. 510" data-case-ids="478452" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0510-01">457 Pa. 510</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=326%20A.2d%20272" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="326 A.2d 272">326 A.2d 272</a> (1974). Under the circumstances, we, like the trial court, will consider the issue on its merits rather than in the context of ineffectiveness of counsel.</p>
