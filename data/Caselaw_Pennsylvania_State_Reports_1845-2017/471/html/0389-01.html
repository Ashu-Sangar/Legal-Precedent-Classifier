Appellant was tried by a judge and jury, and on April 19, 1973, was found guilty of murder in the second degree and aggravated robbery. Post-verdict motions were denied, and on June 12, 1974, appellant was sentenced to not less than ten nor more than twenty years at a state correctional institution on the murder conviction and was given a five to ten year consecutive sentence for the aggravated robbery conviction. Appellant appealed the murder conviction to this court and the aggravated robbery conviction to the Superior Court, which certified the latter case to this court.</p>

At approximately 4:50 p. m. on September 12, 1972, the decedent, John Schmidt, a mechanic for Breuninger’s Dairy in Philadelphia, was shot while road testing one of the dairy’s trucks. Two Philadelphia police officers on stakeout observed three males standing near Schmidt’s truck. Three shots were fired, the decedent stumbled from the truck into the alley, and the three males fled from the scene. The police pursued the three individuals, who split into two groups. One of the officers pursued appellant and after several warnings to stop, shot the appellant in the leg.</p>

Appellant was <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>subsequently transferred to the Police Administration Building, arriving at approximately 1:40 a. m. He was warned and interviewed from 2:00 to 2:18 a. m. He was then fed and allowed to remain alone until 5:35 a. m., at which time appellant gave a formal typewritten states ment, which statement concluded and was signed at 6:50 a. m. He was again allowed to remain alone until 10:00 a. m., at which time another “interview” was conducted until. 10:15 a. m. A final “interview” was conducted at 10:30 a. m., until 10:40 a. m.

The rule and the cases interpreting it, e. g., <em>Commonwealth v.

Under Rule 323 a defendant wishing to suppress evidence allegedly obtained in violation of Rule 130 is free to challenge the admissibility of such evidence prior to trial. If the challenged evidence is found to be admissible at the suppression hearing the defendant is foreclosed from challenging its admissibility at trial; he may, nevertheless, contest the validity of such evidence despite its admission. <em>Commonwealth v.

First, it is clear that if the jury is to be instructed on “unnecessary delay”, it will also have to be instructed as to what does not constitute “unnecessary delay”. <em>See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Futch, </em><a href="/pa/447/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="447 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1942994" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0389-01">447 Pa. 389</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=290%20A.2d%20417" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="290 A.2d 417">290 A.2d 417</a>, 418 (1972), adhering approvingly to the guidelines laid down in <em>Adams v.

To give these added instructions seems to me to invite confusion, and to draw undue attention to one factor in the totality equation and away from the central issue of voluntariness. Second, instructing the jury that they may consider “unnecessary delay” as a factor in the totality of the circumstances implies that if the jury decides that the delay was not unnecessary, it should not consider the delay at all in assessing the voluntariness of the statement. But this would be unfair to the defendant, who is entitled to have the jury consider the length of time he was in police custody as a factor in voluntariness regardless of whether the delay prior to preliminary arraignment was necessary or not. <em>See, e. g., Commonwealth v. </em>
