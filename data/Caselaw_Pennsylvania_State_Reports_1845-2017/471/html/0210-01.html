On September 21, 1970, an approximate one-half acre tract in Muhlenberg Township, Berks County, was condemned by the Department of Transportation [hereinafter “Department”] for highway improvement purposes. Compensation of $7,900 was tendered to the owner-condemnees, Harry M. and Anna E. Gehris, appellants herein, on December 1, 1970. Thereafter, on October 3, 1973, a board of viewers appointed on a petition by appellants filed a report awarding damages of $27,500. The Department appealed this award to the court of common pleas, and following a jury trial, a verdict was returned in condemnees’ favor in the sum of $26,000 plus damages for detention. The parties stipulated that the condemnees had expended in excess of $500 in appraisal expenses and that they had incurred these expenses subsequent to December 29, 1971, the effective date of § 610. The trial judge thereupon molded the verdict to include appraisal expenses of $500, the maximum allowed by the statute. The Department moved to strike the portion of the verdict representing appraisal fee reimbursement, and the court en banc denied the motion. On Appeal, this order was reversed by the Commonwealth Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The Department responds to this contention with two basic arguments: (1) to apply § 610 to this case would contravene the principle that statutes are not to be construed to opérate retroactively; (2) under applicable principles of statutory construction, it is ascertainable that the intention of the legislature was that § 610 is to be construed as applying only to cases wherein the condemnation transpired after December 29, 1971.

In this case the expenses were incurred after the effective date of § 610. Application of that section to these facts thus involves nothing more than a prospective operation of the statute.

Examining the language of § 302 in the context of the organization of the Code as a whole, it is contended that one finds that only the “procedural” provisions of Articles V and VII are to operate in the fashion requested by appellants; the “substantive” provisions contained in Article VI are limited to post-effective date condemnations. Because § 610 was inserted in Article VI, it is argued, that section should have no application to this post-effective date condemnation. Suffice it to say that our own careful examination of the Code reveals no consistent classification into “substantive” and “procedural” articles.

The Department points out that in § 606-A of the 1971 amendments, retroactive applicability is provided for those amendments dealing with the rights of “displaced persons”. The presence of this specific provision, argues the Department, implies the rejection of retroactive operation to § 610. The error of this analysis is that § 606-A speaks to true retroactivity, <em>viz., </em>application to operative events occurring before the act’s effective date. Nowhere in the 1971 act is there specific reference to the type of “retroactivity” contended for by appellants, namely, application to an event (expenditure for appraisals) which took place after the act’s effective date.</p>

We observe that in the introduction to its publication containing the amended Eminent Domain Code with comments, the Joint State Government Commission distinguishes between “official 1971 Comments” and “staff notes”. The note relied upon by the Department falls into the latter classification.</p>

It is pertinent that in § 1939 of the Statutory Construction Act, <em>supra, </em>it is stated that comments of a commission drafting a statute are generally to be consulted, “but the text of the statute shall control in the event of conflict between its text and such comments or report.”</p>
