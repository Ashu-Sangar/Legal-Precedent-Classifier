    <p id="b368-4" data-blocks='[["BL_368.4",368,[255,790,1153,688]]]'>Appellant was sixteen years and eleven months old at the time of his arrest. He was awakened by his mother at 8:20 a. m. and two police officers requested that he go with them because he was wanted for questioning concerning the death of Speakes. Appellant was taken to the Police Administration Building where he was questioned beginning at 9:40 a. m. Prior to this interrogation, <em>Miranda </em>warnings were read to him and he waived his rights. Gaskins gave his first inculpatory statement about 1:18 p. m. and this was followed by a formal confession later that afternoon. No consultation prior to his waiver was permitted at the Police Administration Building.</p>

According to the police witnesses, she declined such an offer because of the need to care for the younger children at home. There is also a conflict as to whether she was given a phone number by the officers where she could reach her son. Nonetheless, it is clear that Mrs. Gaskins was not called prior to the questioning, nor was she notified before he gave his formal confession. In <em>Chaney, </em>we stated:</p>

The record fails to establish such an opportunity. Even if we accept the Commonwealth’s testimony regarding what Mrs. Gaskins was told, we do not feel this meets what is necessary under <em>McCutchen. </em>This case is unlike <em>Commonwealth v. Mc</em>Fadden, <a href="/pa/470/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="470 Pa. 604" data-case-ids="1723826" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0604-01">470 Pa. 604</a>, <a href="/pa/470/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="470 Pa. 604" data-case-ids="1723826" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0604-01">369 A.2d 1156</a> (filed January 28, 1977), wherein we held that the requirements of <em>Mc-Cutchen </em>were satisfied. In that case, the defendant’s mother was present when he was arrested, informed of the nature of the charge, and read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Additionally, that record indicated a period of several minutes during which the mother could advise her son before any interrogation was initiated. <a href="/pa/470/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="470 Pa. 604" data-case-ids="1723826" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0604-01">470 Pa. at 604</a>, 369 A.2d at 1160. In the instant case, there is no showing that Mrs. Gaskins was aware either that her son was under any suspicion of actual involvement, or that she was informed of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>at the time he was taken from home. The mere offer to allow her to accompany her son in these circumstances cannot satisfy the requirement that an opportunity to consult be provided.</p>

Mitchell, </em><a href="/pa/464/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="464 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1710349" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0117-01">464 Pa. 117</a>, <a href="/pa/464/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="464 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1710349" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0117-01">346 A.2d 48</a> (1975), that this argument has been waived. However, <em>Mitchell </em>is inapplicable here. In that case, we held that a claim of unnecessary pre-arraignment delay not raised pre-trial, was waived even though it was prior to our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Futch, </em><a href="/pa/447/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="447 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1942994" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0389-01">447 Pa. 389</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=290%20A.2d%20417" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="290 A.2d 417">290 A.2d 417</a> (1972).

In the instant case, this confession was obtained on February 2, 1973. The suppression motion was heard and denied on June 29, 1973. Both events occurred well before our decision in <em>Roane, </em>the earliest of this line, was announced in November 1974. Because there was nothing comparable to a Rule of Criminal Procedure which, if violated, should have been known and raised by counsel, a <em>Mitchell </em>analysis is inappropriate. Counsel herein challenged the confession on a general voluntariness basis including the issue of a knowing waiver.</p>
