    <p id="b165-5" data-blocks='[["BL_165.5",165,[197,489,1151,627]]]'>Vincent Barnett and his wife, Sheryl, were found dead in their residence at 1213 N. 30th Street, Philadelphia. Their bodies were discovered by firemen responding to an alarm concerning a fire at their residence on August 15, 1974. The fire was subsequently determined to have been of an incendiary origin. Although their bodies were partially burned in the fire, the deaths were not the result of the fire. Sheryl had died from a beating and strangulation. Vincent had died as a result of two severe stab wounds of the neck and chest and had suffered numerous other stab wounds. Both bodies were tied at the hands and Vincent’s was bound at the feet.</p>
    <p id="b165-6" data-blocks='[["BL_165.6",165,[197,1156,1149,470]]]'>Detective Gilbert of the Philadelphia Police Department was assigned to investigate the killings on the day of the fire. On August 16, 1974, Gilbert met for the first time with Gregory Barnett, Vincent’s brother, at his mother’s residence next door to the scene of the fire. Gilbert inquired about Vincent’s background, but did not pursue the inquiry because Gregory was apparently upset over Vincent’s death. Gilbert did not meet with Gregory again until August 29,1974.</p>

The caller suggested Gregory Barnett knew about or was involved in the deaths. Acting on this information alone, Gilbert and other officers went to Barnett’s residence at approximately 6:55 a. m. on August 29, 1974. After being voluntarily admitted by Barnett, the police asked Barnett to accompany them to the Police Administration Building for questioning. Barnett asked if the police had a “search” warrant, and, upon being informed that they did not, he refused to ac<a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>company them. Barnett was placed under arrest, although he was permitted to dress before being handcuffed. He was transported in a police wagon to the Administration Building.</p>

She attempted to find someone to sit with her two minor children, but was unsuccessful. As a result, Gloria and the two minor children were taken to the Administration Building in a squad car.</p>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[252,878,1149,470]]]'>Barnett arrived at the Administration Building at 7:15 a. m. and was left alone in an interrogation room from 7:18 a. m. until 7:40 a. m. At 7:40 a. m., Gilbert gave Barnett <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Barnett then indicated he did not wish to remain silent and did not desire the presence of a lawyer. Barnett was then questioned. He denied any complicity in the killings, any knowledge of who committed the killings and indicated a willingness to submit to a lie detector test.</p>

From 8:15 a. m. until 11:15 a. m., Barnett was with the polygraph examiner except for a five minute period when he was alone. The polygraph examination took about twenty minutes to administer.</p>

At approximately 12:05 p. m., Gloria was re-interviewed and told Detective Hoff that on the day after August 15, 1974, Barnett came home wearing his brother’s clothing and two of his brother’s rings, and smelled of smoke. Gloria had previously been told, following an inquiry by her, that she could not be compelled to testify against her husband and that she would not get in any trouble for telling the truth.</p>

When Barnett first incriminated himself, he was indeed confronted with information obtained from an untainted source, namely, the information obtained from his wife, supra n. 5, and if this was all that Barnett had been confronted with at the time, then the Commonwealth might well have sustained its burden. See and compare, <em>Commonwealth v. Fogan, </em>supra, and <em>Commonwealth v. Marabel, </em><a href="/pa/445/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="445 Pa. 435" data-case-ids="1940083" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0435-01">445 Pa. 435</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=283%20A.2d%20285" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="283 A.2d 285">283 A.2d 285</a> (1971). Furthermore, the remorse expressed by Barnett supports the Commonwealth’s position. See, e. g., <em>Commonwealth v. Davis, </em><a href="/pa/462/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="462 Pa. 27" data-case-ids="485150" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0027-01">462 Pa. 27</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="462 Pa. 27" data-case-ids="485150" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0027-01">336 A.2d 888</a> (1975). But, when confronted with the information obtained from his wife, Barnett was also confronted with the fact that he failed the polygraph examination; this fact is dispositive.

      <p id="b167-8" data-blocks='[["BL_167.8",167,[191,1927,1145,414]],["BL_168.1",168,[298,2185,1112,148]]]'>. We shall assume for purposes of the disposition of these appeals that the presence of Barnett’s wife at the Administration Building, the questioning of her, and the information obtained from her were not tainted by the illegal arrest of Barnett. She testified that she did not request permission to accompany her husband, but the court credited other testimony which established she voluntarily requested to accompany him. Because the court credited the other testimony, a difficult issue, that is, whether the marital relationship in itself would be sufficient reason to consider the accompanying of her husband as tainted by the arrest, would otherwise be presented. But, since disposition of these ap<a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>peals can be made without confronting that difficult issue, we express no view as to its resolution but merely assume, as the Commonwealth advocates, that the information obtained from Barnett’s wife was not tainted by his illegal arrest.</p>
