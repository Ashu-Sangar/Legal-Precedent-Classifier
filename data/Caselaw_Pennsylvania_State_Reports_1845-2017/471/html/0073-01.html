Subsequently, in April 1975, Mr. Zamborsky again contacted her in order to have her sign a consent to the adoption. Appellee signed the consent, but, as a result of this meeting, she apparently thought she may have an opportunity to get her child back. Appellee notified Mr. Zamborsky, in June 1975 prior to the hearing on the voluntary proceedings, that she would not go through with the voluntary termination proceedings. A petition for involuntary termination was filed by the persons having custody of the child. After a hearing, the court below refused to terminate appellee’s rights and denied the petition.

They assert that the delivery of the child to the intermediary in December 1973 was the affirmative indication necessary to a finding of a settled purpose under Section 311(1). It is argued that at that time, appellee believed her act to be final and irrevocable and, therefore, her intent to relinquish her rights is proven. Thus, this case is also argued to be distinguishable from <em>Wolfe, supra, </em>in which the mother believed she could recant within six months.</p>

She testified that she did not want to give up the child but that this decision was forced upon her by parental pressure. Such pressure has been held to vitiate a <em>voluntary </em>consent agreement. <em>See Susko Adoption Case, </em><a href="/pa/363/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="363 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1221633" data-case-paths="/pa/363/0078-01">363 Pa. 78</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.2d%20132" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="69 A.2d 132">69 A.2d 132</a> (1949). Appellee also argues that not until April 1975 was she aware of her right to recant her <em>voluntary </em>relinquishment at any time prior to a final court decree of <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>adoption. She indeed had such a right. <em>See Chambers Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/452/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="452 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="574695" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0149-01">452 Pa. 149</a>, 154, <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%20360" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="305 A.2d 360">305 A.2d 360</a>, 363 (1973). If the evidence presented on these claims by appellee were accepted as true, it could rebut the inference of a settled purpose which arises from the affirmative act of delivery of the child to the intermediary. Additionally, such evidence could undermine the argument that a final purpose persisted for the required time period because evidence of subsequent statements or inaction by the mother would have to be viewed in light of her wrongful impression that the adoption was irrevocable in December 1973. Since the evidence as to appellee’s voluntary and intelligent decision is in conflict, we believe the trial court was in a better position to resolve any factual dispute.
