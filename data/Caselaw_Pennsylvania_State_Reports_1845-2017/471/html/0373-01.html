Stasko, Jr., appeals from the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County. He was indicted and charged with the <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>murder of Bernadette Marie Demeter on January 7, 1974. A jury found him guilty of murder in the second degree and appellant was sentenced to a prison term of ten to twenty years, with credit for time served.

The victim was a part-time employee at the Montgomery Ward department store located in the Borough of Charleroi, Washington County, Pennsylvania. The defendant and victim knew each other and had dated for approximately nine months prior to the murder. The relation was broken off by the victim, however, on January 5,1974.</p>

She drove to work and parked her car on the lot adjacent to the store. The night was clear and cold. At approximately 9:31 p. m., the victim left the store and proceeded to her car. Almost immediately thereafter, three witnesses who were driving across the parking lot heard the victim scream and observed another individual, later identified by the witnesses as the appellant, striking the victim on the ground beside her car. Upon seeing the witnesses, appellant fled the scene in the direction of the nearby Monongahela River. The witnesses gave chase and, with the assistance of the Charleroi Police, apprehended the appellant in the river. The victim died of multiple stab wounds of the chest en route to the hospital in an ambulance. No weapon was ever found.</p>

When prejudicial remarks are made by the prosecution, however, the trial judge may, under certain circumstance and if the impropriety is timely brought to the court’s attention, correct the error. “Indeed, control of the prosecution’s comments is largely delegated to the discretion of the trial judge.” <em>Commonwealth v. Silvis, </em><a href="/pa/445/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="445 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="1939998" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0235-01">445 Pa. 235</a>, 237, <a href="/citations/?q=284%20A.2d%20740" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="284 A.2d 740">284 A.2d 740</a>, 741 (1971). Here, the indiscretion was quickly noted by objection and curative instructions were delivered. The question remains whether the instructions adequately protected the rights <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>of the accused. In <em>Commonwealth v. Russell, supra, </em>we held that the trial judge’s instruction to the jury was insufficient to erase the prejudice of a witness’ testimony. There, the witness testified as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant and also expressed his opinion that all the defense witnesses were lying. Compared with those comments, the single irresponsible remark of the prosecutor in this case was of a less prejudicial nature and, certainly, curable. The remark was not directed to the guilt or innocence of the accused. Nor did the prosecutor blanketly attack the appellant’s credibility. Under the circumstances, we find that the trial judge’s instructions were sufficient to assure the appellant of a fair and impartial trial. <em>See Commonwealth v. Stoltzfus, </em><a href="/pa/462/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="462 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="485206" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0043-01">462 Pa. 43</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="462 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="485206" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0043-01">337 A.2d 873</a> (1975).</p>

Specifically, I agree that appellant was not deprived of his federal and state constitutional rights of confrontation because under the facts of this case, it is unquestioned that the defense was provided a full opportunity to cross examine the witness during the deposition. Nevertheless, I am troubled by the majority’s reliance upon <em>Commonwealth v.

Ed.2d 923</a> (1965), the United States Supreme Court held that prior testimony was admissible at trial only if the accused had been represented at the earlier proceeding and had an adequate opportunity to cross examine the witness. In my view, such an opportunity is not afforded a defendant at a preliminary hearing. The principal function of that proceeding is to protect an individual’s right against unlawful detention. The Commonwealth therefore is required to establish a prima facie case that a crime has been committed by the accused. <em>Commonwealth v. Mullen, </em><a href="/pa/460/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="460 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="482814" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0336-01">460 Pa. 336</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="460 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="482814" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0336-01">333 A.2d 755</a> (1975). In meeting this burden however, the Commonwealth need not present all its witnesses or divulge its entire case at this time. Similarly, the defense is not attempting to try its case or discredit witnesses but rather to learn the key elements and theory upon which the prosecution intends to proceed at trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> Thus, the scope of the preliminary hearing is of such a limited nature that the full rights of a complete cross examination can not be adequately protected and therefore, the testimony adduced at these hearings should not be permitted when that witness is unavailable at trial.</p>
    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[286,1624,1148,439]]]'>I also concur in the view that the trial court properly rejected the proffered psychological testimony. A reading of the record makes it clear that the offer restricted the use of this testimony to the issue of the sufficiency of the provocation. As recognized in <em>Commonwealth v.
