    <p id="b433-4" data-blocks='[["BL_433.5",433,[193,526,1148,851]]]'>Herbert C. Dunlap died on January 8, 1974. By a will dated July 9, 1969, he left his estate to his three children, Geraldine Zettlemoyer, Kenneth Dunlap and Herbert C. Dunlap, Jr. in equal shares. A codicil dated December 4, 1973, however, reduced the share of appellant, Geraldine Zettlemoyer, to twenty per cent and increased the shares of each son to forty per cent. Appellant filed a Petition Sur Appeal from the Register of Wills’ probate of the codicil. Appellant asserted that the codicil was invalid because it was procured through the undue influence of Herbert C. Dunlap, Jr. After appellant presented her evidence, the Orphans’ Court granted appellee’s motion for a nonsuit. In this appeal,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> appellant contends that it was improper to grant the nonsuit. We conclude that the nonsuit was properly granted and affirm the decree of the trial court.</p>

From 1972 to April 1973, testator lived in a room in Dublin, Pennsylvania, while employed as a security guard. In April 1973, he entered the hospital for sixteen days and underwent a prostate operation. After leaving the hospital, he went to live <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>with his son Herbert, Jr. for six to eight weeks. He did not return to work. While recuperating from surgery, testator was unable to operate an automobile. Herbert, Jr. took him to visit friends and to shop. He also took his father to the bank, always dropping him off at the curb and never entering the bank with him.</p>
    <p id="b435-4" data-blocks='[["BL_435.4",435,[181,648,1152,723]]]'>In June 1973, testator moved to his own apartment in Fort Washington, about four miles from Herbert, Jr.’s home. He also bought a new car, which he drove for about two months. He then attempted to sell the car back to the dealer, but was dissatisfied with the price offered. Instead, he gave the car to Herbert, Jr. in return for his son’s agreement to chauffeur him when he needed a ride. Herbert, Jr. and his wife visited testator approximately three or four times a week. In general, testator conducted his own affairs. However, he did receive some help in paying his bills: he would give cash to Herbert Jr.’s wife who then bought money orders and mailed the payments.</p>
    <p id="b435-5" data-blocks='[["BL_435.5",435,[183,1407,1151,499]]]'>From April to November 1973, appellant did not communicate with her father. Herbert, Jr. made no attempt to inform his sister where their father was residing; nor did appellant contact Herbert, Jr., to ascertain this information. On November 24, 1973, Herbert, Jr. telephoned appellant, informed her of their father’s address and asked her to help care for him. Testator also spoke to appellant by phone on that day. Nevertheless, appellant had no further contact with testator before his death.</p>

She made the call to arrange a time which would be convenient for Herbert, Jr. to drive his father to the attorney’s office. Herbert, Jr. took his father there on November 29, 1973. He was not present while testator and his attorney conferred. Testator directed <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>his attorney to prepare a codicil to his will decreasing the share going to his daughter.

      <em>“I </em>attempted to engage him in conversation about that, because I don’t particularly like to do that kind of thing . . . and he didn’t give me much of a reason except to say something to the effect that he thought she didn’t care as much about him as his sons cared about him . . .</blockquote>
