Following the denial of posttrial motions, Carr received a life sentence on the murder indictment and suspended sentences on the remaining charges.

The Commonwealth first attempts to counter this contention by asserting that the appellant had deliberately misrepresented to the police that his age was over 18. It is urged that this attempt tb deceive should now preclude appellant from raising any claim based upon his minority at the time of his arrest. Our concern relating to the circumstances surrounding the waiver of Miranda rights<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> by one under 18 years of age was inspired by a recognition that the juvenile’s immaturity rendered him uniquely vulnerable to the pressures of a <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>police custodial atmosphere. As noted by the United States Supreme Court:</p>
    <blockquote id="b217-4" data-blocks='[["BL_217.4",217,[245,420,1103,908]]]'>We conclude that the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is applicable in the case of juveniles as it is with respect to adults. We appreciate that special problems may arise with respect to waiver of the privilege by or on behalf of children, and that there may well be some differences in technique — but not in principle — depending upon the age of the child and the presence and competence of parents. The participation of counsel will, of course, assist the police, Juvenile Courts and appellate tribunals in administering the privilege. If counsel was not present for some permissible reason when an admission was obtained, the greatest care must be taken to assure that the admission was voluntary, in the sense not only that it was not coerced or suggested, but also that it was not the product of ignorance of rights or of adolescent fantasy, fright or despair.</blockquote>
