The Commission has relied upon Section 203(a) of the Public Utility Law, 66 P.S. § 1123(a), as authority for its incorporation of the disputed condition. That section authorizes the Commission, in granting a certificate of public convenience, to “impose such conditions as it may deem to be just and reasonable.” The Commonwealth Court’s view is that the Commission and an applicant for a certificate might dispute the exact area to be covered by a certificate and that “on a proper record made” the Commission might preserve the dispute by offering a certificate conditioned upon the applicant’s agreeing to extend its service at some future date to the remainder of the disputed area. 10 Pa.Cmwlth. <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>at 544, <a href="/citations/?q=311%20A.2d%20370" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="311 A.2d 370">311 A.2d 370</a>.

The case involved an action for an injunction to prevent hearings scheduled before the PUC. The purpose of the hearings was to determine whether an extension of service beyond the Borough’s certificated area should be ordered. The Court dismissed the Borough’s complaint, holding that in view of the closeness of the question of the PUC’s authority to order an extension, and the existence of an adequate remedy at law in the form of an appeal from any final PUC order, an injunction against the hearings was inappropriate.</p>

Cf. § 403 which states that common carriers must provide services “to and from such stations or points, as the commission, having regard to the accommodation, convenience, and safety of the public, may require.” 66 P.S. § 1173 (1959). This provision cannot be reconciled with an interpretation of the Public Utility Law requiring a utility’s consent prior to ordering service to new points. It is even more explicit than § 401 in demonstrating the Legislature’s intent that the PUC have the authority to order utilities to provide services to new areas without regard to the utility’s consent. That § 403 applies only to common carriers does not suggest that the obligation to make extensions, imposed upon all utilities in § 401, be read more narrowly. Section 403 restates a number of the obligations imposed by § 401 in slightly different form. Compare, for example, “Every public utility shall furnish and maintain adequate, efficient, safe, and reasonable service and facilities . , . .” and “[s]uch service shall also be reasonably continuous and without unreasonable interruptions or delay. .” in § 401, with “[e]very common carrier shall furnish a reasonably sufficient number of safe facilities . . . <em>run </em>and operate the same with such motive power as may reasonably be required . . and shall operate its facilities with sufficient frequency ... as the commission, having regard to the accommodation, convenience, and safety of the public, may require . . .” in § 403.</p>

While there may be different policy considerations applicable to water companies and common carriers, the identical phrase cannot be interpreted as a limitation on the PUC’s power with regard to one and not the other.</p>

Responding to the same constitutional arguments raised by the Water Company in this case, the court held the scope of dedication to be coextensive with the charter territory of the company and upheld the order. <a href="/pa-super/103/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="103 Pa.

The Water Company argues that the significance of charter territories has been vitiated by the 1963 amendments inviting public utilities to incorporate under or be governed by the Business Corporation Law, which permits a corporation to conduct business throughout the state. 15 P.S. §§ 1001-2202 (1967). Because I do not believe that the scope of dedication of a public utility can be changed only by its consent, see infra, it is unnecessary to define the Water Company’s present scope of dedication. I only note that the argument of the Water Company that its certificated area defines its scope of dedication would, if accepted, require a departure from existing case law.
