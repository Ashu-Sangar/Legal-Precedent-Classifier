Insurance rates are proposed annually by a rating bureau subject to supervision and examination by the Insurance Commissioner. Proposed rates for black lung coverage are proposed by the intervenor Coal Mine Compensation Rating Bureau of Pennsylvania [Rating Bureau], an organization composed of the insurance carriers which provide black lung coverage. No insurance policy may issue except in accordance with the rates proposed by the Rating Bureau, as modified, amended or approved by the Insurance Commissioner. Under this regulatory scheme, the Insurance Commissioner reviews the rates to determine if they are excessive or discriminatory.

The Association’s interest in the rates its members are required to pay for black lung insurance does not involve any property rights under traditional concepts of property law. The absence of such traditional property rights, however, does not mean that the Association has no “property” interest subject to due process protections. The expanding participation of the government in our economy has meant that many forms of benefits and privileges extended by the government are at least as important to the individual as traditional forms of property. The role of the government in providing such benefits, and the power that inheres in this role, have made it necessary to provide safeguards to preserve the independent status of the individual. See Reich, The New Property, <a href="/citations/?q=73%20Yale%20L.J.%20733" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="73 Yale L.J. 733">73 Yale L.J. 733</a> (1964). Thus, the Association’s interest in the rates set for black lung insurance cannot be dismissed as a mere privilege. As Mr. Justice Blackmun recently wrote for the United States Supreme Court: “this Court now has rejected the concept that constitutional rights turn upon whether a governmental benefit is characterized as a ‘right’ or as a ‘privilege.’ ” <em>Graham v.

A citizen is best protected against arbitrary action when he is given an opportunity to challenge that action before it is taken. Not only is it easier to persuade the government to reconsider a decision before it is carried out, but the citizen is also protected against infringement on his interest for the period during which his challenge takes place. Even if the citizen prevails in proceedings which take place after government action is taken, he still has suffered an infringement on his interests during the period required for those proceedings. Thus, procedural protection should be given before the government takes action which threatens to deprive a citizen of an interest, unless important governmental interests, or the preservation of the interests of others, require otherwise.

These statutes make provision for self-insurance and the largest coal mining companies in the state are self-insured. The coal mining companies represented in this action, however, have not been able to qualify for self-insurance. Therefore these statutes, as a practical matter, require these companies to purchase insurance.</p>

In the Commonwealth Court the Insurance Department moved to quash the appeal as not having been taken from an “adjudication” and because the Association had not exhausted its administrative remedies. 40 P.S. § 814 (Supp.1976) provides a procedure by which a party aggrieved by a rate change can have that rate change reviewed after it becomes effective. The Commonwealth Court held that the Association could not appeal the 1975 rates, because the Association was not a party to the proceedings by which rates were deemed into effect, and that any due process rights the Association might have could be protected by following the procedures outlined in 40 P.S. § 814. <em>Commonwealth, Insurance Dep’t v.

The majority in <em>Bishop </em>held that the determination whether a public employee has a “property” interest within the protection of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment is to be determined by reference to state law.

This claim is without merit. This section is applicable only to parties to an administrative proceeding. The Association was not named as a party, and the Association does not have a right to intervene as a party to rate increase proceedings if the Insurance Commissioner decides to allow the proposed rates to be deemed into effect without a hearing.
