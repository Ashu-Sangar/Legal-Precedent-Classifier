Ms. Young, called as a Commonwealth witness, testified on direct examination that she saw the defendant shoot Calvin Turner. During the course of her cross-examination, defense counsel produced a statement allegedly given by Ms. Young to counsel prior to trial which in various particulars was inconsistent with her testimony. When confronted with the document, Ms. Young admitted that the signatures on it were hers, but denied having made most of the statements contained in it. The defense subsequently called to the stand one Joseph Prim, who testified that he had been present when the statement was given by April Young. He gave his recollection of the substance of that statement, and testified that the statement had been taken down by counsel in counsel’s own words.</p>

We find no error in the court’s ruling. Furthermore, appellant was able to make substantial use of the statement in his questioning both of Ms. Young and of Prim. In this process the jury was made fully aware of the contents of the statement, the circumstances under which it was made, and that it had been signed by Young. The mere fact that it was not formally admitted into evidence was in no wise prejudicial to the defendant. <em>See </em>1 Henry, Pennsylvania Evidence, § 1 at 4 n. 16 (1953 ed.).</p>

The officer testified, over objection, that when he examined the weapon, a .38 snubnose revolver, it had a gray discoloration on the cylinder and barrel. He then testified, based upon his experience in firing weapons, that such discoloration indicated that the gun had been fired, although he could not say when it had been fired. The appellant contends that this testimony should not have been admitted because the officer had not been properly qualified as an expert in firearms.

He contends, however, that the rehabilitation in this ease was “overly broad” in that the prosecutor was permitted to ask Andrews if the statement which he gave the police shortly after his arrest was “substantially” the same as his testimony. Appellant argues that this was an improper conclusion because the statements themselves were not introduced into evidence so that the jury could judge for itself whether, they were “substantially” the same as Andrews’ trial testimony. In dismissing this claim, we need only point out that under our case law which recognizes the above exception as to the use of prior consistent statements, there is no requirement that they be introduced into evidence if they are referred to; nor do we believe that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the questioning and the response.</p>

The majority characterizes the trial court’s comments as an expression of its opinion that there was no evidence of voluntary manslaughter. The majority holds that this was not error because the trial court fully informed the jury of its power to return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter, whether supported by evidence or not, and instructed the jury that it was not bound by the court’s comments on the evidence. I cannot agree with the majority’s characterization of the trial court’s comments. The trial court did not merely state that in its opinion, there was no evidence of voluntary manslaughter. Rather, the trial court instructed the jury that in its opinion voluntary manslaughter was an “inappropriate verdict,” a comment directed not merely to the evidence to be considered by the jury, but to a verdict which the trial court implied the jury should not return. This direction exceeded the permissible bounds of judicial comment and improperly im<a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>pinged upon the sole province of the jury.

Assuming, however, that the comment in <em>Rivera </em>was proper, it is distinguishable from the trial court’s expression of opinion here. Unlike the court in <em>Rivera, </em>the trial court here did not merely state that it did not think that voluntary manslaughter was involved, but asserted that it would be “inappropriate” for the jury to return a voluntary manslaughter verdict. Thus, there is an even greater likelihood than in <em>Rivera </em>that the jury would think that it was wrong to return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter.</p>
