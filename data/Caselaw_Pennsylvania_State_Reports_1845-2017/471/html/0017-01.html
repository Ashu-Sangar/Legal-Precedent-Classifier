Keeley was the president and owner of all of the capital stock of Keeley Realty Company and Brentwater Homes, Inc., corporations with offices in Camp Hill, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. He was also president of Pennsboro Homes, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Keeley Realty Company. In the spring of that year Keeley undertook to acquire land in Hampden Township, Cumberland County for the development of a planned community to be known as the “Village of Westover”. To this end he introduced himself to Richard W. Weibley, one of the appellees. Mr. Weibley and his wife, Kathryn, owned a stone farmhouse on Sky-port Road in Hampden Township built during the colonial period; his mother, Lucy G. Weibley, owned an adjacent tract of land of 109 acres. Mr. Keeley indicated to Mr. Weibley that he intended to develop the land, if acquired, as part of his projected “colonial village”, and he further indicated that the Weibleys’ colonial farmhouse would be a focal point of the proposed village. Mr. Weibley became interested in the planned colonial village, and on behalf of his mother entered into negotiations with Mr. Keeley for the sale of the 109 acre tract. The result was a written agreement, dated April 24, 1969, by which Mrs. Lucy Weibley contracted to sell her land to Pennsboro Homes, Inc.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

After two or three meetings between the parties, appellees, by written agreement dated August 2, 1969, contracted to convey on or before April 1, 1970 an unrestricted title to a 4^2 acre tract to Brentwater Homes, Inc., the appellant. It is this agreement which is the subject of this litigation.</p>

In September, 1969, after the execution of the agreement of sale, the Weibleys learned for the first time of the proposed rezoning, and Mr. Weibley spoke in opposition to <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>the rezoning in public hearings on the subject. Nevertheless, in November, 1969, the Hampden Township Commissioners rezoned the area to permit the proposed development. When, shortly prior to the date for closing the sale transaction, Mr. Keeley expressed readiness to close on behalf of Brentwater Homes, Inc., the Weibleys refused to do so except on condition that restrictions be inserted in the deed which would have limited the use of the property to single houses of a stated value and would have had the effect of maintaining in force the zoning classifications existing at the date of the contract. These conditions were unacceptable to Keeley, who also refused to rescind the sale agreement. This action was then commenced by Brentwater Homes.</p>
    <p id="b149-4" data-blocks='[["BL_149.4",149,[187,1073,1152,527]]]'>The defense of the Weibleys to this action was that they had been induced by Brentwater Homes’ agent, Mr. Keeley, to sign the contract of sale by representations that the real estate to be conveyed would be developed as a single family, “high class” residential community and that these representations were in fact false and fraudulent when made. The chancellor held that this defense had been made out. The only question for determination on this appeal is whether the evidence supports the chancellor’s conclusion. We hold that it does.</p>

In his adjudication the chancellor characterized Richard Weibley’s testimony concerning Mr. Keeley’s assurances as “credible, convincing, distinct and detailed,” and concluded as a matter of law that Keeley had induced the appellees to enter into the contract of sale “by fraudulently assuring them that he had plans to erect only single family homes on the tract”, and that the contract was therefore voidable by the Weibleys.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

It is clear, furthermore, and the chancellor found, that during the time the agreement for the sale of the appellees’ land was being negotiated but before it was executed, Mr. Keeley entertained definite plans to use the land for such structures as a medical center, a nursing home, apartments and a high-rise structure; in July of 1969, a planner employed by Brentwater Homes appeared before the local Planning Commission with proposals to rezone the land in that area to permit such uses. Accepting the Weibley version of the above conversations, as the trial court did, these plans and proposals by appellant were duplicitous.</p>

The two purchases of land, one by appellant Brentwater Homes and the other by its affiliate Pennsboro Homes, from members of the Weibley family were essentially a continuum, the negotiations for both being handled by the same two persons — Mr. Keeley for the vendees and Mr. Weibley for the vendors. The statements made in connection with the first transaction were germane to the second. Resolution of the conflicts which undeniably were present in the testimony depended on the chancellor’s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses before him. Having found fraudulent misrepresentation to have been made, the trial judge properly concluded that the contract was voidable and unenforceable as against appellees. We find neither abuse of discretion nor error of law in his decision.</p>

The evidence, however, does support the conclusion that, in connection with the negotiations over the prior sale of land, Mr. Keeley, whether intentionally or not, led the Weibleys to believe that his proposed colonial village would consist solely of single-family homes, and that they indicated to him their objections to having apartments constructed in the vicinity of their colonial farmhouse.

Although the sale of the senior Mrs. Weibley’s land was a separate transaction from the one in question, that a certain continuity between them was presumed is evident from Mr. Keeley’s statement that he wanted to acquire the instant property for the continuation of his village. Since the record indicates that Mr. Keeley did in fact begin to build single-family homes on the first tract conveyed, since the area was then zoned for single-family dwellings, and since Mr. Keeley had previously indicated that he was not interested in building apartments, the Weibleys’ assumption that Mr. Keeley’s proposed continuation of the village would involve the construction of more single-family homes was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>

Town houses, rental apartments, and single-family houses of either colonial or contemporary design offer a full range of choice.” (2) The agreement of sale for the first tract of land indicates that the parties <em>removed </em>restrictions from the property, making it unlikely that appellees expected the second tract to be restricted to single-family homes. (3) Although he protested the rezoning, Mr. Weibley did not disaffirm the contract on the ground of fraud when he learned of Mr. Keeley’s plan in September, and even the following March, rather than accusing Mr. Keeley of fraud, he instead attempted to supplement the agreement with restrictions he drafted himself and was clearly capable of drafting at the time of the agreement had such restrictions then been important to him. On the other hand, Mr. Weibley testified that he had not read the entire article abput Montgomery Village and only discussed it in the context of a picture showing bicycle paths, while the record is unclear about the nature of the restrictions removed from the first tract.

    <p id="b161-6" data-blocks='[["BL_161.7",161,[176,1260,1153,805]]]'>I dissent from the majority’s conclusion that the evidence clearly and convincingly established fraud. In this respect, I agree with the concurring and dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Eagen. I do not believe, however, that the denial of specific performance was proper. I cannot accept Mr. Justice Eagen’s reasoning that, because appellees erroneously assumed that appellant would build only single family dwellings on the tract in question, a “sufficiently misleading concealment ... to justify the chancellor’s refusal to grant specific performance of the contract,” has been proved. I fail to see any distinction between “fraud” and “sufficiently misleading concealment.” Since, in my opinion, appellees failed to meet their burden of establishing fraud, I would grant the specific performance requested.</p>
