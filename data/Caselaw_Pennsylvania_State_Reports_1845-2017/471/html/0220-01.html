    <p class="author" id="b349-6" data-blocks='[["BL_349.6",349,[254,755,313,33]]]'>PER CURIAM:</p>
    <p id="b349-7" data-blocks='[["BL_349.7",349,[210,815,1146,151]]]'>Appellant was convicted of murder of the first degree after a jury trial. Posttrial motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
    <p id="b349-8" data-blocks='[["BL_349.8",349,[209,988,1148,368]]]'>Appellant raises six issues on appeal: (1) the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict; (2) the admission of testimony regarding the lighting conditions at the scene of the crime; (3) the manner of impeachment of a defense witness; (4) denial of appellant’s challenge for cause of a juror; (5) the validity of his indictment; and (6) failure to suppress his admissions to the police.</p>
    <p id="b349-9" data-blocks='[["BL_349.9",349,[207,1391,1150,421]]]'>Appellant waived the last two issues because he did not raise them in post-trial motions. E. g., <em>Commonwealth v.

Moreover, appellant has new appellate counsel who has not raised the issue of the ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to preserve these claims for appellate review. See <em>Commonwealth v. Dancer, </em><a href="/pa/460/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="460 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="482887" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0095-01">460 Pa. 95</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="460 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="482887" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0095-01">331 A.2d 435</a> (1975).</p>

I agree. Due process considerations require that an accused be accorded a fair trial “by a panel of impartial and ‘indifferent’ jurors.” <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b350-6" data-blocks='[["BL_350.6",350,[274,1428,1156,738]]]'>Prosecution witnesses in this case were members of the same police department as the juror’s husband. The record discloses that her husband was the Chief Police Inspector of the Philadelphia Police Detectives, and that he shared office space with the Chief Inspector of the Homicide Detectives. Furthermore, the record reveals that the juror and her husband often socialized with the Chief of the Homicide Detectives and his wife. Because of her husband’s position, and because of the various social ties existing between the potential juror and other members of the police force and their families, the possibility that the juror would have unconscious prejudices causing her to unwittingly favor the prosecution is great in this case.</p>
