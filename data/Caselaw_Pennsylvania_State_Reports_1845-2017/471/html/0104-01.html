The agreement also provided that the optionees, if they exercised the option, would accept a deed for the property from one Everett McDonald. At the time he entered into this lease-option agreement, Mr. Miller had in his possession a deed to the property in question which was signed by Everett McDonald and his wife. The space in the deed for the grantee’s name, however, was blank, and the deed apparently was not acknowledged. In January, 1969, appellant or her late husband orally communicated to Mr. Miller their desire to exercise the option, and this communication was orally acknowledged by Mr. Miller. Thereafter, Mrs. Salzman or her husband made several attempts to arrange for settlement, but Miller either refused or neglected to fix a date. In February, 1973, Mr. and Mrs. Miller received a second deed to the property from the McDonalds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> This deed named the Millers as grantees as tenants by the entireties, and was subsequently recorded.</p>

    <blockquote id="b236-5" data-blocks='[["BL_236.5",236,[317,637,1113,797]]]'>“The deed in question [deed of February, 1973 from McDonald and his former wife naming the Millers as tenants by the entireties] was executed and delivered after .execution of the lease-option agreement, the latter being entered into at a time when defendant, Lloyd H. Miller, did not have title to the property .... The fact that Lloyd H. Miller did not have title to the property when he signed the lease-option agreement is immaterial under the doctrine of estoppel by deed. However, his having taken title in his and his wife’s name as tenants by the entireties requires that Mary V. Miller, his wife, execute the deed to plaintiff for the purpose of passing the title; but since the lease-option agreement was not signed by the wife, her inchoate intestate interest is not affected. . . . ”</blockquote>
    <p id="b236-6" data-blocks='[["BL_236.6",236,[264,1492,1157,804]]]'> For several reasons we believe the trial court’s reasoning is erroneous. First, as the quoted portion of the opinion indicates, in applying the doctrine of estoppel by deed the court gave effect to the second deed naming the Millers as grantees holding as tenants by the entire-ties. It is clear, however, that Mrs. Miller could not obtain any “intestate” rights by virtue of this deed. If Mrs. Miller had any interest in the property, it was by virtue of being a tenant by the entireties. It is fundamental that in a tenancy by the entireties, each spouse owns the entire estate as long as both are living. <em>Gasner v.

      <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>Second, and more importantly, if any effect is to be given to the deed naming the Millers as grantees holding as tenants by the entireties, then the trial court erred in decreeing specific performance. As already noted,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Mrs. Miller did not sign the lease-option agreement. Nor is there any evidence in the present record which indicates that she was aware of the transaction with the Salzmans, acquiesced in it, or in any way ratified it. We have held that a husband’s attempt to alienate or encumber an estate by the entireties absent his wife’s joinder violates the Statute of Frauds and is unenforceable against the wife. <em>Del Borrello v.

While it is clear that Mr. Miller was not the record owner and did not have legal title to the property, there is evidence in the record which suggests that he might have been the equitable owner of the premises. (For example, Mr. Miller apparently received the blank deed from the McDonalds in return for assuming the McDonalds’ mortgage payments; also, Mr. Miller’s answer to the complaint alleges that the Salzmans knew or should have known that he was the actual owner of the premises, “since the situation was fully explained to them” before the lease-option was entered into.)</blockquote>

Was it intended that Mr. Miller alone was to be the owner of the premises? These questions, in turn, raise the question of the nature of the relationship between the Mc-Donalds and Mr. Miller (and/or his wife). There is evidence in the record which suggests that Mr. Miller may have been an agent for the McDonalds. (For example, the provision in the lease-option agreement that the Salzmans would accept a deed from Everett McDonald; Mr. Miller’s testimony (a) that he did not have title in his name and that “the McDonald’s [sic] could have done anything to the property at this time” [Deposition of Lloyd H.
