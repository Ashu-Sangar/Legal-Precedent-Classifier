In the late afternoon of October 15, 1971 one Keith Moore obtained a silver-barrelled .32 caliber pistol from a friend. Shortly thereafter Moore learned from his brother and two others that Bernard Sparrow, the defendant, was looking for him. The four men then left Moore’s house and began walking, <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>Moore taking the gun with him in a paper bag. One member of the group, Erie Boyd, left the others for a short while and returned with two bullets. He thereupon asked for and was given the gun, which he placed in his trousers.</p>
    <p id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[193,590,1148,639]]]'>Soon the group was augmented by two other persons, Kenneth Wallace and Jerome Bryant. Bryant informed the others: “We’re rumbling white boys at 16th and Morris.” He asked if any of the others had a weapon, whereupon the pistol was given to Bryant by Boyd, and loaded. Later Wallace asked for the weapon and Bryant complied. As the group reached the corner of Dickinson and Mole Streets in Philadelphia they were joined by the defendant, who demanded the pistol from Wallace and was given it. Sparrow was then heard to boast: “I’m going to get me a homicide.” He made it clear that the object of his remark would be a white person.</p>
    <p id="b623-5" data-blocks='[["BL_623.5",623,[193,1264,1150,1081]]]'>Sparrow, Bryant and Wallace, separated from the other members of the group, then proceeded along Mole Street. Sparrow carried the gun underneath his coat and expressed his intention to rob someone. As they were walking, an automobile being driven along Mole Street stopped and a white male alighted. This person, later identified as Joseph Jaworski, opened the car’s trunk and began removing some pies. Wallace walked past Mr. Jaworski, but Bryant and Sparrow approached him from opposite directions, the appellant from the sidewalk side and Bryant from the street side. Sparrow waved the gun in Jaworski’s face, saying,o “You don’t think this gun is real, do you?” When Jaworski rejoined that he did believe the gun was real, the defendant ordered, “Give me your money.” Jaworski told the defendant he didn’t have any money and began calling for help. As he was shouting, the defendant fired the pistol once, killing Mr. Jaworski instantly. Sparrow was subsequently arrested, tried and convicted as detailed above.</p>

This is clearly a misstatement of the law. Second, the majority’s assertion that merger only operates as to offenses in which the “same facts prove both” is completely untenable.
