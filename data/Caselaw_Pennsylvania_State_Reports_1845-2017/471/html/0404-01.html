    <p id="b534-6" data-blocks='[["BL_534.6",534,[268,658,1162,1021]]]'>In April, 1961, appellee’s husband, Harry Rempel, purchased a thirty-year mortgage protection policy from appellant, Nationwide Life Insurance Company, Inc., through Nationwide’s agent, appellant, Reid W. Mc-Gibbeny. The policy was designed to pay to the beneficiary, appellee, Dolores I. Rempel, an amount approximately equal to the outstanding mortgage balance, if any, on the Rempel home when the insured, appellee’s husband, Harry Rempel, died. In July, 1961, appellee Rempel, upon instructions from her husband, again contacted McGibbeny and asked whether Nationwide could match a policy offered by a competing insurance company that would provide the same mortgage protection plus an additional $5,000 of life insurance, for only a few dollars a month in increased cost. McGibbeny, after consulting Nationwide, told the Rempels that a $5,000 whole life policy with a twenty-year family income rider would provide the protection sought for only a few dollars per month more than the cost of the original policy.</p>
    <p id="b534-7" data-blocks='[["BL_534.7",534,[258,1709,1156,647]],["BL_535.1",535,[203,313,1157,258]]]'>After a discussion in the Rempel home, an application form was signed by the insured Harry Rempel, in the presence of appellee and McGibbeny. Subsequently, a new policy was issued by Nationwide and sent to Mc-Gibbeny. McGibbeny personally delivered the policy to the Rempels but did not discuss or explain the policy to them. A premium of $16.75 per month was paid until the insured’s death in 1970. At that time, appellee called McGibbeny, who went to her residence and told her she had a “good policy” that would pay her approximately $16,000. Since the outstanding mortgage was $11,100 at the time of Mr. Rempel’s death, the $16,000 figure <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>matched Mrs. Rempel’s expectation of receiving $5,000 in addition to having the mortgage balance paid off. A few days later, however, McGibbeny telephoned appellee and advised her that the policy would pay only a lump sum of $10,430.</p>
    <p id="b535-4" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[191,608,1163,1481]]]'>Appellee filed an action in trespass against McGibbeny and Nationwide to recover the amount of the mortgage $11,100, and an additional $5,000. In the trespass action appellee contended that Nationwide’s agent, McGibbeny, had either negligently or fraudulently misrepresented that the insurance coverage applied for and the policy received would provide for the payment of any outstanding mortgage balance on the Rempel home, if any, at the time of the insured’s death, plus an additional $5,000 of life insurance. The trial court, with the consent of appellants and appellee, directed a verdict in favor of appellee for $10,430, the amount which Nationwide admitted owing, plus interest of 6% per annum. The trial court denied appellants’ motion that the jury be instructed to return a verdict in their favor on the remaining portion of appellee’s claim, but did withdraw the issue of fraudulent misrepresentation from the jury. Only the issue of negligent misrepresentation was submitted for the jury’s consideration. The jury found in favor of appellee in the sum of $5,670 plus 6% interest per annum. Appellants’ motion for judgment not withstanding the verdict was subsequently denied and judgment was entered on the verdict. <em>Rempel v.

    <p id="b536-9" data-blocks='[["BL_536.9",536,[265,1354,1160,911]]]'>Appellants argue that binding instructions in their favor should have been given to the jury because McGibbeny made no misrepresentations to the Rempels, and even if he did, reliance by the Rempels on the misrepresentations was not justified. As to whether Mc-Gibbeny made any misrepresentations, the evidence was conflicting. McGibbeny testified that he did not misrepresent the contents of the application or the policy. Appellee Rempel, however, testified that McGibbeny stated that the coverage provided by the policy would pay off the mortgage balance plus pay an additional $5,000. Because of this conflict, a jury issue was presented. Under these circumstances, binding instructions, based on a claimed lack of evidence of misrepresentation, would have been improper. In a jury trial, the resolution of a factual dispute must be made by the jury — not the trial judge.</p>

There can be no question that the evidence established that for over ten years the Rempels <em>relied </em>on the representations of McGibbeny that the second policy contained the same mortgage protection coverage as the first policy, plus an additional $5,000 of insurance. Appellee Rempel testified that the policy was never read by her or her husband and its terms were not explained by McGibbeny when the policy was delivered. The only issue presented is whether the jury could have properly concluded from the evidence that the reliance by the Rempels was <em>justifiable.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b537-4" data-blocks='[["BL_537.4",537,[196,1027,1152,1078]]]'>The issue of the justification of the Rempels’ reliance cannot be considered in a vacuum. Neither this Court nor a jury can consider the issue without considering the relationship of the parties involved and the nature of the transaction. Consumers, such as the Rempels, view an insurance agent such as McGibbeny, as one possessing expertise in a complicated subject. It is therefore not unreasonable for consumers to rely on the representations of the expert rather than on the contents of the insurance policy itself. Indeed, the procedure established by Nationwide is one which leaves the consumer little choice but to rely on the representations of the expert— the insurance agent. The insurance application signed by the insured states that the application is an offer which must be accepted by the company, yet the application does not contain in detail the exact terms of the offer being made. Rather, a “specialized language” is used which will have no meaning to the consumer except the meaning attributed to the words by the representations of the agent. In this case the offer made said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b537-5" data-blocks='[["BL_537.5",537,[238,2127,1105,254]]]'>“In consideration of reissuing my policy on the whole life plan of insurance for the face amount of $5,000 with the twenty year family income rider, effective April 5, 1961, the following statements are made by me</blockquote>

      <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>No other statements appeared in the offer to explain what was meant by this “specialized language.” The Rempels, of necessity, relied on McGibbeny’s “translation” of the meaning of the offer. This is the only document which the insured was required to sign; the consumer’s signature is not required on the policy. In fact, it is received weeks, or perhaps longer, after the signing of the application. The significant decision by the consumer is not made when the policy is received. The receipt of the policy is the acceptance of the offer previously made. It is at the time that the offer is being made by the consumer — when the application is being signed —that the consumer is making the decision to “buy” or “not to buy” the insurance. By the time the written policy is received, it has lost its importance to the insured.

Rev. 961">83 Harv.L.Rev. 961</a>, 968 (1970). It is not unreasonable, therefore, for a purchaser of insurance to “pass” when the time comes to read the policy,</p>
    <p id="b538-4" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[242,1409,1162,746]]]'>When the Rempels received the policy at issue here, they were not required by Nationwide to sign the policy, and the policy was not explained to them by McGibbeny. Moreover, there is nothing on the face of the policy which would have alerted them that the policy did not contain the coverage expected as a result of the application made with McGibbeny’s explanation of what the offer meant. In fact, nothing in the main portion of the policy in this case indicated that the coverage was anything other than what had been applied for. Only by examining a rider attached to the policy, and making mathematical computations could one ascertain the extent of the coverage provided.</p>

Initially, we do not share the Cynicism of the appellants. Fraudulent claims are possible in many areas of the law, but such a possibility is not reason for denying meritorious claims, particularly when procedures other than those utilized in this case are open to the insurance company. The application form, which is the offer being made by the consumer, could be prepared in large type <em>in terms easily understood by the insured </em>so that reliance on the agent’s representations would not be necessary. The insurance company might adopt a practice whereby an insured is required to sign the policy and acknowledge the receipt of a clear and comprehensible notice of at least the main coverage provided either as contained in the policy document or separately. These examples only serve to illustrate why we are not persuaded that the insurance company is helpless to avoid or severely limit the possibility of fraudulent claims.

The prevailing view, however, permits the action to be maintained, considering that the policy which invalidates the promise is not directed at cases of dishonesty in making it, and that it may still reasonably be relied on even where it cannot be enforced.

    <p id="b543-5" data-blocks='[["BL_543.5",543,[202,1210,1150,1009]]]'>It is clear that, as the result of McGibbeny’s negligent misrepresentations, Rempel mistakenly believed that he had obtained more insurance coverage than was actually provided. In suing for the greater amount, his widow was, in effect, seeking to reform the contract of insurance to coincide with her husband’s reasonable expectations and beliefs. She sought both to reform the contract and to recover as damages the total sum she was entitled to receive once the contract was reformed. The policy as drafted clearly did not coincide with what the Rempels believed it would contain as a result of conversations with the agent. Appellee Rempel did not attempt to introduce evidence to vary, contradict, or alter the integrated writing — she was, instead, attempting to show that the purported integration was not an integration and did not coincide with what it was previously agreed would be received in return for the premium paid. Cor-bin discusses a similar occurrence in his Treatise. He there states:</p>

The court held that the insured could not, in an action for the amount of a loss, prove that the insurer knew the facts of his lumber yard and waived the 100 foot requirement in advance. <em>All that the plaintiff needed, to do, however, was to allege in his complaint that the policy as drafted was mistaken and to ask for its reformation as well as for a judgment for the amount of the loss.
