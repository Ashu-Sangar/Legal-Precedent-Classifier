William H. Crochiere, the individual appellant herein, accepted employment under an oral contract of employment with John G. Bryant Co., and Overhead Lifts Company in March 1963. The oral agreement of employment did not provide for a restrictive covenant not to compete. The two companies involved specialized in the field of selling and servicing of devices used in in<a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>dustrial material lifting. This is a highly technical field requiring specialized skills and methods of doing business. In June 1963 John Bryant, who was in fact the sole proprietor of the two companies, entered into two written employment contracts with Crochiere under which Crochiere was appointed as a sales representative for both companies. Each agreement provided that upon the termination of the employment, Crochiere would not engage in a competitive business within the sales territory of the two companies for a period of three years following the termination of employment. The sales territory was specifically defined and essentially included Eastern Pennsylvania, South Jersey and the State of Delaware. Thereafter, the Bryant Company and Overhead Materials Company, incorporated under the respective names of John G. Bryant Company, Inc., and Overhead Materials Handling, Inc., these corporations being the instant appellees. Following the incorporation in August of 1968, new agreements were entered into between the newly formed corporations and Crochiere essentially incorporating the terms of the 1963 agreements of employment.</p>
    <p id="b133-4" data-blocks='[["BL_133.4",133,[201,1527,1157,817]],["BL_134.1",134,[242,289,1156,695]]]'>On January 1, 1973, a third written agreement was entered into between the parties as a result of Crochiere’s expressed desire to go into business on his own. The 1973 agreement provided that Crochiere would be permitted to form a company (to be designated Sling Testing and Repair, Inc.) and to solicit new business within the defined sales territory. However, Sling Testing and Repair, Inc. was prohibited from selling directly to established accounts of Bryant and Overhead Materials. The agreement specifically set forth the prohibited accounts which were customers of Bryant’s and Overhead Materials’ as of March 1, 1973. The agreement further provided that Crochiere would remain in the appellees’ employ until February 28, 1973, at which time Bryant Company was to become the manufacturer’s agent for <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>Crochiere’s newly formed company and that Crochiere’s company was to become sales agent for Overhead Materials. The term of this agreement was for a period of three years and was expressly binding on successors and assigns. Crochiere formed and incorporated a business under the name of Sling Testing and Repair, Inc. and had begun to engage in business. It is admitted on this record that Sling Testing made direct sales to accounts of appellees in violation of the 1973 agreement. Sling Testing is now defunct. However, Crochiere has undertaken a new corporate venture under the name of Sling Manufacturing, Inc., which engages in the same business as Sling Testing and Repair, Inc.</p>

After hearing, a Decree granting the preliminary injunction was entered on January 15, 1975, and an appeal to this Court followed.</p>

They note that appellees were only able to demonstrate actual damages in the amount of $427.00 in loss of commission and argue that this meager amount cannot possibly constitute irreparable harm. This reasoning however, ignores the nature of the violation herein involved. It is not the initial breach of a covenant which necessarily establishes the existence of irreparable harm but rather the threat of the unbridled continuation of the violation and the resultant incalculable damage to the former employer’s business that constitutes the justification for equitable intervention.</p>

Similarly, under traditional agency concepts, any new business or improvement in customer relations attributable to him during his employment is for the sole benefit of the principal. This is what he is being paid to do. When he leaves the company he should no more be permitted to try to divert to his own benefit the product of his employment than to abscond with the company’s cash-box.” Blake, Employee Agreements Not to Compete, <a href="/citations/?q=73%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%20625" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="73 Harv.

While recognizing the problem that would be presented if we were called upon to consider the propriety of injunctive relief based upon the 1963 agreement, we need not reach this question since it is clear that there is adequate support for the enforcement of the covenant set forth in the 1973 agreement.</p>

The contract contained a list of approximately 560 established customer accounts as existed on March 1, 1973, to which Sling Testing could not directly sell. Crochiere insists that some of the corporate customers are so large that the effective area of restriction “span[s] the entire nation.” The Chancellor correctly decided that the geographic extent of the agreement was necessarily limited by the two prior written contracts which were incorporated into the 1973 agreement. <em>Plunkett Chemical Company v.

The scope of the covenant therefore was not enlarged, but was in fact reduced. <em>Cf. Capitol Bakers, Inc. v.
