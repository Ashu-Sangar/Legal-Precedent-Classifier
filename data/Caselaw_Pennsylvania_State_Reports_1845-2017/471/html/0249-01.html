Decedent, Arthur Hahn, died on June 18, 1973, survived by his widow and by his son, Earle Hahn. Decedent’s will and a codicil thereto, both dated April 27, 1973, were probated and letters testamentary were issued to Earle Hahn as the executor named therein. On July 6, 1973, decedent’s widow filed her election against the will and any and all lifetime conveyances made by decedent. The executor filed an answer thereto urging dis<a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>missal of the widow’s election as barred by a postnuptial agreement.</p>
    <p id="b379-4" data-blocks='[["BL_379.4",379,[174,422,1150,848]]]'>Hearings to determine these matters commenced on January 8, 1975. On the third day of hearings, counsel for the executor-appellant asked the court below to strike testimony presented at the previous hearing concerning the valuation of assets. This issue was resolved when counsel for both sides agreed that evidence of valuation would be deferred until the end of the hearings. Thereafter, the electing widow sought permission to have the underlying assets of decedent’s closely held family corporations valued, to which the appellant objected. At the request of counsel argument was held and briefs filed, leading to an interlocutory order of the lower court directing the executor to permit the widow’s appraisers to gain access to the real estate and further directing him to make certain designated records available to the widow.</p>
    <p id="b379-5" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[173,1309,1151,422]]]'> The executor responded by filing a motion to dismiss, for lack of jurisdiction, certain issues relating to the inter vivos conveyances and requests for valuation evidence. By decree dated December 18, 1975, the court below refused the motion and this appeal followed.

Like other pre-1968 courts, the orphans’ court is now part of the newly constituted court of common pleas, a court in which is vested “unlimited original jurisdiction in all cases except as may otherwise be provided by law”. Constitution of Pennsylvania, Art. V, Sec. 5.</p>

Those questions have to do with the valuation of assets of closely held family corporations created by decedent, <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>and with the validity of the transfers during decedent’s lifetime of certain assets by those corporations.</p>
    <p id="b382-4" data-blocks='[["BL_382.4",382,[279,438,1155,1119]]]'>It is true, as the Court points out, that proceedings in the old orphans’ court were not considered to be either “at law or in equity” for purposes of the Act of 1925,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> permitting appeals from interlocutory orders pertaining to <em>jurisdiction; </em>hence appeals from interlocutory decrees of the orphans’ court were not allowed. But those cases are now of historical interest only. The court of common pleas has admitted jurisdiction of the subject matter of the instant disputes. The Act of 1925 should not be applied to allow appeals concerning the presence or absence of subject-matter jurisdiction as between <em>divisions </em>of the court of common pleas. If the jurisdiction over the cause of action is being exercised through the wrong division, the remedy, if a remedy is needed, will be a transfer to the correct division. See <em>Kohl v. Lentz, </em><a href="/pa/454/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="454 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="579869" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0105-01">454 Pa. 105</a>, 110, <a href="/citations/?q=311%20A.2d%20136" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="311 A.2d 136">311 A.2d 136</a>, 137 (1973) (concurring opinion of Pomeroy, J.). Also, as the Court’s opinion indicates, an appellant may seek interlocutory review under our appellate rules, See Pa.R.A.P. 312, 1311.

    <p id="b382-5" data-blocks='[["BL_382.5",382,[273,1590,1155,666]]]'>The fallacy of the Court’s analysis is made clearer if it be assumed that the dispute between the decedent’s widow and son had originated in a suit in equity brought in the civil (or trial) division of the court of common pleas. Had a jurisdictional challenge then been raised on the ground that the controversy was justiciable only through the orphans’ court division,, presumably, under the majority’s rationale an appeal would lie under the Act of 1925, since the civil division would have been sitting in equity. Surely, in a unified judicial system, the availability of an appeal right should not depend on which branch of the trial court is first seized of the case.</p>

I cannot subscribe to the notion of the majority opinion that there is a third category of litigation known as “orphans’ court” which is not encompassed by the language of “law and equity.” This appeal should not be quashed because appellant had a right to an interlocutory appeal since he is contesting subject matter jurisdiction. Act of March 5, 1925, P.L. 28, § 1, 12 P.S. § 672. On the merits of the appeal, I would affirm. There is no such thing today as “orphans’ court subject matter jurisdiction.” The constitutional reforms of 1969 were designed to make clear that there is only one court of common pleas for subject matter jurisdiction purposes. Divisions of the court of common pleas may be convenient for administrative purposes. These divisions, however, are irrelevant to the question of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>
