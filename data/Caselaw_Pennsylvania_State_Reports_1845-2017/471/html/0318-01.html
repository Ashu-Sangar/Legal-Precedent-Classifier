One of the men was masked and armed with a shotgun. The other man, who was not masked and who was later identified by three eyewitnesses as Hilliard, drew a revolver, jumped behind the bar and at gunpoint ordered the bartender, John Cassidy, to open the cash register and to get a bag. As Cassidy secured a bag, Hilliard picked up a pistol which Cassidy kept behind the bar and then directed Cassidy to put the money from the cash register into the bag. At the same time the man with the shotgun attempted to take money out of the trouser pocket of one Lee Hicks, a patron of the bar, after having already taken Hicks’ wallet. Hicks, however, resisted violently. He grabbed the shotgun and a struggle ensued between Hicks and the masked gunman. As these two fought, another patron, William Coates, began throwing bar stools at Hilliard behind the bar. After Coates had thrown three or four stools, Hilliard fired two shots at him and moved from behind the bar in his direction. Coates and Hilliard began grappling and at one point during their combat they were facing each other with Coates attempting to subdue his opponent by squeezing him in bearhug fashion. Hilliard, however, had his arms free and he placed his revolver at Coates’ back and pulled the trigger. Coates died from the resultant gunshot wound. Hilliard then stepped away from the fallen Coates and almost immediately was confronted by the cook at Cassidy’s Bar, Richard Ray. When Hilliard ordered him to get out of the way, Ray grabbed at Hilliard’s weapon and Hilliard shot <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>him in the stomach. While Hilliard and Coates struggled, Hicks, with the aid of several other patrons, wrested the shotgun away from the masked man and began beating him with it. At this point in the fracas, a third gunman, who apparently had been stationed at the door, stepped into the bar and fired a number of shots at the group beating the masked man. The three gunmen then ran out of the bar. Cassidy took a rifle from under the bar and fired two shots* at Hilliard before the rifle jammed. After the fleeing gunmen were out of the bar Cassidy ran to a side door and fired at least three more shots in the direction of their flight. The three gunmen escaped in a white Pontiac driven by a fourth man. The entire incident lasted about five minutes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">2A</a>

Upon entering the saloon Hilliard approached the bar and ordered a glass of beer. Sonny entered the bar behind Hilliard with a shotgun and announced the holdup. Although taken by surprise, Hilliard noticed Cassidy moving for a gun behind the bar. Hilliard reached over the bar, seized Cassidy’s pistol, put it in his pocket, and ran for the door. While fleeing Hilliard was shot. Although Hilliard had his own revolver in his pocket when he entered Cassidy’s he maintained that he did not withdraw this weapon from his pocket and did not at any time fire either his own or Cassidy’s pistol.</p>

He arrived at about 1:50 a. m. and began interviewing witnesses. He learned that at least three men were involved in the crime and that they used a 1963 or 1964 white Pontiac to aid their escape. The man who shot Coates was described as “being possibly 30, big shoulders, broad shouldered, with a mustache, wearing a brown corduroy coat and a hat.” The second man was described as “around 25 to 30, thin build, around five foot eight, wearing a long black leather coat, and he has a ski mask pulled over his face.” Both men were black. McGurk also learned that the bartender shot at the robbers as they fled, specifically at the man who shot Coates and Ray, and that some of the patrons had taken a shotgun away from the man wearing the ski mask and had beaten him with it. McGurk had this information broadcast over the police radio and also relayed back to police headquarters. Detective McGurk also learned that the man <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>wearing the brown corduroy coat had taken a .25 caliber pistol with a specific serial number from the bartender.</p>

Officer Robert Morton was at Frankford Hospital in Philadelphia on police business unrelated to the instant case. He observed a wounded man (whom he identified at the suppression hearing as Hilliard) arrive at the hospital in a 1964 white Pontiac with one other black male and two females. Hilliard approached Morton and related that he had been accidentally shot, but did not want to prosecute the person who shot him. Morton informed him that all gunshot wounds had to be reported to the police and then instructed one of the hospital employees to request the police to send someone to make a report on Hilliard’s gunshot wound. Morton left Frankford Hospital at approximately 2:10 a. m. and after leaving, Morton and his partner heard the radio message reporting the incident at Cassidy’s Bar. Realizing that the description of the suspects and the getaway car matched those he observed at the hospital, Morton called in his observations and then returned to the hospital. Hilliard could not, however, be found.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">3</a> Morton obtained the admission slip which had been filled out for Hilliard and which identified him as John Williams of 4524 North Bouvier Street. The slip was signed by a woman who gave her name as Doris Williams of the same address. This information was relayed to Detective D’Alverez Bethel at headquarters who had the Bouvier Street address checked out. A man was picked up at that address and this man informed the police that a Doris Williams lived at that address, but that she had gone out shortly before midnight in a light-colored car with three black men and that she had mentioned .going to 1402 West Erie Avenue. Detective Bethel contacted Detective McGurk at approximately 5 a. m. with this information.</p>

The address was that of an apartment building with a first floor entrance leading into a vestibule. McGurk entered the vestibule and encountered a second door with a large window leading into the building proper. McGurk observed through this window a brown corduroy coat lying on the floor beside the doorway of the first floor apartment. Lights were on in the vestibule, the first floor hallway, and the apartment itself, and the apartment door was wide open. McGurk opened the vestibule door and entered the hallway. He knocked on the door and announced the presence of police, but received no response. McGurk then entered the apartment, stopping to examine the brown corduroy coat which was lying on the floor. Examination of the coat revealed a hole with a reddish stain in the left armpit area. McGurk proceeded into the apartment in search of the suspects. In the bedroom McGurk observed a chest of drawers with the top drawer open about three inches through which the butt of a revolver was visible. McGurk opened the drawer completely and found not only the revolver he first observed but also a .25 caliber pistol, the serial number of which matched the number of the weapon taken from Cassidy’s Bar. In the living room McGurk found a long-sleeved black turtleneck sweater and a T-shirt lying on a table. Each of these garments had a hole in the left armpit area.</p>
