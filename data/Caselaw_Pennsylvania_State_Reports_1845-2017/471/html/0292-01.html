    <p id="b422-5" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[237,415,1156,1339]]]'>On March 5, 1976, Yul Brynner Hayward, who was then fifteen and a half years old, was arrested and charged with murder, robbery, and related weapons offenses arising out of an incident on February 24, 1976. Subsequently, informations were filed against Hayward, pretrial motions were disposed of, and the case was assigned to Judge Bullock for trial. On August 11, 1976, at a conference with counsel prior to jury selection, Judge Bullock asked the prosecuting attorney whether the Commonwealth was seeking the death penalty, and the latter replied: “I cannot in all candor say because I think it is a jury question.” The judge then stated that, as he had indicated previously in a letter to the district attorney’s office, it was his intention in such a case to make “a preliminary determination whether or not I consider a reasonable jury could find the death penalty if the death penalty is still in the case.” He thus scheduled a hearing “at which time I will expect the Commonwealth to make any offer of proof as to the facts and basis of which it believes the jury could reasonably find the death penalty.” Further, he <em>sua sponte </em>ordered that Hayward be given a psychiatric examination and that the psychiatrist testify at the hearing as to Hayward’s “maturity or lack thereof.” The judge also subpoenaed Hayward’s school records.</p>

The judge then called a psychiatrist and a psychologist, both of whom had official positions as consultants to the court and both <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>of whom had examined Hayward at the court’s request. The judge took the lead in questioning both witnesses. The psychiatrist testified that he had examined Hayward for about forty minutes and concluded that, although he found no “thinking disorder” in the defendant, the latter was a “schizoid personality” who under stress “could compensate into a real psychotic state which I did not see during the interview.” The psychologist testified that he had examined Hayward for about an hour, that his tests indicated a “dull-normal” I.Q. of 84 but that he had a potential I.Q. of 105; the psychologist concluded that Hayward was “functioning well below his potential . because of emotional problems” and that intellectually he was functioning at the level of a twelve-and-a-half-year old and emotionally at the level of a nine-year old. The supervisor of pupil personnel and counselling at Hayward’s school was also called as the custodian of the defendant’s school records, and these records were admitted into evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Although defense counsel had originally indicated that he intended to call both the defendant and his father for the limited purpose of determining whether the jury might reasonably impose the death penalty, the defense ultimately decided to present no evidence of its own. At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Bullock requested briefs and indicated he would schedule an oral argument, but he also stated: <em>“I have already ruled </em>that the death penalty is not in this case and I will certify the issue for appeal.” [Emphasis added.] After an oral argument on August 31, 1976, the judge, in an opinion and order of September 2, held that the case was non-capital because of the youth and lack of maturity of the defendant at the time of the crime; he certified the issue for immediate appeal. The Commonwealth, however, petitioned instead for a writ of prohibi<a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>tion both vacating the instant order and prohibiting such pretrial determinations in the future.</p>

The Commonwealth, on the other hand, argues that in a jury trial for murder the Sentencing Code requires that the question of whether the death penalty shall be imposed be determined only after the defendant has been found guilty of murder of the first degree, and that such determination shall, at least initially, be made by the jury that found him guilty. Hence, in the Commonwealth’s view, the court must regard all murder cases as capital cases for the purpose of conducting the voir dire.</p>

A jury which found a defendant guilty of murder of the first degree had absolute and unfettered discretion whether to punish by death or life imprisonment. It could thus disregard the recommendations of both the district attorney and the trial court, and its discretion in this regard was not even subject to appellate review.

    <p id="b426-4" data-blocks='[["BL_426.4",426,[271,410,1158,1276]]]'>After that statute had been ruled unconstitutional, however, we were presented with the question of whether a person charged with murder rising to the level of murder of the first degree was charged with a capital offense so that he could be denied bail, even though the death penalty could not have been imposed because the statute in force at the time of the crime had been invalidated. In <em>Commonwealth v. Truesdale, </em>supra, 449 Pa. at 331, 333, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20829" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="296 A.2d 829">296 A.2d at 832</a>, we held that “the constitutional phrase ‘capital offense’ is a definition of a penalty, i. e., the death penalty, rather than a definition of the crime of murder in the first degree” and that “murder in the first degree is not a capital offense when it cannot be punished by death.” Subsequently, the legislature in 1974 enacted the present death-penalty statute as part of the new Sentencing Code. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1311 (Supp. 1976-77). Rather than giving the jury unlimited discretion whether to punish a person convicted of murder of the first degree by death or life imprisonment, the present statute attempts to provide precise legal standards to govern the jury’s determination. The statute thus sets forth nine “aggravating circumstances” and three “mitigating circumstances.” Section 1311(d) provides that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b426-5" data-blocks='[["BL_426.5",426,[314,1725,1107,472]]]'>“If a murder of the first degree is accompanied by at least one of the following aggravating circumstances and none of the following mitigating circumstances, the person convicted shall be sentenced to death.

The question now before us, therefore, is whether the present statute, with its more precise legal standards for determining the appropriate punishment for first-degree murder, confers any greater authority than did the previous one to enable a trial court to make a pretrial determination that a charge rising to the level of murder of the first degree cannot be punished by death as a matter of law, thus precluding the jury, which may subsequently find the defendant guilty of murder of the first degree, from considering the penalty.

In his opinion Judge Bullock sets forth three reasons why he believes a pretrial determination should be made: (1) Because jury selection is more extensive and time-consuming in a capital case, judicial economy requires the court to determine whether the case is actually non-capital. (2) There is a strong possibility that a jury willing to impose the death penalty will be more likely to be prejudiced in favor of conviction. (3) It is inhumane to hold the death penalty over a defendant’s head when the case is not really a capital one.</p>
      <p id="b430-6" data-blocks='[["BL_430.6",430,[289,1400,1114,371]]]'>It seems to us, however, that a pretrial evidentiary hearing on the question might take as much, or more, time as the more extensive voir dire in a capital case. Furthermore, if after such a hearing the court were to determine that the death penalty might still be applicable, the more extensive voir dire would be required anyway. Finally, if the jury then convicted the defendant of murder of the first degree, the evidentiary hearing might have to be repeated for the jury. Thus, conducting such a pretrial hearing does not seem to us to serve the purposes of judicial economy.</p>
