At trial Ostroff positively identified Meadows and Wilson as being two of the robbers. He detailed the actions of the three robbers during the incident and specifically with, respect to Meadows, he testified that Meadows entered the store behind the two gunmen and while those two took money from Ostroff and cigarettes from behind the counter, Meadows knocked Mrs. Ostroff into a chair and took money from her pocket. Ostroff described one of the guns as black with a white handle and also described the robbers as wearing T-shirts. The entire incident lasted approximately five to eight minutes.</p>

Sergeant Alfred Margerum of the Philadelphia Police Department testified that he found a dollar bill and approximately five dollars in change in the yard at 1711 Ringgold Street and a coca-cola carton, later identified by Ostroff, and several cartons of cigarettes next to the fence in the adjoining yard at 1713 Ringgold Street. Margerum further testified that Meadows and Wilson were taken from 1711 Ringgold Street to the Ostroff store at 1706 Point Breeze Avenue, a distance of three or four blocks, where he observed Meadows and Wilson being identified by Ostroff. Margerum also had a vague recollection that Meadows was wearing a T-shirt at the time.</p>

We are not persuaded Ostroff’s confusion rendered the evidence so weak and inconclusive as to warrant an arrest of judgment and discharge. Furthermore, an examination of the trial court’s opinion in support of granting the motion in arrest of judgment reveals that the trial court, in passing on that motion, engaged in a weighing of the evidence, rather than determining the absence or presence of that quantum of evidence necessary to establish some proof of the elements of the crimes. For example, the trial court’s opinion referred to the introduction by the defense of a mug shot of Meadows, taken the day of his arrest, showing him dressed in a regular shirt rather than a T-shirt. The trial court’s opinion also referred to Ostroff’s poor eyesight and hearing problems, in addition to his inconsistent recollection of the pretrial identification. In view of the fact that the initial verdict was guilty, it is apparent that the trial court re-evaluated Ostroff’s credibility and the weight to be assigned thereto. As such, the trial qourt did not follow the standard articulated above for considering a motion in arrest of judgment, but rather weighed the evidence. <em>Commonwealth v.

How is the issue to be reviewed on appeal? If the <em>weight </em>of the evidence is not sufficient, it simply means that the Commonwealth’s evidence was not sufficient to prove guilt <em>beyond a reasonable doubt. </em>In these circumstances a defendant cannot be tried a second time. If the <em>weight </em>of the prosecution’s evidence is insufficient, it is not entitled to a second crack in order to provide <em>more weight </em>and establish its case <em>beyond a reasonable doubt. </em>In a first trial, either the prosecution’s evidence is sufficient <em>beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>or it is not. In the former <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>case, the conviction is proper. In the latter case, a discharge is necessary in view of double jeopardy protections.</p>
    <p id="b338-4" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[249,471,1147,419]]]'>In the appeal before us, the evidence was, in my opinion, sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court’s order arresting judgment should therefore be vacated and the matter remanded for consideration of whether any trial errors occurred which would warrant the grant of a new trial. It would not be trial error, however, if the only objection to the trial concerns weight of the evidence.</p>
