She reached neither her station nor the school. Later that day, in a wooded area north of Lebanon, fire fighters engaged in extinguishing a brush fire discovered her body, partially covered with debris, lying on a small trash dump. Death was caused by multiple stab wounds to the neck, and inhalation of fumes from the fire.</p>

The witnesses moved closer, ascertained that the adult was “short and stocky,” and recorded the license number of the automobile, OC3181.</p>

He was found next door at a neighbor’s house, and was escorted back to his own home. The neighbor and close friend, who was also a guard at the Lebanon County Prison, accompanied appellant and the police to appellant’s home. Appellant’s <em>Miranda </em>rights were read to him by the police, he indicated understanding, and asked his friend what to do. The friend told appellant to tell the truth. Appellant initially denied any part in the homicide. When another policeman entered the room where appellant was seated, carrying pants apparently stained with blood however, appellant made certain incriminating statements. Immediately thereafter, at 11:40 p. m., appellant was taken to the district attorney’s office and, again, <em>Miranda </em>warnings were read to him. At this point appellant requested an attorney, and all further questioning ceased.</p>

We agree with appellant’s contention that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant appellant’s request for a change of venue.

From the moment the news of the homicide became public, the community was emotionally stirred. The story aroused the interests of virtually all citizens of the community. The victim’s body was discovered on Friday, November 9, 1973. That discovery was reported by the local newspapers in their headlines the following day. On Monday, November 12, 1973, the Lebanon Daily News, in bold, red print headlines measuring over one-half inch in height, and extending the entire width of the first page, announced : “Arrest Suspect In Murder Of Girl.” Immediately beneath these headlines, in three-eighths inch high type, two columns wide, the subheadline stated: “Jail Former Penitentiary Prisoner, 26.” Accompanying these headlines was a large photograph of appellant. <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>The companion story related that appellant had previously been tried and convicted on a morals charge and had spent two and one-half years at Rockview State Penitentiary from which he had been released just two months prior to the homicide. In addition, the report indicated that appellant had spent approximately eighteen months at another state institution. The article also stated that a member of appellant’s own family described him as “mentally ill.”</p>

The other three were dismissed for cause on grounds that they were acquainted with one or more of the attorneys or prosecuting officers involved in the case. The <em>voir dire </em>interview examination occurred less than four months after the homicide. Of the thirty-two who were asked about their recollections, twenty-eight stated that they recalled hearing or reading of the murder. Of the fourteen jurors who were eventually seated (twelve jurors plus two alternates) eleven recalled having heard or read of the murder, two had no recollection, and only one stat<a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>ed that he had not read of the incident at issue. The defendant was granted eleven challenges for cause, the majority of these challenges being granted because the prospective juror involved stated that he or she had either formed a fixed opinion of appellant’s guilt based on recollection of the newspaper articles — an opinion which could not be put aside — or because the prospective juror stated that he or she <em>specifically </em>recalled having read newspaper articles of appellant’s prior criminal record. Five of appellant’s challenges for cause (based on a juror’s statement that he or she had formed an opinion as to defendant’s guilt as a result of recollection of the newspaper articles) were refused by the trial court, and appellant was required to use peremptory challenges to keep those prospective jurors from being seated. Examination of the <em>voir dire </em>interviews thus clearly indicates that the news coverage which occurred at the time of and shortly after the homicide was still in the minds of the prospective jurors at the time of trial. The potential of prejudice resulting from the close proximity of such news articles publicizing appellant’s prior criminal record, and his admissions of guilt, was therefore extremely great. This potential for prejudice exists despite the statements by the prospective jurors that they could put aside any opinion as to appellant’s guilt which they had formed after reading the newspaper articles. <em>Commonwealth v.

      <em>Pierce </em>and <em>Kichline </em>illustrate the proper examination to be made by the trial court faced with a request for a change of venue charging that pretrial publicity will deny the accused’s right to be tried by an impartial jury, is to first look at the <em>nature of the content </em>of the publicity. Does it contain references to the accused’s prior record of criminal convictions, if any? Does it expose potential jurors to any confessions or admissions of guilt allegedly made by the accused? Does it point to the ac<a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>cused’s guilt in terms that go beyond objective news reporting and enter the realm of the emotional and of the inflammatory? If the court answers any of these questions in the affirmative, its analysis must proceed to a determination of the likelihood that a significant number of the prospective jurors in the county were, in fact, exposed to such publicity. If the trial court answers “yes” to any of the above three questions concerning the content of the pretrial publicity, and if the record shows that there is a likelihood that a significant portion of the population was exposed to publicity of that nature, refusal to grant a change of venue would be an abuse of discretion unless the record also indicates that a sufficiently long period of time has passed between the time of the publicity and the time of the application for a change of venue for the court to conclude that any prejudice which may have been initially created by the publicity has been dissipated.</p>

In fact, the record shows that a high proportion of the prospective jurors interviewed during the <em>voir dire </em>remembered reading such articles.

The constitutional standard remains whether the defendant was tried by a panel of impartial, indifferent jurors. In the instant case the jurors testified as to their ability to put aside any opinion as to appellant’s guilt, which may have been formed as a result of the pretrial exposure and render a verdict based solely on the evidence. There is nothing in the entire voir dire transcript that would reasonably cause one to question their sincerity or their capacity to decide the cause impartially. Hence, there is no foundation to support a claim for a violation of due process under the Federal Constitution.</p>

In <em>Pierce </em>the Court was concerned not only with the presence of inherently prejudicial publicity but more importantly the source of that publicity. A close analysis of <em>Pierce </em>reveals that the determinative factor in the decision was the participation of the police and prosecutor in the dissemination of the inflammatory and prejudicial publicity. In the instant case the police and the prosecutor in no way contributed to the information appearing in the pre-trial articles. The record conclusively establishes that the contents of the articles were based on the independent research of representatives of the news media, press coverage of the preliminary hearing, and information supplied by members of appellant’s family.</p>

Typical of the suggestive nature of the reporting in <em>Pierce </em>was an article entitled, “Two Youths Re-enact Media Street Attack,” which included a large photograph of the defendant at the scene of the crime, in the custody of police, “pointing” to where the victims’ bodies fell. In contrast, the nature of the publicity in the instant case is not so emotional or suggestive as to be comparable to that in <em>Pierce, </em>and it thus falls far short of being “inherently prejudicial.” It clearly defies reason to “presume”, on the basis of the record before us, that the jury was biased.</p>
