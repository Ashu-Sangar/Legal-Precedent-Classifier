Appellant was arrested at approximately 1:50 a. m. on April 3, 1973, several blocks from the premises by police officers who noticed that he was wearing his jacket inside out and that it was bloodstained. Appellant was immediately taken to the hospital where Kennedy was being treated. Kennedy, who died ten days later, could not identify appellant with certainty. Appellant was taken to the Central Detective Division headquarters at 2:15 a. m. and was placed in a detention room. At 3:08 a. m. he was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and asked to participate in a line-up. He executed a written waiver of his right to counsel at the <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>line-up.

Appellant denied any involvement in the killing. At 9:20 a. m. there was a break in the interrogation while appellant’s clothing was taken for laboratory testing pursuant to a search warrant. After receiving assurances that the victim was still alive, appellant made his first admission of guilt at 9:55 a. m., eight hours after arrest. A written statement was taken at 11:30 a. m., and a formal typewritten statement was later taken, which appellant signed at 2:40 p. m. The last entry on the police department records is 2:50 p. m., when appellant was slated. At the suppression hearing, defense counsel tried to ascertain the time of arraignment, but the police did not know when he was arraigned. Appellant’s uncontradicted testimony was that he was not arraigned until 9:30 p. m., 19V2 hours after his arrest.</p>

The Commonwealth argues that the claim was not raised in appellant’s pre-trial suppression motion or at trial. After review of the record, we conclude that appellant has preserved his claim. It appears from the record that the <em>Futch </em>claim was argued at the suppression hearing: the issue was presented at another suppression hearing held to determine the admissibility of the line-up identification. At trial, appellant’s counsel objected to the introduction of appellant’s statement, stating that he wanted to “renew” his objection made at the suppression hearing to the confession obtained “in violation of the rules of <em>Tingle, Dutton, Futch.”</em>
