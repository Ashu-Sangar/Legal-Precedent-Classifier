On May 1, 1974, the landlord sent the tenant a registered letter, reciting the opinion of one Robert Rosen, an engineer, that the store could not be repaired within 120 days, and announcing the election of the landlord to terminate the lease pursuant to the terms of Section 15 thereof.

This proof, coupled with evidence of Rosen’s past business relations with the landlord, caused the chancellor to conclude his opinion below as follows:</p>

The principle that the opinion of a person who is not party to a contract as to the adequacy of a performance, which opinion is by the terms of the contract determinative of some rights of the parties, must be an objective opinion made in good faith, seems self-evident and is well established in contract law.

It was there held that a party could not reject a performance as unsatisfactory where his dissatisfaction is capricious or in bad faith. Where, as in the instant case, it is the function of a third person to give an expert objective opinion as to a technical problem, adherence to the good faith standard is equally necessary and perhaps more readily susceptible to judicial decision than where the only standard for the inadequacy of a performance is the satisfaction of a party.</p>
    <p id="b245-4" data-blocks='[["BL_245.4",245,[202,909,1154,585]]]'>Nor does Section 15 by its terms require that the period of time during which the landlord is performing his duty to repair a fire-damaged structure should be excluded from the computation of the stated term of the lease. Rather, it merely allows the rent to be abated until the restoration is completed. The chancellor’s order, which extended the term of the lease by a period approximately equal to the period during which the landlord had failed to perform his duty to repair, was a reasonable application of Section 15 in the circumstances and will not be disturbed by this Court.</p>

While the chancellor’s decree granting relief was proper and sound as far as it went, it did not afford the plaintiff redress for any injury which resulted from the landlord’s failure to repair the leased premises within the period of one hundred and twenty days allowed him by the lease agreement.</p>
