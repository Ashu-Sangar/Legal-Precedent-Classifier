California, </em><a href="/us/386/0738-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="386 U.S. 738" data-case-ids="6182629" data-case-paths="/us/386/0738-01">386 U.S. 738</a>, <a href="/us/386/0738-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="386 U.S. 738" data-case-ids="6182629" data-case-paths="/us/386/0738-01">87 S.Ct. 1396</a>, <a href="/us/386/0738-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="386 U.S. 738" data-case-ids="6182629" data-case-paths="/us/386/0738-01">18 L.Ed.2d 493</a> (1967) and <em>Commonwealth v.

Counsel filed a new brief which was substantially the same as the first brief, and thus does not meet <em>Anders </em>standards. Instead of requiring counsel to meet the instructions of this Court, however, the majority affirms the denial of post-conviction relief. I dissent.</p>

    <p id="b221-6" data-blocks='[["BL_221.6",221,[209,764,1151,637]]]'>After this Court directed counsel to file a new brief comporting with <em>Anders, </em>counsel filed a five and one-half page typewritten brief. The first four and one-half pages of the new brief are a verbatim copy of the history of the case and argument from the previous brief. On the final page of the new brief, counsel reviews some general principles of law applicable to appellant’s case, and states that there is one argument for granting appellate relief. Instead of providing any reasoning in support of that argument, however, counsel “asserts that he is unable to present any other argument for granting appellate relief.”</p>
    <p id="b221-7" data-blocks='[["BL_221.7",221,[206,1427,1151,745]]]'>Counsel has not complied with our instruction to file a new brief which comports with <em>Anders. </em>Indeed, he has filed essentially the same brief which we previously found to be inadequate. The brief is still sketchy, conclusory, and briefed against his client. Whether counsel’s action stems from incompetence, intransigence, or simple laziness, it should not be rewarded. Yet the majority, instead of requiring counsel to meet the standards set by this Court, affirms the denial of post-conviction relief. In so doing, the majority ill serves the purpose of ensuring that lawyers before this Court maintain professional standards, and that indigent defendants are afforded due process and equal protective rights to effective counsel on appeal.</p>
