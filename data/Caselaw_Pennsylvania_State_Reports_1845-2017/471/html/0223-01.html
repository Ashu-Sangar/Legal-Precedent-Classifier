This call was taped by the Scranton police. Roger Ferretti was located and denied making the phone call. After appellant’s arrest, the Commonwealth petitioned the lower court to require the appellant to make a recording via the telephone wherein he would repeat some of the same words as in the October 22 call to the police. The purpose of this request was to enable the Commonwealth to submit both tapes to a voiceprint expert in order to determine whether the appellant was the original caller.</p>

He was selected in 1966 to be trained as an analyzer of spectrograms because of his background in electronics and his training in fingerprint analysis. He studied spectrography in 1967 under Mr. Lawrence Kersta, the acknowledged innovator in the field, and since the fall of 1968, has studied audiology and speech sciences at Michigan State University. His academic ad-visor and teacher there has been Dr. Oscar Tosi who has conducted extensive experiments with the sound spectrograph and testified as an expert on voiceprint analysis in many cases. At the time of the trial, Lieutenant Nash had been analyzing spectrograms for upwards of six years, had examined more than three thousand voices and had analyzed in excess of 180,000 voiceprints.</p>

The five arguments are: (1) that the trial court erred by allowing a recording of a telephone call made to the Scranton police and recorded without the caller’s knowledge or consent to be introduced into evidence at appellant’s trial; (2) that the trial court erred by requiring appellant to make a second recording for the purpose of comparing his voice with the voice of the person who called the Scranton police; (3) that the trial court erred by allowing expert testimony based upon voice print comparison tests; <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>(4) that the trial court improperly limited cross-examination of a Commonwealth witness concerning a recording of appellant’s voice made without his knowledge or consent while he was being interrogated by state police; and (5) that the trial court erred by denying appellant’s motion for a mistrial when it appeared that the Commonwealth had twice deceived both the trial court and defense counsel concerning the existence of the interrogation recording.</p>

However, the factual allegation that the Commonwealth deceived both the defense and the trial court is verified by the trial court’s opinion dismissing on the merits, post-trial motions which raised all of the issues concerning the recordings urged here. Appellant argues that he was prejudiced by the Commonwealth’s refusal, despite the trial court’s mandate, either to reveal the existence of the interrogation tape or to turn over to it the first, inconclusive voiceprint comparison test. This claim has substantial appeal, for the interrogation recording which was withheld by the Commonwealth might have made a powerful exhibit for the cross-examination of the voiceprint expert. We need not reach this issue, however, for the reason stated above.</p>
