The testimony developed a clear question of fact as to defendant\u2019s negligence which was submitted to the jury in a charge which we find to be free from reversible error. A careful examination of the record discloses no ground for disturbing the verdict.\nThe judgment and order of the court below, refusing plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, is affirmed.",
