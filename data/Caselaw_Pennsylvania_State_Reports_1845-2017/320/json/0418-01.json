        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Kephart,\nWhere a trust is created in which the settlor reserves a life interest in the income, such interest is subject to the tax imposed by the Act of June 20, 1919, P. L. 521: Dean\u2019s Est., 279 Pa. 582; Leffman\u2019s Est., 312 Pa. 236. Appellant, trustee, claimed decedent\u2019s interest as a gift through a release of the income from the settlor. She had therefore the burden of proof: Smith\u2019s Est., 237 Pa. 115; Sullivan v. Hess, 241 Pa. 407.\nIn 1924 Harriet Cooper sold a property and took a purchase-money mortgage for $45,000. She assigned this mortgage to Grace Corliss, under an agreement wherein Grace Corliss was to pay the income on this mortgage to Harriet Cooper for life. In 1931 Harriet Cooper died and the value of this mortgage was appraised as part of her estate so as to subject it to the tax above mentioned. Grace Corliss resisted the assessment and appealed from the appraisement, claiming that the life interest in the income was surrendered to her by Mrs. Cooper in 1930. The court below approved the appraisement.\nThe Commonwealth, in making out its prima facie case, offered the appraisement in evidence. To this appraisement two affidavits were attached. They were prepared by appellant and her attorney a year or two before the present proceeding as an aid to the inheritance tax appraisers. These affidavits contained statements that decedent had released her interest in the trust in the spring of 1930. Appellant now argues that the Commonwealth, having placed these affidavits in evidence without qualification, is irrevocably bound by the statement that decedent\u2019s interest in the trust was released. We held in Heyman v. Hanauer, 302 Pa. 56, 62, that the party who presents in evidence written documents of another party to a dispute, must present the writing in its entirety but that he may thereafter disprove allegations contained therein adverse to his interests. See also Yearsly\u2019s App., 48 Pa. 531. The affidavits were not pleadings or part of them. No issue was made therefrom and the cases cited by appellant are therefore not applicable.\nThe issue depended on the evidence and it supported the court\u2019s conclusion that no release of decedent\u2019s interest in the trust had taken place. This finding, having been approved by tbe court in banc is, by our settled rule, binding upon us: Foley v. Barnet, 303 Pa. 218; Belmont Lab. v. Heist, 300 Pa. 542, 546.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost.",
