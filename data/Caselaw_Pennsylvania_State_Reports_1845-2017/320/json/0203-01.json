United Traction Co. of Pittsburgh, 320 Pa. 196. We consider the records amended by marking the suits to the use (as stated in Frey\u2019s Appeal).\nThe orders appealed from are reversed, the records are remitted to the end that judgment he entered for the plaintiff for such sum as to right and justice may belong unless other legal or equitable cause be shown to the court below why such judgment should not be so entered.",
