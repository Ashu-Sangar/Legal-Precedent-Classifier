An examination of the pleadings discloses that the amended affidavit of defense and new matter specifically deny the allegations of the statement of claim and aver facts which, if proved at a trial, would warrant the jury in returning a verdict for defendant. It is a familiar rule that summary judgment should only be entered in cases which are clear and free from doubt. This is not such a case and the court below was therefore right in discharging plaintiff\u2019s rule for judgment. Peabody v. Carr, 316 Pa. 413; Ridley Park Borough v. American Surety Co., 317 Pa. 263.\nThe order is affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost.",
