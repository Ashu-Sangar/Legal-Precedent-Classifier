Plaintiff has appealed from the refusal of the court below to award a new trial. After a full examination of the record, including the notes of testimony and the charge of the court, we find no reason for disturbing the verdict. Moreover, we are convinced the decision reached by the jury was clearly warranted under the evidence.\nJudgment affirmed.",
