    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.7",228,[264,621,1152,1732]]]'>On the night of May 20, 1933, a storm broke a pole about a foot from the ground; after the pole fell the upper end rested on a cross-arm. The pole had a number of such cross-arms carrying wires which remained in place. The fall of this pole drew toward it the next pole (without bringing it down) causing the wires to sag. No wire in the vicinity of the fallen pole rested on the ground; one wire was near it; the next nearest was about a foot above that, and the third a foot above the second. These two poles were on opposite sides of a lane leading to the farmhouse of one, Onkow. He erected a barrier across the lane to warn anyone coming to his house from the main road via the lane. About 10 o’clock on the morning of May 21st, Chernuka, the decedent, with his wife and children, drove into the lane to visit Onkow. The Onkows saw them approach and Mrs. Onkow warned Chernuka “not to get close to the wires.” When he reached the barrier, his wife and children got out and walked to the house which was quite near, while he drove off the lane away from the suspended wires and over the field to the barn. Before allowing his wife and children to walk to the house, he cautioned them to keep away from the wires. After all had gathered at the house, Chernuka again warned his children to keep away from the wires. Later, Onkow and Chernuka walked down the lane toward the wires, Chernuka walking slightly in advance. When he reached a point about five feet from the wires and near where they sagged across the lane, he (in Onkow’s words) “slipped or stamped on a stone” and “fell” bringing his body in contact with one of the wires about three and a half feet above the ground. He died instantly.</p>

While electric companies are bound to use the highest degree of care practicable to avoid injury to everyone who may be in lawful proximity to their wires, yet the ordinary person is held to know that danger attends contact with electric wires, and it is his duty to avoid them so far as he may. If one heedlessly brings himself in contact with such a wire, and is injured in consequence, his imprudence must be regarded as a contributing cause, and will prevent a recovery.” See also Williams v.
