Sinking funds are required by the fundamental law. The Constitution provides: “Every city shall create a sinking fund, Avhich shall be inviolably pledged for the payment of its funded debt”: Article XV, section 3. “Any county, township, school district or other municipality incurring any indebtedness shall, at or before the time of so doing, provide for the collection of an annual tax sufficient to pay the interest and also the principal thereof. . . . ”: Article IX, section 10. This section is affected by the amendment to section 8, article IX, which noAV contains the folloAving: “In incurring indebtedness for any purpose the city of Philadelphia may issue its obligations maturing not later than fifty (50) years from the date thereof, with provision for a sinking-fund sufficient to retire said obligations at maturity, the payment to such sinking-fund to be in equal or graded annual or other periodical installments. Where any indebtedness shall be or shall have been incurred by said city of Philadelphia for the purpose of the construction or improvements of public works or utilities of any character, from which income or revenue is to be derived by said city, or for the reclamation of land to be used in the construction of wharves or docks owned or to be owned by said city, such obligations may be in an amount sufficient to provide for, and may include the amount of, the interest and sinking-fund charges accruing and which may accrue thereon throughout the period of construction, and until the expiration of one year after the completion of the work for which said indebtedness shall have been incurred; and said city shall not be required <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>to levy a tax to pay said interest and sinking-fund charges as required by section ten, article nine of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, until the expiration of said period of one year after the completion of said work.” While these provisions are self-executing, various statutes were passed to aid in making them effective. The so-called Charter Act (June 25, 1919, P.'L. 581) provides, in article XVIII, section 2, P. L. 610, “In any ordinance authorizing the city to incur new debt or increase its indebtedness, except for temporary loans, the council shall provide for the collection of a tax to pay the interest thereon and the principal thereof as is now or may hereafter be required by the Constitution. ...” Section 8 provides: “Whenever any debt shall be or shall have been created for which the Constitution of this Commonwealth requires a sinking-fund to be established, the proceeds of the taxes levied for the payment of the principal and interest of such debt and all other money pledged or appropriated for the payment of the principal and interest of such debt shall be paid into the sinking-fund of such city, and shall be inviolably reserved for, and applied exclusively to, the payment of the principal and interest of such debt.</p>

As respondents only have appealed, it is also unnecessary, on this record, to determine the maximum amount required by the contracts to be appropriated, because it appears, as the learned court below held, that (of the sum demanded by the commissioners) the respondents failed to justify withholding the amount ordered to be paid, an amount slightly less than what was demanded.</p>

The contract of the city and the bondholders, considered in the light of the Constitution and enabling legislation, provides in effect that, for each loan, a sinking fund shall be created and maintained to provide for interest and principal at maturity. Whether the law is complied with and the contract performed are matters of law, though performance may depend on the determination of matter of fact, for example, whether the payment to a sinking fund is sufficient in amount. City council, the commissioners, jointly or separately, and bondholders as a class, may differ as to the amount necessary, but unless a satisfactory compromise is reached the fact will be determined by the courts in appropriate proceedings. Each interested party has a right to be heard, but not to exclude another. Beferenee is made in the briefs to sinking fund earnings expected from year to year, the commission contending for a calculation on a basis of 3% per cent while city council and the controller put it in excess of 4 per cent. <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>The determination of the proper percentage may be only one of the facts to be found by the court if necessary in ascertaining the amount of the required payment.</p>

He contends that the provision in article XVII, section 1, of the Charter Act of 1919, supra, requiring the city controller to furnish to the mayor “estimates of receipts and liabilities” to enable the mayor to supply data to city council for the preparation of the annual budget, authorizes the controller to' decide what is a liability and what is not a liability, and that his judgment on the subject is final; that in the exercise of such authority, he decided that no annual contributions to capital amortization was required. The contention cannot be considered seriously. No statute confers or could confer power on the city controller to violate the contract created pursuant to the constitutional mandate. The city controller is “the city’s head bookkeeper” whose duties (see article XII, Charter Act, 1919, P. L. 597) “are partly ministerial and partly discretionary, and while the courts will not review his discretion exercised in a proper case, yet he is not above the law, and his discretion is not arbitrary but legal”: Com. ex rel. v.

They contend that the city need maintain but one sinking fund and, if there is more, than one loan, the sinking funds created to secure payment of each loan must necessarily be considered as part of a single general sink<a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>ing-fund reserve maintained as common security for all loans without regard to the date of issue. To support this contention the learned counsel who appeared for city council refers to the Consolidation Act of February <em>2, </em>1854, P. L. 21, as establishing a single sinking-fund. Pursuant to the act the various municipalities of the County of Philadelphia were consolidated into a single city. The act provided that the net debts of the several municipalities incorporated into the city, after deducting and cancelling assets held for their payment in their respective sinking-funds, should be consolidated into one debt to be called the debt of the city of Philadelphia, and provided (section 38) that a sinking fund should be established for the payment of that consolidated debt. When the consolidation was completed the force of that section was spent. Subsequent legislation shows clearly that for each bonded debt thereafter created a sinking fund must be maintained. While the total of the city’s bonded debts may be referred to as the debt of the city or the total of the assets in the sinking funds as the sinking fund reserve, such terms do not control the legal interpretation. The record shows that in practice in Philadelphia the accounts of the loans have been kept separate as also have been the sinking funds for separate loans. The record in Schuldice v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/251/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="251 Pa. 28" data-case-ids="1019656" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0028-01">251 Pa. 28</a>, 36 et seq., <a href="/citations/?q=95%20A.%20938" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="95 A. 938">95 A. 938</a>, shows the same practice in the City of Pittsburgh. It would be highly inequitable that a sinking fund that had been accumulating for, say, nine-tenths the term of a loan, should be shared, in the event of municipal default, by the holders of recently-created loans with sinking fund accumulations of a short period. It would require very clear legislative expression to establish appellants’ contention and we do not have it. This matter perhaps received emphasis in the arguments only because of the loans to raise the city’s contribution to the construction of the Delaware River Bridge and the subsequent sale of the city’s interest in the bridge. Money contributed by the city to the cost <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>of the bridge was raised by .five different loans from 1920 to 1924. In 1931 the city sold its. interest in the bridge and received from the purchaser the amount it had then invested in the bridge. City council directed the sum received to be paid to the sinking fund commissioners. They received and apportioned it to the sinking funds established as security for the loans from which the money for the bridge was obtained. One contention now made on behalf of all the appellants is that instead of appropriating the sum to the five loans in question it should be considered as appropriated to the forty-four city loans, in which event (so they contend) no contribution for principal amortization for 1935 would be required on the ground that in those circumstances there would be sufficient sinking fund reserve, treating all the funds as a unit. That question was raised in Corporation for the Relief of Widows, etc., v. City of Philadelphia et al., <a href="/pa/317/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="317 Pa. 76" data-case-ids="8845302" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0076-01">317 Pa. 76</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.%20727" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="176 A. 727">176 A. 727</a> (1935) and the contention now repeated by appellants was rejected. As we took original jurisdiction in that case the record remains in our files. The bill recited the receipt of the amount stated above, by the commissioners of the sinking funds, and, in the 20th paragraph, complainant averred that the commissioners had appropriated the entire sum: “$4, 940,700 of such money to be set aside for the retirement of the bonds then held in the sinking funds whose proceeds were used for the Delaware River Bridge and the balance of such money to be set aside as a special sinking fund, for the payment of the remaining outstanding bonds whose proceeds had been used to pay for the Delaware River Bridge.” A detailed account of this allotment was attached to the bill as an exhibit. The answer of the city council admitted the averment but denied its legal validity. Subsequently, November 15, 1934, city council passed an ordinance designed to repeal the ordinance appropriating the money to the sinking fund commissioners, and intended to withdraw it from them. The bill prayed for an injunction to restrain the city from <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>doing so and this court decided that the plaintiffs were entitled to the relief sought. The decision necessarily approved the practice of maintaining a separate sinking fund for each loan and in distributing the total received to the five sinking funds securing the loans which contributed to the bridge. Section 8, article XVIII, of the Charter Act, supra, requires a separate sinking fund for each loan; unless maintained the law cannot be complied with.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
