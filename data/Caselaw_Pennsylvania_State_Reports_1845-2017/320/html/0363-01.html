A taxpayer’s bill was filed to enjoin on the ground that the debt proposed to be incurred exceeded the constitutional limit, without an election. An injunction was granted but in the decree it was provided: “It also appears from the advertisement and bids sub<a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>mitted in respect to the proposed work of improving the three roadways and the additional sewering were asked for and received in separate and distinct items, so that the Township may use its discretion as to whether or not it will build any or all of such improvements.” In the final decree a similar provision was made.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b399-3" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[124,668,1157,750]]]'>The contract which the parties originally proposed to carry into effect was amended by eliminating from the proposed improvements one of the four streets. After plaintiff had partly performed, he was notified to stop; payment for the work done was refused although he produced the township engineer’s final estimate showing performance at the contract price in the sum of $5,-553.95. He then brought this suit for that sum with interest and for loss of profits he would have earned but for defendant’s breach. The case was tried by the court without a jury pursuant to the Act of April 22, 1874, P. L. 109, 12 PS section 688. The learned trial judge found facts in accord with part of plaintiff’s claim and entered judgment accordingly. Defendant has appealed.</p>
