She was an elderly woman who never married, and had resided during her entire lifetime at Milroy, Armagh Township, in Mifflin County. On August 31, 1932, following her death, there was probated a last will and testament of decedent, dated July 28,1932, upon which letters testamentary were granted on September 3,1932, to the executor named therein, C. G-. Milliken. The executor filed his first and final account of the administration of the estate on March 27, 1933, showing a balance of $18,274.20 for distribution. Exceptions to the account were filed by Harry Haines, nephew, the only heir at law and next of kin of decedent. The court thereupon appointed an auditor to pass upon the exceptions and award distribution of the balance of the estate.</p>

The first of these was dated July 27, 1927, having attached* a codicil of the date of February 19, 1931. We are not concerned here with this first will and codicil. It is conceded that its provisions were revoked and voided by the subsequent testamentary dispositions made by testatrix.</p>

Although admitted to probate, no letters testamentary were issued under the 1931 will, the executor acting under the letters granted upon the 1932 will. Both wills named C. G.

L. 403, 20 P. S., section 195. This would affect the gifts to the White Memorial Congregational Church of Milroy, Pennsylvania, to the Lewis-town Hospital, the appellants herein, and to the Congregational Conference of Pennsylvania.

The'3d Item reads as follows: “I herewith order and direct my hereinafter named executor or executors to give the balance of my estate of whatsoever nature, as I have otherwise directed him or them.” Prom the evidence before the auditor, the executor was entrusted under the oral directions referred to in this item, to make the following gifts: To the White Memorial Congregational Church of Milroy, Pennsylvania, $500; to Wood-lawn Cemetery Company, $1,000; to various named persons gifts of cash and specific articles belonging to decedent; to the Congregational Conference of Pennsylvania, all the rest of the furniture; and to the White Memorial Congregational Church of Milroy, Pennsylvania, the balance of decedent’s personal estate.</p>

The bequest to the Lewistown Hospital was increased to the sum of $2,000; a bequest of a like amount of $2,000 was made to the nephew of testatrix, Harry Haines. After the distribution of certain cash gifts and personal effects of furniture, according to directions privately given to the executor, the balance of the estate of whatsoever nature was given to the White Memorial Congregational Church of Milroy, Pennsylvania.

The auditor admitted testimony of the scrivener and the executor of the will, both of whom were witnesses present at the time of its execution, as to the declarations and instructions of the testatrix evincing her intention that the two instruments were to stand together. Basing his findings largely upon the testimony of these two witnesses, he decided that the 1932 will should be construed as a codicil to the 1931 will, and the gifts to the charities named related back to the 1931 will and were valid. Accordingly, in the schedule of distribution the auditor awarded to them the gifts provided by the testatrix. Exceptions to the report and award of the auditor in respect to these gifts were sustained by the court below upon the ground that the 1931 will was revoked by the later will, and the gifts to the charities and religious institutions as contained in the 1932 will were barred by the act above mentioned. The report was referred back to the auditor with directions to make distribution of the estate in accordance with the court’s opinion. To the auditor’s supplemental report and the revised schedule of distribution the charities filed exceptions which <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>were dismissed by the court below, this action being assigned as error in these appeals.</p>

We are not in agreement with the conclusion reached by the auditor that the instrument of 1932 is in effect a codicil. On the contrary, we view that writing as a complete disposition of all the property of testatrix, inconsistent with the earlier will, and effectually revoking it not only by express words but by manifest intention. It would have been error had the court below failed to sustain the exceptions to the auditor’s findings upon this question.</p>
    <p id="b360-6" data-blocks='[["BL_360.5",360,[270,1080,1153,1070]]]'>We have pointed out the differences between the two wills and the material changes which the testatrix made or caused to be made in the later will. A will, complete within its four corners, which makes a disposition of all the property of testatrix, as the 1932 will here does, is clearly incompatible with the existence of any former will and must operate as a revocation of all wills previously executed by testatrix: 1 Jarman on Wills, page 333. As stated in Teacle’s Est., <a href="/pa/153/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="153 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="840262" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0219-01">153 Pa. 219</a>, it “must operate as a revocation without express words to that effect.” Our conclusion would have been the same even though the 1932 will contained no express clause of revocation, as we regard the two wills in question as antagonistic wills, where a presumption of revocation may be made from such circumstance: Sigel’s Est. (No. 1), <a href="/pa/213/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="213 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="943441" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0014-01">213 Pa. 14</a>, 17. However, we cannot read out of the later will the clause of revocation, and giving to it, therefore, its meaning and effect, it would seem in itself determinative of the question whether the earlier will was to stand.</p>

In that case the later will contained no clause of revocation, yet it was held that the second will operated as a revocation of an earlier will even without express words to that effect. Mr. Justice Kephart, <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>speaking for this court, said: “The later will, sustained by the court below, disposes of the entire estate and is inconsistent with the earlier will. The provisions of the two wills cannot be harmonized. There is no reference in the later will to the first will, nothing inherent in the second will connects it with, or in any way refers to, or leads the mind to, the earlier will. They are two separate and distinct papers, both complete in themselves, without any relation to each other, with no inherent characteristics to compel a connection. A will may adopt an existing paper by reference thereto but to do so it must so identify the instrument as not to admit of a contrary conclusion.” See also Teacle’s Est., supra, where the only question was whether a will of the testatrix dated September 11, 1888, containing a clause of revocation, revoked a prior will dated August 12, 1881. It was contended that both wills should be admitted to probate and stand together as the will of testatrix. The court below held that the will of 1881 had been revoked and refused to admit it to probate. Mr. Chief Justice Paxson said, at page 223: “While many of the provisions of the two wills are similar there are several points of difference, and different executors are named in each will. In case both wills are admitted to probate, as constituting but one testamentary paper, to which set of executors are the letters testamentary to be granted? The second will makes a complete disposition of all the property of the testatrix. Such a will is clearly incompatible with any former will, and, therefore, must operate as a revocation without express words to that effect. . . . It is conceded that a will may be composed of different papers, executed at different times. There may be codicils executed from time to time, changing the disposition of the testator’s property, and there may be other papers which operate as codicils for the same purpose, but when a paper is executed with all the formalities of a will, disposing of the testator’s entire estate, and appointing executors to execute it, it impliedly re<a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>vokes all former wills for the reason that it is the latest declaration of the testator’s intention. And if a clause of revocation he added it expressly revokes former wills.” See also Hoffner’s Est., <a href="/pa/161/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="161 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="854188" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0331-01">161 Pa. 331</a>; Price v.

But the facts in both cases are different from those with which we have here to deal. In Sloan’s Appeal, the testator designated the later instrument which he signed as “a codicil” and made direct reference to his earlier will in these words: “And I desire my said Will <em>to stand confirmed </em>in all other respects.” The will was made by the testator more than one calendar month before death, while the codicil was executed within the month. The codicil postponed the time of payment of the bequest to a charity as contained in the will until after the expiration of two life estates, without changing the purpose or terms in other respects. In sustaining the gift, we held that there was no revocation of it by the codicil and the Act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 328, did not apply. In the second case, Bingaman’s Estate, the later instrument, although called a will, was in effect a codicil. It revoked all former wills “excepting only so much of the same as relate to the charitable gifts, bequests and devises, which are set forth and made in a former will made by me.” We decided (page 507) : “The present will is, in effect, a codicil, and in some respects cannot possibly be anything else. In terms it refers to the will of 1919, as expressing a part of decedent’s testamentary intent when he executed this will of 1922, and, without the former will in some respects <em>it cannot he known </em>what testator intended when he executed the later one. . . . Hence the two wills were rightfully probated together and must be construed together in this particular.” To the same effect are other cases cited by the appellants, viz.: Sigel’s Est. (No. 1), supra; Warne’s Est., <a href="/pa/302/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="302 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1129064" data-case-paths="/pa/302/0386-01">302 Pa. 386</a>, and <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>Mifflin’s Est., <a href="/pa-super/49/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="49 Pa.

We think it was error for the auditor to receive parol testimony to remove the clause of revocation from the 1932 will. As the court below aptly said: “If this clause could be taken out of the will by extrinsic evidence, so could any other clause, and we have a testament, not in writing, but by oral declaration directly repugnant to section 2 of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, 20 P. S., section 191.” It is true that parol evidence is admissible to explain a latent ambiguity in a will, such as an inaccuracy in the description of a property (see Brooklyn Trust Co. v. Warrington, <a href="/pa/277/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="277 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="1079533" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0204-01">277 Pa. 204</a>, and cases therein cited), but where the language of the will is perfectly clear, and there is a complete and plain will in writing, it cannot be altered or affected by parol evidence as to testamentary intention, nor by any evidence of matters dehors the will: Wallize v. Wallize, <a href="/pa/55/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="55 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1470756" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0242-01">55 Pa. 242</a>; Willard’s App., <a href="/pa/68/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="68 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="1024578" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0327-01">68 Pa. 327</a>. Moreover, we are not impressed with the argument that a constructive fraud was practiced upon the testatrix by the allegation that the clause of revocation was unknown to her, and was not read to her, but was permitted to remain in the will without her knowledge and consent. The testimony reveals that the testatrix was of sound mind and understood the testamentary disposition she was making of her estate. However incompetent the testimony of these two witnesses named above may be, it failed to support the allegations made in this <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>connection. Therefore, it was proper, in our opinion, for the court below to sustain the exceptions to the auditor’s findings based upon such testimony, which action is here made the subject of several of the assignments of error.</p>

The construction of this statute over a period of years has been so well established that it has become a rule of property.. We have uniformly held from the earliest interpretation of the statute to the present time that estates devised or bequeathed contrary to its provisions are void. The act establishes an unbending rule and fixes an arbitrary period within which such dispositions of property, whether by deed or by will, shall be absolutely barred. Such bequests, under the circumstances, fail because of the incapacity in the beneficiaries to take. The act must be literally read and construed, if effect is to be given to the legislative intent, and cannot be stretched to save a bequest clearly intended by the act to be void.
