Kahler borrowed from the Fair Oaks Building and Loan Association, appellee, four thousand four hundred dollars, giving her bond therefor with a mortgage on certain land as security. As additional security she assigned to the building and loan as<a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>sociation twenty-two shares of its stock. Later in the year she sold the property to Joseph Veronese and wife. The deed of conveyance is not printed, hut it is stated that it was subject to the mortgage which was assumed by the purchasers. The grantor also assigned her ownership in the building and loan stock to her grantees subject to the prior assignment to the association. On the 21st of February, 1933, Veronese and wife, having defaulted in their payments on the mortgage, the building and loan association entered judgment against Mrs. Kahler on her bond.</p>
    <p id="b282-4" data-blocks='[["BL_282.4",282,[274,939,1151,589]]]'>Thereafter Veronese and his wife were requested by the officers of the association to make a deed for the property to it to avoid costs of foreclosure, etc., and in May, 1933, they did make such deed to G. W. Guyer, an officer of the building and loan association who took the title in trust for the building and loan association. It is stated that this deed contained words creating the same liability as to Guyer, Veronese’s grantee, as did that from Mrs. Kahler to Veronese, i. e., subject to the mortgage given by Emma J. Kahler to the association, which the grantee assumed to pay.</p>

Kahler knew nothing of the default of Veronese or of the subsequent transaction culminating in the deed to Guyer until after that deed had been made. Then she was advised of these matters by the association’s officers, who demanded from her four thousand six hundred and seventy-four dollars as the balance due on the mortgage. She refused to pay this sum, claiming no liability. The association thereupon issued an execution on the judgment against appellant, directing the sheriff to sell the property mentioned in the mortgage together with other property of appellant not covered by the mortgage. Mrs. Kahler endeavored to prevent this by petitioning the court below to open the judgment and stay the writ as to all property not covered by the <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>mortgage. The execution was stayed as to such property, but that covered by the mortgage was sold for twenty-six hundred dollars to the building and loan association. It then petitioned for a deficiency judgment under the Act of January 17, 1934, P. L. 243, and asked the court below to determine the amount appellant was indebted on the mortgage less the sum credited from the sale of the mortgaged premises. A master was appointed to ascertain the deficiency, if any.</p>

It must be answered to determine whether there was any liability at all for the deficiency in the mortgage debt after the sale of the premises. That question was not decided by the court below.

As between the parties' to the conveyance this presumption may be overcome by oral or written agreement, but not to the prejudice of others not parties thereto who may be affected thereby.

Under a deed of conveyance which contains an “under and subject” clause, the grantee’s liability is as just expressed. The vendee in an “under and subject” deed is a purchaser of the entire estate and is liable to pay the encumbrance as part of the purchase price.

It has been intimated in this jurisdiction by obiter dicta that, in a use action by the mortgagee against the grantee, such loss must first be shown. Thus in, Lowry v.

But these cases did not directly pass on this point and they should all be viewed in the light of what was then before the court. We have stated above that in a deed containing an “under and subject” clause the grantee is under an obligation to indemnify the grantor only against actual loss. When the language of the deed is that the grantee “assumes and agrees to pay” the encumbrance, or similar language, the agreement may also be one of indemnity. But to follow the above quoted dicta to their logical conclusion would have the effect of attaching to this open liability an element of a contract of indemnity against loss, whereas the language purports to impose a higher or broader obligation. In Faulker v. McHenry, <a href="/pa/235/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="235 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="984832" data-case-paths="/pa/235/0298-01">supra,</a> at page 300, the difference between these two liabilities and the apparent conflict in the cases was thus set forth, though it, too, was obiter. “Any apparent want of harmony in the decisions as to the right of a party indemnified <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>to recover without proof of loss by the payment of the debt or otherwise, disappears when the nature of the undertaking is considered and the distinction between an obligation to do a specified thing and one of indemnity against loss resulting from nonperformance is observed. Where the indemnity is against liability there is a right of recovery as soon as a liability is incurred; where it is against loss by reason of a liability there is no right of recovery until a loss occurs . . . In 16 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of L. (2d ed.) 178, the rule is thus stated, ‘where the contract is strictly one of indemnity the indemnitee cannot recover until he has suffered actual loss or damage; the mere incurring of liability gives him no such right; but where the contract is to protect against liability, the indemnitee may recover as soon as his liability has become fixed and established, even though he has sustained no actual loss or damage at the time he seeks to recover.’ ” (See also Malley v. American Indemnity Co., <a href="/pa/297/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="297 Pa. 216" data-case-ids="1118264" data-case-paths="/pa/297/0216-01">297 Pa. 216</a>, 221; West v.

Accordingly, in contradistinction to the cases which deny recovery to the grantor from the grantee in a deed containing an “under and subject” clause where the only loss the grantor can show is a judgment against him (see Faulker v. McHenry, <a href="/pa/235/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="235 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="984832" data-case-paths="/pa/235/0298-01">supra),</a> this court has permitted recovery on similar facts where the grantee “assumes and agrees” to pay the encumbrance: McAbee v. Cribbs, <a href="/pa/194/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="194 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="912391,912445" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0094-01,/pa/194/0094-02">194 Pa. 94</a>.</p>

Merriman v. Moore, <a href="/pa/90/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="90 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1065583" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0078-01">90 Pa. 78</a>, 81; see also Putnam v. United Traction Co. of Pgh., <a href="/pa/320/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="320 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1163618" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0196-01">320 Pa. 196</a>; John Ruzyc et al., to use, v. Thomas B. Brown et al., <a href="/pa/320/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="320 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="1163688" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0213-01">320 Pa. 213</a>. Conceding that .in the <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>“assumes and agrees to pay” situation the relation between the grantor and grantee is that of an indemnitor against liability, or an assumption of direct liability as though the engagement was with the mortgagee, when the grantee’s liability to the holder of the encumbrance is in question, it partakes of the nature of both of these engagements and permits a use action against the grantee directly by the mortgagee upon proof of default without more. As was stated in Lowry v. Hensel’s Heirs, <a href="/pa/281/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="281 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="1087077" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0572-01">supra, at 517</a>, the mortgagee has, under these circumstances, two principal debtors. See also Cook v. Berry, <a href="/pa/193/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="193 Pa. 377" data-case-ids="910363" data-case-paths="/pa/193/0377-01">193 Pa. 377</a>; Morris v. Oakford, <a href="/pa/9/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="9 Pa. 498" data-case-ids="960692" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0498-01">9 Pa. 498</a>; Blood v.

With this outstanding right to enforce payment from one who had contracted to pay, and with the right of subrogation for the protection of intermediate parties who may be pursued for the debt, it would seem that the solution of immediate liability on maturity or default in the obligation is in conformity with justice and sound legal rules.</p>

The fact that he made the promise as trustee has been considered in two cases. In Britton v. Both, supra, a dry trustee took the title under a personal assumption clause and we held the trustee liable for a deficiency in the payment of a mortgage debt. It was there urged that the trustee should be relieved of liability and the beneficiary held, therefor. The court did not consider this argument of any avail to relieve the trustee who was compelled to pay the deficiency. In Girard Life Insurance &amp; Tr. Co. v. Stewart, <a href="/pa/86/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="86 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="1056625" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0089-01">86 Pa. 89</a>, the trustee was permitted to show that he was a trustee and took title subject to the payment of the mortgage merely as an accommodation. <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>The lower court there held that the trustee was not liable because the title was put in him through the agency of others without his knowledge, and it was on this basis that the case was differentiated in Britton v. Both, supra. However it is to be noted that the deed in that case is stated as one “under and subject” to the mortgage, and the suit was by the holder of the encumbrance, a remote party in the chain of title, to whom there would not in any event have been a liability either by the beneficiary or the trustee.</p>

It is clear, however, that the subsequent sale by the sheriff to appellee would not carry with it any personal liability either directly or as indemnitor for the mortgage on the property as to which foreclosure took place: See Ryon’s Estate, <a href="/pa/318/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="318 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="1159600" data-case-paths="/pa/318/0171-01">318 Pa. 171</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=178%20A.%20133" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="178 A. 133">178 Atl. 133</a>; Steele v.
