In that case this court held that an act authorizing voters in their own localities to vote “for license or against license” did not breach the constitutional prohibition against delegating legislative power. Mr. Justice Agnew, speaking for the court, said: “They [the voters] declared their views or wishes and when they did so, it was the fiat of the law, not their vote, which commanded licenses to be issued or not to be issued . . . The legislature in the Act of 1871 have given to the people a law, not a mere invitation; needing no ratification, no popular breath to give it vitality. The law is simply contingent upon the determination of the fact, whether licenses are needed, or are desired, in this ward. And why shall not the legislature take the sense of the people? Is it not the right of the legislature to seek information of the condition of a locality, or of the public sentiment there? The Constitution grants the power to legislate, but it does not confer knowledge. The very trust implies that the power should be exercised wisely and judiciously. Are not public sentiment and local circumstances just subjects of inquiry. A judicious exercise of power in one place may not be so in another. Public sentiment of local condition may make the law unwise, inapt, or inoperative in some places, and otherwise elsewhere. Instead of being contrary to, it is con<a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>sistent with, the genius of our free institutions, to take the public sense in many instances, that the legislators may faithfully represent the people, and promote their welfare. So long, therefore, as the legislature only calls to its aid the means of ascertaining the utility or expediency of a measure, and does not delegate the power to make the law itself, it is acting within the sphere of its just power.” See also McGonnell’s License, <a href="/pa/209/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="209 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="936206" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0327-01">209 Pa. 327</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20A.%20615" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="58 A. 615">58 A. 615</a>.</p>

We there pointed out the distinction between making a law and investing some official or group of electors with discretion in putting or not putting the law into effect. There are many examples in our laws of similar vesting of discretion: A state law confers upon the voters of the respective counties the power to say <em>whether or not </em>voting machines shall be used in those counties ; the secretary of the Commonwealth is given power by law to decide <em>what Mnd </em>of voting machines may be used. None of these, however, are delegations of legislative powers. Likewise, in the instant case, the power conferred on the voters by the act in question to say whether the law prohibiting baseball and football being played on Sunday afternoons shall be operative in their localities, is not a delegation of legislative power.</p>

The accepted canons of interpretation of provisions of the federal Constitution which are the same or substantially similar' to corresponding provisions in our state Constitution, while not necessarily controlling in state forums when provisions in our own Constitution are being <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>interpreted by ns, nevertheless command great respect. The distinction between the Schechter case and the case at bar is obvious. In that case the law challenged provided that “upon the application to the President by one or more trade or industrial associations or groups, the President may approve a code or codes of fair competition for the trade or industry or subdivision thereof, represented by the applicant or applicants, if the President finds (1) that such associations or groups impose no inequitable restrictions on admission to membership therein and are truly representative of such trades or industries or subdivisions thereof, and (2) that such code or codes are not designed to promote monopolies or to eliminate or oppress small enterprises and will not operate to discriminate against them, and will tend to effectuate the policy of this title: Provided that such code or codes shall not permit monopolies or monopolistic practices.”</p>
    <p id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[268,1336,1153,1080]],["BL_329.1",329,[155,350,1154,861]]]'>It was further provided that when the codes so submitted to the President by certain groups were approved by him, violation of- them became punishable crimes. These codes were also enforceable by equitable proceedings in federal courts. That statute presented a perfect example of an attempt by Congress to delegate its legislative power to “trade or industrial associations or groups” acting with the approval of the President. Under this statute the fiat of these groups, when given presidential approval, became the law of the land. In that case Chief Justice Hughes, speaking for the court, said: “We look to the statute to see whether Congress ... in authorizing codes of fair competition has itself established the standard of legal obligation, thus performing its essential legislative function, or, by the failure to enact such standards, has attempted to transfer that function to others.” He found that the statute was unconstitutional because by it Congress had attempted to transfer to others the function of establishing standards of legal obligation. If the Pennsylvania <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>statute we are now considering provided that any group of persons wanting to play any kind of games on Sunday afternoons should draw up a “code” describing those games and the manner of their playing, and providing that upon the approval of the Governor such games would be lawful and anyone interfering with them should suffer the pains of the criminal law, we would have a statute analogous in its basic aspects to the statute held void in the Scheehter case. But the statute before us does nothing of that sort. It confers upon no group the power to establish ány standard of legal obligation. All legal obligations with respect to Sunday baseball and football in Pennsylvania were fully defined by a complete act of legislation. No men or group of men could add anything to or subtract anything from that law.</p>

Our state legislature laid down poli* cies and established a standard in respect to the playing of baseball and football on Sunday afternoons. It left to “selected instrumentalities,” i. e., municipal subdivisions, “the determination of facts to which the policy as declared by the legislature is to apply.” The statute recognizes the fact that there are citizens to whom the playing of baseball or football on Sunday afternoon is not offensive and others to whom it is. In the language of the act some citizens are “in favor of baseball and football on Sunday between the hours of 2 and 6 P. M.” and conversely some citizens are not in favor of such playing at such times. All citizens are given the right by law to register at the polls their attitude toward such playing and the law assures them that their attitude when formally expressed will be respected by the sovereign Commonwealth. The law in question bears an analogy in respect to the features upon, which it is <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>challenged, to the Act of March 24, 1927, P. L. 64, providing that “no license to marry shall issue, if either applicant therefor, be under the age of sixteen years: Provided, that a judge of the orphans’ court shall have discretion to authorize a license to be issued by the clerk of orphans’ court in special cases where one or both persons are under the age of sixteen years.” It could as logically be argued that the judge of the orphans’ .court is engaging in an act of legislation when he formally registers his “favoring” the suspension in a particular case of the prohibition against issuing marriage licenses to persons under sixteen years of age as it can that the voters of a municipality are engaging in an act of legislation when they formally register their favoring of the suspension in their localities of the prohibition against Sunday afternoon baseball and football.</p>

Our own state Constitution recognizes that laws may be suspended by the authority of the legislature, for section 12 of the Bill of Bights provides: “No power of suspending laws shall be exercised unless by the legislature or by its authority.” In the act here in question the legislature authorized the voters of the respective municipalities of the Commonwealth to suspend the prohibition of that act.</p>

Chief Justice Hughes, speaking for the court, said: “Section 9(c) does not state whether or in what circumstances or under what conditions the President is to prohibit the transportation of the amount of petroleum or petroleum products in excess of the state’s permission. It establishes no criterion to govern the President’s course. It does not require any finding by the President as a condition of his action. ... It gives to the President an unlimited authority to determine the policy and to lay down the prohibition, or not to lay it down, as he may see fit. And disobedience to his order is made a crime punishable by fine and imprisonment . . . The Congress left the matter to the President without standard or rule, to be dealt with as he pleased. . . .

Appellants say in their brief: “Law-making power is delegated to petitioners by conferring upon them the sole power to command the submission of the question upon which the electors are empowered to express their will.” The error of this proposition lies in the fact that the command for the submission of the question comes directly from the legislature. When 5% of the voters petition, as the legislature prescribes, for the referendum machinery to become operative, it automatically starts. The calling or demand of the voters for a referendum, as provided for in the above section, is no more a legislative act within the meaning of the constitutional provision against legislative acts by outside agencies than is the ordering of a municipal election by the corporate authorities of any county, city, town or incorporated district to ascertain the will of the voters as to an increase in indebtedness, as provided in the Acts of April 20,1874, P.

Speaking for the court, Chief Justice Black said: “Half the statutes on our books are in the alternative, depending on the discretion of some person or persons to whom is confided the duty of determining whether the proper occasion exists for executing them. But it cannot be said that the exercise of such a discretion is the making of the law. New privileges, conferred on a public corporation, need not be absolute and peremptory, so as to force them on the members against their consent. When individuals or corporators are merely authorized to do a thing, the doing of it necessarily depends on their own will; and we can see no reason why the acceptance of a new power, tendered to a public corporation, may not be made to depend on the will of the people when it is expressed by themselves, as well as when it is spoken by the mouths of their officers and agents.”</p>

Black, <a href="/pa/200/0629-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="200 Pa. 629" data-case-ids="924400" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0629-01">200 Pa. 629</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.%20198" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="50 A. 198">50 A. 198</a>, is also cited by the court below. Judge Bailey then pertinently says that “the act in question applies to every municipality in the Commonwealth and operates upon all of them. It is argued, however, that since, by the submission of the question of Sunday baseball and football to voters in the various municipalities, and from the result of this vote, that act which might be legal in one would be illegal in another, brings the statute within those constitutional inhibitions as being local. The courts of this State, however, have held otherwise. It was decided that a statute, general in form and covering every county in the State, cannot be deemed local on account of varying results arising from the exercise of local option: Com. v. Woodring, <a href="/pa/289/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="289 Pa. 437" data-case-ids="1103341" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0437-01">289 Pa. 437</a> [<a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.%20635" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="137 A. 635">137 A. 635</a>].”</p>

The learned judge said: “This section can be successfully invoked against a law when it purports to extend or amend a previous statute. . . . Section 8 of our act [that is, the act in question] shows that the intention of the legislature was not only to amend or exténd the provisions of the Act of 1794, but to repeal them in so far as they might prohibit baseball and football on Sunday. This constitutional provision has reference to express amendments only. The act in question is a new law, complete in itself. Its meaning is apparent on its face, and does not require the reenforcement of any other stat<a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>ute to give it effect. It is, therefore, not void as violative of this constitutional limitation: Searight’s Est., <a href="/pa/163/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="163 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="859034" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0210-01">163 Pa. 210</a>, 216 [<a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.%20800" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="29 A. 800">29 A. 800</a>]; Com. v.

    <p id="b337-3" data-blocks='[["BL_337.4",337,[137,558,1155,1138]]]'>The fourth basis of the attack on this act is that it breaches section 3, of article III, of the Constitution because no notice is given in the title of the act that it amends section 1 of the Act of April 22, 1794, which prohibits worldly employment and business and unlawful games on Sunday. Appellants say: “The subject of the Act of 1933 is the same as that of 1794. The earlier act covered the entire subject of worldly employment and business upon Sunday while the later statute is confined to two objects or members of the class of objects of such employment and business. This being true, the express partial repeal of section 1 of the Act of 1794, the reenactment of the prohibition imposed by the Act of 1794 by the 1933 Act and its referendum provisions are and can be nothing other than express alterations and amendments of the 1794 Act.” As the court below said: “It is sufficient answer to this contention to say that this law does not purport to be an amendment, but in its title<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a> it fairly gives notice of its contents, and that is all that is necessary: Com. v.
