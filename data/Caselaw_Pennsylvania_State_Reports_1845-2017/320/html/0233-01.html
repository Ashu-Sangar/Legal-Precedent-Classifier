He is described in it as “inventor of a special treatment for electrical bulbs to be used in automobile headlights, for which patent has been applied for.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> By the contract he assigned to the Company his application for the patent “and right to manufacture and market the bulb, and [agreed] to assign the patent when granted and to extend to the [Company] all rights to improvements he may develop. ...” The patent was granted in 1932. The Company agreed <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>to pay Mm a royalty of ten cents per set of two bulbs of the first 50,000 sets sold in each year and five cents per set on the excess of 50,000 in each year. The contract contained the following provision: “The [Company] to provide manufacturing facilities and market the bulbs, exerting such effort and making such expenditures as they deem necessary to accomplish this.” It also provided that “for a period of thirty (30) days from this date the [Company] is to have the privilege of investigating the merit and possibilities for this bulb in the market, and to accomplish this [Christmas] agrees to furnish his services required mainly to employ agents to market the bulb locally, get into limited production, etc.” The Company reserved the right “to cancel the arrangement under this agreement if it is found from the investigations of [the Company] during the thirty (30) day investigation period either the market for the product or the quality or practicability of the same has not been found to be as anticipated at the time this agreement was entered into.” Both parties immediately began performance. Apparently no cause arose for cancellation during the 30-day period set aside for that purpose. The record shows a remarkable measure of success up to February 10, 1932. It will be observed that the agreement expressed no definite period during which the Company should enjoy its benefits (once the 30-day period had passed) save as implied by the term of the patent, if granted, and subject to the construction of the provision, quoted above, that the Company should exert “such effort and making such expenditures as they deem necessary to accomplish” the purposes of the agreement.</p>

The Company not only made no offer to return the invention assigned, but wrongfully retained the royalty for part of December, 1931, and for January, 1932, now conceded to be owing. The evidence, accepted by the jury, supports the conclusion that the Company acted without right and in bad faith. See Kenderdine Fuel Co. v. Plumb, <a href="/pa/182/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="182 Pa. 463" data-case-ids="893297" data-case-paths="/pa/182/0463-01">182 Pa. 463</a>, 469, <a href="/citations/?q=38%20A.%20480" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="38 A. 480">38 A. 480</a>. The details of this phase of the transaction are fully described in the record and need not be stated here; the fact however has some bearing on the questions arising on the proof of damages. The Company admits giving notice on February 10, 1932, that it <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>would not pay the royalty then due or that would accrue thereafter. When the Company declined to continue performance, plaintiff notified it that its refusal would be treated as “a complete breach of the entire contract”; this suit for damages in the nature of anticipatory breach then followed: see McCormick v. Fidelity and Casualty Co., <a href="/pa/307/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="307 Pa. 434" data-case-ids="1138149" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0434-01">307 Pa. 434</a>, 439, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20A.%20532" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="161 A. 532">161 A. 532</a>.</p>

    <p id="b272-5" data-blocks='[["BL_272.5",272,[281,1048,1153,859]]]'>In dealing with the challenged evidence it is necessary to keep in mind the salutary rule, applied in the review of trials on appeal, that judgments will not be reversed for harmless errors; that, though error in a technical sense may appear, it will not be ground for retrial, if an appellant was not injured by the error. Even though part of the evidence was not admissible we should not disturb the judgment if consideration of the amount of the verdict in the light of the evidence conclusively establishes that the jury heeded the instructions of the learned trial judge, in substance, to draw no inferences of damage not reasonably following from as much of the evidence as the jury might regard as certain, as distinguished from that which lay in fields of mere speculation and conjecture. The application of the rule will be obvious as we proceed.</p>

They gave evidence of their conclusions. Witnesses for defendant denied the validity of the conclusions suggested by plaintiff’s witnesses and gave their views as to possible damage, generally concluding that there was none. As to the term of the patent, it must be said that unless the Company, with plaintiff’s consent, chose to surrender its rights under the agreement before the expiration of that term, the Company had the right to avail itself during the entire period of the benefits granted.

Appellant says “it is too speculative and uncertain to be the proper basis for damages.” On this record we need not attempt to fix the date beyond which it might be said that the opinions of the witnesses rested on mere guess, as appellant suggests, because we are satisfied that the jury did not base its verdict on evidence which might be considered too uncertain, but that, on the contrary, the jury rejected that portion of the evidence. The defendant cannot complain, if the record for the period during which it sold the lights was used as the basis to determine what the royalty might have been during, say, the period up to the trial. The jury was certainly justified in accepting as probable defendant’s statements that, in the three months of the spring of 1932, 1,000,000 sets of the bulbs would be sold; that alone would give plaintiff a royalty of $52,500. The <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>same prediction would support the conclusion that the business, at a profitable rate, would in all probability continue for some time after 1932, and that, during the remaining part of 1932, or (for purposes of review if necessary to support the verdict), up to the time of trial, enough would be sold to earn royalties in the amount of the verdict. See, Restatement, Contracts, section 331, comment a. According to the evidence of plaintiff’s expert witnesses the sales which they thought would be made would have required the payment of royalty from the time of the breach to the time of trial in a sum of approximately $200,000; this sum the jury not only declined to find, but greatly reduced. Under the charge of the court, the amount found due (which included interest) was only $85,000. It therefore clearly appears that if, as appellant contends, there was error in allowing the witnesses to estimate sales over too long a period, a point we need not pass on, appellant was not injured.</p>
