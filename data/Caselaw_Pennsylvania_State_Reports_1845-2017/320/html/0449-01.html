L. 452, known as the General State Authority Act. Defendants are the members of the General State Authority, the corporation organized under the provisions of that act. Original jurisdiction of the cause was taken upon plaintiff’s petition and defendants’ answer thereto, in which defendants joined in the prayer of the petition. A petition to intervene as party plaintiff and to file a supplemental bill was granted to another taxpayer. Defendants’ answers to the bill of plaintiff and the supplemental bill of the intervenor admit the allegations of fact therein but deny the in<a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>validity of the act and tlie agreements proposed to be executed thereunder. A stipulation of facts has been filed setting forth (a) the form of resolution under which the authority proposes to contract with the Commonwealth for the erection of needed improvements, (b) the form of “loan and grant agreement.” proposed to be entered into between the authority and the federal government, and (c) the deed of trust proposed to be executed by the authority to secure its bond issue.

It recites the need for an improved water supply and waterworks for the State Colony for Epileptics near Selinsgrove, the cost of which is to be $50,909. The recital further discloses that the federal emergency relief administration of public works has approved the project and that, through the benefits of an act of Congress known as the Federal Emergency Work Relief Act, 45 per cent of the total cost of the construction of the project will be paid by the federal government, and the balance, $28,000, will be loaned to the authority by the federal government if satisfactory terms can be arranged. It is then resolved that the authority may enter into an agreement with the depart<a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>ment of welfare of the Commonwealth, and that the terms of that agreement shall in substance provide: “(a) The Commonwealth to make available the necessary site or sites, together with pipe line easement in lands upon which the project will be erected and established, to be conveyed or leased to this authority for a nominal consideration, (b) This authority to construct on the sites thus made available and transferred a complete water-works system which shall be rented to the Department of Welfare of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for a term not exceeding thirty years at an annual rental not exceeding $2800.00 for the first third of the term, $2520.00 for the second third of the term and $2240.00 for the balance of the term. Said lease also to provide that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, acting through its appropriate department or agency will keep said water-works in good order and repair and maintaining the same in operating condition.

(e) If the Supreme Court of the State shall not render a decision satisfactory to the Administrator holding that: (i) Act No. 190 [the General State Authority Act] is constitutional, . . .

Of these we need consider only one. Section 4 of article IX of. the Constitution provides: “No debt shall be created by or on behalf of the State, except to supply casual deficiencies- of revenue, repel invasion, suppress insurrection, defend the State in war, or to pay existing debt; and the debt created to supply deficiencies in revenue shall never exceed, in the aggregate at any one time, one million dollars: Provided, however, That the General Assembly, irrespective of any debt, may authorize the State to issue bonds, to the amount of one hundred millions of dollars, for the purpose of improving and rebuilding the highways of the Commonwealth.” We are of the opinion that the lease which the Commonwealth proposes to execute under the stipulation in the record, and other leases like it, are within the prohibition of that section. We have not often been called upon to consider the meaning and effect of section 4 of article IX. It is clear, however, that the vice intended to be prevented by it is not different from that prohibited by section 8 of article IX, which limits the indebtedness of municipalities, and which we have frequently had to consider. We pointed out in Kelley v. Baldwin, <a href="/pa/319/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="319 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1162333" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0053-01">319 Pa. 53</a>, at page 60, that the mischief sought to be avoided by section 4 was “the accumulation of a state debt (subject to the $1,000,000 leeway for deficiency in revenue) by expenditures in excess of current biennial revenue.” In Com. v. Liveright, <a href="/pa/308/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="308 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1140242" data-case-paths="/pa/308/0035-01">308 Pa. 35</a>, it was said, at page 66: “This section was intended to restrict legislative acts which incurred obligations or permitted engagements on the credit of the State beyond revenue in hand or anticipated through a biennium, and establishes the principle that we must keep Avithin current revenue and $1,000,000.” We have likewise several times asserted that the sort of indebtedness <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>prohibited by section 8 was the “contractual obligation to pay in the future for considerations received in the present”: see Keller v. Scranton, <a href="/pa/200/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="200 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="924409" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0130-01">200 Pa. 130</a>, 135; Lesser v.

The respective purposes of the two sections are undoubtedly parallel, and it therefore becomes relevant to consider the cases construing section 8.</p>

In City of Erie’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/91/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="91 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="487742" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0398-01">91 Pa. 398</a>, it was said, at page 403: “If the contracts and engagments of municipal corporations do not overreach their current revenues, no objections can lawfully be made to them, however great the indebtedness of such municipalities may be; for in such case their engagements do not extend beyond their present means of payment, and so no debt is created.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> Thus, a contract, the purpose of which is to meet the ordinary expenses and recurrent needs of the community, is not within the constitutional restraint (Reuting v. Titusville, <a href="/pa/175/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="175 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="880487" data-case-paths="/pa/175/0512-01">175 Pa. 512</a>), even though the undertaking may extend beyond the current fiscal term: Wade v.

Where it does not appear, however, that an obligation incurred by a municipality can be met out of current revenues, the obligation must be considered a debt in the constitutional sense if it in fact represents an extraordinary or capital expenditure, éven though it may be arranged so as to appear to be an ordinary and usual expense: Brown v. City of Corry, <a href="/pa/175/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="175 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="880540" data-case-paths="/pa/175/0528-01">175 Pa. 528</a>; McKinnon v.

Payment was to be in annual installments for 20 years, title to remain in the contractor until the city had fully performed its contract. In a “supplementary statement” it was declared to have been the original intention of the parties to the agreement that the payments were to be “payable . . . annually from the current revenues of said city and not otherwise.” The contention was made for the city that the contract was merely for the supply of water and was confined to current revenues. It was none the less held that the purpose of the arrangement was the acquisition of a capital improvement and did not fall within the rule enunciated in City of Erie’s Appeal, supra, concerning current revenues. Since the city’s borrowing power was exhausted, the debt thereby created was invalid. A similar scheme, for the construction of a school building, was struck down in McKinnon v. Mertz, <a href="/pa/225/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="225 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="965410" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0085-01">supra,</a> notwithstanding a “supplemental agreement” attempting to restrict the indebtedness to “funds legally available.” In Lesser v. Warren Borough, supra, the proposal was to construct a waterworks, to be financed by a bond issue, which was to be met solely from the revenues of the waterworks, “without other liability whatsoever” on the part of the borough. It was pointed out that, if the bonds were not paid, the waterworks, borough property, could be taken in payment. In holding the proposed undertaking a violation of the restriction on municipal indebtedness, we said, at page 513: “In determining whether any legislative or municipal act conflicts with the Constitution, its substance, and not its form, must always be the test. To sanction what the appellant proposes to do would permit municipalities burdened with debt almost up to the constitutional limit, to constantly overstep it, with results easily to <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>be conjectured. Public improvements which could not be made in the face of the Constitution would be made in defiance of it. To permit a borough or city to borrow money under a contract that it shall not be liable for its repayment, but that the lender must look solely to pledged municipal property or assets, would, in effect, annul the constitutional restriction upon municipal improvidence and strike down a safeguard against municipal profligacy. The Constitution is not to be thus set at naught.”</p>
    <p id="b493-5" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[125,895,1153,906]]]'>In the present ease, the Commonwealth proposes to construct a waterworks at its Selinsgrove institution. To that end, the Commonwealth is to give to the authority land now owned, or subsequently to be acquired, upon which the latter shall construct the waterworks with money borrowed by it. The land, with the completed waterworks and other improvements thereon, is then to be leased to the Commonwealth for a term of 30 years, at an annual rental calculated to pay the operating expenses of the authority and the interest on its bonds, and to amortize the principal of the bonds. In addition to payment of the rental, the Commonwealth shall agree to provide for the maintenance, operation and repair of the waterworks. At the end of the term, and upon full payment of the stipulated rental, the Commonwealth shall acquire full title to the land and waterworks.</p>

We are not confronted with an ordinary expenditure, nor is it a ease in which the means of payment is provided at the time the obligation is incurred. The particular waterworks described in the record is but a single instance of a program of public works to which no limit has been set either by the act <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>or by the officers of the Commonwealth and the authority. It was stated at the bar of the court that the authority is expected to receive some $60,000,000, of which some $33,000,000 must be repaid. It is clear that the rentals to be paid by the Commonwealth for the various projects constitute the only contemplated source of revenue of the authority, apart from whatever self-liquidating projects may be undertaken. If the authority defaults, the bondholders may, under the act, compel it to enforce its agreements with the Commonwealth, and may take the property originally conveyed by the Commonwealth to the authority in payment of their claims. The engagement extends beyond the present biennium; no means of payment are presently provided; the purpose is to purchase a capital asset; and it in no way appears, nor can it be assumed, that there will be sufficient surplus revenues in this or future bienniums to meet the contemplated payments. Clearly, the Commonwealth is buying on credit and living beyond its means. The intention embodied in the constitutional restriction on debt was to preserve in the financial administration of the Commonwealth the principle of paying as it goes, subject to the specified, exceptions. The proposed leases violate that principle and therefore transgress both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution.</p>

Allegheny County Authority, <a href="/pa/316/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="316 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1158989" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0065-01">316 Pa. 65</a>, is. urged upon us as decisive in defendants’ favor. There, however, the proposed projects were self-liquidating. The revenue for construction was to come, not from the county, but from tolls collected from users of the projects, and the sole obligation imposed upon the county was for the maintenance, operation and repair of the projects. The county undertook to pay the costs of insurance and of lighting, sweeping, cleaning, and removing snow from structures and approaches. The maintenance agreement was in fact expressly sustained on the understanding that the costs of maintenance Avould <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>be well within the county’s annual current revenues, to which it was said the parties had agreed. No such agreement is shown here, nor is there any evidence to indicate that current revenues will be adequate to meet maintenance costs in the future. In view of the fact that the proposed expenditures are for capital purposes, upon which no limit has been placed, a future sufficiency of surplus current revenue may not be assumed. The Tranter case very plainly can afford no solace to defendants. It is suggested in their brief that some self-liquidating projects are contemplated under the present act.. In so far as such projects are permitted by the Tranter case, no valid objection to them could be founded upon section 4 of article IX. But it must be obvious that the nature of most of the projects envisaged excludes the possibility of self-liquidation. So far as those projects are concerned, the Tranter case offers no support.</p>

In this view of the matter, we have no doubt that a creation of indebtedness on the part of the Commonwealth in excess of the constitutional limitation is contemplated, and we therefore do not hesitate to enjoin the execution of the proposed leases, whereby such indebtedness will be incurred. It is the plain purpose of the act, and the agreements to be executed under it, to permit the Commonwealth to construct public works for which it is not now able to pay, and for which it cannot directly borrow. - The attempt is to evade the constitutional restriction on debt, and, since the method proposed is illegal, it must be struck down.

I join in their conclusion concerning self-liquidating projects, but I disagree with the majority’s conclusion as to the constitutionality of the act as it relates to the facts in this case, and it is to these that the majority opinion must be restricted. It can be extended no further for the court had no other facts before it. Giving to that opinion this effect, it divides projects under the act into two classes: self-liquidating projects wherein the State as such is not obligated to pay the cost under any guise, and other projects where the State as such makes payment of the liquidating cost in whole or part in some fashion. I do not assume that the majority at this time would object to the federal government presenting the State with a project free of charge.</p>

In that case, as here, capital assets were to be acquired by the State; in both cases the State’s property given to the respective authority was put in jeopardy for any default on the bonds. In the Tranter case the tolls and charges were to be used in liquidation of the bonded debt. To that extent it was self-liquidating but this was not the only source of payment. Here, in my judgment, the parallel between the Tranter case and the instant case is definitely established. For the county, in aid of the payment of the bonds through tolls definitely assumed payment of the cost of operation, repair, maintenance, insurance, lighting, sweeping, cleaning, policing, removing snow and ventilating tunnels, and other incidentals without limitation. With, for instance, thousands of automobiles using daily the Liberty Tubes, this cost will run into many, many thousands yearly, to say nothing of other contingencies. All of this in relief of the <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>bonded indebtedness. • It could not be otherwise unless we apply a rule hitherto unknown to business. The county by assuming to pay all the costs attendant on these projects, bridges, tunnels and roads in the Tranter case contributed that much money to the retirement of the bonded indebtedness. The Allegheny improvements were not self-liquidating projects. But this court sustained the assumption of those charges by the county though they arise regularly every year and extend far into the future (1950) and indirectly affect the purchase of a capital asset. Why then may not the State assume to pay a rental charge over a period of thirty years?</p>

To assume that it will do so is simply to seek a means to strike down legislation. The Commonwealth is entitled to the presumption that the sums provided by this lease were within current revenues. The obligations of the county in the Tranter case run to 1950. It is a heavy obligation, and one which the federal government may specifically enforce. I believed then, as I do now, that so long as these outlays do not exceed annual current revenues no debt within the constitutional sense is created. Petitioners having failed to demonstrate that in this case these expenditures would exceed current revenues that have been appropriated, the court is bound to presume that they are within them.</p>

If the answer is ‘yes,’ it is within the power of the council to enter into if it is, ‘together with other like expenses, within the limits of its [the city’s] current revenues.’ ” The court said further that “when a contract made by a municipal corporation pertains to its ordinary expenses, and is, together with other like expenses, within the limit of its current revenues, and such special taxes as it may legally and in good faith levy therefor, such contract does not constitute the incurring of an indebtedness within the meaning of the constitutional provision limiting the power of municipal corporations to contract debts.” The <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>lower court then added: “Our own Supreme Court has said, ‘This is a sound constitutional interpretation,’ and its reason must be apparent to all. The ordinary expenses, at least many of the ordinary expenses, must be incurred and paid, or the city cannot exist. It cannot be supposed that the framers of the Constitution intended to prevent municipalities from deriving the benefit that may accrue from favorable contracts for a term of years for supplying what must certainly be had, and must be otherwise provided for annually, at perhaps additional expense and inconvenience.

The State does not have to prove its solvency every time it incurs a financial obligation. To hold otherwise would be to assert that every time the State leases a liquor store or other building for a term of years and some taxpayer objects, the Commonwealth must go into court and prove that its current revenues and prospective revenues will be sufficient to meet the obligations incurred. A statement was made at bar, without contradiction, that the proposed rentals of the Selingsgrove project are not beyond the current revenues. It is a matter of official record in this Commonwealth that the rentals paid by this Commonwealth for the fiscal year, June 1, 1934, to May 31, 1935, for the rental of real estate was $894,297.79. This included rentals paid for the leasing of State Liquor Stores, this alone amounting to $466,231.06. The citation of these figures shows the absurdity of the contention that an annual rental ranging from $2,240 to $2,800 a year will be so far beyond the current revenues of the State as to amount to the incurring of a debt prohibited by article IX, section 4, of the Constitution.</p>

As in the case before us, bonds of the authority were to be issued to the federal government in the amount of the loan, and as security therefor the authority was authorized to pledge revenues from the projects. Property of the county, already devoted to public purposes, was to be conveyed to the authority for use in connection with the projects. The property held by the authority and the obligations issued by it were by the act exempted from taxation, and it was further provided that the authority should have no power to pledge the credit of or create any debt of the Commonwealth or any county or other municipality thereof. The act likewise stipulated that neither the Commonwealth nor any political subdivision thereof should diminish or impair the authority’s power to own and control its properties or to <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>levy and collect tolls, rents and other charges in connection therewith, so long as any of its obligations remained unpaid and until adequate provision was made by law for the protection of persons advancing money upon these obligations. After the cost of all of the projects and improvements had been fully paid, the properties which had been conveyed to the authority, together with the improvements thereon, were to revert to and become the property of the county, -without cost to the county. The only difference between the arrangement in that case and the one in the present case, in no way affords a valid reason for arriving at a diametrically opposite result. The projects there proposed were to be self-liquidating — i. e., the bonds of the authority were to be paid out of revenues collected from the users of the improved facilities. In the case before us, while some of the projects are to .be self-liquidating, others, it is contemplated, will be paid for, at least in part, by rentals from the Commonwealth.

A further obligation will arise from the promise to maintain the waterworks. It was stated at the bar of the court, without contradiction, that the revenues of the Commonwealth in the present biennium will exceed expected revenue already appropriated by some fourteen millions of dollars.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a>

In that case we said, at page 60, speaking of the validity, under section 4, of tax-anticipation notes payable out of current revenues: “The prohibited mischief was the accumulation of a state debt (subject to the $1,000,000 leeway for deficiency in revenue) by expenditures in excess of current biennial revenue. Unless a challenged debt is within that prohibition, it is permitted. The creation of these notes for payment out of current revenue adds nothing to the state debt as defined.” Since City of Erie’s App., <a href="/pa/91/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="91 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="487742" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0398-01">91 Pa. 398</a>, it has been settled that a contract of a municipality which is within the current revenues of the municipality does not constitute a debt within the meaning of the constitutional restrictions thereon, it was there said, at page 403: “If the contracts and engagements of municipal corporations do not overreach their current revenues, no objections can lawfully be made to them, however great the indebtedness of such municipalities may be; for in such case their engagements do not extend beyond their present means of payment, and so no debt is created.” In Athens Nat.

A long-term obligation of a municipality, payable in periodic installments, is not a debt within the meaning of the constitutional provisions relating thereto where the amount of the periodic payments is clearly within the municipality’s ability to pay from current revenues: Wade v.

Such an obligation is wholly in accord with the “pay-as-you-go” principle, the preservation of which in the financial administration of the Commonwealth is said to be the purpose of the limitation on debt. There could be no objection to an obligation the payment of which was provided for when the obligation was incurred, or which was restricted to the current revenues available at the time payment fell due.</p>

The proposed annual rental to be paid by the Commonwealth for the waterworks here described is not to exceed $2,800 at any time during the term. It would be futile to say that this rental, or in fact the maximum total rental for the life of the lease ($75,600), could not be met out of the current revenues of the Commonwealth, particularly when it is remembered that the surplus unappropriated revenues of the present biennium should amount to fourteen millions of dollars.</p>
    <p id="b518-5" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[253,890,1154,1131]]]'>It would seem equally fair and more reasonable to anticipate that funds will be on hand in current revenues of future years to meet the payments required, as to suppose there will be no such adequate revenues. To predicate the decision of this case upon that conclusion, which involves rather a fiscal than a legal question, is to disregard the common experience of past years during which the current revenues of the Commonwealth have enabled it, not only to pay its ordinary governmental expenses, but in addition thereto, as it is of common knowledge, to make grants in sums aggregating millions each biennium to worthy and needing hospitals, schools, colleges and charitable institutions. Moreover, it should be taken into account that included within the term “ordinary governmental expenses” (See Com. ex rel. v. Liveright, <a href="/pa/308/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="308 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1140242" data-case-paths="/pa/308/0035-01">308 Pa. 35</a>, 66) are large sums for rental of offices, buildings, and properties necessary to house the activities and operation of the state government and its agencies. The buildings to be erected as projects under this act will undoubtedly be a factor in assumption and relief of at least a portion of the rentals paid.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">2</a>

It was on that ground that an agreement of maintenance by the county was sustained in the Tranter case. It there appeared that the parties had agreed “that the cost to the county of performing such agreement will be well within its annual current revenues.” In reference thereto we stated, on page 89: “On that understanding we sustain the agreement [of maintenance]; the costs of operation, repairs and maintenance described above can never exceed the annual current revenues applicable thereto. . . .

The act provides a structure whereby the Commonwealth may enter into restricted undertakings within current revenues. To this extent it must be held valid.

To the extent that the contemplated payments are kept within the bounds of the current revenues available as the payments fall due, the Commonwealth is fully within the principle of paying as it goes. Where it does <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>not appear that an obligation incurred by a municipality can be met out of current revenues, the obligation must be considered a debt in the constitutional sense: Brown v.

This must be true regardless of the purpose for which the obligation was incurred. In those cases it was not shown that the amount of the periodic payments which the municipality contracted to make would in fact be within its current revenues, and, since that amount was in excess of the indebtedness authorized by the Constitution, the contract was invalid. Where, however, it is clear that the amount of the obligation is in fact within current revenues, or where it is reasonably thought to be so when the obligation is incurred (see Addyston-Steel Co. v. City of Corry, <a href="/pa/197/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="197 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="918666" data-case-paths="/pa/197/0041-01">197 Pa. 41</a>; Schilling v.

If it appears or is reasonably thought that the Commonwealth will have on hand thirty years hence available current revenue to the extent e. g. of $2,240, a promise now made to apply that revenue to the rental of this waterworks is not a debt within the constitutional sense since it is not beyond the Commonwealth’s ability to pay. The situation intended to be prevented by the restriction on the debt of the Commonwealth is that in which the Commonwealth, having promised to pay, has no available revenue with which to meet the payment <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>when it falls due. Accordingly, where it is reasonably certain at the time the obligation is incurred that the Commonwealth will have sufficient revenue to meet future payments as they become due, the vice of incurring indebtedness beyond available means of payment is not present. In the present case, it cannot be doubted that the Commonwealth will have sufficient available revenue to meet the payments stipulated. It follows that no debt is incurred, and the prohibition of section 4 of article IX is not transgressed.</p>
