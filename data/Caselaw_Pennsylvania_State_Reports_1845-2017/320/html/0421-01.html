This so-called income tax was designed to levy a tax on business associations, foreign and domestic, for the privilege of doing business in the State. It was intended to reach corporations doing business wholly within the State and those doing business partly within and partly without the State. The amount of the tax to be collected is measured by 6% of the net earnings or profits gained within the State during the year by the corporation. The structure of the act was intended to provide an equitable and comprehensive system whereby the tax base could be fairly ascertained. It is on its face a lawful measure.</p>
    <p id="b457-4" data-blocks='[["BL_457.8",457,[155,1236,1155,688]]]'>The tax is here assailed because, first, it violates section 1 of article IX of the Constitution: “All taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects”;, second, section 2 of article IX, and section 7 of article III, which prohibit laws exempting property from taxation; third, section 3 of article III forbidding laws containing more than one subject not clearly expressed in the title. It is also charged in connection with the first quoted section, and apart from it, that.the legislative method employed in ascertaining the tax base is unworkable and, if it can be put into operation, unequal and unfair results will be produced which will cause the assessed tax to be illegal and unfair.</p>

It contends that, in effect, the act imposes a graded income tax and that <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>the graduation of the tax follows from the process by which net income is determined; and that, if the tax is not graduated, the method of computing it or formula’s operation is not uniform when applied to corporations differently situated as respects the three factors which enter into the calculation of the net income allocated to operations within this State.</p>
    <p id="b460-4" data-blocks='[["BL_460.4",460,[256,731,1159,1285]]]'>Plaintiff has not pointed to a single provision of the act which would demonstrate a legislative intent to impose a graded income tax. The rate used, 6%, is the same for all corporations. The tax base to which this rate is to be applied is also identical. It is the net income attributable to this State. It certainly should be axiomatic that the same impost when applied to the same subject-matter does not make the tax graded simply because of the fact that one association, owning more of the particular taxable subject-matter than another, pays, on this account, a greater sum total of tax. Where <em>different </em>rates are legislatively imposed on varying amounts or quantities of the <em>same </em>tax base, then you have a graded tax that lacks uniformity under our Constitution. See Kelly v. Kalodner, <a href="/pa/320/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="320 Pa. 180" data-case-ids="1163597" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0180-01">320 Pa. 180</a>. To create a graded tax it is generally necessary that the rate itself be a variable factor even though the base may remain constant, or it may be that in particular cases such a tax may result because of intangible differentiations in subject-matter with the imposition of a different rate upon each of them. The impost which varies in levels of the tax base thus defined becomes graded and lacks uniformity under our Constitution. This is not a graduated income tax.</p>
    <p id="b460-5" data-blocks='[["BL_460.5",460,[255,2038,1152,373]],["BL_461.1",461,[130,345,1156,1247]]]'>The charge is then made that the method employed by the legislature is unworkable and that in its operation it will produce arbitrary and unjust results, rendering it discriminatory, illegal and violative of the constitutional provision relating to uniformity. This argument is addressed chiefly to that portion of the act which sets forth the method or formula for ascertaining the net income <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>arising in this State where the corporation does business both within and without the State. The formula in this act is a careful and equitable valuation of the various elements which contribute to and produce income. In the introduction of three factors — gross receipts, tangible assets and payroll — each essential which bears a direct relation to profits and income seems to have been considered. It is a matter of common knowledge that, depending upon the type of activity concerned, different corporations employ more or less of capital or labor. Thus certain corporations may have a large force of laborers or wage earners with consequently heavy payrolls but possibly little capital investment. Then there are corporations whose activities demand a heavy capital investment for operation but a small number of wage earners. Both these factors must be considered in the tax base, otherwise certain associations would be relieved of their proper share of the tax burden of the State. That the third factor is essential needs no discussion. That all three are important is shown by reported cases in this and other states and in the federal courts. The net result is that no association engaged in doing business within this State will escape the tax.</p>

Through many years and in varying situations, taxing authorities in many jurisdictions have used formulas for apportionment where the tax basis concerned corporations doing part of their business within and part without the State. It is not now open to question that a state has authority to levy a tax on the privilege of doing business measured by income accumulated within the state and that, as to corporations doing business within and without the state, the tax may be found by apportionment through a formula, such as here adopted, where its general effect produces uniformity of operation by using all the elements entering into the production of net income.

In these cases we separated some companies from the general mass for the purpose of taxation.

The corporations here excluded bear sufficient distinction in themselves to set them apart as a class and, if they may be held to be sufficiently distinctive for the purposes of levying a tax, they must also be held sufficiently distinctive for the purpose of excluding them from the larger class when the latter is subjected to tax. Classification under the Constitution is necessarily elastic; the use in this statute of the generic term “corporations” does not estop the legislature from delimiting this class by excluding certain types of associations. It cannot be seriously questioned that had the legislature chosen to enumerate particular classes of corporations, such as manufacturing corporations, transportation corporations, etc., and subjected them to the tax here in question, this would be upheld notwithstanding that the list did not embrace banks, insurance companies and the like. As we view it, the legislature has here employed the term “corporations” to cover all classes except those which they have specifically excluded.</p>

Germania Brewing Co., supra, the act under discussion made a class of all corporations except foreign insurance companies and banks and savings institutions. The opinion of Judge McPherson, adopted by this court in a Per Curiam opinion, stated at page 84, with respect to this classification, “we know of no constitutional objection thereto.” In Com. v. Provident Trust Co., <a href="/pa/287/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="287 Pa. 251" data-case-ids="1099602" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0251-01">287 Pa. 251</a>, the Emergency Profits Tax there under consideration similarly levied a tax on all corporations and it exempted building and loans and corporations required to pay a gross premiums tax (insurance companies). This court stated at page 258: “The whole scheme and purpose was to treat all corporations alike except those which for some special reason were required to pay more taxes than they should, or where <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>tlieir revenues • were not of a nature that they could rightfully be termed income.”</p>

For instance, the revenues of insurance companies can hardly be termed “income” within the meaning of the act. Their income (premiums) is in great measure required by law to be set aside as a reserve, and is not unconditionally available to its members. Moreover, insurance companies are subject to a gross premiums tax. Building and loans, and the other so-called exempt associations, are subject to their special forms of taxation. No doubt the legislature, in the exercise.of its discretion, deemed all of them sufficiently affected with a public interest to merit their exclusion from what might otherwise be a burdensome tax.</p>

Section 13 declares that the provisions of the act are severable and that the unconstitutionality of any of its provisions shall not affect others. It further states, “It is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that this act would have been adopted, had such unconstitutional provisions not been included herein.” If, therefore, the provision relating to exemption should be held unconstitutional, the result would be that the act would have to be read as if this provision were not contained therein, and the nontaxables would then become part of the taxable class. This follows not alone from the provisions of the act but from what we have previously stated when confronted with a similar constitutional objection: see Com. v. Germania Brewing Co., supra, at page 85; Bagley Co. v. Cameron, <a href="/pa/282/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="282 Pa. 84" data-case-ids="1088385" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0084-01">282 Pa. 84</a>.
