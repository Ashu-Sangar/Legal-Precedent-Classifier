Plaintiff lives in Warren County and the insured property was located there. Defendant is a domestic corporation located and having its headquarters in Clarion County; no office or place of business was maintained in Warren County, nor were there any agents, officers or directors in the latter county. Neither before nor after the issuance of the summons in this case did defendant transact any of its business in Warren County. The summons was served by the sheriff of Clarion County, <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>deputized for the purpose by the sheriff of Warren County. In accordance with the provisions of the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, defendant entered an appearance de bene esse and filed its petition raising the question of the court’s jurisdiction. A rule to show cause why the service of the summons.and the return of service should not be set aside was granted and subsequently discharged. Defendant then took the present appeal.</p>

This common law rule has in many instances been modified by statute, and the changes that have been made vary with the nature of the corporation (i. e., foreign or domestic), the kind of business transacted, the geographical extent and location of that business, and the nature of the cause of action sued upon. As the procedure in the instant case conflicts with the common law rule as to suits against corporations, it must depend on statutory justification.</p>

L. 318 (supplemented and amended by the Acts of April 8,1868, P. L. 70, and May 13, 1889, P. L. 198, in respects not here material). By virtue of the provisions therein contained, the insured was empowered to bring suit in the courts of the county in which the insured property was located. The reason for the passage of the <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>statute was pointed out by Mr. Justice Sterrett in Quinn v. Fidelity Beneficial Assn., <a href="/pa/100/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="100 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="498431" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0382-01">100 Pa. 382</a>, at page 384, where it is said that, “prior to the passage of that act, the class of suitors, intended to be benefited thereby, was obliged to seek redress in the courts of the county where the insurance companies might be located. This was generally attended with great inconvenience and expense in procuring testimony and securing the attendance of witnesses at points often very remote from their homes and the locality of the loss. In view of these and other considerations, and for the purpose of providing a suitable remedy, the Act of 1857 was doubtless passed.” If that statute is still in force the court below had jurisdiction of the present cause of action. Whether or not it is still in force involves an examination of the provisions of the Insurance Company Law of May 17, 1921, P. L. 682, which in express terms purported to repeal absolutely the Acts of 1857, 1868 and 1889, supra. But by section 344 of the Act of 1921, supra, the legislature apparently intended to preserve and continue the jurisdiction which had been existent since 1857. In Spector v. Northwestern F. &amp; M. Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/285/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="285 Pa. 464" data-case-ids="1095098" data-case-paths="/pa/285/0464-01">285 Pa. 464</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=132%20A.%20531" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="132 A. 531">132 A. 531</a>, we held this section unconstitutional in so far as it authorized service on an insurance company by directing process to the sheriff of another county. The section clearly offended article III, section 3, of the Constitution for the reason that there was nothing in the title of the act giving notice of anything contained therein with respect to service of process in suits against insurance companies. Nor can it be said that although the section is invalid in so far as it provided for service of process, it is nevertheless constitutional as a jurisdictional measure. Just as the title of the act gives no notice with respect to service of process, likewise there is no provision in the title with respect to the jurisdiction of the courts of common pleas in actions against insurance companies. “It will be observed that nothing is said as to actions on insurance policies, or the service of proc<a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>ess therein”: Spector v. Northwestern F. &amp; M. Ins. Co., supra, at page 469. It follows that in so far as section 344 attempts to define the jurisdiction of the courts of common pleas in actions against insurance companies, it is unconstitutional. It does not follow, however, that the salutary jurisdiction which had existed since 1857 was, through the inadvertence of the legislature in formulating the title to the act, lost and destroyed. It was the clear intention of the law-making body to preserve in the Act of May 17,1921, a well-established and long-existent jurisdiction, and though section 344 of that act falls for the reason stated, there are principles of construction which warrant this court’s giving effect to that intention.</p>

This follows inevitably from the fact that in the eyes of the law it never came into existence. Never having come into existence, it could have no effect. The rule that an unconstitutional enactment will not by mere implication repeal a preexistent valid law is well established: Frost v. Corporation Commission., <a href="/us/278/0515-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="278 U.S. 515" data-case-ids="3905021" data-case-paths="/us/278/0515-01">278 U. S. 515</a>; The People v.

Nor does the fact that the later invalid statute contains a clause repealing all prior inconsistent legislation work a change in the result: State v. Blend, <a href="/ind/121/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="121 Ind. 514" data-case-ids="1376642" data-case-paths="/ind/121/0514-01">121 Ind. 514</a>; Sullivan v.

The only question is whether where, as here, an act expressly repeals another act and provides a substitute for the act repealed and the substitute is found unconstitutional, is the other act so expressly repealed to be judicially accepted as repealed. Such a construction is not warranted unless it clearly <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>appears that the legislature would have passed the repealing clauses even if it had not provided a substitute for the acts repealed. Not only was there no such intention on the part of the legislature in the present case, but it is apparent that exactly the opposite was intended. The precise question now being discussed/has not heretofore been passed upon by this court. However, other courts have enunciated the principle that a repealing clause expressly repealing a prior statute is itself ineffective where the substitute for the prior statute provided in the repealing statute is unconstitutional, and where it does not appear that the legislature would have enacted the repealing clause without providing a substitute for the act repealed: Rosenfield v.

Edmondson, 89 Ohio State 351; State v. Groom, 91 Ohio State 1; Portland v. Coffey, 67 Oregon 507. There is no doubt that the legislature in enacting section 344 of the Act of 1921 intended to preserve to courts of counties in which insured properties were located the jurisdiction in insurance cases created by the Act of 1857. It is a legitimate inference that the Act of 1857 would not have been repealed by the Act of 1921 if the legislature had known that section 344 of that act would be declared invalid for defect in the title of the act.</p>

The <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>severability clause cannot save the appropriate repealing sections if it is clearly apparent that they would not have been inserted had the legislature known that section 344 was invalid, even though there is an apparent legislative expression to the contrary.
