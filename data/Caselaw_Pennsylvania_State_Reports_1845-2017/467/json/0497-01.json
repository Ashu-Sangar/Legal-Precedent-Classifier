Commonwealth v. Alston, 456 Pa. 128, 131, 317 A.2d 241, 243 (1974). This Court has previously held that a confession can be rendered involuntary not necessarily as a result of overbearing police conduct but rather by an appellant\u2019s own condition. Commonwealth v. Ritter, 462 Pa. 214, 340 A. 2d 433 (1975). In Ritter, a confession was held to be involuntary in that the \u201cappellant was in no condition to knowingly and voluntarily confess . . . [since he was] ... in dire need of psychiatric help and exhausted.\u201d 340 A.2d at 434. In this case, the evidence reveals that appellant was in great pain when he was questioned by the police and that less than an hour later he was unable to respond to a doctor\u2019s attempts to communicate with him. In fact the doctor testified that appellant did not respond to the sewing of appellant\u2019s wound which indicated the presence of overriding and significant pain.\nI must dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion. It is clear from the facts that appellant\u2019s will was overcome by his physical condition. Therefore, it cannot be said that appellant voluntarily gave the statement or voluntarily waived his Miranda rights.\nROBERTS, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.",
