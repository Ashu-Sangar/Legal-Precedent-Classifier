An appeal was taken to the Superior Court which affirmed the judgment of sentence per curiam. We now grant allocatur to consider the validity of the attack upon the constitutionality of the statute.\nOur recent decision in Commonwealth v. MacDonald, 464 Pa. 435, 347 A.2d 290 (1975) is equally applicable here. We now hold that section 18 P.S. \u00a7 4524(a) is unconstitutional. Accordingly, the judgment of sentence is reversed and appellant is discharged.\nJONES, C. J., dissents.\nThe sentence was conditioned upon payment of cost of prosecution and $2,000.00 fine and further, that during such period Krasner refrain from the sale or distribution of any literature within the geographical confines of the 44th Judicial District.",
