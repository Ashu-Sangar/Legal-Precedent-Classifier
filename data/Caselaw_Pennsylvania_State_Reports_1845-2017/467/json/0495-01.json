The decree states:\n\u201c[I]t is hereby decreed and ordered that the time for appeal from probate of the will and two codicils of [Mary L. Woolman] ... be and it hereby is limited to September 5, 1975, except in the case of Henry N. Woolman, Jr., where it is limited to September 12, 1975.\u201d\nSee 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 908(a) (1975).\nAppellants Henry III and Glenn filed an appeal from probate of the will on September 12, 1975. The executrix, Helen R. Murr, filed preliminary objections to the appeal stating that the time for appeal by Henry III and Glenn had expired on September 5, 1975. Appellants filed no answer to the preliminary objections, see Montg. Co. Orph.Ct.R. 32.1. Instead, they appealed the amended decree to this Court.\nThe appeal is dismissed as premature. Unless the orphans\u2019 court sustains the preliminary objections, which have not yet been disposed of, appellants have neither suffered any prejudice nor been put out of court.\nAppeal dismissed.
