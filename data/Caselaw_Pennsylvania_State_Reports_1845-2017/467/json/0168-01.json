        "text": "OPINION\nNIX, Justice.\nAppellant, Helen Boone, was indicted for murder in the stabbing death of one Donna Stocker and subsequently convicted by a jury of voluntary manslaughter. Post-trial motions were denied and a sentence of 3% to 10 years imprisonment was imposed. This direct appeal followed.\nInitially, appellant alleges as error the suppression court\u2019s failure to suppress all written and oral statements made by appellant.\nOur responsibility upon review is to determine whether the record supports the factual findings of the lower court and the legitimacy of the inferences and legal conclusions drawn therefrom. Commonwealth v. Bundy, 458 Pa. 240, 328 A.2d 517 (1974); Commonwealth v. Stafford, 451 Pa. 95, 101, 301 A.2d 600, 604 (1974). Furthermore, we are to consider only the evidence of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and that portion of the testimony offered by the defendant which is uncontradicted. See generally Commonwealth v. Goodwin, 460 Pa. 516, 333 A.2d 892 (1975); Commonwealth v. Bundy, supra.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established that as a result of statements by appellant\u2019s estranged husband, Ms. Boone was picked up for questioning at approximately 9:30 P.M., April 16, 1973. Police Officer Merrick, who had not up to that point participated in the investigation, was assigned the task of transporting appellant to police headquarters. Merrick testified that at this particular time, he was unaware appellant was a suspect and believed he was merely transporting a witness. Shortly after Ms. Boone entered the car, a radio dispatch directed Merrick to meet a police wagon. At this point the following conversation occurred.\n\u201cWhile I was sitting waiting for the wagon to arrive, Helen Boone asked me, she said, \u2018Do you know what happened?\u2019 or, did I hear anything about what happened. I said \u2018No.\u2019 She said, \u2018Where are you taking me?\u2019 I said, T was told to take you to the P.A.B. Homicide Division.\u2019\nAt this time she stated to me, \u2018Then my husband\u2019s girlfriend I stabbed must have died.\u2019 . . . She continued; she stated that she had gone to her husband\u2019s home, that she was attacked by his girlfriend, and she stabbed her, and they left.\u201d\nAppellant was then handcuffed, transferred to another vehicle and taken to Police Headquarters where she arrived at 10:30 P.M. At 11:00 P.M., Ms. Boone was given her Miranda warnings and repeated the inculpatory statement. The statement was reduced to writing and signed by appellant. Fifteen minutes later, the same officer returned to clarify part of the statement. This interview lasted approximately one hour wherein appellant stated further that she did not believe decedent was going to stab her nor was there a struggle when appellant grabbed the weapon from the decedent\u2019s hand. The second written statement was completed and signed at 7:45 A.M. of the morning after her arrest.\nAppellant first argues that she was in police custody upon entering the patrol car and therefore Miranda warnings should have been given to her at that time. She thus contends that the oral statements made to the officer in the police vehicle should have been suppressed and were improperly introduced against her at trial. Accepting arguendo the fact that she was in custody when she first entered Merrick\u2019s vehicle, this fact would not be helpful to appellant\u2019s present position. Under the circumstances it is clear that these statements were not as a result of custodial interrogation but rather were voluntary and unsolicited comments. Under such circumstances Miranda warnings were not required to be given.\nIt is, however, only that questioning which is interrogation initiated by law enforcement officers which calls for Miranda warnings. Miranda v. Arizona, supra, 384 U.S. 436, at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602 at 1612, 16 L. Ed.2d 694. As this Court held in Commonwealth v. Simala, supra, 434 Pa. 219 at 226, 252 A.2d 575 at 578: \u201c[I]t is not simply custody plus \u2018questioning,\u2019 as such, which calls for the Miranda safeguards but custody plus police conduct . . . calculated to, expected to, or likely to, evoke admissions.\u201d The rationale behind this holding is found in Miranda, where the Court stated: \u201cConfessions remain a proper element in law enforcement. , . . The fundamental import of the privilege , . . is not whether [an individual] is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit of warnings and counsel, but whether he can be interrogated. There is no requirement that the police stop a person who enters a police station and states that he wishes to confess to a crime. . . . Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment. . . . \u201d Miranda v. Arizona, supra at 478,86S.Ct.at 1630 (emphasisadded).\nClearly, \u201cany question likely to or expected to elicit a confession constitutes \u2018interrogation\u2019 under Miranda. . \u201d Commonwealth v. Simala, supra at 227, 252 A.2d at 579. Accord, Commonwealth v. Mercier, 451 Pa. 211, 214, 302 A.2d 337, 339 (1973). But \u201c[a]ny statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence.\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, supra at 478, 86 S.Ct. at 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. Commonwealth v. Yount, 455 Pa. 303, 309, 314 A.2d 242, 245 (1974).\nAppellant next claims that subsequent incriminating statements were made as a direct result of these alleged \u201cinadmissible in-custody, prewarning\u201d remarks and must be suppressed as \u201cfruits of the poisonous tree.\u201d However, our disposition of the first issue is also dispositive of this claim.\nIt is next urged that all statements after the first written statement were inadmissible because of an unnecessary delay between the time of arrest and arraignment.\nAppellant concedes that the period of time that transpired between her arrival at Police Headquarters and the completion of her initial statement was not sufficient to constitute an unnecessary delay as that term has been defined under our caselaw. She does, however, contend that the further incriminating facts elicited during the subsequent interrogation which resulted in a second written statement and a tape recording of that statement, did offend Rule 118 (now Rule 130) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure.\nThe weakness of the argument is that the record demonstrates that she made all of her incriminatory statements within the first 2% hours after her arrival at police headquarters. While it is true that the entire interrogation process exceeded 20 hours, no additional incriminating information was elicited after the first 2% hours.\nIn all of the cases following our decision in Futch we have never considered a period of time of 2% hours as being offensive to the requirement of a speedy arraingment. While we have said the length of time itself is not necessarily determinative, Commonwealth v. Blagman, 458 Pa. 431, 326 A.2d 296 (1974); Commonwealth v. Tingle, 451 Pa. 241, 301 A.2d 701 (1973), a short interval such as the one in this instance, is indicative of the fact that there was not a nexus between the time that expired and the resultant admissions.\nFurthermore, it is immaterial from a Futch doctrine standpoint that the interrogation continued after the 2% hour period. Since the information obtained during the subsequent period was merely repetitious, the appellant was not prejudiced. Commonwealth v. Davis, 460 Pa. 644, 334 A.2d 275 (1975); Commonwealth v. Rowe, 459 Pa. 163, 327 A.2d 358 (1974). In absence of prejudice to the accused, there is no justification for the imposition of the exclusionary rule of Futch.\nFurther appellant contends that her physical and mental condition rendered her statements involuntary. After reviewing the totality of the circumstances to determine the voluntariness of the confession, we find this contention unsupported. The detective who conducted the interrogation testified that appellant appeared alert at all times, spoke clearly, and was willing to answer questions. She was offered food and drink, and given several opportunities to use the lavatory and rest. Appellant received her Miranda warnings prior to the commencement of the custodial interrogation and a second time during the course of it. At neither time did she request assistance of counsel or decline to speak with the officers.\nWhile it is uncontradicted that Ms. Boone had a large abscess on her left arm, the detective testified that appellant did not request medical attention. Additionally, her signed formal statement admits that no in-custody requests were denied. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the Commonwealth has met its burden of proving an intelligent and voluntary waiver. Commonwealth v. Goodwin, supra; Commonwealth v. Fogan, 449 Pa. 552, 296 A.2d 755 (1972).\nSimilarly, the numerous assignments of trial errors are devoid of merit. Appellant first urges that defense counsel was improperly prohibited from cross-examining the medical examiner as to decedent\u2019s use of drugs. We disagree. On cross-examination the doctor was asked to read that portion of the post mortem report which indicated the presence of barbiturates in decedent\u2019s blood. There had been no testimony of any drug use during the prosecution\u2019s case. Moreover, it was unquestioned that decedent died of stab wounds inflicted by this appellant. Appellant\u2019s intended use of the report was to establish a defense; that her presence at the scene stemmed from her concern for her children\u2019s contact with a drug user.\nThis was clearly beyond the scope of direct examination and the prosecution\u2019s objection was properly sustained. See Commonwealth v. Schmidt, 437 Pa. 563, 263 A.2d 382 (1970). Furthermore, this ruling did not preclude the presentation of such evidence during the defense case, which appellant failed to do.\nSecond, it is asserted that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the \u201cDella Penna Club\u201d while cross-examining Ms. Boone constituted prejudicial error because it might have inflamed the jurors. This reference occurred during cross-examination of appellant with reference to a conversation she had with' her sister shortly before the stabbing. We fail to find any prej udice to appellant.\nFirst, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the jurors were aware of the reputation of the club. And even more importantly, the testimony indicated that appellant did not frequent the club and in fact admonished her sister for going there. At best this was a vague, fleeting reference which would hardly have produced the effect suggested by appellant. See Commonwealth v. Riley, 459 Pa. 35, 326 A.2d 400 (1974); Commonwealth v. Goosby, 450 Pa. 609, 301 A.2d 673 (1973).\nAppellant next cites as error the reading to the jury of the officer\u2019s notes of the interrogation. It is argued that this should not have been permitted because it was admittedly not a verbatim record of what was said. This specific objection was not raised at trial and is therefore waived.\nCommonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974); Commonwealth v. Ehly, 457 Pa. 225, 228-29, 319 A.2d 167 (1974).\nAppellant charges it was error to overrule her motion for a directed verdict where the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established self-defense. To the contrary, the record clearly indicates otherwise. In passing upon such a motion, the test is whether viewing all the evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, a jury could possibly find the defendant guilty as charged. All evidence actually received is to be considered without regard for the validity of the evidentiary rulings. Commonwealth v. Fostar, 455 Pa. 216, 317 A.2d 188 (1974); Commonwealth v. Pride, 450 Pa. 557, 301 A.2d 582 (1973). The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence showed 1) decedent died of multiple stab wounds of the chest, back, arms and shoulder; 2) appellant\u2019s own inculpatory statements indicated she did not believe decedent would stab her and there was no struggle when appellant gained possession of the weapon; and 3) a witness\u2019 testimony that decedent appeared to be backing away when appellant approached the victim. Taken in concert, the evidence obviously provided a basis for a jury\u2019s finding of guilt and the motion was properly denied.\nThe next group of assignments of error relates to the adequacy of the court\u2019s charge to the jury in explaining inter alia bias of witnesses, the presumption of innocence, reasonable doubt, the voluntariness of the confession, and self defense. We find upon a thorough review of the charge in its totality, that all instructions on the law were sufficient and calculated to properly guide the jury in their deliberations.\n\u201c [3, 4] Additionally, the trial court is not required to accept the language of the point submitted by counsel but rather is free to select its own form of expression. The only issue is whether the area is adequately, accurately and clearly presented to the jury for their consideration. Compare, Commonwealth v. Nelson, 396 Pa. 359, 366, 152 A.2d 913, 917 (1959); Commonwealth v. Clanton, 395 Pa. 521, 526, 151 A.2d 88, 91 (1959).\u201d\nCommonwealth v. McComb, 462 Pa. 504, 509, 341 A.2d 496, 498 (1975).\nSee also, Commonwealth v. Rose, 449 Pa. 608, 297 A.2d 122 (1972).\nWe also find the court correctly refused to charge the jury on decedent\u2019s reputation for violence. Appellant testified that due to one specific incident, John Boone had called the decedent a \u201cbarroom brawler\u201d. Appellant\u2019s daughter also testified that decedent was \u201cmean\u201d and often hit her own children. However, reputation evidence is established by testimony of the community opinion of the individual in question, not through specific acts or mere rumor. See generally V Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 1609, 1611-1612 at 580, 583-584 (Chadbourn Ed. 1974).\nAppellant complains that the court erred in failing to recharge the jury as to self-defense during the further instructions that were given at the jury\u2019s request. It is clear that the judge confined this charge to the precise questions posed by the jury. After the instruction the court inquired of the jury whether the information supplied satisfied their request and they responded in the affirmative. As we noted in Commonwealth v. McNeil, 461 Pa. 709, 337 A.2d 840 (1975), the trial court is not obligated to give further instructions beyond those requested by the jury.\nAppellant also contends that the verdict was not a product of a free and impartial deliberation. During the course of the jury deliberations an altercation erupted among several of the jurors. The court conferred with both counsel and all agreed that it would be inappropriate to discharge the jury at that time. The panel was then called in, admonished for their behavior and permitted to continue deliberating. Having failed to voice any objection at time of trial, appellant cannot now, for the first time, raise this objection. See Commonwealth v. Reid, 458 Pa. 357, 326 A.2d 267 (1974).\nThe final objection is that appellant was denied due process of law because she was given a minimum as well as maximum sentence, pursuant to Commonwealth v. Butler, 458 Pa. 289, 328 A.2d 851 (1974). This argument is predicated on a theory that Butler\u2019s application in this instance was tantamount to an ex post facto law. We decline to discuss the merits of this argument since appellant raised no objection during the sentencing proceedings and is therefore precluded from presenting this issue on appeal. See Commonwealth v. Piper, 458 Pa. 307, 328 A.2d 845 (1974) and cases cited therein.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nROBERTS, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which MANDERINO, J., joins.\n. Appellant and John Boone had been separated for approximately 14 months. The homicide occurred at the home which they owned as tenants by the entireties. The victim, Mr. Boone\u2019s girlfriend, had begun living there with him.\n. Commonwealth v. Futch, 447 Pa. 389, 290 A.2d 417 (1972).\n. The shortest periods of time that we have construed to be an unreasonable delay has been 5 hours in Commonwealth v. Bey, 462 Pa. 545, 341 A.2d 907 (1975); 5% hours in Commonwealth v. Barilak, 460 Pa. 449, 333 A.2d 859 (1975); 4 hours in Commonwealth v. Johnson, 459 Pa. 171, 327 A.2d 618 (1974).\n. In Commonwealth v. Rowe, 459 Pa. 163, 327 A.2d 358 (1974), approximately seven hours elapsed between the original admission and the final written statement. Here, the time period is practically identical.\n. Appellant also argued that she was psychologically coerced. A study of the record fails to provide any support for this claim.\n. Appellant presented testimony that decedent had been present on several occasions when the children visited Mr. Boone.\n. The Della Penna Club was the scene of a brutal murder of a young girl in the Kensington section of Philadelphia. That incident occurred in 1971 and this trial took place in 1973.\n. It should be mentioned that the panel had already returned to the jury room when defense counsel made the request for this instruction.\n. This decision was handed down 15 days prior to imposition of sentence in the instant matter.",

        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice\n(dissenting).\nI dissent. Although I agree that the first statement appellant gave to police was admissible, the subsequent statements made by appellant should have been ruled inadmissible as the product of an unreasonable delay between arrest and preliminary arraignment; Pa.R.Crim. P. 130, Commonwealth v. Futch, 447 Pa. 389, 290 A.2d 417 (1972); Commonwealth v. Rowe, 459 Pa. 163, 327 A.2d 358 (1974); Commonwealth v. Cherry, 457 Pa. 201, 321 A.2d 611 (1974); Commonwealth v. Dixon, 454 Pa. 444, 311 A.2d 613 (1973); Commonwealth v. Wayman, 454 Pa. 79, 309 A.2d 784 (1973); Commonwealth v. Dutton, 453 Pa. 547, 307 A.2d 238 (1973); Commonwealth v. Tingle, 451 Pa. 241,301 A.2d 701 (1973).\nBy 11:00 p. m. on April 16, 1973, appellant had signed a written inculpatory statement which had been properly obtained. Instead of taking appellant to preliminary arraignment without delay, as required by Pa.R.Crim.P. 130, the police attempted to elicit additional statements from appellant to \u201cclarify\u201d her original statement. A second written statement was completed and signed at 7:45 a. m. the following day. Thus, 22 hours after her arrest she had still not been arraigned. These unwarranted, unnecessary delays which produce \u201cclarifying\u201d statements in violation of Rule 130 and the cases decided thereunder cannot be tolerated.\nIn an attempt to justify its conclusion that the subsequent statements were properly admissible, the majority contradicts its own recitation of the facts. The opinion states that after the initial statement was given, the police sought to have appellant \u201cclarify\u201d her inculpatory recitation. These clarifications were apparently sufficiently important to be reduced to writing by the police, given to appellant to sign more than eight hours after her first statement was signed, and used by the prosecution at trial. The majority states however, \u201cSince the information obtained during the subsequent period was merely repetitious, the appellant was not prejudiced.\u201d I cannot join this equivocation. The facts of record indicate that the subsequent statements should have been suppressed.\nMANDERINO, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.",
