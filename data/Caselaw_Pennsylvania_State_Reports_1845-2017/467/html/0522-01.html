(Emphasis added.) The words 'as in the judgment of the Commission’ indicate to us that the Legislature recognized that only an administrative agency with broad remedial powers, exercising particular expertise, could cope effectively with the pervasive problem of unlawful discrimination. Accordingly, the Legislature vested in the Commission, quite properly, maximum flexibility <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>to remedy and hopefully eradicate the ‘evils’ of discrimination. Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, supra at § 2(a), 43 P.S. § 952(a) (Supp.1973).

    <p id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.4",560,[299,604,1154,477]]]'>In this case there is no question concerning the remedy itself; rather the issue is raised whether PHRC may order affirmative relief for persons who were not specifically named in the original complaint. Freeport argues that, when the original complaint is filed by an individual, PHRC may order such relief only for the individual or individuals named in the complaint. A brief review of the statutorily mandated procedure for PHRC handling of complaints disposes of this contention.</p>
    <p id="b560-5" data-blocks='[["BL_560.5",560,[286,1112,1162,1185]]]'>The Pennsylvania Human Relations Act contemplates an invarying three step procedure for handling complaints, regardless of source. A complaint may be filed by an individual, by the Attorney General or initiated by PHRC itself. PHRC must investigate all complaints that are filed. If the investigation reveals that there is probable cause to credit the allegations of the complaint, PHRC must give the respondent an opportunity to respond to those allegations at a preliminary hearing. If, after this opportunity for response has been given, there is still reason to believe that the complaint is valid, PHRC must attempt to conciliate the dispute. If conciliation fails, PHRC must hold a public hearing on the charges. After the public hearing, if the complaint is sustained, the Commission issues findings of fact and a final order “requiring such respondent to cease and desist from such unlawful discriminatory practice and to take such affirmative action including but not limited to hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employes, with or without backpay. . . .” Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, Act of October 27, 1955, P.L. 744, § 9, as amended, 43 P.S. § 959 (Supp.1975).</p>

      <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>Thus it can be seen that the Act mandates that every complaint, regardless of source, must be investigated, if thought to be valid, must be the subject of an attempt by PHRC to conciliate the dispute, and, if conciliation fails, must be the subject of public hearings and formal findings and orders by the Commission. Once the complaint is filed the procedure is uniform. Nothing in the Act limits PHRC’s power to investigate, conciliate or adjudicate depending upon the source of the complaint. Nothing in the Act limits the remedy which PHRC may order depending upon the source of the complaint.</p>

Although PHRC, under the Act, has the power to order such relief, a failure to inform a respondent concerning the scope of investigation and possible relief might vitiate an otherwise lawful exercise of PHRC’s authority. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. United States Steel Corp., </em>10 Pa.Cmwlth. 408, <a href="/citations/?q=311%20A.2d%20170" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="311 A.2d 170">311 A.2d 170</a> (1973). In this case, however, Freeport had ample notice not only that the investigation was to go beyond its discrimination against the named complainant, but itself supplied the names of persons who had been affected by the policy which was alleged to be discriminatory. As <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>Judge Rogers said in his concurring and dissenting opinion:</p>

Clearly, due process requires that employers have reasonable notice of the nature and extent of the charges against them, including in this kind of case, the identities of persons, not complainants, who may be included as objects of relief in the Commission’s order. However, I learn from the record that the school district here received ample notice that others than [complainant] were involved by (a) her complaint so alleging, which averment it denied, and (b) the fact that the respondent was requested to and did supply to Commission investigators prior to hearing the names and other facts concerning the cases of [the two other persons who were awarded backpay by the Commission].”</blockquote>
