In October, 1974, appellant was tried by a judge and jury and was found guilty of conspiracy and murder in the third degree. Post-trial motions were properly filed and denied by the court en banc. Appellant was sentenced to one and one-half to five years’ imprisonment on the murder conviction and received a suspended sentence on the conspiracy conviction. This appeal followed.</p>

    <p id="b396-5" data-blocks='[["BL_396.5",396,[318,1137,1155,426]]]'>The facts surrounding the confession are as follows. On May 8, 1974, Oscar Ligón was accosted and beaten by John Yates, Stanley Yates, his brother, and two other individuals. The reason behind the attack was a previous altercation between the decedent and appellant’s sister, Ophilia Yates. The beating was observed by Dora Johnson, the owner of the candy store where the beating took place.</p>

Appellant arrived at the Police Administration Building at approximately 7:10 a. m. Appellant was alone between 7:10 and 7:20 a. m., at which time his interrogation began. Between 7:20 a. m. and 8:30 a. m., appellant was warned of his <em>Miranda, </em>rights, which he waived, and' he was then confronted with the statement of Dora Johnson» the witness to the beating. ’ After being told of the Johnson statement, appellant admitted his involvement in the beating and he signed a handprinted statement admitting <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>his involvement at approximately 8:40 a. m. The police officer who conducted the interrogation and obtained the written confession testified that no physical threats or punishment were inflicted on appellant to obtain the confession and that appellant appeared alert, coherent and responsive during the interrogation. Based on the above facts, we are of the opinion that appellant’s confession was prompted by his being confronted with an eyewitness statement, and not by police coercion. See <em>Commonwealth v.

Further, defense counsel would testify that he attempted to reach appellant at the Police Administration Building at approximately 8:00 that morning, but was informed that appellant had already given an inculpatory statement.

If, in fact, there was a voluntary and considered judgment by the suspect to unburden his soul by discussing the incident with police officials there is no reason to believe consultation with counsel would stifle that desire. On the other hand, counsel’s presence would restrain the suspect who was motivated by fear, intimidation, ignorance, or unreasoned impulse, which is the objective <em>Miranda </em>has mandated us to seek. The very presence of counsel during custodial interrogation is a bulwark against the compulsion of the surroundings and provides a credible witness for the defense if there is a subsequent issue as to the circumstances surrounding the questioning.”</blockquote>
