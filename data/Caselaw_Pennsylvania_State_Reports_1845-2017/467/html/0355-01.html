Nirmaier, filed a complaint in equity seeking to enforce an oral agreement with the appellees, Keith L. Hamilton and Jean A. Hamilton concerning a sixty-three acre farm on which appellants lived. The trial court denied relief and this appeal followed.</p>

Nirmaier, the trial court found the following. Appellants had purchased the farm which is the subject of the controversy in 1969, and have lived there continuously since that time. In 1971, appellants were financially distressed and faced a mort<a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>gage foreclosure on their farm. A day or two before the scheduled sheriff’s sale, the appellants approached the appellees for assistance and appellees agreed to “bail . out” the appellants until the appellants “got on their financial feet again.” The parties agreed that the appellees would secure a mortgage loan of $12,500.00 for the purchase of the farm. The appellants agreed to pay all closing costs, taxes, and attorney’s fees connected with the purchase. The appellants also agreed to pay all taxes, insurance, and repairs on the property and to pay the appellees $168.00 per month to cover the necessary mortgage payments. It was further agreed that when the appellants were financially able, they would assume the mortgage in their own name and, at that time, appellees would deed the property to the appellants.</p>
    <p id="b389-4" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[160,1098,1153,483]]]'>Pursuant to the agreement of the parties, appellees purchased the property six days after the sheriff’s sale from a third party who had purchased the property at the sheriff’s sale. The appellees obtained the $12,500.00 mortgage in their name and appellants, as agreed paid all closing costs, taxes, and attorney’s fees. Since that time appellants have paid the $168.00 monthly payment to the appellees and have also paid for the taxes, insurance, and repairs on the property.</p>

In fact, the property had not been sold but it had been listed for sale by the appellees with a real estate broker. Upon learning these facts, appellants filed this complaint in equity seeking to enforce the oral agreement between the parties.</p>

Appellants contend that the oral agreement is enforceable in equity. They argue that the appellees “served as a conduit,” only, and “never wanted, expected, <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>or contracted to own the property.” Essentially, appellants argue that a trust relationship was established.
