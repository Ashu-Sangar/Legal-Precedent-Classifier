Ziel, Sr., deceased, must be set aside because of decedent’s alleged testamentary incapacity at the times when each was executed and the undue influence allegedly exerted on the decedent by Lucy W. Ziel, his sister and co-executrix of his estate, with whom decedent had been living for nearly four years prior to his death on June 24, 1972.</p>

He was survived by two sons, Oscar T. Ziel, Jr. and the contestant Harry K. Ziel, the appellant here, and the testator’s sisters, Lucy Ziel and Alice A. Ziel. Oscar, Jr. is a farmer in Allegheny County. Harry, a resident of California, is also a doctor. In 1968, the testator resigned from a staff position at Ohio Valley Hospital and retired from an active private practice in the McKees Rocks area of Allegheny County. He then went to live with his sisters, Lucy and Alice, two retired school teachers, in Crafton, Pennsylvania. He remained there until his death on June 24,1972.</p>

Under the terms of that instrument, the principal was to be divided into two equal shares, one for Lucy and one for Alice; each sister was to receive income from her share for life, with the right in the trustee to invade principal if necessary to provide for the welfare or comfortable support of either. Upon the death of each sister, her share of the trust estate was to be divided and paid over as follows: forty per cent to Harry K. Ziel (or his issue if he were deceased); forty per cent to Oscar T. Ziel, Jr. (or his issue if he were deceased) ; and the remaining twenty per cent to the testator’s grandchildren (children of Oscar T. Ziel, Jr.). The codicil of November 8, 1971, devised any real estate owned by the testator at the time of his death to Oscar T. Ziel, Jr. and his children (Oscar, Jr. to receive 50% thereof, and his children jointly the other 50%). By the codicil of March 18, 1972, Dr. Ziel added specific bequests of $25,000 to each of his two sons, Oscar, Jr. and Harry.</p>

He gave it as his opinion that Dr. Ziel was incapable of acting responsibly with respect to his property at that time, and that Dr. Ziel’s condition would progressively deteriorate, with recovery unlikely. Dr. Breathauer stated that on the occasions of four post-hospitalization visits to Dr. Ziel, the last of which was in December of 1969, Dr. Ziel was still confused but not totally disoriented.

Stressing this, contestant claims that his proof of testamentary incapacity amounts <em>a fortiori </em>to clear and convincing evidence of the weakened mental condition of Dr. Ziel.

Again, we cannot agree. Mr. Anton and Lucy Ziel testified that Dr. Ziel appointed Lucy as his attorney-in-fact because he knew other people his age who had made such arrangements and because the bank had complained that the signatures on his checks were increasingly less uniform. A confidential relationship in this sense exists whenever “the circumstances make it certain the parties do not deal on equal terms, but, on the one side there is an overmastering influence, or, on the other, weakness, dependence, or trust, justifiably reposed [for] in both [situations] an unfair advantage is possible.” <em>In re Estate of Button, <a href="/pa/459/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="459 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="481069" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0234-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/pa/459/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="459 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="481069" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0234-01">459 Pa. at 239</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="459 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="481069" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0234-01">328 A.2d at 483, n. 4</a>. It is true that we have said, as contestant notes, <em>Foster v.

Here, however, Lucy bcame his attorney-in-fact at Dr. Ziel’s instance and merely for his convenience. Moreover, Mr. Anton and others testified that Dr. Ziel was well aware of the extent of his property and was active in handling his business affairs. The hearing judge was entirely justified in concluding that contestant’s evidence does not demonstrate convincingly <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>that Dr. Ziel was subject to any overmastering influence by Lucy Ziel.</p>

With the first codicil, the testator’s real estate holdings, valued at $74,500, were withdrawn from the corpus of the trust from which Lucy and her sister were to derive income and were devised to Oscar Ziel, Jr. and his children. By the second codicil, the testator further removed $50,000 from the residuary estate which would comprise the corpus of the trust estate and specifically bequeathed it in equal shares to his sons, including the contestant. Thus, Harry’s share of his father’s estate was increased during this time by the $25,000 bequest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> None of this sequence <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>of events demonstrates any influence by Lucy, let alone a nefarious influence.

Catherine Bladel, a neighbor, testified that she occasionally exchanged greetings with Dr. Ziel and although he appeared a little confused at times, he was generally mentally alert. Mary Vito, who operated a neighborhood pharmacy, stated that the doctor often came into her store and she had noticed no change in his mental condition through 1971. John Daniels, Chief of the Crafton Police force, said that Lucy Ziel had requested that the police escort him back home whenever he wandered off on a walk, and that this had occurred five or six times over the years Dr. Ziel had lived in Crafton. Daniels’ only comment was, “It seems the man was a little confused. But he was always dressed neat and sharp.” Finally there was the testimony of Dr. Zeiler of the staff at Ohio Valley Hospital, where Dr. Ziel also had been a staff member. He explained that Dr. Ziel had been asked to move to honorary status because he was no longer able to handle his caseload. He did not, however, attribute the move to a decline in the doctor’s mental faculties.</p>
