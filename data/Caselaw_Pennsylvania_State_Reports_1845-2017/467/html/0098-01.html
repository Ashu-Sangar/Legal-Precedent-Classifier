The automatic weapon was apparently incapable of discharging a .22 caliber bullet.

Long was taken into custody shortly thereafter on the tenth floor of a high-rise building hiding inside a closet.

This is an overreading of <em>Commonwealth v. Roots, </em>supra, and <em>Commonwealth v. Rush, </em>supra. These decisions do not say that in order for a jury to reject a part of a defendant’s pretrial statement offered in evidence by the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth must offer evidence to rebut that portion of the statement. The sense of the above decisions is that in order to meet its burden of proof, the Commonwealth’s evidence apart from that which may be disbelieved by the jury must be sufficient in law to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We are satisfied this is such a case. The part of Long’s statement that establishes Jones fired shots at Harrison from a .25 caliber gun was not crucial to the Commonwealth’s case. With this particular portion of Long’s statement as.to the caliber of the gun eliminated from the Commonwealth’s proof, the evidence remaining was sufficient to warrant a jury in finding Jones shot Harrison and Long participated as an aider and abettor.</p>

Without the benefit of the pathologist’s finding that death had been caused by a .22 caliber bullet, appellant described the weapon he observed which in fact was the weapon recovered by the police at the time of Jones’ arrest. This evidence was strengthened by appellant’s statement that the revolver used was placed by Jones in his waistband after the shooting. When arrested the .25 caliber pistol Was recovered from Jones’ waistband. Under these facts I can find no basis for the majority’s position that a jury should be permitted to ignore not only the appellant’s statement, but also the evidence presented by the Commonwealth as to the caliber of the gun fired. Nothing in the record connects appellant with the .22 caliber weapon which caused the victim’s death. I therefore dissent.</p>
