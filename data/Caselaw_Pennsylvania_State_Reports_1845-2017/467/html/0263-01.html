A sentence of seven and one-half to fifteen years was imposed. Appointed counsel, who represented appellant at trial, now seeks to withdraw from further representation. We must determine whether appointed counsel’s motion to withdraw as counsel for the appellant satisfies the requirements of <em>Anders v.

Counsel has submitted a brief discussing the only tenable issue preserved on this record, <em>L e., </em>the sufficiency of the evidence. In accordance with <em>Anders, Greer </em>and <em>Baker, </em>supra, counsel has presented an advocate’s brief. This brief has been forwarded to his client in accordance with our case law. Counsel has fully notified appellant of the order he is seeking and of appellant’s right to maintain this appeal without counsel or with new counsel, as required by <em>Commonwealth v.
