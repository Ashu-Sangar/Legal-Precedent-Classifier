A review of the record discloses that at the suppression hearing Detective Porter testified for the Commonwealth that when he arrested appellant and the other suspects, he smelled an odor which he believed to be marijuana but did not observe any of the individuals smoking marijuana. Porter further testified that he was acquainted with the effects of marijuana but appellant exhibited none of the usual symptoms. Rather, the detective stated that Culberson appeared normal, alert and responsive to questions. After both the oral and written statements, appellant informed Porter that the confession was freely given and he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. This evidence supports the factual findings of the suppression court and we therefore conclude that the confession was voluntarily given and admissible at trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> See <em>Commonwealth v.

We believe this reliance is misplaced. <em>Carter, supra </em>involved the question of the prosecution’s duty to make available to the defense the names of all material eyewitnesses, including confidential informants. In that case, an informant had introduced an undercover agent to appellant and purchased drugs for the agent. In reversing the conviction, this Court held that since the informer was the only material eyewitness to the transaction besides the police and the accused, and the defense consisted solely of appellant’s claim of mistaken identity, the privilege of anonymity must yield. Under those specific facts, the Court believed the disclosure of the informant’s identity would be relevant and helpful to the defense and was essential to a fair determination of the cause. <em>Carter, supra </em>at 59, <a href="/citations/?q=233%20A.2d%20284" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="233 A.2d 284">233 A.2d 284</a>.
