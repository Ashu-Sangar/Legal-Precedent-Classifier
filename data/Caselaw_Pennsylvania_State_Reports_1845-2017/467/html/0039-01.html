Bluntly, they impressed the Court as being ‘weirdos’ of the first degree and the Court felt that not only were they sublimely unfit for jury service but would also contaminate any jury of which they were a part. Several alternatives for dealing with this situation were available but the Court decided upon the option of granting two additional peremptory challenges to each side.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

If they could not have been challenged for cause defendant had the right under our rules and the statutes of the Commonwealth to have them on his jury. The trial court’s “option” is a thinly veiled technique by which to give the Commonwealth sufficient peremptory challenges to get the jury it wants, despite the existence of rules and statutes designed to assure fairness in this most important aspect of trial by jury. I cannot join an order which sanctions such a result.</p>
