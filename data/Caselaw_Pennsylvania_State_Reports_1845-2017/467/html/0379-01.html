    <p id="b419-5" data-blocks='[["BL_419.5",419,[178,1516,1150,313]]]'>We conclude that Alexander Sedmak, in writing the October 6 holographic paper, intended a testamentary gift to be given Ms. Portenar only in the event that he predeceased her. Accordingly, the decree of the court below is reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

The record discloses that an objection was made on behalf of decedent’s estate to the testimony by appellant herself on the grounds of her incompetency to so testify in support of her position under the Dead Man’s Act. An exception was also taken to the testimony of appellant’s sister; however, the basis of that objection was that the writing spoke for itself and therefore extrinsic evidence should not have been admitted. The three bank <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>account books referred to previously were entered as exhibits without objection and appellant’s 1969 will was admitted over objection on grounds of relevancy. The lower court opinion considered Zella Portenar’s testimony along with the other supporting extrinsic evidence presented stating: “Without specifically determining that the testimony of Zella Portenar is admissible, we have nevertheléss considered it in reaching our decision [that the writing is not testamentary], since it is insufficient in any event to allow probate of the writing in question.” <em>(Estate of George A.
