    <p id="b362-4" data-blocks='[["BL_362.4",362,[298,599,1154,526]]]'>The hostility between Joseph and Nassar was caused, in part, by the language of the instrument creating the trust. Article seventh makes no specific statement that the corpus of the trust is to be distributed to Nassar during the life of the trust. Joseph believed that Nassar was primarily the income beneficiary of the trust and that the corpus was to be distributed under the terms of the residuary clause of the will. As a consequence, he was extremely reluctant to invade the corpus of the trust for Nassar’s benefit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

He relies on both the language of article seventh which grants to the trustee the discretion to invade the corpus for his benefit and the example of an identical trust set up under article eighth for the benefit of his brother Randall. The trustee of that trust, decedent’s brother, within three years of the creation of the trust, distributed virtually the entire corpus to the person who, in Joseph’s view, was merely the “income beneficiary.”</p>

The record of this case clearly demon<a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>strates that Joseph and Nassar were hostile to one another. Joseph represented to the orphans’ court that he had been “harassed” by Nassar, that Nassar had called him a “liar and indicated that he was not doing what was right” and that Nassar had “made a great number and many unnecessary requests and rather foolish requests . . .” Joseph attacked Nassar’s motives and judgment several times at the hearing. Nassar, on his part, indicated that he believed that Joseph was not complying with either the terms of the trust or settlor’s intent. These feelings on both sides amount to much more than mere friction.</p>
    <p id="b364-5" data-blocks='[["BL_364.4",364,[278,912,1166,969]]]'>Moreover, the Nassar trust vests the trustee with broad discretion to invade corpus for Nassar’s benefit. Not only may the trustee invade corpus “to provide for the welfare, maintenance, support and education” of Nassar, but he is also empowered to “expend principal for the investment in any business or professional venture in which [Nassar] may wish to. participate, if same appears sound to [the trustee]The decision to invade Corpus for investment is in the trustee’s sole discretion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> This power under the trust, which requires much more than a mere “minister” as trustee, dictates that the trustee and the beneficiary have a good relationship with each other. Decedent apparently intended that the trustee act as a surrogate father, bringing his maturity and experience to bear on investment proposals made by his son. This intention is impossible of accomplishment when feelings of hostility obtain between the trustee and the beneficiary.</p>

      <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>All of this shows that had Joseph not resigned, the orphans’ court could have removed him without abusing its discretion. This is true despite the strong preference given trustees named by the settlor of a trust.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> In this case we are not concerned with the removal of a trustee. Rather, we are asked to review the orphans’ court’s selection of a successor trustee. If Joseph’s hostility has been passed on to Union or if Nassar has no confidence in Union, so that the appointment of Union will frustrate the purposes of the trust, the appointment of Union as successor trustee would be an abuse of discretion. It appears that each of these conditions exists.</p>
    <p id="b365-5" data-blocks='[["BL_365.4",365,[171,976,1156,1077]],["BL_366.1",366,[292,271,1157,476]]]'>The record indicates that Joseph relied on his personal friendship with trust officers at Union to persuade them to accept nomination as successor trustee. It is reasonable to assume that Union would give substantial weight to Joseph’s interpretation of the trust both because of his position as the resigning trustee and because of the friendly relations between Joseph and Union. Moreover, one of Union’s trust officers appeared in court and testified on Joseph’s behalf, in opposition to Nassar’s exceptions to the accounting, concerning both trustee’s and attorney’s fees to be paid out of the trust for services during Joseph’s trusteeship. This partisan activity, in opposition to the beneficiary’s interests, seems somewhat unusual in a successor trustee who is required to give its unswerving loyalty to that beneficiary. Even though the testimony was not a breach of the fiduciary’s duty of loyalty because Union had not yet been appointed, it is easy to understand that its willingness to take an active part in an adversary contest against the beneficiary’s interest might cause the beneficiary to <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>question its future performance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The record also reveals that Nassar wrote to Union before the hearing and informed it that he wished it not to accept nomination as successor trustee because he believed that they would have a conflict of interest as trustee for his trust and as trustee for the residuary trust. Despite this opposition by the beneficiary of the trust, and despite the appearance of the claimed conflict of interest, Union accepted appointment as trustee.</p>
    <p id="b366-4" data-blocks='[["BL_366.4",366,[293,780,1157,415]]]'>Given that this sort of hostility between the former trustee and Nassar interfered with the effective realization of decedent’s intent, it is not unreasonable to expect the same result under the same conditions of hostility between the successor trustee and the beneficiary. Therefore, it appears that the appointment of Union will interfere with accomplishment of the trust’s purposes and must be vacated.</p>
    <p id="b366-5" data-blocks='[["BL_366.5",366,[292,1250,1154,656]]]'>We turn now to a second issue in this case: Who are the proper parties to appear before the orphans’ court in a proceeding to appoint a successor trustee to replace Union. There are four possibilities: Joseph, Union, the guardian ad litem, and Nassar. Joseph, whose resignation as trustee was accepted effective December 31, 1974, is clearly out of this case. Union may not appear to suggest a successor trustee because of the present hostility between it and Nassar. If the chain of transmitted hostility and lack of confidence in the trustee is to be broken, the selection of a successor trustee to replace Union must be free of the taint of hostility.</p>
