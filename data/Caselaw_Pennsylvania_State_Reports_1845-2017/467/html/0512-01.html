Although the Commonwealth conceded at trial that Brown did not do the actual stabbing, it contended that he combined with Harold Roux, Herbert Pennington, Clenzo West, and Raymond McClendon to beat and rob Domingo Martinez, and that during the commission of these crimes, Martinez was fatally wounded by one of the conspirators. The Commonwealth presented the following evidence in support of that position. Roux, Pennington, West, McClendon and Brown were inside the Oxford Street Bar when Martinez entered to buy a six pack of beer and a pack of cigarettes. The cigarette machine was not functioning properly and Martinez complained to the bartender. Pennington went over to Martinez, told him to stop complaining and started to punch him in the face. West stopped the fighting saying, ‘Wait until he gets outside, you know, get a head.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Harold Roux, then standing about ten feet away from the scuffle, produced a knife and said, “I’m going to stab this mother fucker.” Martinez left the bar and all five defendants followed. In a vacant lot next to the tavern, Martinez was attacked by all the pursuers simultaneously during which attack he was fatally stabbed. During the fracas, Brown was seen striking the deceased several times on the head with a trash barrel and repeating “They broke my leg, they broke my leg.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

During direct examination, Christy was asked whether he had given a statement to police at the time of the incident. Christy responded that he had. Brown’s counsel objected, the objection was sustained and no further reference was made to that statement on direct examination. Christy was then extensively cross-examined concerning possible inconsistencies between his trial testimony and his testimony at the preliminary hearing. On redirect, the assistant district attorney again referred to the statement given by Christy to the police. Objection was again made, sustained and the jury was instructed to disregard both the question and the answer.</p>

Then on re-redirect examination, the Commonwealth was permitted, over objection, to question Christy concerning the existence and truth of the statement given to the police but not, however, as to the substance of that statement. It is clear that, aside <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>from the initial reference to the statement on direct examination which, in itself, is insufficient to warrant a new trial,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> the Commonwealth was entitled to question the witness as to the prior consistent statement on re-re-redirect examination in the manner it did for purposes of rehabilitation since Christy had been impeached by use of prior inconsistent statements. <em>Commonwealth v.

Additionally, the questions on re-re-redirect examination were permissible to rebut the inference raised by the defense that the testimony had been fabricated shortly before trial. <em>Commonwealth v.

However, reading the charge as a whole, as we must <em>Commonwealth v.

In several other portions of the charge, the court used the proper language in instructing the jury when, and under what conditions, an acquittal would be the proper verdict. Therefore, this one use of “may” rather than the mandatory “must” does not constitute reversible error.</p>

[Emphasis in original.] Here, in addition to the testimony of eyewitnesses who testified that they saw Brown strike Martinez with a large trash barrel, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of a police detective who testified that, after arriving at the scene approximately fifteen minutes after the incident and acting on a description of the barrel given by the eyewitnesses on the night of the incident, he searched the vacant lot adjoining the bar where the attack took place and found only one barrel, and that barrel matched the description given by the witnesses. That barrel was then taken by the officer, photographed by him and turned over to evidence technicians within the police department. The Commonwealth also introduced the testimony of a medical expert who testified that the barrel could inflict wounds consistent with the wounds on Martinez’s body. Therefore, a chain of custody of the photographs was established as well as circumstances which give rise to an inference of the likelihood that this was the barrel used. Accordingly, no error was committed in introducing the photograph into evidence. <em>Commonwealth v. Ford, </em>supra.</p>
