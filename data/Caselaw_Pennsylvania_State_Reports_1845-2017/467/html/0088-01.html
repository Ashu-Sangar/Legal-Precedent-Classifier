Appellant visited Tinson and his son frequently during the first two months of M’s life. On several occasions, appellant and his mother took M to their house for periods ranging from a few hours to a day. However, primary parental responsibility remained <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>with Tinson, and appellant made only limited financial contributions for M’s care.</p>

Appellant was notified of the hearing by letter at the prison, and he immediately contacted the agency demanding custody of the child, According to testimony of a caseworker at the hearing, children’s services determined that it was in M’s best interests to postpone the voluntary termination of Tinson’s parental rights until grounds could be established for involuntary termination of appellant’s parental rights. To this end, as the record reveals, the agency decided to postpone the hearing hoping that appellant wquld not contact either Tinson or the agency for a six month period.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> A letter was sent to ap<a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>pellant informing him that the hearing had been “can-celled.”</p>

Appellant requested a meeting with M’s social worker, which occurred on October 22. Appellant stated that he wanted to raise M and requested that he be allowed visitation privileges and be informed of the location of the foster home. Children’s services refused all of appellant’s requests, claiming that its decision was based on Tinson’s wishes.
