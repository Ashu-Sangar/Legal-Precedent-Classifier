See Sections 508, 1108 and 1122, of the School Code, Act of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, art. 5, § 508 as amended, and art. 11 §§ 1108 &amp; 1122, as amended, 24 P.S. §§ 5-508 (Supp.1975), 11-1108 (Supp.1975), 11-1122.

    <p id="b119-4" data-blocks='[["BL_119.4",119,[187,668,1152,750]]]'>In the case at bar, the collective bargaining agreement provides that the rating of a teacher as “unsatisfactory” is a proper subject of grievance and so of arbitration. Unlike a decision as to whether a teacher, tenured or otherwise, shall be discharged — matter clearly entrusted by the School Code to the school board — rating a teacher’s performance is an administrative function. It is governed by standards and regulations set by the Department of Public Instruction, and is done by or under the supervision of the superintendent of schools or by such other administrator as supervises the work of the teacher being rated; no unsatisfactory rating is valid unless approved by the district superintendent.

Thus the effect of the arbitration provision is to interject, in a case where a grievance is asserted, an additional step into the rating procedure — a further scrutiny, in addition to that of the district superintendent under the School Code, to ensure the procedural fairness of a recorded black mark against the competency of a teacher. The authority of the school board to make the ultimate decision whether or not to suspend or discharge a teacher is not abridged. I agree with the Court that the agreement in question “neither modifies nor creates an alternative to [the Code’s] dismissal procedure; nor does it provide for a review of the dismissal of a tenured teacher. . . . All the parties have done is to afford the teacher a further procedural protection . . ..” Opinion of the Court, ante at 562. As I observed in the outset, I cannot see that this rather limited additional review of an administrative function is “in violation of, or inconsistent with, or in conflict with”, see § 703 of PERA, the scheme of the School Code governing the rating of professional employees. It is clear that under the Code not only the rating system but the rating process is to be fair; the arbitration to which the parties have agreed is designed to make doubly sure that unfairness does not creep into the handling of a particular case. Section 703 of PERA is not a bar to this design.</p>

The actual provision of § 703 is as follows: “The parties to the collective bargaining process shall not effect or implement a provision in a collective bargaining agreement if the implementation of that provision would be in violation of, or inconsistent with, or in conflict with any statute or statutes enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the provisions of municipal home rule charters.” Act of July 23, 1970, P.

One purpose of rating is to aid in the determination as to whether a professional employee shall be dismissed for incompetency. Section 1123 of the Code, 24 P.S. § 11-1123 (Supp.1975), supra. Another purpose of rating is to provide an order for suspensions in connection with decreases in size of the staff of professional employees. Section 1125(a) of the Code, 24 P.S. § 11— 1125. Under the latter section it is the duty of boards Of school directors to establish a permanent record system containing ratings of each professional employee. A copy Of any unsatisfactory rating is required to be sent to the professional employee concerned. No such employee may be dismissed unless such rating records have been kept on file by the board of school directors. Ibid.</p>
