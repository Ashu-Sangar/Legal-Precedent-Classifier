The Association posits that, under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, when the Committee recommended the grant of faculty status to all librarians, Dr. Branson was duty bound to accept this recommendation, with only the particular faculty rank accorded each librarian remaining for final determination by Dr. Bran-son. That is, the Association does not dispute the final authority delegated to Dr. Branson. The Association merely asserts that he was not free to invoke his own selection procedures and, by virtue of the Committee’s recommendations, was obligated to appoint all librarians to some degree of faculty status.

We note that, although the chancellor determined the librarian status dispute was not ripe for arbitration, this contention was not advanced by the University in its complaint seeking injunctive relief or in its appeal to this Court. Moreover, such a determination does not provide a proper basis for enjoining an arbitration as the question of the timeliness of a demand for arbitration “is not of interpretation of the agreement and not one of the existence or scope of the arbitration provision; it is thus outside the bounds of our review and its resolution must be left to arbitration.” <em>Muhlenberg Township School District Authority v.
