The next day the police arrested one Alexander Payne, who told the police that Johnson had aided him in the slaying of Wakefield. Payne then voluntarily submitted to a lie detector test. On the basis of the information thus supplied, and without first procuring a warrant, the police went to Johnson’s home and there arrested him for the murder of Jerome Wakefield. Appellant now argues, as he did below, that this warrantless arrest was without probable cause, that the confession obtained was a tainted fruit thereof, and that the suppression court therefore erred in ruling the confession admissible.</p>

At 8:30 a. m. he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and questioned for five minutes. At 8:35 a. m. he was permitted to go to the bathroom. Johnson then consented to take a lie detector test. The test began at 8:55 a. m, and lasted two hours. At 10:55 a. m. Johnson was supplied with food, was allowed again to use the bathroom, and was given an opportunity to rest. The interrogation resumed at 11:30 a. m. and continued until 12:05 p. m. at which time Johnson made an oral confession of his participation in the crime and agreed to give a formal statement.</p>

The hearing judge chose to resolve the conflicts in testimony in favor of the Commonwealth and, based on the chronology of events above-described, concluded that the confession was voluntary.
