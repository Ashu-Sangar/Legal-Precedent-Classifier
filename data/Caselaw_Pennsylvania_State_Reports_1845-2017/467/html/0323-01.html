In this direct appeal <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> he raises five allegations of error: (1) <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>the evidence presented at trial was not sufficient to support his conviction; (2) the identity of appellant as the assailant was not established beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) the District Attorney made prejudicial remarks to the jury during his opening statement; (4) the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a photograph of the alleged murder weapon; (5) a new trial is mandated because two of the Commonwealth’s witnesses testified on cross-examination that they originally identified Inge as the assailant from police photographs. We have carefully reviewed the briefs and the record and have concluded that there is no merit to any of these contentions.</p>
