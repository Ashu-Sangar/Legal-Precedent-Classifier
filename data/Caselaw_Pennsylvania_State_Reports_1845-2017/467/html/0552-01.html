Arguments to the jury based upon such an indictment of the trial proceedings are, in my mind, manifestly improper and cannot be said to fall within the scope of a lawyer’s duty zealously to represent his client. A lawyer must, of course, vigorously pursue appropriate procedures to challenge errors in the proceedings; but to say that a lawyer must not allow perceived error to go uncontested is not to condone the misguided effort to argue the wisdom of the judge’s rulings to the jury.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Opinion of the Court <em>ante </em>at 743. This proposition is said to be derived from the quoted language of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Craig v. Harney, </em><a href="/us/331/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="331 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="6157728" data-case-paths="/us/331/0367-01">331 U.S. 367</a>, <a href="/us/331/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="331 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="6157728" data-case-paths="/us/331/0367-01">67 S.Ct. 1249</a>, <a href="/us/331/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="331 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="6157728" data-case-paths="/us/331/0367-01">91 L.Ed. 1546</a> (1946). The <em>Craig </em>decision, however, is simply not apposite to the circumstances of this case. In <em>Craig </em>the Supreme Court was called upon to decide the extent to which the press could be punished for contempt for critical journalistic appraisals of a trial judge’s handling of a case then before the court. It was in this context that the language relied upon by the majority was written.</p>

In this sense they must, in Mr. Justice Douglas’ words, be “men of fortitude, able to thrive in a hardy climate.” [Opinion of the <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>Court <em>ante </em>at 743. The broad protections of the First Amendment require at least this much. But to say that a judge may not wield the contempt power to throttle public criticism by the press is not to condone similar criticism of a judge uttered by a lawyer during the course of a courtroom proceeding. Citicism by the press is in the nature of public debate: it protects the integrity, of the court by exposing its processes to robust public review. Accusations of judicial impropriety made by a lawyer to a jury in the course of a judicial proceeding, however, serves only to denigrate the authority and dignity of the court. To preserve the integrity of our courts judges must accept the former types of criticism but must not tolerate the latter. For these reasons, I would affirm appellant’s contempt conviction.</p>
