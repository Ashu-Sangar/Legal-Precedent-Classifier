      <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>Appellant focuses his present contention on this particular segment of the record. Although the objection could have been more precise, it should have alerted the trial judge to the problem presented. Hindsight judgment would suggest that the Court should have precluded further exploration of this area and at this juncture explained to the jury the legal significance of the evidence on this point, heretofore presented. Nevertheless we do not believe his allowance of the testimony which followed the objection justifies the grant of a new trial. An analysis of the testimony received after the objection satisfies us that it was merely a repetition of that which the jury had previously been advised, i. e., that Kahley elected to exercise his constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment to remain silent. We find no justification for a conclusion that this reference was any more offensive that the earlier ones. This particular line of questioning was not deliberately designed to suggest an inference of guilt but rather to refute the defense’s improper premise that the silence should be construed as supportive of appellant’s position at trial that he was not present at the scene.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It is also significant that the defense made no effort to pursue the objection by requesting clarifying instructions to avoid any possible prejudice that might have been created by this additional reference to the subject.</p>
    <p id="b312-4" data-blocks='[["BL_312.4",312,[292,1694,1150,152]],["BL_313.1",313,[192,307,1153,703]]]'>Appellant argues that the information received after the objection was distinguishable from the earlier testimony in that it introduced for the first time the fact <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>that the accused also sought the benefit of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. It is contended that this compounds the error and created additional prejudice which was not present as a result of the original reference to the exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege. We do not agree. Although the trooper indicated that appellant did express the desire to have counsel present, his testimony clearly set forth the assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege as the sole basis for Kahley’s refusal to answer questions put to him by police officials. We find that no additional prejudice was created by the statement that Kahley also desired to have counsel if and when he agreed to participate in the interrogation.</p>
    <p id="b313-4" data-blocks='[["BL_313.4",313,[183,1058,1162,811]]]'>Appellant next contends that the Court erred in permitting the testimony of a Commonwealth witness who was neither listed on the bill of indictment nor on the list of prospective witnesses which defense counsel had requested in a bill of particulars. We disagree. At trial, appellant presented a defense of alibi. Both he and his wife testified that on the night in question, Kahley was at his home in Philadelphia and remained there the entire night. The Commonwealth then called Mrs. Roberta Chesonis who testified on rebuttal that appellant and another man had come to her home in Shoemakers-ville, Berks County, late on the night of the incident, at which time she learned of their participation in the shooting. She further testified that the men had slept in the living room and left the next day.</p>

His reliance on <em>Jackson, </em>supra is clearly misplaced. <em>Jackson, </em>supra was decided at a time when Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 312 was <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>operative.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Rule 312 required the defense to notify the Commonwealth of the identity and whereabouts of any witnesses they intended to call for establishing the defense of alibi. We reasoned in <em>Jackson </em>supra that it was necessary for the Commonwealth to afford the accused reciprocal discovery rights. At the time of the instant trial, Rule 312 was not in effect and appellant had not furnished the Commonwealth with the list of alibi witnesses he intended to call. There was therefore, no obligation upon the Commonwealth to offer the names of any witnesses they might deem necessary to challenge the credibility of the alibi testimony.</p>

The Commonwealth had properly listed the crimes charged and those witnesses it intended to call during the case in chief, thereby enabling appellant to prepare his defense.

Therefore, the prosecution could not have been expected to list a witness it thereafter decided to call to rebut that defense.</p>

One of the items seized was ap<a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>pellant’s telephone bill which listed the telephone number of Mrs. Chesonis. On cross-examination, Mrs. Chesonis stated that she was first contacted by police sometime after Kahley’s arrest. Appellant argued that the name of this witness had been obtained from the illegally seized telephone bill and requested that the trial judge declare a mistrial. In response, the Commonwealth countered that it had learned of this witness through an independent source and that Mrs. Chesonis had in fact spoken with police several days prior to Kahley’s arrest. The state trooper was recalled and testified from written notes that he first spoke with Mrs. Chesonis on February 6, 1974, and that she signed a statement three days later.</p>
