The rules of the orphans’ court divisions are to be “liberally construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action or proceeding to which they are applicable.” Rule 2.1 (formerly Section 2 of Rule 1) of the Orphans’ Court Rules of this Court. The same rule allows the orphans’ courts to “disregard any error or defect of procedure which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties in interest.” See also 20 Pa.C.S. § 3521. If, therefore, the court’s failure to consider the issue was because of the “defect of procedure” referred to, the court abused its discretion in the premises.

It is to be noted that the two Harrisburg National certificates were not supported by bank signature cards delineating the nature of the joint ownership. Had there been such cards, our law is clear that the transaction would be viewed as prima facie an inter vivos gift and the burden of proof would be placed upon the party claiming that no gift was intended (the appellant in this case). See e. g., <em>Keeney Estate, </em><a href="/pa/465/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="465 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="1712704" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0045-01">465 Pa. 45</a>, <a href="/pa/465/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="465 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="1712704" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0045-01">348 A.2d 108</a> (1975); <em>Scott Estate, </em><a href="/pa/455/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="455 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="582236" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0429-01">455 Pa. 429</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=316%20A.2d%20883" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="316 A.2d 883">316 A.2d 883</a> (1974); <em>Dzierski Estate </em><a href="/pa/449/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="449 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="1945599" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0285-01">449 Pa. 285</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20716" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="296 A.2d 716">296 A.2d 716</a> (1972). On the other hand, nothing can be inferred from the absence of such cards in this case because, as the record shows, Harrisburg National did not require such cards of its depositors at the time the certificates were issued. (A bank officer testified that the certificates were in a form that <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>the bank considered to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship.) Cf. <em>Balfour v. Seitz, </em><a href="/pa/392/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="392 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="8845449" data-case-paths="/pa/392/0300-01">392 Pa. 300</a>, 306 n. 9, <a href="/citations/?q=140%20A.2d%20441" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="140 A.2d 441">140 A.2d 441</a> (1958).</p>

Joseph’s testimony, although adverse to the interests of the estate, was admissible because all of the parties waived the applicability of the so-called “Dead Man’s Act.” Act of May 23, 1887, P.L. 158, § 5, cl.

This was in contradistinction to the $14,000 certificate, of deposit (and another not now in issue) which he purchased at Dauphin Deposit. As to that certificate, he testified that “[m]y name was put on there for convenience in case it was necessary for me to take over the funds for her care.”</p>

Because he was a close relative to the decedent, less evidence is required of him to prove an inter vivos gift than would be required of a stranger. <em>Balfour v.
