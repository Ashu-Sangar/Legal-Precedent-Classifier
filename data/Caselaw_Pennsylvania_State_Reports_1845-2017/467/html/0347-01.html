Post-trial motions were filed and denied by a court en banc. On April 8, 1975, the court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment for second-degree murder and a concurrent term of not less than ten nor more than twenty years’ imprisonment on the kidnapping indictment. Appellant appealed the murder conviction to this court and also appealed the kidnapping conviction to the Superior Court, which in turn certified the record to this court on July 3,1975.</p>

Two witnesses testified that they saw the decedent being beaten by appellant and his companions and also witnessed the decedent being forced into an automobile by the group. Nelson’s body was found early the following morning and appellant and four members of the group that accompanied him to the bar were arrested for the homicide.</p>

Such advocacy, I believe, falls within the bounds of the “reasonable latitude” the district attorney must be allowed in the presentation of his case. Furthermore, even if it be assumed that the district attorney exceeded the limits of permissible advocacy, a reversal would be mandated only if the unavoidable effect of his comments would be so to prejudice the jury that they could not fairly weigh the evidence and reach a just verdict. <em>Commonwealth v. Stoltzfus, </em><a href="/citations/?q=462%20Pa.%2055" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="462 Pa. 55">462 Pa. 55</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="337 A.2d 873" data-case-ids="485206" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0043-01">337 A.2d 873</a> (1975); <em>Commonwealth v.

In my mind, the cautionary instructions given to the jury by the trial judge were sufficient to prevent this prejudicial effect. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>
