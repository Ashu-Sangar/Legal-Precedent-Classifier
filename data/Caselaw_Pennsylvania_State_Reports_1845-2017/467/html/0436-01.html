Indictments followed on all charges. On December 17, 1974, two hundred sixty-eight days after appellee’s arrest, the prosecution moved, pursuant to Rule 314, Pa.R. Crim.P., for leave to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>in the case against appellee on the grounds that it had no admissible evidence with which to prosecute the case. The prosecution’s lack of evidence resulted from the grant of a motion to suppress certain incriminating statements made by appellee to police, and because a co-defendant, who was expected to be the main prosecution witness against appellee, had refused to testify. Over appellee’s objec<a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>tion, the prosecution’s motion for a <em>nolle prosequi </em>was granted.</p>

A hearing was held on May 29, 1975, following which the trial court issued an opinion and order vacating the <em>nolle prosequi, </em>and granting appellee’s motion to dismiss all charges with prejudice. From this order the prosecution now appeals. The appeal on the bill of indictment charging appellee with murder was taken directly to this Court; the appeal on the bill of indictment charging appellee with criminal conspiracy was taken to the Superior Court and subsequently transferred here.</p>

See Comment to Rule 1100, Pa.R.Crim.P. The rule’s purpose, and the consequence of failure to abide by its mandate, were clearly delineated in <em>Commonwealth v. Hamilton. </em>Rule 1100 provides the one method (as opposed to <em>Barker v. Wingo’s </em>“balancing test”) by which the courts of Pennsylvania are to determine whether an accused’s constitutional right to a speedy trial has been violated. The test mandated by Rule 1100 is the only test to be applied in Pennsylvania to determine a speedy trial claim. It was not meant to be applied in addition to <em>Barker’s </em>“balancing test.” It represents this Court’s determination that the “balancing test” announced in <em>Barker </em>provides only the “minimum standards guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments,” and that such minimum standards are not adequate to provide Pennsylvania criminal defendants the protection guaranteed by the constitution of this Commonwealth. See Pa.Const. Art. I, Sec, 9. It is clear from a reading of <em>Commonwealth v. Hamilton, </em>that the purpose of the rule would be wholly frustrated if the position taken by the prosecution here were to be accepted. Through the simple expedient of a <em>nolle prosequi, </em>the prosecution could indefinitely delay an accused’s trial, thereby frustrating the state objective of Rule 1100, while at the same time, escaping the consequences of its violation. Such a result is also recognized by the ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice — Relating to Speedy Trial, Approved Draft, 1968, at 40-41, where it is stated that “[i]f following undue delay in going to trial, the prosecution is free to commence prosecution for the same offense, subject only to the statute of limitations, the right to speedy trial is largely meaningless.”</p>

Rule 314 requires that a <em>nolle prosequi </em>issue only with the approval of the court. Rule 1100(c) provides a mechanism whereby the prosecution may secure an extension of the time within which it must bring an accused to trial. Paragraph (c) provides for a hearing at which the defendant, as well as the prosecution, can be heard. It also provides that if a continuance is granted, a specific date is to be set before which date trial must commence. In this way, Rule 1100(c) seeks to prevent indefinite postponements. Through these two rules, the district attorney’s power to decide whether and when to prosecute, and whether and when to continue or discontinue a case is subjected to the power of the court to supervise all court proceedings and to protect the accused’s right to a fair trial. <em>Commonwealth v.
