Emmett Fitzpatrick, the District Attorney of Philadelphia, was superseded in the staffing of the November 1975 Special Investigating Grand Jury by Attorney General Robert P. Kane at the request of President Judge Edward Bradley of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas. On December 16, 1975, Judge Bradley wrote to the Attorney General requesting that he assign a special attorney or attorneys to staff the November 1975 Special Investigating Grand Jury pursuant to Section 907 of the Administrative Code, <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>Act of April 9, 1929, P.L. 177, Art. IX, § 907, 71 P.S. § 297. Judge Bradley acted after receiving a recommendation that the district attorney’s office not staff the grand jury from Judge Marshall, the judge assigned to preside over it. Judge Marshall’s recommendation was based on findings of fact obtained at a hearing held on December 10, 1975 to determine if the district attorney’s office was able to staff the grand jury. On December 17, 1975, the Attorney General responded to Judge Bradley’s request and assigned the office of the Special Prosecutor to staff the grand jury. Shortly thereafter, appellant filed two notices of appeal, one from Judge Bradley’s letter of December 16, 1975 requesting the Attorney General to supersede the district attorney’s office, and the other from the action of the Attorney General on December 17, 1975 assigning the office of the Special Prosecutor to staff the grand jury. Those two appeals were subsequently consolidated into this one action in which appellant is contesting the legality of his supersession.</p>
    <p id="b334-4" data-blocks='[["BL_334.4",334,[300,1316,1157,693]]]'>Section 907 of the Administrative Code, 71 P.S. § 297, which mandates the action of both the President Judge and the Attorney General in order to supersede a district attorney, does not provide any procedure to be followed should the district attorney object to the supersession, as does appellant in this case. When appellant requested that Judge Bradley enter a formal order indicating that appellant had been superseded pursuant to Section 907 of the Administrative Code, Judge Bradley stated that no such order was necessary as the action of the Attorney General complying with Judge Bradley’s request for appellant’s supersession effectively served as an order. Appellant is now appealing that “order.”</p>

His determination decided with sufficient finality the rights and powers of the district attorney, and was, in effect, an adjudication within the meaning of Section 2 of the Administrative Agency Law.
