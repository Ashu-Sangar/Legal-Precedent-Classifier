    <p id="b655-6" data-blocks='[["BL_655.5",655,[169,1088,1154,1080]],["BL_656.1",656,[292,268,1154,756]]]'>Although they may cover various aspects of the marital relationship, antenuptial agreements usually are “instruments designed and executed for a particular purpose — to alter or extinguish a spouse’s statutory rights of inheritance.” <em>Harrison Estate, </em><a href="/pa/456/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="456 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="584441" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0356-01">456 Pa. 356</a>, 359, <a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%205" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="319 A.2d 5">319 A.2d 5</a>, 7 (1974). Because the surviving spouse in Pennsylvania is statutorily invested with substantial rights in the estate of the deceased spouse, close scrutiny is given to any agreement which purports to contract away those rights. See, <em>e. g., Harrison Estate, supra; Rosciolo Estate, </em><a href="/pa/434/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="434 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="1922637" data-case-paths="/pa/434/0461-01">434 Pa. 461</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=258%20A.2d%20623" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="258 A.2d 623">258 A.2d 623</a> (1969); <em>Hillegass Estate, supra; Vallish Estate, </em><a href="/pa/431/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="431 Pa. 88" data-case-ids="1917421" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0088-01">431 Pa. 88</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20745" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="244 A.2d 745">244 A.2d 745</a> (1968). This characteristic post-mortem purpose of such agreements is clearly evidenced by the quoted language of Paragraph 4 of the agreement here. Of course, there is nothing to prevent a contractual agreement between a prospective husband and wife from speaking also or alternatively to financial affairs during coverture, including a disavowal of the husband’s duty of support.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> In the case at bar, however, the trial court <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>found that the agreement was not motivated by an intent to relieve Mr. Slight of his support obligation, and that the agreement should not be read as if there were such an intent. During their marriage and until the time Mr. Slight was placed in a convalescent home he paid all of their mutual expenses and, in addition, his wife’s expenses except for clothing, prescriptions and doctor visits. He sought no contribution from her separate funds in meeting these expenses. What Mrs. Slight now seeks is a continuation of that arrangement, with the estate meeting the expenses just as her husband did before his incompetency. We agree with the court below that the antenuptial agreement, which makes no specific provision for incompetency, does not prevent this.</p>
    <p id="b656-4" data-blocks='[["BL_656.5",656,[287,1062,1150,424]]]'>Appellant next argues that, the antenuptial agreement aside, the lower court erred in directing support payments because Mrs. Slight failed in her statutory duty of proving her need for the requested funds by sufficient, competent evidence. Section 5536 of the Decedents, Estates and Fiduciaries Act, 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 5536 to which Mrs. Slight points in advancing her claim, provides in pertinent part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b656-5" data-blocks='[["BL_656.6",656,[329,1508,1104,262]]]'>“The court, <em>for cause shown, </em>may authorize or direct <em>the payment </em>or application <em>of any or all of the income or principal of the estate of the incompetent for </em>the <em>care, maintenance </em>or education <em>of </em>the incompetent, <em>his spouse, </em>. . . .” (emphasissupplied).</blockquote>
    <p id="b656-6" data-blocks='[["BL_656.7",656,[283,1791,1146,97]]]'>The question is thus whether Mrs. Slight has in fact shown cause. We agree with appellant that she did not.</p>

Although this sum was producing an annual income of about $6,200., Mr. Slight’s expenses were approximately $10,000. Thus principal was being invaded at the rate of about $3,800 per year. Mrs. Slight’s estate was not fully valued in the evidence adduced at the hearing. It was established, however, that her spendable cash receipts were about $500 per month.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Since the onset of her husband’s incompetency, Mrs. Slight has received no financial assistance from him or his guardian, and is therefore paying some expenses formerly paid by her husband. It was to cover these expenditures that Mrs. Slight made the request for $100 per week, notwithstanding that, according to her own testimony, her income was sufficient to meet all her personal needs and the additional expenses she has been defraying. The hearing judge found that this request “does not seem out of line,” and accordingly directed the appellant guardian to pay Mrs. Slight $5,000 per year “out of income, or of principal, as required.”</p>
    <p id="b657-5" data-blocks='[["BL_657.4",657,[192,1336,1150,482]],["BL_658.1",658,[284,267,1151,370]]]'>It is clear that the payments directed to be made to Mrs. Slight must come out of the principal of her husband’s estate, thus increasing the annual invasion of principal to $8,800 per year.

As long as one spouse has assets and spendable cash of his or her own, we see no justification for reducing the other, incompetent spouse to the status of a pauper merely in order that the obligation to support may be fulfilled. This, like other obligations, is relative, and requires a balancing of interests.</p>

In that case the incompetent husband’s estate produced income in excess of his expenses in the amount of $2,000 annually which was being paid to the wife for her support and maintenance. The wife’s separate estate provided her with a yearly income of $30,000. Nevertheless, the wife petitioned, under 5536 of the Decedents Estates and Fiduciaries Act, to increase the payments from her husband’s estate to more than $8,000 yearly. The increased amount would necessarily have come from principal, and would have served only to augment the wife’s already adequate funds at the cost of assuring the incompetent’s inability to meet his own expenses from income.
