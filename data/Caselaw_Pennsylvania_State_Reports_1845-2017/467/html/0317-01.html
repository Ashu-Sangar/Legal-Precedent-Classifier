In order to succeed on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the moving party’s right to prevail must be so clear that “a trial would clearly be a fruitless exercise.” <em>Bata v.

The complaint alleged that on September 4, 1972, plaintiffs, William and Cecelia Keil, had entered into an oral agreement with the defendants for the purchase of a certain plot of ground located in Huntingdon County. The complaint also alleged that a mobile home located on the property was to be included in the sale. The property was to be sold for the sum of $2,500.00, and in addition, appellants were to loan appellees the sum of $1,000.00. Sometime after September 4, 1972, according to the complaint, appellees arranged for appellants to pick up the deed to the property and the title certificate for the mobile home from a third party in order that appellants might have the title searched, a new deed drafted, and a certificate of title to <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>the mobile home completed prior to settlement. Appellants thereafter caused the title search to be made and caused the deed to be drafted conveying the property from appellees to appellants.</p>
    <p id="b352-4" data-blocks='[["BL_352.4",352,[285,529,1163,917]]]'>The complaint also alleged that on September 23, 1972, appellants gave the deed to appellees in order that it might be executed prior to settlement, and that thereafter appellants were informed that the deed had in fact been executed by appellees. Financial arrangements were made by appellants so that the purchase price could be paid, and a note to be executed by appellees at the time the settlement was drafted guaranteeing payment of the proposed $1,000.00 loan. Appellees were notified that settlement on the proposed sale of the property was to be held on October 18, 1972, in the office of the appellants’ attorney. Sometime thereafter appellants were informed by appellees that appellees had entered into a written agreement of sale of the same property with a third party, and that appellees would not comply with their prior agreement to convey the property to the appellants.</p>
    <p id="b352-5" data-blocks='[["BL_352.5",352,[274,1466,1158,530]]]'>Appellants instituted an equity action to compel the conveyance of the property; preliminary objections were filed and dismissed on May 23, 1973; appellees filed an answer containing “new matter” and a counterclaim; and some time thereafter, appellees also filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. In their “new matter,” appellees averred that plaintiffs’ complaint should be dismissed because of the Statute of Frauds, 33 P.S. § 1. Judgment on the pleadings was granted on February 5, 1975.</p>

This result is compelled because on the face of the pleadings it would be apparent that plaintiffs had no claim upon which relief could be granted, and, the case being free from doubt, entry of judgment on the pleadings would be proper. If, on the other hand, the plaintiff responds to defendant’s “new matter” allegations raising the bar of the statute of frauds, a sit-<a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>nation is created which may Or may not require entry of judgment on the pleadings. Whether or not such a result is required will depend upon the factual allegations contained in plaintiff’s complaint and in plaintiff’s answer to defendant’s “new matter.” If in their complaint, or in their answer to defendant’s “new matter,” plaintiffs allege no facts which, if proven, would take the alleged oral contract for the sale of real estate outside the bar of the Statute of Frauds, then clearly a trial would be a “fruitless exercise,” and entry of judgment on the pleadings in favor of defendant would be proper. <em>See Pierro v.

If, however, in their complaint, or in their answer to defendant’s “new matter”, plaintiffs allege facts which, if proved, would take the oral contract outside the statutory prohibition, then an issue of fact is presented, and the case must proceed to trial. The plaintiffs have alleged such facts here, and for that reason the order of the court granting defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings must be vacated and the ease allowed to proceed to trial.</p>
