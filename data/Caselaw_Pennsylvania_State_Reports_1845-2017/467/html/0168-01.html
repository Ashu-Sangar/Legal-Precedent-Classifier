Police Officer Merrick, who had not up to that point participated in the investigation, was assigned the task of transporting appellant to police headquarters. Merrick testified that at this particular time, he was unaware appellant was a suspect and believed he was merely transporting a witness. Shortly after Ms. Boone entered the car, a radio dispatch directed Merrick to meet a police wagon. At this point the following conversation occurred.</p>

At 11:00 P.M., Ms. Boone was given her Miranda warnings and repeated the inculpatory statement. The statement was reduced to writing and signed by appellant. Fifteen minutes later, the same officer returned to clarify part of the statement. This interview lasted approximately one hour wherein appellant stated further that she did not believe decedent was going to stab her nor was there a struggle when appellant grabbed the weapon from the decedent’s hand. The second written statement was completed and signed at 7:45 A.M. of the morning after her arrest.</p>

She thus contends that the oral statements made to the officer in the police vehicle should have been suppressed and were improperly introduced against her at trial.

Instead of taking appellant to preliminary arraignment without delay, as required by Pa.R.Crim.P. 130, the police attempted to elicit additional statements from appellant to “clarify” her original statement. A second written statement was completed and signed at 7:45 a. m. the following day. Thus, 22 hours after her arrest she had still not been arraigned. These unwarranted, unnecessary delays which produce “clarifying” statements in violation of Rule 130 and the cases decided thereunder cannot be tolerated.</p>
    <p id="b214-6" data-blocks='[["BL_214.7",214,[280,1701,1153,586]],["BL_215.1",215,[178,258,1149,205]]]'>In an attempt to justify its conclusion that the subsequent statements were properly admissible, the majority contradicts its own recitation of the facts. The opinion states that after the initial statement was given, the police sought to have appellant “clarify” her inculpatory recitation. These clarifications were apparently sufficiently important to be reduced to writing by the police, given to appellant to sign more than eight hours after her first statement was signed, and used by the prosecution at trial. The majority states however, “Since the information obtained during the subsequent period was <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>merely repetitious, the appellant was not prejudiced.” I cannot join this equivocation. The facts of record indicate that the subsequent statements should have been suppressed.</p>
