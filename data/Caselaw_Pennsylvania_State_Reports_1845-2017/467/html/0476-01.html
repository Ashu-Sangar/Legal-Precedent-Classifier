Prison sentences were imposed on each conviction, the sentences to run concurrently. These appeals followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>Palmer asserts he is entitled to a new trial because of errors and deficiencies in the trial court’s charge to the jury. An account of the evidence presented is thus necessitated.</p>
    <p id="b510-4" data-blocks='[["BL_510.4",510,[298,525,1146,96]]]'>From the Commonwealth’s evidence, the jury could find the following:</p>
    <p id="b510-5" data-blocks='[["BL_510.5",510,[295,643,1148,419]]]'>On July 4, 1973, Eugene Ross and Herbert Halliday were residing at 2047 Indiana Avenue, Philadelphia, along with Mrs. Patricia Davis, the owner of the residence, her five children and her husband. On or about that date, Palmer began residing at the same residence. Animosity between Ross and Palmer developed during the period between July 4 and July 31, 1973 when the homicide here involved occurred.</p>
    <p id="b510-6" data-blocks='[["BL_510.6",510,[295,1101,1146,258]]]'>In the early morning hours of July 31, 1973, an argument developed between Palmer and Ross over the presence of certain women at the residence. The next morning the argument continued and resulted in Palmer leaving the house.</p>
    <p id="b510-7" data-blocks='[["BL_510.7",510,[295,1391,1147,424]]]'>Palmer then contacted Reginald Hamel, Andre Greene and Kevin Henderson in an effort to acquire a gun. Palmer’s efforts were successful in that Henderson supplied him with a shotgun and ammunition. Palmer, Greene, Hamel and Henderson then drove to the general area of Palmer’s residence. Palmer departed the vehicle and proceeded to the residence with the shotgun concealed in a guitar case.</p>
    <p id="b510-8" data-blocks='[["BL_510.8",510,[290,1847,1147,478]],["BL_511.1",511,[182,243,1152,480]]]'>Palmer, upon arriving in front of the house, called Ross, who was in the basement, and Ross came out and saw Palmer with the guitar case. Each beckoned to the other to come closer but Palmer walked in a “backward” manner away from Ross while at the same time watching him. Palmer crossed the street and continued to move backward as Ross moved toward him. Palmer then bumped into a small child and Ross helped the child to her feet as Palmer had backed further away. Palmer <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>reached a corner and moved around a car. Ross attempted to look around the corner when Palmer suddenly reappeared, opened the guitar case, pointed the shotgun at Ross, stated: “I’m not scared of you now . . ,” and fired the weapon. As a result, Ross was wounded in the hand and a four-year-old child, Kelly J. Lane, who had been playing nearby, was fatally wounded. The testimony does not indicate whether Kelly Lane was the same child bumped into by Palmer and helped by Ross.</p>
    <p id="b511-5" data-blocks='[["BL_511.4",511,[231,759,770,39]]]'>The defense testimony was as follows:</p>
    <p id="b511-6" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[178,833,1153,748]]]'>Ross, was not a resident of 2047 Indiana Avenue, but was only an occasional visitor and he was trained in karate. Because of this Palmer was both respectful and fearful of Ross’s physical prowess. In the early morning hours of July 31, 1973, the argument over the presence of the women at the residence had resulted in a fight. The argument later that morning also resulted in a fight during which Ross kicked Palmer and thereby drove him across part of a room into a wall. Palmer complained to Mrs. Davis but to no avail. Following the complaint, the argument continued and Palmer departed the house after repeated threats by Ross which included a threat to kill Palmer if he returned. Palmer departed only because of the threat and a fear of Ross.</p>
    <p id="b511-7" data-blocks='[["BL_511.6",511,[177,1621,1151,259]]]'>Palmer later returned to the residence only to acquire his clothing.

Mrs. Davis called Ross and when he appeared Palmer began moving away from the residence. Palmer tried to avoid Ross, but Ross continued to pursue him. Palmer began running to avoid Ross. As Palmer attempted to run around a corner, he tripped and ran into <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>a parked car because he had his shoes on in a “flip-flop” manner. The guitar case which Palmer was carrying opened as a result of the impact, and Palmer grabbed the shotgun because Ross was now so close to him that he considered himself cornered and unable to flee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Palmer pointed the shotgun at Ross and warned him not to approach. Ross continued to approach, raised his hand to strike Palmer, and Palmer shot at him.</p>
    <p id="b512-4" data-blocks='[["BL_512.4",512,[297,693,1149,424]]]'>Palmer further testified he had not attempted to kill Ross. He also said he knew how to use a shotgun and Ross was sufficiently close that he could have killed him but he had intentionally not pointed the gun straight at Ross. Finally, Palmer testified he did not know a young child had been shot when he fled the scene and would not have discharged the weapon had he known the child was in the vicinity.</p>

If a person reasonably believes under all of the circumstances that he is in danger of death or serious bodily harm at the hands of another, the law permits him to kill if necessary such other person to protect himself from death or serious bodily harm.
