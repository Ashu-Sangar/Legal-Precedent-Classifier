Miller died on November 3, 1971, leaving an original will, with various codicils thereto, containing many interlineations and deletions. A “copy fair” was duly probated from which no appeal was taken. The will and its codicils were interpreted by the auditing judge to bequeath the residue of the testator’s estate, in trust, for the benefit of his widow for life and, at her death, 61% thereof to pass to certain named charities and the remaining 39 % of such residue to continue in trust for the benefit of testator’s four children, for their respective lives, with remainder to their issue. The will also contains a provision that all death taxes be paid from the <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>residue of the state with authority to the executors to prepay such taxes on future interests.</p>

Under this view, whether federal estate and state death taxes are included in the valuation of a future interest is entirely dependent upon whether the taxes are paid before or after valuation occurs.
