When appellants refused to convey the property, appellee instituted the instant equity action to compel specific performance. After a trial, the chancellor ordered appellants to convey a “free, clear and merchantable title,” ruled that appellants had neither expressly nor impliedly reserved a right-of-way over the land, and concluded that under the terms of the option agreement, appellee was not required to pay interest charges which had accrued on money owed by appellants for the installation of certain sewer facilities on the lots in question. Appellants appealed. We. conclude that appellants are entitled to retain a right-of-way over the easterly twenty feet of lots 275 and 276 and that the decree should be modified accordingly; as so modified, we will affirm.</p>

The reservation of such an easement, it is claimed, is both expressly set forth in the addendum clause of the lease granting the option, and implicit in light of the circumstances surrounding the transaction in question. An understanding of these contentions requires a brief review of the events which gave rise to this controversy.</p>

      <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>In 1960 appellants purchased lot 285, a plot of land with a narrow forty foot southerly boundary on West 13th Street and one hundred-fifty-three foot westerly border on lots 275 and 276. (Lot 285 was bounded on the north and on the east by other properties not herein relevant). At the time of the purchase, a building thirty feet wide was situated on the southerly end of lot 285. Access to the northerly portion of the lot from West 13th Street could be gained only through a seven foot space which separated the western edge of this house and the border of lots 275 and 276.</p>
    <p id="b343-4" data-blocks='[["BL_343.4",343,[190,891,1157,929]]]'>Shortly after the purchase of lot 285, appellants began construction of a repair shop for automobile bodies on the northern portion of the lot. Because the seven foot passageway was not wide enough to allow necessary vehicles to reach the construction site, appellants, with the consent of the then owners, used the easterly twenty feet of lots 275 and 276 as an access route. In 1963, after the construction was completed, appellants purchased these two lots and paved the twenty foot access road. Two years later appellants agreed to lease the two lots to appellee, who drafted a lease containing an option to purchase the leased lots and a separate option to purchase lot 285. Appellants, however, concerned that the writing would not preserve their right to use the access road, refused to sign the lease agreement as drafted; they insisted, and the lessees agreed, that the following addendum be added prior to execution:</p>

At issue is the construction to be afforded that portion of the option agreement which provides that appellee, if the option is exercised, shall bear the “cost of the sanitary sewer installation.” See n. 1, supra. The chancellor concluded that the quoted phrase embraced only the cost of installation as such, not the interest that accrues on the unpaid balance of the installation cost. Such a construction is not without support. See <em>e. g., </em>Black’s Law Dictionary 415 (4th ed. 1968). Appellant contends, however, that the term is intrinsically ambiguous and ought to be construed in light of the circumstances surrounding its adoption. Even assuming, however, that the term “cost of . . . installation” should be so construed, the record does not contain sufficient evidence of those circumstances to undermine the chancellor’s conclusion that “interest” was pot within the contemplation of the parties when they entered into the lease agreement. Accordingly, we will affirm the chancellor’s decree in this regard.</p>

Rules of construction serve the legitimate purpose of aiding courts in their quest to ascertain and give effect to the intention of parties to an instrument. They are not meant to be applied as a substitute for that quest. Where a document is found to be ambiguous, inquiry should always be made into the circumstances surrounding the execution of the document in an effort to clarify the meaning that the parties sought to express in the language which they chose. <em>See New Charter Coal </em>Co. v. <em>McKee, </em><a href="/citations/?q=411%20Pa.%20304" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="411 Pa. 304">411 Pa. 304</a>, 307, <a href="/citations/?q=191%20A.2d%20830" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="191 A.2d 830">191 A.2d 830</a> (1963); <em>Commonwealth v.

Gedicke Sons, </em><a href="/pa/343/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="343 Pa. 524" data-case-ids="1208395" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0524-01">343 Pa. 524</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.2d%20490" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="23 A.2d 490">23 A.2d 490</a> (1942). In <em>Philadelphia Steel, </em>the Court rejected <em>Nauman’s </em>restrictive reading of the permanency requirement of an implied easement by reservation. In <em>Nauman, </em>the Court held that where a right-of-way (a railroad siding) could be destroyed by the actions of a third party (the railroad company), over whom the proponent of the easement had no control, the right-of-way could not be said to be permanent. In <em>Philadelphia Abrasive, </em>the Court overruled this formulation and held that where there is nothing in the present circumstances to indicate that a right-of-way was intended to be nonpermanent, the potential of future disruption by the act of a third party does not destroy the permanence of the right-of-way for the purpose of finding an easement by implied reservation. The Court’s decision left unaffected the <em>Nauman </em>conclusion that such rights-of-ways are continuous.</p>

      <p id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[203,1767,1150,564]]]'>. See note 5 supra. It should be noted that there is no language contained in the option agreement which would tend to negate the implication that the right-of-way in question was intended to continue in existence after the exercise of the option. <em>See </em>note 1 supra. Appellee, the drafter of the option agreement, certainly could have included such language had it so desired. Moreover, even if the addendum clauses are considered to be too ambiguous to create an easement in the lessor-vendor after sale, they cannot reasonably be read as declaring an intent that the right-of-way should terminate upon the exercise of the option. It is true, as the chancellor’s opinion points out, that the parties are referred to in those paragraphs as “Lessors” and “Lessee,” not as parties to a sale, but this is the terminology used throughout the instrument (which was, of course, primarily a lease), including the option paragraphs (13 and 14).</p>
