    <p id="b77-6" data-blocks='[["BL_77.6",77,[179,633,1152,591]]]'>Plaintiff-appellee, Phillips Home Furnishings, Inc., commenced the instant litigation by way of a complaint sounding in assumpsit and in trespass alleging that on June 16, 1973, its agent delivered the sum of $5,669.00 into the “night depository safe” of defendant-appellant, Continental Bank, and that those funds were never credited to the Phillips’ account. The Bank moved for summary judgment asserting that there was no triable issue of material fact.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Bank sought summary judgment in its favor relying upon the following exculpatory clause in its “night depository agreement”:</p>
    <blockquote id="b77-7" data-blocks='[["BL_77.7",77,[228,1260,1107,535]]]'>“Bank shall be under no liability with respect to anything placed in the Night Depository, except for the amount of cash and checks actually taken into its possession upon opening the Night Depository Safe. In the event of any dispute as to whether or not the said bag dropped down the chute and entered the Night Depository Safe, or came into the possession of Bank, the report of the employee of Bank who shall open the Safe upon the following business day shall be conclusive and binding upon the undersigned.”</blockquote>

The Common Pleas Court <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>agreed and granted the Bank’s motion for summary-judgment.</p>
    <p id="b78-4" data-blocks='[["BL_78.4",78,[259,387,1158,1242]]]'>Phillips appealed to the Superior Court asserting only that the pleadings and affidavits raised sufficient issues of fact which foreclosed the right to summary judgment and required that the matter proceed to trial. Specifically appellee argued that the affidavits of the Bank employees could not, by themselves, create an irrebuttable presumption sufficient to preclude them from endeavoring to prove at trial that the deposit had in fact been made. Phillips, in the appeal before the Superior Court, did not challenge the validity of the exculpatory clause and conceded in argument before this Court that the decision not to raise the question at that juncture was a deliberate one, chosen for a specific tactical objective. Nevertheless, in deciding the cause before it, the Superi- or Court perceived the threshold issue to be: “whether a bank may contractually absolve itself from all liability in connection with the use of a night depository facility, so that its customers are required to use the facility at their sole risk.” After concluding that the exculpatory provision was invalid as a matter of law, the Superior Court then determined that there was a genuine issue of material fact and reversed the order of the court below granting summary judgment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

That issue was presented to the court of common pleas, yet Phillips’ brief to the Superior Court does not address the issue. Continental Bank’s brief to the Superior Court discusses the validity of the clause and states that Phillips did not appeal the trial court’s validity determination. Although Phillips stated in oral argument before this Court that it chose not to raise the issue in the Superior Court, the opinion of the Superior Court implies that the validity of the clause was raised. Although not briefed by Phillips to the Superior Court, the issue may have been raised in oral argument and thereby presented for decision. This Court has no way of knowing on the present record whether the issue was raised at oral argument. This case is therefore distinguishable from <em>Wiegand </em>where it was undisputed that the issue was neither briefed nor argued but reached sua sponte by the Superi- or Court in making its decision.</p>

On remand it should determine whether the validity of the clause was presented to it. If the validity of the clause was not argued, review should be limited to interpreting the clause to determine if there is a genuine issue of material fact to be tried. If the issue was raised at oral argument, however, the validity of the exculpatory clause was properly before the Superior Court and the principles of <em>Wiegand </em>are inapplicable. In that event its order should be reinstated and the case returned here for review.</p>
