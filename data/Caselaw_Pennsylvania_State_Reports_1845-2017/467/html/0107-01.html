On August 20, 1972, Parnell Butler was found murdered in his cell at Graterford Prison. On October 24, 1972, appellant was called as a witness by the Commonwealth during the preliminary hearing for Donald Reese, who was accused of the murder of Butler. Appellant’s testimony implicated Reese as the assailant, placed himself in the cell during the altercation which caused Butler’s death, and implicated himself as a participant in the slaying. Appellant was cross-examined by Reese’s attorney but he was not represented by counsel. On September 19, 1974, appellant was called as a witness at the trial of Reese for the murder of Butler. Appellant was sworn and testified that he had been “residing” at Graterford for the past two (2) years. Appellant then testified as follows:</p>
