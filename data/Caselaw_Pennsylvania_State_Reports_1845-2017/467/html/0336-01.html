After appellant finished the presentation of her case, the lower court granted appellees’ motion to dismiss appellant’s objections.

The thrust of her appeal to this Court is that certain contents of a safe deposit box were the subject of an inter vivos gift to her from Arthur Evans, the de<a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>ceased, and, consequently, should not have been included in his estate.</p>

Appellant cooked meals for the Evanses, cleaned their house, did their laundry and generally cared for Mrs. Evans. She received adequate compensation for performing these needed services. When Mrs. Evans died, appellant continued to cook at least one hot meal a day for Mr. Evans, do his laundry and make sure his house was tidy. After appellant was married, she continued to perform these same services and visited' Mr. Evans once a day. In May of 1971, following one of his four hospitalizations, the deceased moved into appellant’s home.</p>

During this last hospital stay, Reverend Cunnings visited with him and was told that Mr. Evans was giving the Reverend’s church $10,000.00 and that he had given the rest of his possessions and the keys to his safe deposit box to appellant. Mr. Evans expired on November 23,1971.</p>

Diamond National Bank, supra, </em>the donor and donee were husband and wife and had lived together harmoniously for many years. The husband had three safe deposit boxes registered in his name and the name of his wife and he designated one of them as his wife’s. He gave her the keys to that box. The Court found that she had complete control over that box and that he only entered it with her permission. Since she had complete control over the access to the box the Court found there was a valid delivery of the contents of the box to her.</p>

In the instant case, appellant did not have dominion and control over the box even though she was given the keys to it. The box remained registered in Mr. Evans’ name and she could not have gained access to it even with the keys. Mr. Evans never terminated his control over the box, consequently he never made a delivery, constructive or otherwise.</p>

First, he was not on his deathbed. He was ambulatory and not only went to the bank on October 22, 1971, but took walks thereafter and did not enter the hospital until November 5, 1971. On the day he went to the bank he could have rented a second safe deposit box in appellant’s name, delivered the contents of his box to it and then given the keys to appellant. He could have assigned the contents of his box to appellant. For that matter, he could have written a codicil to his will.</p>

On the record before us it is clear that regardless of Mr. Evans’ intention to make a gift to appellant, he never executed that intention and we will not do it for him. On these facts, we are constrained to hold that there was not an inter vivos gift to appellant and that the contents of the safe deposit box were properly included in the inventory of Mr. Evans’s estate.</p>

Despite appellant’s attempts to characterize the lower court’s order as granting a compulsory nonsuit, the lower court framed its relief as granting appellees’ motion to dismiss appellant’s objections. As such, this case does not fall within the ruling of <em>Jervis Will, supra. </em>We note that nothing could be gained by remanding the instant cause and allowing appellees to present their defense since the lower court has already correctly ruled on the failure of appellant to establish a prima facie case of a valid inter vivos gift.</p>
