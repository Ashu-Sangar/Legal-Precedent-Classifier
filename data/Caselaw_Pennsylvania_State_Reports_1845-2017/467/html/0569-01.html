The chancellor promptly held an unrecorded ex parte hearing on the complaint, after which he decreed that “defendant ... is preliminarily enjoined from selling, reselling, lending, distributing, exhibiting, giving away or showing any obscene literature, book, magazine, pamphlet, newspaper, storypaper, paper, comic book, writing, drawing, photograph, figure or image, or any obscene article, instrument or device at the premises known as ‘Continental Adult Book Store’</p>

On March 18-14 a trial was held with a jury, pursuant to the request of appellant, to which were submitted specific questions about thirteen publications which had been named in the complaint as allegedly sold by appellant and admitted into evidence; additional testimony was taken outside the presence of the jury about the alleged danger to the community presented by appellant’s adult bookstore. On March 19, 1975, the chancellor found the submitted publications obscene, and in his final decree not only enjoined their exhibition, sale, and distribution, but permanently enjoined appellant from operating the bookstore.

Pa.R.C.P. 1531(a) provides that “A court shall issue a preliminary or special injunction only after written notice and hearing unless it appears to the satisfaction of the court that immediate, and irreparable injury will be sustained before notice can be given or a hearing held . .” In the instant case there was nothing in either the complaint or the record of the subsequent formal hearing to indicate either the requisite “immediate and irreparable injury” or the impossibility of giving notice. The obscenity complaint was based on publications alleged to have been purchased on January 8, yet the complaint, alleging that “continued selling, distribution and exhibition . . . will cause immediate and irreparable loss and damage to the citizens of Northumberland County” and thereby seeking to justify the lack of notice, was itself not brought until February 13, more than a month later. In addition, the complaint spoke in general terms of the “violence frequently associated with <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>said type of business,” but it made no specific allegation of violence, either actual or imminent, in connection with this particular bookstore that might justify an immediate injunction without prior notice to appellant. The evidence offered at the subsequent preliminary hearing merely indicated that a person linked with the ownership of this bookstore had been the <em>victim </em>of violence and attempted violence in connection with bookstores in other parts of the Commonwealth, and that this bookstore had once been burglarized and the alleged burglars apprehended.</p>

This is particularly so where First Amendment freedoms are involved, and it is clear beyond question that, although obscenity itself has been held not to be protected by the Constitution, the narrow line between obscenity and protected speech needs to be discerned by sensitive judicial tools, and careful procedural safeguards must be maintained to guard against chilling restraints on protected speech. The ex parte procedures utilized in this case were plainly inadequate for this purpose. See <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Costa v.

Furthermore, the preliminary injunction, decreed after the ex parte hearing and continued after the formal hearing, prohibited not only the sale, exhibition, and distribution of the publications named in the complaint, but also that of a wide variety of unnamed “obscene” materials. Such a prohibition was overly broad in its insensitivity to the narrow line between obscenity and protected speech. Moreover, its failure to specify with sufficient clarity <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>and precision what acts were being restrained made it void on its face.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Cf. <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

In order to minimize prior restraints on protected speech and to provide for prompt adjudication of First Amendment questions, this Court in 1973 adopted Pa.R.C.P. 1531(f), which provides that when a court issues a preliminary injunction involving freedom of speech, the defendant may demand that a final hearing be held within three days and that a final decree be filed within twenty-four hours after the close of the hearing. The new rule further provides that if the final hearing is not held within the allotted three-day period, or the final decree not filed within the allotted twenty-four-hour period, “the injunction shall be deemed dissolved.” See also <em>Duggan v. 807 Liberty Ave., Inc., </em><a href="/pa/447/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="447 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="1942940" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0281-01">447 Pa. 281</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20750" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="288 A.2d 750">288 A.2d 750</a> (1972). Appellant herein contends that since it demanded a final hearing on February 21, 1975, and since the hearing was not scheduled until March 4 and was then rescheduled for March 12, not only was the preliminary injunction dissolved because of the delay, but the final hearing and injunction that followed it were also void as a matter of law. We note, however, that Rule 1531 (f) provides only for the dissolution of the preliminary injunction; the dissolution of a preliminary injunction in order to prevent an excessive prior restraint does not preclude a subsequent final adjudication of the complaint. In addition, the record discloses that, although appellant’s counsel filed a demand for a final hearing with the prothonotary on February 21 and served this on the district attorney on the same day, he did not present this demand to the <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>court, which subsequently scheduled the final hearing for the third court day after it had actually been advised of the demand. Appellant’s counsel then requested a jury trial, which could not be held until the following week. Therefore, we do not find that the court violated Rule 1531(f).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Appellant further argues that even if section 5903(h) is constitutional, the chancellor erred as a matter of law in finding all of the submitted publications obscene, Since the jury specifically found one of them not to be patently offensive and one of them not to be lacking in serious value. Since both the court and the parties appear to have regarded the role of the jury to have been merely advisory, as provided in Pa.R.C.P. 1513, we need not here determine whether section 5903(i), which specifically preserves the right to trial by jury in all proceedings under section 5903, confers a broader right to jury trial than would normally be the case in an equity proceeding. We note, however, that the chancellor, in finding all of the publications obscene, explicitly adopted the findings of the jury.</p>

I do not join the opinion announcing the judgment, however, because I cannot agree with the opinion’s intimation that a lawful business may be enjoined as a nuisance merely because it is unpopular and therefore a target of violence. This is especially true where, as here, the business is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b612-4" data-blocks='[["BL_612.4",612,[258,690,1159,1238]]]'>The opinion announcing the judgment states, “It is well-settled that even a lawful business may be enjoined if it is shown that, under the particular circumstances of its operation, it constitutes a public nuisance.” Although this is generally true, I believe the rule is subject to an important caveat. When parties are engaged in lawful activity which for some reason is unpopular with other people, the lawful activity may not be enjoined because the dissatisfaction of others erupts into breaches of the peace.
