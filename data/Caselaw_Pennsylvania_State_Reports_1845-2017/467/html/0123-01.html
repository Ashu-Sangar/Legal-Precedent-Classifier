Nevertheless, we think that, even absent such a specific request, a prosecutor has the duty to make available to the defense evidence that is truly exculpatory, rather than merely favorable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
      <em>Brady </em>suggests that such evidence would be “material either to guilt or to punishment.” Exculpatory evidence has also been defined as “evidence which extrinsieally tends to establish defendant’s innocence of the crimes charged, as differentiated from that which although favorable, is merely collateral or impeaching.” <em>People v. Bottom, </em><a href="/misc2d/76/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="76 Misc. 2d 525" data-case-ids="1271148" data-case-paths="/misc2d/76/0525-01">76 Misc.2d 525</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=351%20N.Y.S.2d%20328" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="351 N.Y.S.2d 328">351 N.Y.S.2d 328</a>, 334-35 (1974).

The record does suggest the existence of statements indicating that at this scene of gang hostility other members of appellant’s own gang were observed with drawn knives — one of which may even have had blood on it— and that someone had a cane. But in view of Gee’s own repeated, uncontroverted, and independently corroborated admission that he had stabbed Glenn Cook, the finding of the pathologist that either wound sustained by <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>Cook in itself would have been fatal, and the absence of any statement other than Gee’s own placing a cahe or any other weapon in the hands of the decedent, these statements would seem neither to have supported Gee’s claim of self-defense nor to have suggested the provocation needed to reduce murder to manslaughter.</p>
    <p id="b164-4" data-blocks='[["BL_164.4",164,[279,635,1163,1408]]]'>On the day of his arrest, Gee was given a polygraph examination, and he now argues that, apart from the question of the admissibility of the polygraph results themselves which will be discussed subsequently, the Commonwealth’s failure to turn over to defense counsel “every test, every result, every interview sheet that was taken in connection with that polygraph test” was a violation of its duty to turn over exculpatory evidence. This evidence was exculpatory in the sense that it certainly contained exculpatory statements by appellant, but not in the sense that its denial precluded him from any additional evidence; it did not “extrinsically” tend to establish innocence or to mitigate guilt. The record of the suppression hearing makes it clear that the results of the examination were inconclusive, and that in the course of this examination appellant merely gave the same version of the stabbing he gave in his prior informal statement and his subsequent formal statement. Both of these statements were admitted into evidence, and any additional probative value of evidence that he remained firm and consistent in his version of events at an intermediate time would clearly be minimal in light of the consistency already shown and should not be allowed to outweigh the danger of improper inferences arising from references to the polygraph examination.

The changes, however, were not exculpatory in nature and appeared rather to strengthen the evidence of guilt. Appellant nevertheless now argues that in not calling these witnesses the Commonwealth failed in its obligation not to withhold testimony favorable to the accused, apparently on the theory that it thereby precluded him from cross-examining these witnesses about the inconsistencies with their prior statements. The law is clear, however, that the Com<a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>monwealth is not required to call to the stand all available witnesses, particularly if it regards them as unreliable, as long as it makes their names and whereabouts available to the defense.

The Commonwealth here made all such witnesses available to the defense, and indeed procured them for the defense to call at trial if it chose to do so.

Since it appeared that these witnesses might have been involved with one side or the other in the gang hostility that accompanied the killing, a hearing was held in the judge’s chambers to advise each potential witness of his right to counsel and his right not to incriminate himself, and some of them eventually chose not to testify and were excused for this reason. Others indicated that they were willing to testify, but it became apparent that at least some of them were eager to testify not for Gee, but against him. Because of this, the judge repeatedly warned defense counsel that such witnesses might be harmful to his client, and that if he made them his witnesses and they testified adversely, he could not claim surprise and impeach them with their prior statements. Counsel indicated that he still expected them to testify in a manner consistent with their statements to the police, and that this would be helpful to his client. When these witnesses were called to the stand, they did not testify as counsel hoped, and all efforts at contradition or impeachment by means of the prior statements were objected to <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>by the Commonwealth and precluded by the court.

It is generally thought to be a relic of the primitive time when parties were not supported by witnesses in the modern sense of the word, but by “oath-helpers” whose function was not to attest to facts but the purely partisan one of swearing for the party calling them. See 3A Wigmore, Evidence § 896 (Chadbourn rev. 1970). Since these oath-helpers were ordinarily chosen by the party from among his own relatives, friends, or adherents and countered by similar oath-helpers representing the other side, it was thought appropriate to regard each party as vouching for the credibility of his own witnesses and bound by what they affirmed. Courts have long recognized, however, that a strict application of the ancient voucher rule under the conditions of modern jurisprudence can lead to injustice, and so they have articulated and developed a number of exceptions to the rule, usually without questioning whether the rule itself remains a valid one.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> One such well-established exception permits a party, who has been surprised by an adverse statement made by a witness he has called, to cross-examine him on the basis of his prior inconsistent statements.

In this case, however, the trial judge has indicated in his opinion denying Gee’s motion for a new trial that his refusal to allow cross-examination about the witnesses’ prior statements was based not only on the absence of surprise but also on the collateralness of the prior inconsistencies to the issues of fact to be determined by the jury.</p>

He also declared in his statement that he had stabbed the decedent only once and then retreated, while the Commonwealth’s witness, Steven Lambert, testified that, still swinging his knife, he followed in the direction of the retreating Glenn Cook. However, even if the jury were to accept Gee’s version of subsequent events, the uncontroverted and undisputed opinion of the expert pathologist was that either wound alone would have been fatal; thus, Gee would have been responsible for Glenn Cook’s death even if another had subsequently stabbed him. Therefore, although we are hampered by the absence in the record of the statements given by these witnesses to <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>the police and regarded by Gee as exculpatory, and by Gee’s failure to specify clearly why he regarded them as such and what he would have been able to prove had the witnesses testified consistently with their prior statements, a careful reading of the record suggests that his reliance on their exculpatory nature was misplaced.</p>

Another witness, Charles Waters, had apparently told the police prior to trial that he had seen several boys with knives and one with a cane, and he repeated this on the witness stand. On cross-examination by the Commonwealth, however, he stated that the boy with the cane was not the decedent but Michael Leatherbury, a member of the June Street Gang. Since the original statement apparently did not say that Glenn Cook had the cane, only that somebody did, there was no contradiction of the earlier statement, only an amplification of it. Defense counsel obviously hoped that testimony that a cane was present would lend support to Gee’s story, but significantly he did not ask the witness who had the cane, and so obviously did not rely on any previous statement that it was in the possession of the decedent. When the Commonwealth brought out on cross-examination the damaging testimony that it was a member of Gee’s own gang who was swinging the cane, thus not only casting doubt on Gee’s version of events but suggesting to the jury where he might have gotten the idea for his story, defense counsel had not only no basis for surprise, but no prior contradiction to provide a basis for impeachment. Similarly, the witness, Leroy Malachi, had apparently stated to the police that Leatherbury had a knife, while on direct he stated that he had a cane; on cross, however, he resolved the apparent contradiction by testifying that Leatherbury had both a knife and a cane, and that he regularly carried the cane because of a crippled leg.</p>

But one potential witness who had told this to the police declined to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds, as did White Mouse himself. Waters, who did take the stand, denied that he saw White Mouse with a knife in his hand; in his statement he apparently had said that White Mouse did have a knife, though there was no indication he said it had blood on it. In view of Gee’s admission that he had stabbed the decedent, an inconsistency as to whether the witness had seen White Mouse with a knife, even one that might have had blood on it, particularly since he did testify he had seen others with knives, was clearly a matter collateral to the issue of whether or not decedent had attacked appellant with a cane.

Even more clearly collateral and irrelevant were defense counsel’s efforts to bring out apparent inconsistencies as to whether or not Glenn Cook was a member of the Moon Gang, particularly since another witness, Kevin Miller, did state that he was. Certainly even if it were established beyond all doubt that the decedent was a member of the rival gang, this, in itself, would lend no support to Gee’s claim that Glenn Cook had attacked him with a cane.</p>

Nor, for the same reason, was it an abuse of discretion for the judge subsequently to refuse to allow defense counsel to impeach these witnesses indirectly through the police officers who took down their statements. We are of the opinion that such judicial discretion is important as a check on the delay and confusion which can be caused by collateral testimony, and that the burden must remain with a defendant, not strictly surprised by adverse testimony and seeking to cross-examine an adverse witness he himself has called, of showing that the denial of such cross-examination would be an injustice to him because the prior statement depended upon was exculpatory and sufficiently indicative of reliability to make reliance upon it reasonable.

Certainly it is incumbent upon us to be alert to developments in this field so that, if indeed lie detectors have passed beyond the experimental stage to a trustworthiness comparable to that of other scientific tests whose results have immeasurably aided our courts in their search for truth, we do not deny ourselves the enlightenment they might provide.

A party does not hold out his witnesses as worthy of belief, since he rarely has a free choice in selecting them.

When they testified in accordance with their changed stories, appellant’s counsel plead surprise and asked that he be allowed to impeach on the basis of the prior inconsistent statements. The trial court did not allow him to do so. Although the trial court explaned to appellant and his counsel before the witnesses were called that it would not allow any claim of surprise, and though this ruling was probably sustainable, I believe that we should reverse the ruling which kept these relevent and freely given statements from the jury.</p>
