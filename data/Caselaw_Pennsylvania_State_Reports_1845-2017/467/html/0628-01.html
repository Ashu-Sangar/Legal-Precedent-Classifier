The background and circumstances giving rise to this particular appeal are as follows:</p>
    <p id="b662-10" data-blocks='[["BL_662.10",662,[281,1595,1153,591]]]'>On November 12, 1971, John H. Smith wrote at Alice G. Clark’s request what purported to be Mrs. Clark’s last will and testament. That document made fourteen specific legacies totalling $56,000.00 among which were a $5000.00 bequest to Harry S. Leech, Mrs. Clark’s nephew, and his wife, and a $10,000.00 bequest to Lyda Smith, wife of John H. Smith. The remainder of the estate, constituting approximately $135,000.00, was left to John H. Smith, a first cousin, as residuary beneficiary. Smith was also made executor without bond under the will. Alice G. Clark died on April 22,1972 at age 77.</p>

      <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>On April 26, 1972, the above will was admitted to probate. Harry S. Leech appealed from the order of the Register of Wills alleging that the decedent lacked testamentary capacity and/or that the contested writing was procured by undue influence and duress practiced upon Mrs. Clark by John H. Smith. The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Orphans’ Court Division, found that Mrs. Clark possessed testamentary capacity at the time the will was made. However, that court found that Mrs. Clark suffered from diminished mental and physical capacities; that a confidential relationship between Smith and Clark existed at that time; and that Smith exercised undue influence over Mrs. Clark in procuring his place in the will. The court decree that the residuary clause of the will and Smith’s appointment as executor be set aside and also directed the revocation of the letters testamentary which had been granted to Smith. Exceptions to that ruling were filed and dismissed by the court en banc. This court affirmed.

Smith and his wife Lyda<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> presented at the will contest hearing which can be summarized as follows. John H. Smith testified that in late <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>November of 1971, Mrs. Clark contacted the Dollar Savings Bank concerning the procedure necessary to close a savings account she had with that institution. She then directed John H. Smith, who was, and had been, handling her business affairs and possessed a power of attorney to sign checks on her behalf, to take whatever steps were necessary to close the account but not to finalize the transaction until after the interest payable for the month of November was credited to the principal. On December 3, 1971, Mrs. Clark prepared a signed withdrawal slip and directed Smith to finalize the transaction. Smith returned with a check in the amount of $23,010.08, drawn on the Dollar Savings Bank and made payable to Mrs. Clark. On December 6, 1971, Mrs. Clark endorsed the check without restriction and instructed Smith to return $1,500.00, intended for her use in buying Christmas presents, but to keep the balance as a gift from Mrs. Clark to Smith and his wife. Smith testified that he objected the gift was excessive .but that Mrs. Clark insisted he take the money and invest it for his own benefit. That same day, Smith purchased a certificate of deposit in the amount of $20,000.00, deposited $1,510.08 in his personal checking account and returned $1,500.00 to Mrs. Clark. Finally, Smith testified that he told no one except his wife and personal accountant<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> about the gift at this time.</p>

Smith, testified that she knew nothing of the gift until December 6, 1971 when her husband returned home, showed her the certificate of deposit and told her of Mrs. Clark’s generosity. She testified that when she next saw Mrs. Clark, she thanked her for the gift but Lyda Smith could not remember Mrs. Clark’s response or any comment Mrs. Clark may have <a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>made concerning the gift.

The rationale of that decree was stated in the alternative by the chancellor. First, he concluded that the testimony offered by the Smiths failed to establish donative intent and delivery, the necessary elements of a gift, <em>Rankin v.

In the alternative, the chancellor concluded, even if the testimony established a prima facie case that a gift from Clark to Smith was made on December 6, 1971, that prima facie case raised a rebuttable presumption of the validity of the gift and shifted the burden to Leech to rebut that presumption by clear, precise and convincing evidence. <em>Fenstermaker Estate, </em><a href="/pa/413/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="413 Pa. 645" data-case-ids="1888604" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0645-01">413 Pa. 645</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.2d%20857" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="198 A.2d 857">198 A.2d 857</a> (1964); <em>Rogan Estate, </em><a href="/pa/404/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="404 Pa. 205" data-case-ids="1301477" data-case-paths="/pa/404/0205-01">404 Pa. 205</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=171%20A.2d%20177" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="171 A.2d 177">171 A.2d 177</a> (1961). The chancellor concluded further that Leech had carried his burden and rebutted the presumption by showing that a confidential relationship existed between Smith and Clark at the time of the gift.
