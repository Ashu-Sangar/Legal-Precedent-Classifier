    "head_matter": "Northampton County, Appellant, v. Easton Passenger Railway Co.\nTaxation \u2014 Corporations\u2014Property incident to exercise of corporate functions.\nThe property of canal and railroads companies, and other quasi public corporations, necessary for the exercise of their several franchises, as depots, toll houses and water stations, is not taxable for local purposes. The reason for this exemption is that these things enter into the very composition of the works of these corporations and are essential to the exercise of their corporate functions, and for this reason are taxed by the state as included in the capital of the said corporation.\nCase stated \u2014 Pacts agreed upon \u2014 Court will not go outside the agreement. In an action by a county to recover taxes against a street railway company, the ease stated agreed upon, declared \u201cthat the said lot and stables and the said horses, cars and vehicles are used only in and about the business of conveying passengers and produce, according to the defendant\u2019s corporate powers, and that they are appurtenant, necessary and indispensable therefor.\u201d\nHeld, That the court will not go outside of the case stated, and that this agreement therein as to the facts clearly brings the case within the principle above stated.\nQuery, whether apart from the above agreement, such property would be held to be exempt.\nArgued March 10, 1892.\nAppeal, No. 292, Jan. T., 1892., by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. Northampton Co., Feb. T., 1889, No. 49, for defendant, on case stated.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell and Heydrick, J.J,\nCase stated in the nature of a special verdict for recovery of county taxes.\nFrom the case stated it appeared that defendant\u2019s lot and stables, horses, cars and vehicles, had been assessed for county purposes and a tax thereon, amounting to \u00a716.72, had been levied. It was \u201cagreed that the said lot and stables and the said horses, cars and vehicles are used only in and about the business of conveying passengers and produce, according to the defendant\u2019s corporate powers, and that they are appurtenant, necessary and indispensable therefor. It is further agreed that the lot aforesaid, with the improvements and also the horses, cars and other vehicles, are a part of the capital stock of the corporation, defendant, and are wholly included in the same, and as such pay the usual state tax to the commonwealth. The stock of the corporation defendant is owned by individuals, who are liable to and pay tax thereon to the said county plaintiff.\u201d\nThe court Reeder, J., entered judgment for the defendant. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was the entry of judgment for defendant.\nGeorge W. Geiser, for appellant. \u2014\nOnly property indispensable to the construction and operation of a railway is exempt from taxation for local purposes. Property of the character of that sought to be taxed in this case is liable: Railroad v. Berks Co., 6 Pa. 70; Wayne County v. Canal Co., 15 Pa. 351; Erie County v. Transportation Co., 87 Pa. 434.\nMarch 28, 1892:\nFrank Reeder, Frederick Green with him, for appellee."
