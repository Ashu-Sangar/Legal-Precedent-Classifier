    "head_matter": "City of Chester v. Phila., Reading & Pottsville Telegraph Co., Appellant.\nTelegraph poles \u2014 License fees.\nSee preceding case.\nArgued Feb. 11, 1892.\nAppeal, No. 250, Jan. T., 1892, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Delaware Co., for plaintiff, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Heylrick, JJ.\nAssumpsit to recover license fees for maintenance of telegraph poles.\nThe statement filed was to recover license fees of $1 per pole per annum imposed by city ordinance. Defendant\u2019s affidavit of defence was to the effect that: (1) plaintiff had no authority in law to impose such tax ; (2) the telegraph poles erected and maintained by the defendant in the city of Chester were not the subjects of taxation for revenue purposes by the plaintiff ; (3) that these taxes were imposed not for police, but for revenue purposes, the city not having expended any money whatever, nor by its officers directed any attention whatever to the supervision, control or police surveillance of the poles of the defendant.\nThe court, Clayton, P. J., entered judgment for the plaintiff, holding that \u201c the right of the city to charge a reasonable license fee for the privilege of obstructing the public streets and for necessary police supervision and public protection, has been too well settled to require further notice. It is not a tax for revenue, but a police charge for the necessary liability of the city to supervise the use of its streets. The sum charged is not unreasonable, and the defendant must pay the license fee or remove the poles.\u201d\nJudgment for plaintiff $421.88, with costs. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was the entry of judgment in favor of the plaintiff.\nW. I. Sehaffer, W. B. Broomall with him, for appellant.\nOrlando Harvey, for appellee.\nMarch 28, 1892:"
