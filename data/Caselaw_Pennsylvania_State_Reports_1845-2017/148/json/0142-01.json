Cbeyney, from decree of O. C. Delaware Co., dismissing exceptions to report of auditor distributing the share of Howard Dickinson, one of the heirs, in the estate of William Dickinson, deceased.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Heydrtck, JJ.\nClaim of a judgment creditor of one of the heirs on the heir\u2019s portion of a fund produced by a sale in partition of decedent\u2019s real estate.\nThe facts appear by the opinion of the court below, Wad-dell, P. J., specially presiding, dismissing exceptions to the report of V. Gilpin Robinson, Esq., the auditor appointed to make distribution. The opinion was as follows :\n\u201c The fund for distribution is the share of one of the heirs of William Dickinson, dec\u2019d, ascertained by proceedings in partition in the orphans\u2019 court. The heir entitled bo the share was indebted to his father at the time of his death in an amount exceeding his share, and since the death, and before the adjudication, judgments were entered against him to a large amount by several creditors. Under these circumstances, the heir, accepting the real estate at the valuation, paid this share into court under the provisions of \u00a7 49 of the act of March 29, 1882. It is, therefore, in the hands of the court for distribution among creditors or others, \u2018 with like powers as exercised by the court of common law, where money is paid in by sheriffs or coroners.\u2019 The other heirs claim it should be applied to the liquidation of the indebtedness to the father, while the creditors claim it should be applied to the payment of their judgments in their order. No doubt the fund for distribution bears the impress of realty, and the judgments being entered before the adjudication, they will follow the fund, and are entitled to be paid out of it, if they take precedence of the debt due the father.\n\u201c The rights of all the creditors must depend upon the rights of this heir. They claim through him. His right to this share depends upon his right to have a proportional part of the valuation money of his father\u2019s real estate. It is the father\u2019s estate which is being distributed. All the interest this son has in the land, or the proceeds of the land, he derives from his father under the intestate laws of the commonwealth. That interest is an equal share with the other children in the decedent\u2019s other estate, whether real or personal. After proceedings in partition, each heir is entitled to receive a proportional part\u00ae of the valuation money. A proportional amount is defined to be, such a share as shall make each child equal with the others, after deducting his advancements: Dutch\u2019s Ap., 57 Pa. 467. If one child is allowed to retain what he has already received from his father, whether in the shape of money paid for his benefit at his request, and thus regarded as a debt, or paid directly to him for his use, and thus regarded as an advancement, and is also allowed to receive his full share of the estate besides, he is certainly receiving more than an equal share of the estate of the father. In equity, an equal distribution can only be effected by charging him with the advancement, or requiring him to pay his indebtedness by applying his share of the estate to that object. If this was a contest between Howard Dickinson, the son indebted, and the other heirs, we think no question could arise as to their right to defalk his indebtedness to the father\u2019s estate. His indebtedness to the father would be regarded as assets in their hands for the purpose of adjustment, and when he demanded his share of the recognizance, they could require him to pay his debt before receiving a share of the estate. Especially would this be the case if he invoked the aid of the orphans\u2019 court to enforce his demand. He would be entitled to receive what was left after deducting what he owed the estate.\n\u201c It must be remembered that the fund is in the hands of the orphans\u2019 court, and the jurisdiction of that court has been invoked by the parties in interest. That court, therefore, has exclusive jurisdiction over the question of disbursement, with power to decide all questions necessary to a proper distribution : Kittera\u2019s Est., 17 Pa. 423. It has authority to ascertain the amount of a decedent\u2019s property, and order its distribution among those entitled to receive it, and those thus entitled have been deemed to embrace heirs, next of kin, legatees and creditors: Kittera\u2019s Est., 17 Pa. 422; Whiteside v. Whiteside, 20 Pa. 474; Ashford v. Ewing, 25 Pa. 215. Its jurisdiction will be so exercised as to dispose of every subject embraced within the contest, and will be made so effectual as to afford complete relief to all the parties in interest: Shollenberger\u2019s Ap., 21 Pa. 340. It was in the exercise of these powers that the court \u2022declared in Springer\u2019s Ap., 29 Pa. 208, that \u2018if one of the heirs of an estate is indebted to it, he may be treated in its distribution as having an advancement to the amount of his debt.\u2019 The same principle and right, based upon the same power, is recognized in Lucas\u2019s Ap., 53 Pa. 404, and Thompson\u2019s Ap., 42 Pa. 357, 358. The heir who owes the estate is presumed to have in his hands, already, assets of the estate, sufficient to pay and satisfy his share. He is thus paid by operation of law, and the orphans\u2019 court, when it comes to distribute the fund, does -equity by applying these assets to the payment of his share: Thompson\u2019s Ap., 42 Pa. 357. - His share of the estate has been absorbed, as it were, and he therefore has no further interest in it. For this reason, there is -nothing for the judgments to attach to, and they are not considered in the distribution. It will be seen that the right to appropriate the share in this way does not depend upon the common law doctrine of set-off, but upon the exercise of the chancery powers vested in the orphans\u2019 court. As is said by Vice-Chancellor Stuart, in Smith v. Smith, 5 Law Times, N. S. 302, and quoted approvingly in Thompson\u2019s Ap., supra, page 358, \u2018the expression retainer or set-off is not a proper one, for it is not a question of retainer or set-off, but the question of the right on the part of the legatee to receive payment of the legacy, having regard to the amount of the debt due to the testator\u2019s estate; so long as the debt remains undischarged .... the legatee will not be entitled to receive the legacy.\u2019 The court then goes on to say that, whether the claim in the case before them (Thompson\u2019s Appeal) was an advancement or a debt, it must be discharged by the legatee before he can claim his legacy, or, in other words, the legacy must first be applied to pay the debt, and then the balance belongs to him. We see no difference in applying this principle between a legacy and a distributive share.\n\u201c If we are correct in our view of the authority under which the court acts, then it makes no difference whether the funds in the hands of the court for distribution, are the proceeds of real or personal property: Manifold\u2019s Est., 5 W. & S. 341; Springer\u2019s Ap., 29 Pa. 208. All that is necessary is for the orphans\u2019 court to have control of the fund for the purpose of distribution, and the parties interested before it, and it will ascertain and enforce such equities as are necessary to equalize, as far as it can, the shares of the respective heirs in the estate of decedent. And this doctrine is not controverted by the case of Wallace v. Keyser, 51 Pa. 493. In that case, certain heirs were endeavoring to enforce an agreement made by themselves, through a bill in equity. They were\u00b0not in the orphans\u2019 court, and the court very properly held that the debts of the heir to the testator could not be taken out of the proceeds of sale, before the payment of judgment creditors, for the reason that the proceeds of sale were not a fund, in course of distribution; but the contest was over the purchase money from a private sale by the heirs, put into the hands of a third person,' for the use\" of the judgment creditors, in lieu of the liens which they released. If this is not entirely clear from the case itself, it is made so by what the court say in Hughes\u2019 Ap., 57 Pa. 179.\nMarch 28, 1892:\n\u201c These views lead us necessarily to the support of the auditor\u2019s report. We believe he is correct in applying the fund in question to the payment of the debt due the estate, and in distributing the share of the heir among those interested in the estate of the decedent. We must, therefore, dismiss the exceptions and confirm the report of the auditor.\u201d\nHrrors assigned were (1) dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report; (2) confirming the report; (3) not awarding to appellant the amount of his judgment against Howard Dickinson.\nHorace L. Qheyney, for appellant.\nGfarrett H. Smedley, Henry Q. Howard with him, for appellees."
