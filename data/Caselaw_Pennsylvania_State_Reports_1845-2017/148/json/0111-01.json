    "head_matter": "Commonwealth v. Brauninger, Appellant. Commonwealth v. Kleinmann, Appellant.\nLiquor laws \u2014 Bottler's license \u2014 Delivery to purchaser in adjoining county. Commonwealth v. Hess, Appellant, ante, p. 98, followed.\nArgued Feb. 2, 1892.\nAppeals, Nos. 112 and 113, July T., 1891, by defendants, Sophia Brauninger and Gottlieb Kleinmann, from judgments of Q. S. Montgomery Co., June T., 1891, Nos. 30 and 31.\nBefore Paxson, G. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell and Heydbick, JJ.\nIndictments for selling liquor without a license.\nThe evidence on the trial before Weand, P. J., disclosed a state of facts similar to those in the ease of Commonwealth v. Hess, ante, p. 98. Defendant Brauninger was the holder of a bottler\u2019s license in Philadelphia county, and defendant Kleinmann was the driver of her wagon.\nCommonwealth v. Brauninger, Appellant.\nDefendant submitted the following point:\n\u201c The evidence being that the defendant, a licensed wholesale liquor dealer in Philadelphia, received at her place of business by mail orders for lager beer, which she caused her driver to fill by delivery to a hotel beeper in Montgomery county, who sometimes paid her at her place of business, sometimes by check through the mail, and at other times to the driver, the court is requested to charge the jury that this does not constitute an offence under the law, and that the verdict should be \u2018Not guilty.\u2019 Answer: I cannot so charge you. If defendant, although licensed in Philadelphia, received orders from Montgomery county, and sent the lager beer by her own driver and wagon to this county and delivered it here and was paid for it through her driver here, either by money or check, she is guilty of violation of the law.\u201d [1, 2, 3]\nThe court charged the jury, in part, as follows:\n\u201c The delivery of the goods and receipt of the price, or any part of it, by the defendant\u2019s driver, in Montgomery county, at any time within two years preceding the finding of the indictment, constituted a sale by the defendant in this county and a violation of the law.\u201d [4]\nMarch 28, 1892:\nCommonwealth v.

The court is requested to charge the jury that this does not constitute an offence under the law, and that the verdict of the jury should be \u2018not guilty.\u2019 Answer : I cannot so instruct you. Under the above state of facts, the defendant would be guilty of a violation of the law.\u201d [1, 2, 8]\nThe court charged the jury in part as follows :\n\u201c The delivery of the goods and receipt of the price or any part of it, by the defendant, in Montgomery county, at any time within two years preceding the finding of the indictment, constituted a sale in this county, and a violation of the law.\u201d [4]\nVerdicts, guilty, and judgments thereon. Defendants appealed.\nHrrors assigned were, in each appeal, (1-8) refusal to affirm defendant\u2019s point and the answer given thereto, quoting point and answer; (4) the portion of the charge above quoted.\nIrving P. Wanger, with him Irvin P. Knipe and John Dolman, for appellant.\nHenry M. Brownhack, district attorney, B. H. Chain with him, for appellee.\nCommonwealth v. Bbauningeb,, Appellant."
