The principal contention was over the judgment of Yietor & Achclis, which the appellants contended was a void instrument, and did not warrant the entering of judgment and the issuing of execution: See second specification. We cannot say that it was a void instrument. It was a note for $12,500, payable to the maker or bearer, with a confession of judgment for that sum. Upon this note judgment was entered by the firm, Vie-tor & Aehelis, bearers, through their attorney. The consideration of the note was the subject of inquiry, both by the auditor and the court below, aided by the verdict of the jury in a feigned issue. We think it was entitled to participate in the distribution.\nThe decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.",

T., 1892, by William Wood & Company and Knower & Cooley, from decree of C. P. Luzerne Co., dismissing exceptions to report of auditor distributing proceeds of sheriff\u2019s sale under sundry executions, one of which was issued on judgment of Vietor & Achelis v. Johnson, Dec. T., 1889, No. 430.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nClaim that above plaintiffs should not participate in said distribution.\nFrom the report of the auditor, R. C. Shoemaker, it appeared that William Wood & Company were attaching creditors of Johnson, and that Knower & Cooley were judgment creditors and had issued a fi. fa. subsequent to that issued on the judgment of Yietor & Achelis. The note of Vietor and Achelis on which their judgment was entered was as follows :\n\u201c \u00a712,500.\n\u201c Wilkesbarre, Pa., November 12th, 1889.\n\u201c Four days after date I promise to pay to myself or bearer twelve thousand five hundred dollars ($12,500) value received, without defalcation with interest, and I do hereby confess judgment for the said sum waiving inquisition and all exemption ^aws'\n\u201cWitness my hand and seal:\nR. P. Johnson, (seal.) \u201d\nThe following praecipe was attached to the note:\n\u201c George Frederic Vietor,. Thomas Achelis, Carl Vietor and John Achelis, partners, trading as Frederic Vietor & Achelis, Bearers, v. R. P. Johnson. In Common Pleas of Luzerne County. No.\n\u201c Enter judgment on the above note.\n\u201cJohn T. Lenahan.\n\u201c Atty. for Plffs.\u201d\nThe auditor allowed the judgment of Vietor & Achelis to participate in the distribution. The following exceptions, among others, were filed to the auditor\u2019s report: \u201c Third. The auditor erred in not finding as matter of law, that the note on which the judgment of Vietor & Achelis was entered was a void instrument, and did not warrant the entering of judgment and the issuing of execution.\u201d [2] \u201cFourth. The auditor erred in not finding as matter of law that the entry of judgment on the note of Vietor & Achelis, as bearers, was irregular and void.\u201d [3] The court overruled the exceptions; but directed an issue to be framed between Vietor & Achelis, as plaintiffs, and the appellants, among others, as defendants, to try the questions whether the note upon which the Vietor & Achelis judgment was entered was given by Johnson to them for a valuable consideration; and whether said note and confession of judgment were given for the purpose of hindering or defrauding the petitioners for the issue. A verdict and judgment were entered in this issue for the plaintiffs, in January, 1892; and, in February, the auditor\u2019s report was confirmed absolutely.\nErrors assigned were, among others, (2, 3) overruling the appellants\u2019 third and fourth exceptions to the report of the auditor, quoting them.\nJohn Marshall Grest, S. J. Strauss, F. O. Sturges and John Spar hawk, Jr., with him for appellants.\nJohn T. Lenahan, not heard, for appellee.\nApril 25, 1892:"
