Of course cases can be easily conceived in which the alteration of an instrument would be so apparent by a mere inspection of it that there could be no possible question, and in such a case it might be the duty of the court to say to the jury that such and such things in particular cases have been altered; but other cases might easily arise in which the alteration, although material if made, was so doubtful and so slight that it would be impossible for the court to say positively that there had been an alteration, and that it was apparent by a mere inspection of the instrument. In such cases the question would naturally go to the jury for their decision; and this case, as I understand it, is a case of that kind, and I therefore refer to you the question whether this note has been altered, and that is the first question for your decision.] [2] . . .</p>
