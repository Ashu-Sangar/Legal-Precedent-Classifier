If the jury should find against defendant on the first point, and if the defendant had really been guilty of a breach of contract in removing from the premises, and refusing to pay rent therefor, after April 1, 1888, such breach of contract occurred in the lifetime of said Mary A. Murphy, and the cause of action for the recovery of damages (if any) occasioned thereby accrued unto the said Maiy A. Murphy, and such damages can only be recovered by said Mary Murphy or the legal representative of her estate, to wit: her executor, or administrator, and that said John Murphy, suing in his individual <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>capacity, has no cause of action against, this defendant, and therefore cannot recover in the present action, and the verdict of the jury must be for defendant.</p>

But as the testimony shows that Losch removed from and vacated and surrendered the premises in December, 1887, and was not at the time of the death of the said Mary Murphy, or any time thereafter in the possession or occupancy of said premises, and was not at any time the tenant of said John Murphy, after his estate by the curtesy commenced, the plaintiff cannot recover, and the verdict of the jury must be for defendant.</p>
