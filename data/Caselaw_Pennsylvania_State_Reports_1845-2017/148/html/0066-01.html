L. 79, was to compel railroad companies to give the owners of farms a convenient mode of access from one part to the other when divided by a railroad. While it may not be impossible for a farmer in gathering his crops to make a detour of half a mile in getting from one field to an adjoining field, it would nevertheless be intolerably inconvenient.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b92-11" data-blocks='[["BL_92.13",92,[289,1541,1180,288]]]'>Defendant’s railroad was located through plaintiff’s farm. Defendant constructed a crossing for plaintiff over their tracks, but afterwards removed it, claiming that plaintiff had access by a public road. The route by way of this public highway required him to make a detour of about half a mile to pass from one portion of his farm to the other, while the crossing which the company constructed and afterwards removed gave him convenient access.</p>

The facts are, that the planked crossing which the company has removed gave him convenient access from one portion of his farm to the other. He still has such access, but by a circuitous route. The Emaus road passes along one side of his property, until it intersects a turnpike road at nearly right angles. By passing along these two roads, and in part by lands of another person, he can reach that portion of his farm lying on the south side of the railroad, and on the opposite side from his buildings. Thus, by making a detour of about half a mile, he can reach the southern <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>side of his farm. If it were a detour of five miles, the principle would be the same. The plain object of the act of 1849 was to compel railroad companies to give the owners of farms a convenient mode of access from one part to the other, when divided by a railroad. While it may not be impossible for a farmer, in gathering his crops, to make a detour of half a mile in getting from one field to an adjoining field, it would nevertheless be intolerably inconvenient. It was to provide for such and similar cases that the act of 1849 was passed. The facts of this case do not require us to consider whether a road skirting a man’s land, or passing along the edge of it, is a road “ running through” a man’s land, within the meaning of said act. As before observed, its object was to furnish convenient access from one part of the land to the other, and we quite agree with the learned court below, that the crossing referred to was necessary to give such access, and that it ought not to have been removed.</p>
