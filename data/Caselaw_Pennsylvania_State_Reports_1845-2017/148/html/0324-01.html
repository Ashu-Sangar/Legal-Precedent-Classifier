    <p class="summary" id="b351-5" data-blocks='[["BL_351.6",351,[156,596,1170,1064]]]'>“ This is an action brought by James T. Glass against Enoch Fritz to recover damages for obstructing the natural course of the water and throwing it back on plaintiff’s land. The plaintiff and defendant own adjacent farms in Brady township, this •county. Some years ago the defendant built a private ■ road ■over his land, along the southern boundary of the plaintiff’s land. This road, it is claimed by the plaintiff, is somewhat higher than the lands of the parties on either side thereof. At a certain point in this road shown on the map used in this case, the plaintiff contends, the waters which fell on his lands were accustomed to flow and pass over the lands of defendant, until obstructed by him. It is alleged that many years ago a ditch was dug by the plaintiff through his land from the public road, shown on map, to this private road of defendant, at the point where the latter filled up the crossing which had previously •carried the water over said road on the lands of defendant. [This ditch, it is alleged by plaintiff, was dug through a ravine and in the same channel or course through which the waters that fell on his land were accustomed to flow, and that the ditch did not change the natural course of the water, but was simply intended to aid and direct the natural flow.] [4]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b351-6" data-blocks='[["BL_351.7",351,[155,1666,1171,759]],["BL_352.1",352,[289,375,1180,2022]],["BL_353.1",353,[198,389,1160,93]]]'>“ [On the part of the defendant it is claimed that the natural course of the drainage or flow from the plaintiff’s land was not to and across the defendant’s land at the point contended for by plaintiff; that the ditch made by the plaintiff diverted the water from its natural course where it was accustomed to flow, which course they claim to have been toward the southwest corner of the Glass tract, as shown on their map.] [5] Defendant also contends that there never was any natural course for the water which fell on plaintiff’s land — that it was standing water and not a stream, and that plaintiff could not collect water standing on his land and by an artificial channel turn it •over in a body on defendant’s land. If you should find from the evidence the facts to be as contended for by the defendant, the plaintiff cannot recover; on the other hand, if you find them to be as contended for by the plaintiff, then he is enti<a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>tied to recover. In reference to there being a stream of water, we instruct you, that it is not necessary that there should be a continual flowage of water to constitute a stream in the eyes of the law. If the waters on plaintiff’s lands that came from rains and snows were accustomed to flow in a certain course, through a certain place over his land, and naturally passed 'over the lands of the defendant at a certain point, such customary flowing of water can no more be obstructed than a continuous stream of flowing water. Whatever is the natural direction of the excess of waters in floods and freshets, as in seasons of ordinary water must be left as nature has made it. If you find that the waters which in heavy rains or snows fell upon plaintiff’s land were not accustomed to remain there until they evaporated or were absorbed by the earth, but were accustomed to flow away in a certain channel or direction, whether rapidly or slowly, is immaterial. [Then your inquiry will be what was the natural course of such flowage of water. Did it naturally flow down in the ravine, as claimed by the plaintiff, where the ditch made by him is located, or was it accustomed to flow in a different direction <em>?] [6] In </em>other words, if the plaintiff had not dug the ditch, would the water have flowed from his. land over the defendant’s land, if the private road made by him had not been higher than the level of the land on either side, or if the depression in the road had not been filled up and thus impeded the flow of the water ? If the water would have naturally flowed there and the ditch was made only to aid and direct the natural flow, and the defendant by any means obstructed the passage of the water and threw it back on the plaintiff’s land, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover such damages as he has sustained by reason of such act of the defendant. The inferior owner has no right to prevent the waters which descend on the lands of the superior owner from flowing where they were accustomed to flow. As was said by the Supreme Court in the case of Kaufman v. Griesemer: Because water is descendible by nature, the owner of a dominant or superior heritage has an easement in the servient or inferior tenement, for the discharge of all waters which by nature rise' in, or flow, or fall upon the superior. The owner of the higher lands is called the owner of the dominant or superior heritage, and the owner of the lower land the owner of the inferior her<a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>itage; — the owner of the lower lands must receive the waters which flow naturally from the lands more elevated.</p>

If, on the other hand, the plaintiff has diverted the water from its natural course, and is attempting to force it upon the land of defendant at a place where it would not naturally flow, then the defendant had a right to obstruct it, and the plaintiff could not recover.</p>
