An order for his relief issued April 10, 1883, while he was living with his wife in Brady township, in the same house on the same lot in which he now lives, and ever since that time has lived.</p>

The said appeal being finally determined by an opinion filed in the case by his Honor Judge Cummin, November 27, 1885, affirming the order of removal. In that appeal Clinton township claimed that inasmuch as the pauper had lived in Brady township one whole year prior to the issuing of any order of removal he had acquired a settlement therein in the same manner and under the same mode as now above claimed. By virtue of the affirmance of that appeal Jefferson Shaffer was declared a pauper chargeable to Clinton township, and his settlement was fixed as of the time when he became so chargeable, to wit: April 10,1883. Clinton township having, without the order of removal, recognized her liability to support the pauper, and having so rendered him aid until July, 1885, as admitted, we need only, in determining this case, consider whether or not he has acquired a new settlement be<a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>tween that date and April 26, 1888, the time of issuing the present order of relief. August 7,1884, Elizabeth Shaffer, wife of Jefferson Shaffer, having purchased about two acres of land in Brady township in 1883 from Henry Decker for the sum of five hundred and fifty dollars, and failing to pay the full consideration money, surrendered her purchase of the same in fee and entered into the contract in writing, a copy of which is in evidence as ‘Exhibit B.’ And now under and by virtue of the said contract, and their residence on said lot, and payment of taxes by herself and husband, the different modes of acquiring a new settlement by her husband are set up as above stated. It is somewhat difficult to exactly determine what estate the husband and pauper, Jefferson Shaffer, has by virtue of the agreement or writing entered into between Elizabeth Shaffer, his wife, and Henry Decker. Is it a mere license or privilege to occupy without any greater interest, or is it a grant in the land ? The contracting party, on the one side, signing the instrument as such, and paying the consideration money of two hundred and fifty dollars, her own separate estate and money, and agreeing to pay the taxes, is Elizabeth Shaffer. The words ‘ grant, bargain, sell, alien, release and convey ’ are wanting. It is not made to the grantee, executors, administrators or assigns. It is not in the ordinary words of a deed or lease. If it is a grant in the land it will carry with it the right to assign and an interest capable of being assigned. And such an interest and estate in the land as may be subject to seizure and sale by execution for the debts of the grantees. Is it a lease for the life of the husband as well as for the life of the wife, and hence a freehold estate ? The language used is ‘ to live on and occupy,’ ‘ to let Elizabeth Shaffer and her husband, Jefferson Shaffer, live on,’ ‘ and occupy the lot on which they now live rent free during the term of their life.’ Jefferson Shaffer is not named in the premises nor conclusion of the writing. His name only appears in the habendum. The evidence, however, is that he was present when the writing was made and assented to it. He took possession of the lot with his wife, and aided and assisted her in the payment of the taxes. The words ‘ to live on,’ ‘occupy’ and ‘occupancy’ mean possession, cultivation, to hold and keep for substantial and practical use. And the word ‘ revert ’ implies that the grantor has parted with an estate in <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>lands. Taking into consideration all the language used in the writing, together with the testimony of the grantor, in which he says ‘ I first sold the property mentioned to Mrs. Shaffer in fee for five hundred and fifty dollars. Afterwards when she could not pay the amount, I gave her and her husband a life estate in the land. By the second agreement, of August 7, 1884, which was made possibly in the neighborhood of a year after the first, the life estate of Mr. and Mrs. Shaffer, in the agreement of August 7, 1884, was granted in consideration of two hundred and fifty dollars which Mrs. Shaffer had received as an inheritance from her father’s estate.’ All taken together imply a leasing for the life of Elizabeth Shaffer, and also during the life of Jefferson Shaffer, and is a lease for their lives, and hence rises to the dignity of a freehold estate in lands. While the grantor may not be able to enforce performance of the unperformed condition in the same, nevertheless, so long as it be performed by either or both of the grantees the estate vested in them, or either of them, cannot be divested by the grantor. He is lawfully bound to all its provisions. By it then the pauper has a freehold estate seized in his own right. He- can hold it as long as he lives and pays the taxes. The estate is situated in Brady township, where he has continued to reside upon it, with his wife, since 1885. But since that time and the 26th day of April, 1888, the date of issuing the present order of relief, subsequently followed b3^ the order of removal and appeal, has he acquired a new settlement in the said Brady township ?</p>

Neither did he take a lease, bona fide, under the statute, nor pay the rent according to the second above mentioned mode of gaining a settlement. Where the husband does not make the lease, nor obligate himself in any manner to pay rent, a payment by the wife on a lease signed by herself as lessee is not a lease or payment of rent by the husband sufficient to confer a settlement upon him by the statue. A husband does not deliver a settlement by or from the acts of the wife as the wife does from the husband. Whether or not he acquired a new settlement by the third <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>aforementioned mode we regard as the most serious question. Has lie dwelt upon his freehold estate in Brady township one whole year in such a manner as will gain him a settlement there ? This depends upon the fact whether he was a pauper during that time charged to Clinton township, and received or should have received aid from said township between July 27, 1885, and April 26, 1888, and is a question of fact to be determined by the court upon a careful consideration of all the evidence in the ease. If Shaffer was a lawful charge on Clinton township, and by trick or artifice the overseers of the poor of said township insincerely, collusively or wrongfully withheld aid, when it should have been furnished, it should be held the same as having rendered aid and assistance to the pauper as a charge upon the township during the interval and prevent the pauper from gaining a settlement so long as this relation existed. If the overseers of Clinton township, in violation of their statutory duty, in a sinister manner neglected or wrongfully refused aid and support to their charge, so that he suffered therefor or was forced to support himself by stringent and unreasonable means, as a beggar or starving, and did not for one whole year reasonably and voluntarily support himself, he did not gain a settlement by the third mode mentioned.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b341-4" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[201,1503,1164,755]]]'>“ Poor authorities might, and too often do, corruptly furnish aid in advance to paupers in order to afford them an opportunity to acquire settlement in a district other than the one to which they belong, and by such sly procedure entrap honest, faithful, confiding officials in allowing a pauper or poor person to effect a change of settlement unjustly. Much of the troublesome and expensive litigation in pauper cases in our own county has occurred in this manner. Worthless lots of land purchased or donated, mere cabins or shanties erected on them, leases made, rent paid, taxes assessed and paid and residence established, all by shrewd, deceitful management to effectuate a change of a poor person’s settlement. It is the duty of the courts to nip in the bud all such undue exercise of power and manipulation by overseers of the poor. In what light does this case appear, fairly viewed by the evidence ? ” *</p>

But while he must have been in more need than ever and receiving aid from some neighbors on the asking, begging from many and every time he met them, which was every day or two, getting his friends to draw up and circulate a subscription for his relief, and an order from two justices, as required by law, joining in and obtaining by petition to the court attachment process against the overseers of the poor of Clinton township to compel them to obey the order of relief and removal of 1883-1885, causing the arrest of the overseers of the poor of both Brady and Clinton townships on a criminal charge and warrant for their neglect and refusal to furnish him aid; — all go to show that he was all the while in absolute need of aid and relief, and doing the very best he knew to obtain it. This is found to be true, as a matter of fact, and convinces us that the overseers of the poor of Clinton township were not authorized or justified in refusing Jefferson Shaffer, the pauper, further aid, nor in striking his name off the poor books. ...</p>

Besides we have already held that under the circumstances if aid was not furnished to the pauper by the overseers of Clinton township, it ought to have been and was lawful and necessary and their bounden duty to have furnished it, and, therefore, he did not acquire a new settlement in Brady township according to the mode required by the fourth paragraph in the act of assembly of 1836.</p>
