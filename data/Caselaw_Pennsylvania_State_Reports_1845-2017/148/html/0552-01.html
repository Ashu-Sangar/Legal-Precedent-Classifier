    <p class="syllabus" id="b578-7" data-blocks='[["BL_578.8",578,[237,975,1164,535]]]'>Defendant was indicted, under the act of May 13, 1887, for selling liquor without a license. His defence was that he was not selling on his own account, but as steward of an incorporated club, and that no sales were made to others than members of the said club, unless brought there by a member. The evidence of the prosecution was to the effect that defendant had been selling liquor under a wholesale license and that his place was of bad character. He failed to procure a license for the year 1891. Soon after, the alleged club came into existence in the defendant’s old barroom. The evidence showed that it was a mere sham or device to evade the license laws. Though a club in form, it was in fact a mere barroom where liquor was sold without a license. There was a clumsy attempt to disguise its real character and throw over it the protecting mantle of the law:</p>

The defendant here is accused of having committed that offence. It seems to me that, about the essential feature of the case, there is no dispute <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>in regard to the facts. It is admitted on the part of the defendant that, in the first place, he was engaged and sold himself, individually, beer at five cents a glass, and whisky at ten cents a glass. The defence, however, sets out this state of facts</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b579-3" data-blocks='[["BL_579.4",579,[197,640,1162,593]]]'>“ It appears that a club called the Ellsworth Club, which was duly chartered, was organized for the purpose of literary culture and improvement and as a social club. The defendant, as they allege, was employed as the steward of that club, and the contention is, that since he sold it to persons who bought it in the capacity of members, and he being simply the steward of the club, that that constitutes a legal defence. In other words, the right is claimed that a club may sell liquor to the members of the club. In looking at the purpose of the charter of this club, it appears, as I have said, to have been for literary pursuits and for the improvement of the members and as a social club.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b579-4" data-blocks='[["BL_579.5",579,[197,1252,1163,909]]]'>“ It would seem, however, that in the liquor which was sold there was a profit. That is conceded by two of the witnesses for the defence, one of them saying that there was a profit which went to the salary of the steward, and another one saying there was a little profit involved in the sale. [It is difficult to see how the fact that these gentlemen have gathered together for this purpose affects the right which is denied by the statute of selling liquor without a license. Certainly, their getting together as a club does not give them greater rights in that respect than they would have as so many individuals gathered together.] [1] If this was a kind of distribution of what was common property it would be no offence. That is, the statute does not seem to make it unlawful to buy, but it does make it unlawful to sell. Two men could get together to buy liquor in common and distribute it as common property, but not to sell it. So I take it a hundred men might put up a common fund and buy liquor with it and divide the liquor around, because there is no attempt to make a profit.</p>

There was not a distribution of common property of liquor among the members of the club, but there was a sale of it. True, confined to members of the club, but a sale and a profit.

If the counsel, therefore, wish to make a motion for a new trial I shall grant that motion, and permit the defendant to renew his bail., I am led to this course because a sister state seems to have adopted a somewhat different view of the same question. Again, there is a difference of opinion in the community. The defendant here, if he has offended, has offended under the claim of right, and I, therefore, think it is important it should be carefully considered. [I instruct you, however, for the purpose of your inquiry that the defendant is guilty if you believe the facts which have been testified to.] [3] ”</p>

An examination of the act of 1887 will show that it contains little more by way of restraint than is found in the act of 1856. The later act is not a prohibitory act.

It appears from the testimony that he had at one time been selling liquor under a wholesale license at his place, at the southeast corner of Twenty-third and Kim-ball streets, in the city of Philadelphia. He failed to obtain a license of any bind for the year 1891. The reason why it was withheld does not appear. There was evidence that the place-had a very bad character. Shortly after the license was withheld, he was found selling liquor at the same place, and was indicted for the violation of the license laws. His defence was, that he was not selling on his own account, but as the steward of the Ellsworth Club, and that no sales were made to others than members of the club, unless brought there by a member. It was alleged that the club had been incorporated by the court of common pleas. Of this, however, we have no proper knowledge, as we have not been furnished with a copy of the charter and by-laws, if any there be. This is o£ very little importance. Assuming it to have been regularly chartered, the question arises upon the evidence, whether it was a bona fide club, organized for social or other proper purposes, or whether it was a mere scheme or device to evade the license laws. A careful examination of the evidence leaves us in no doubt upon this point.</p>

It was a small room, out of which everything had been removed but a few tables and a few chairs. A place of about six feet square had been partitioned off from the room from which the liquids were being dispensed. This little room was the club room, the balance of the house <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>being occupied by the defendant and his family.

If you become a member of the club you can come in, but if you will come in with one of the members, or one that has a key, I will give you all you want. I told him I liked a glass of beer occasionally. He said he served the club, and if I came in with them I could have beer.” A number of members of the club were called by the defendant, some of whom stated that the initiation fee was twenty-five cents, and the weekly dues ten cents. Others put it at twenty-five cents. As we were not furnished with a copy of the charter, we can only state the object of the club, as given by these witnesses. The main purpose, as we gather it from their testimony, appears to have been sociability, and, to some extent, mental improvement. Its literary department consisted of two penny newspapers, and the Police Gazette. All of the defendant’s witnesses testified that the proceedings were conducted in an orderly manner, and that beer was furnished them at five cents a glass, and whisky at ten cents.</p>

The evidence abundently shows that it was a mere sham, a device to evade the license laws. It was a club in form; in fact, it was a mere barroom, where liquor was sold without a license. There was a clumsy attempt to disguise its real character, and throw over it the protecting mantle of the law. The latter is not so feeble, however, that it cannot pierce such a thin covering as this. It follows, from what has been said, that it was not error in the court to instruct the jury that, if they believed the testimony which was pre-' <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>sented to them, it was their duty to find the defendant guilty of the offence with which he was charged.</p>
    <p id="b585-3" data-blocks='[["BL_585.4",585,[176,478,1160,501]]]'>We decline to discuss the rulings of the court, referred to in the fourth and fifth specifications, for the reason that the rights of a bona fide club are not involved in this case, and we prefer to decide only what is legitimately and necessarily before us. We rule this case upon its own facts. Were we to countenance such a sham as this, any man who is refused a license can get a few of his customers to sign a paper, constituting themselves a club; rent them his barroom, have himself appointed a steward, and, by such clumsy device, evade the law. We cannot dignify such an association by treating it as a club.</p>
    <p id="b585-4" data-blocks='[["BL_585.5",585,[175,988,1157,94]]]'>Judgment affirmed, and the appellant is required to undergo the sentence imposed by the court below.</p>
