Pursuant to its charter it has laid pipes, constructed works, and is now maintaining the same, for the purposes for which it was incorporated, and claims that, by virtue of its charter, it has the exclusive right so to do. It is alleged that the defendant company, a corporation chartered on Dec. 23, 1890, threatens, and is proceeding to lay water pipes in said borough for the purpose of supplying water to the public, in violation of the plaintiff’s vested and exclusive right. The prayer of the bill is for an injunction.</p>

The granting of a new charter to a new corporation may sometimes render valueless the franchises of an existing corporation ; but unless the state, by contract, has precluded itself from such new grant, the incidental injury can constitute no obstacle: Lehigh Water Co.’s Ap., <a href="/citations/?q=102%20Pa.%20528" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="102 Pa. 528">102 Pa. 528</a>, and cases cited.</p>

It is only in a clear case that the courts are justified in declaring an act unconstitutional. This rule is applicable, not only where the provisions of an act are alleged to be unconstitutional, but also where the sufficiency of its title is brought into question: Craig <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>v.

The provision of the constitution under consideration was not intended to obviate the necessity for vigilance. It was proposed in the convention of 1838, and rejected, because it was feared it would render legislation too difficult and uncertain and lead to litigation, and since its adoption in 1864, and re-enactment in the constitution of 1874, the courts have almost universally given the titles of acts a liberal construction. ‘ It will not do, therefore, to impale the legislation of the state upon the sharp points of criticism; but we must give each title as it comes before us a reasonable interpretation, <em>ut res magis valeat quampereat. </em>If the title fairly gives notice of the object of the act, so as reasonably to lead into an inquiry into the body of the bill, it is all that is necessary. It need not be an index to the contents, as has often been said: ’ Allegheny Co.

A title to a bill, which tends to mislead, stands upon a different footing from one which is merely general in its terms. When the title conveys the belief that one subject is the purpose of the bill, while another and different one is its real subject, it tends to mislead by diverting the attention from the true object of the legislation : Union Pass.

The title first declares that the act is a supplement to the general act providing for the incorporation and regulation of certain corporations, and then proceeds to indicate the particulars in which it supplements that act; <em>(a) </em>by amending the 34th section thereof ; (b) by extending its provisions to fuel companies; (e) by providing for their capital stock and regulation; ('d) by giving them the power of eminent domain. The words ‘amending <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>the 34th section thereof,’ and ‘ extending its provisions to fuel companies,’ are different branches of the same general subject, and we do not think the careful reader would conclude, without examining further, that the latter clause was merely explanatory of the former. Amending an act or section of an act is one thing, extending its provisions is another. The provisions of an act may be extended in the form of an amendment, but if that were the sole purpose of which the title was to give notice, one would naturally suppose that the two clauses would have been connected by the word ‘by,’ or the words ‘so as to extend,’ or that the words ‘ extending the provisions of the 34th section to fuel companies ’ would have been used without inserting the first clause at all. As it was written, we think the title gives notice of an amendment of the 34th section beyond the mere extension of its provisions to fuel companies, which was sufficient to lead legislators and others interested to examine into the provisions of the act, and this, according to the great weight of authority, is the test.</p>
