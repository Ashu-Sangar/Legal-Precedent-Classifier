Saeger, CordeliaS. Schantz, and defendant. In partition of his real estate, defendant accepted a certain lot, upon which was charged a dower interest. Eliza Saeger died in 1882, leaving a will by which she left her residuary estate to Henry J. Saeger and Cordelia S. Schantz, and named them as her executors. On June 21, 1884, all the parties in interest met, and a settlement was made with Saeger and Mrs. Schantz for their share of the dower interest, and a release was given to them containing this provision: “ Provided, that nothing herein contained shall in any manner affect the claim of the execurors of said Eliza Saeger for any arrears of interest unpaid to her on said SI,888.831 at the time of her <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>death, until this release shall have been signed by said executors in their representative capacity and separately acknowledged as such; after which it shall be as effectual for the discharge of said arrears of interest due at the death of said Eliza Saeger as for any other purpose.” Defendant then paid part of this interest in cash, and gave for the balance notes to her brother and sister in their individual names, whereupon they executed and acknowledged the release as executors. The note given to Cordelia S. Schantz was for <em>$277.11, </em>and it was for this amount that this action was brought. Defendant relied upon the release, whereupon plaintiff, in rebuttal, put in evidence a portion of the affidavit of defence, as follows:</p>

    <p id="b105-12" data-blocks='[["BL_105.13",105,[201,1415,1165,450]]]'>We do not think the fact that this suit was instituted in the name of Henry J.

He does not object to the use of his name, and has made no application to the court below to prevent its unauthorized use. He would have a right to demand immunity from costs, but as he has made no complaint in this respect, we must presume he is satisfied. The suit was properly brought for the recovery of this portion of the dower interest.</p>
