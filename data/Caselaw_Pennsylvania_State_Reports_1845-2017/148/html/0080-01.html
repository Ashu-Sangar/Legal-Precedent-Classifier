In the reasons which I gave to the jury at that time for the entry of the compulsory nonsuit, I stated that even if that principle were correctly stated that a recovery could not be <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>had in this form of action. In this I was mistaken. As no provision has been made by an act of assembly for a recovery of damages in cases such as this, if the right of recovery exist at all the remedy would have to be by common law action.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b107-3" data-blocks='[["BL_107.4",107,[186,606,1168,441]]]'>“ Where a special remedy is given by statute the common law remedy will not lie : Boom Co. v. Sanderson, <a href="/citations/?q=81%2A%20Pa.%20402" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="81* Pa. 402">81* Pa. 402</a>. This has been recognized by the courts to be correct in principle. Therefore, if there is no statute of the state of Pennsylvania giving a special remedy in cases of this character, and there is any cause of action at all, the remedy must be by a common law action such as this, and, if the plaintiff has a right to recover at all, he would have the right to recover under this form of action.</p>

Where, for instance, a municipality erects public works, changes or improves highways so as to depreciate the market value of any property in the neighborhood of such works, there would be a right of action. But that is not this case. The plaintiff does not complain that the mere construction of the sewer in itself depreciated the market value of his property, and this action is not brought for such depreciation. But his complaint is that because of an error of judgment on the part of the municipal authorities in the exercise of their legislative functions the sewer was inadequate for the purpose for which it was constructed, and that consequently the water which it was intended it should carry off was dammed up and backed over upon his property, and into his cellar, undermining his foundation wall, and that this damage is the damage that he seeks to recover for.</p>
