    <p class="summary" id="b229-9" data-blocks='[["BL_229.12",229,[214,1163,1170,542]]]'>“ The judgment with which we have here to deal was entered by virtue of the provisions of a certain lease, executed October 31,1889, between C. P. Davidson, the then owner of the premises and the defendant; the interest of the said Davidson having since then passed to the plaintiff. The term of IT months for which the lease was given has now expired, but there is a further provision therein, that it is to continue from month to month after the expiration of the term until the lessor gives written notice to quit at least 30 days before the end of any month, and we may presume that the lease for lack of this, notice is still in force.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b229-10" data-blocks='[["BL_229.13",229,[211,1724,1168,596]]]'>“ As the lessee has, however, but a very precarious tenure under this part of the lease, the decision at which we may now arrive will — as we conceive — affect the relations of the parties but little. The plaintiff affirms, as the basis of his judgment, that the lease has been forfeited by reason of the failure of the defendant to pay the water rates as therein agreed to. One of the stipulations of that instrument is that the ‘ lessee shall pay his own gas and water bills; ’ it is also further provided that ‘ if the lessee shall fail to keep and perform all the terms, provisions and stipulations of this agreement, or any of them, the lessor may, if he elect to do so, declare the lease forfeited and the term at an end.’</p>

It differs materially in <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>this respect from an ordinary money judgment entered by confession upon a note or bond. In that case there is an absolute obligation upon the face of the instrument itself, while here the partjr is not liable to a judgment except upon a breach of some of the conditions of the agreement resulting in a forfeiture. If, therefore, the right to a judgment is disputed, the burden throughout of establishing that right is upon the plaintiff. This was decided in the case of Hughes v. Moody, No. 461, Juñe T., 188T, in this court.</p>

This would be true, if it merely stood with oath against oath, for it would not be for the court to choose between them. But the question here is deeper, and goes to the very right of the plaintiff to claim a forfeiture at all.</p>

There is no mention to whom -they are to be paid, nor when, much less is there a suggestion that they are to be paid to the landlord, upon demand as is now claimed. We consider this merely as a declaration, inserted in the lease to avoid any uncertainty, that the landlord did not undertake to furnish these accommodations to the premises, but that the tenant should look out for and pay his own gas and water bills himself; any other construction than this is strained, and we cannot be expected to go to that length to help out a forfeiture.] [2] [It is true the water rates in the present instance have been charged by the water company to the plaintiff who now makes a demand over upon the defendant.</p>

There is nothing in the lease to sustain the position that if the landlord pay the water rates due from the premises and the tenant fail to reimburse him upon demand, the lease can be forfeited.] [4]</p>

The lessor has the full benefit and effect of the provision in question when he is not called upon to supply the premises with these conveniences. He had no right to forfeit the lease, and the judgment cannot be sustained. As this conclusion is reached as a matter of law upon the record there is no occasion to send the case to a jury, there being no question of fact to be submitted to them.] [5]</p>

It also contained a clause of forfeiture in case the lessee should not keep and perform all the terms, provisions and stipulations of the lease, or any of them. Then follows the further provision that, “At the end of said term, whether the same shall be determined by forfeiture or expiration of time and notice to quit, it is agreed that an amicable action of ejectment may be entered in the court of common pleas of Lackawanna county, in which the lessor shall be plaintiff, and the lessee, defendant; that judgment shall be entered Thereupon in favor of the plaintiff for the premises above described, to have the same force and effect as if a summons in ejectment had been regularly issued, legally served and returned, and that writs of habere facias possessionem, with clause of fi. fa. for all costs, may be issued forthwith.” <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>By the last paragraph of said lease it was “ understood and agreed that all the conditions and stipulations herein contained, shall bind the heirs, executors, administrators and assigns of the said parties.” Davidson, the lessor, subsequently assigned the lease to the plaintiff, who had become the owner of the property.</p>

Upon the application of the defendant, the court below stayed the writ, and granted a rule to show cause why the judgment should not be opened and defendant let into a defence. It is not denied that he had notice to pay the water rent, and that he did not pay it. The court below held that the stipulation in the lease, that the “lessee shall pay his own gas and water bills,” did not admit of the construction that a failure to keep and perform it would work a forfeiture of the lease, and made the rule to open absolute, and ordered the judgment to be vacated.</p>

Nor do we think there is any ambiguity as to who the water rents are to be paid to. • The water rents are payable, as every intelligent man knows, to the water company furnishing the water. When, therefore, a tenant covenants in his lease to pay the gas bills, or the water rents, it is as much a condition of his holding as any other covenant therein. If they are not paid, and the tenant vacates the premises, the landlord is obliged to pay them, or have the gas and water cut off from his premises. The latter has a right to protect himself against this, and to enforce a lawful covenant for that purpose in the lease. It was held in Fernwood Masonic Hall Association v. Jones, <a href="/pa/102/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="102 Pa. 307" data-case-ids="502723" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0307-01">102 Pa. 307</a>, that where, in a lease, the lessee covenants to pay the lessor for all gas consumed on the premises, a sum due for gas consumed is to be regarded as rent in arrear, and may be distrained for.

The right is equally clear to forfeit for nonpayment of water rents where that is the agreement of the parties. In the case in hand, the defendant distinctly agreed that his lease might be forfeited for such nonpayment. He could have avoided it by paying the bills.</p>
