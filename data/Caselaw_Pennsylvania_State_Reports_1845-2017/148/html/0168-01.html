A part of this allowance having been granted by the board, a certificate of the balance due by the collector was filed by the board, under the provisions of the act of April 11, 1862, see. 18, P.

It was contended that the collector and his sureties were discharged from liability because he had not been furnished with a warrant when the duplicate of the school tax was placed in his hands for collection. It was not alleged that in consequence of this omission he was in any way hampered or interfered with in the collection of the taxes, or that he suffered any loss thereby.</p>

In May, 1889, a committee of the board met, and with the defendant reviewed the exoneration list prepared by him. A large amount of the exonerations claimed was disallowed, and the board made a settlement showing a balance of $2,046.47, a certificate of which was entered in the court of common pleas, in accordance with the provisions of the act of April 11, 1862, sec. 18, P. L. 474, Defendant’s bond was then certified from the quarter sessions to the common pleas, and judgment thereon entered for the amount of the balance shown by the settlement.

It appears to have been an oversight of which the collector was as ignorant as the board. The collector never demanded a warrant. If he had, no doubt it would have been given him. It does not appear that the want of a warrant ever prevented him from collecting any part of the tax, or that any one resisted his authority or refused to pay on that account. Not having suffered, by reason of the omission, it will not avail him as a defence to this proceeding.</p>

In accordance with the 13th section <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>of the act of April 11, 1842, the school board of said borough filed a certificate in the court below, attested by the president and secretary of the said board, showing a balance due, on settlement, from said John A. Titman, collector, of $2,046.47. We cannot review said settlement, nor are we asked to do so. The only question for our consideration is, whether the court below, in the exercise of its equity powers, was justified in refusing to open the judgment. The ground upon which the defendant claims this relief is, that he had never been furnished with a warrant for the collection of the taxes. It appears that he accepted a duplicate, but for some reason, probably the mutual ignorance of the parties, he had never been furnished with a warrant, nor had he ever demanded one. He accepted the duplicate, and proceeded to collect a large portion of the taxes. He thus became a collector de facto, and it does not appear that he suffered any loss by reason of the absence of a warrant. It is conceded that he would have been furnished with a warrant at any time, had he asked for it. Under these circumstances, we do not think he has any equity which would require the court below to open the judgment. It follows that the refusal to open it was not an abuse of discretion. The judge to whom such an application is made acts as a chancellor and, upon appeal, this court will only see that his discretion has been properly exercised: Wernet’s Ap., <a href="/citations/?q=91%20Pa.%20819" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="91 Pa. 819">91 Pa. 819</a>; Jenkintown National Bank’s Ap., <a href="/citations/?q=124%20Pa.%20837" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="124 Pa. 837">124 Pa. 837</a>.</p>
