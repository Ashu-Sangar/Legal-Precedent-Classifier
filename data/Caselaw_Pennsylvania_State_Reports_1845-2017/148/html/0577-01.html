It is claimed by Louisa Shissler that <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>there being no trustee interposed, no investment of the principal directed, and no limitation over in the clause, the intention is to vest an absolute estate to the principal in her.

The decision there is that, the bequest by the testator of a share of his estate to his daughter, her heirs and assigns, she to have the interest of such share only so long as she lives, in the absence of any interposition of a trustee, or direction for investment or limitation over, vested such share in her absolutely. In the present ease, the bequest is only of the interest for the life of Louisa Shissler. The principal is not bequeathed to her. It is therefore easily distinguished from Silknitter’s Ap. All that was there decided, as stated, was that the direction as to interest was not sufficient to overcome the force of the prior absolute gift: Sheets’ Est., <a href="/citations/?q=52%20Pa.%20264" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="52 Pa. 264">52 Pa.

What was to be done with it, or where it was to go after the death of Louisa Shissler, seems to have been entirely overlooked by the testatrix in making her will. On the other hand there is, in the 11th clause, a clear intent particularly expressed to give Louisa Shissler only the interest of the $1,000 during her life, and where the payment of the interest of a fund is restricted for the life of a person, or for any definite period of time, it does not carry the corpus of the fund. The bequest in the 11th clause is not of a gross sum but in the nature of an annuity. The taker of the income for life does not also take the corpus: McDevitt’s Ap., <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.%20777" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="5 A. 777">5 Atl. Rep. 777</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b606-6" data-blocks='[["BL_606.7",606,[249,1504,1169,961]]]'>“ A bequest of interest or income will not carry an absolute estate in the principal, where the plain intent appears to sever such interest or income from its source, as is explicitly done in this case. Nor does the testatrix separate the $1,000 from the body of her estate. The inferences and implications which can be fairly and reasonably drawn from the other provisions in the will are not clear and strong enough, in our opinion, to overcome the expressed, clear provision in the 11th clause, that Louisa Shissler shall only be paid the interest of the $1,000 for and during her lifetime. To preclude or overcome such plainly expressed intention by different intention gathered within the four corners of the will, such different intention on the part of the testratrix, as before stated, must be clear, manifest and undisputable. Upon studying carefully the whole will we fail to find satisfactory evidence of a clear, manifest intention on the part of the testatrix to give to Louisa Shissler more than the interest of $1,000 during her life. In arriving at this intent of the testatrix we have sought to give effect to every part of the will, and to give harmony to the whole.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b607-2" data-blocks='[["BL_607.3",607,[211,381,1162,1469]]]'>
      <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>“ It should be noticed, however, as stated in Roberts’s Ap., 59 Pa. page 73 of opinion, that the testatrix here, as in that case, in other items of bequest in her will, contingent on arriving at age, or death or otherwise, has limited to other persons and appointed trustees, etc., showing that when she intended these things she had them properly provided for in her will. She omitted them, as already noticed, in the bequest in controversy. In the 2d, 3d, 4th, 14th, 15th and 16th clauses of her will, where the testatrix creates a trust or limitation over of a fund to certain persons, or for specific purposes, she names such persons and purposes, and also names the persons or person who shall act as trustee, and in the majority of instances names her executor as such trustee. These very facts afford strong grounds upon which to found an argument that because she did so create a trust, name a trustee, and limit the principal sum over in the other provisions of her will, and did not do so in the clause in question, she therefore intended the principal to vest in the legatee therein named and did not intend it to pass to her residuary legatee, or that her executor should act as trustee of the same. It is also claimed by the counsel for Louisa Shissler that the following language of the 17th clause of the will, to wit: ‘ If the above bequests do not exhaust my estate,’ and the words, ‘ if any,’ in the residuary clause, show that the testatrix considered the corpus of the fund mentioned in the 11th clause as completely disposed of, and not intended for further distribution. But comparing the whole will with all the clauses above recited, such argument is entirely overcome by the language of the will — by fair implication, and by the rules of law before given.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b607-3" data-blocks='[["BL_607.4",607,[212,1859,1161,552]],["BL_608.1",608,[243,384,1171,695]]]'>“ It must also be observed that in every case where she intended the principal sum, or any part of it, to be paid to the legatee, it is so specifically stated. The great care and particularity with which she disposes of her estate convinces us that she did not intend to die intestate in reference to any part of it, and judging from the whole will and the rules of law, as applied in this state,we are forced to the conclusion that the sum or principal of the $1,000 mentioned in the 11th clause of her will falls into her residuary estate and does not pass to her heirs or next of kin. In the 17th clause, after using the following language, to wit: ‘ If the said above bequests do not <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>exhaust my estate,’ she bequeaths $500 more. In the 18th clause a gold watch, in the 19th gold glasses, in the 20th and 21st each $200 — altogether $900 — additional, after expressing the condition or doubt in regard to the amount of her estate as relating to that before disposed of. Again, as if fearful of leaving a portion of her estate undisposed of, she added the residuary clause, which we hold covers any and all moneys not in her will before disposed of. . And not having bequeathed the principal sum of the $1,000 but only the interest of it to Louisa Shissler during her life, and the same not being exhausted or disposed of by any bequest it vested, under the rule in this state, at the time of the death of Catharine Ritter, in her residuary legatee, Mary Gellinger. It must therefore be paid to her at the death of Louisa Shissler.</p>
