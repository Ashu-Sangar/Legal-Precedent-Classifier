That the taxes of the said John R. Bennett and Caroline G.

That the 5 per centum was added by him according to law and fo'r the penalty provided for nonpayment, and the two percentuin mentioned in complainants’ bill was only named as costs of the levy, not as a penalty.</p>

After a careful hearing of the case we refused to do so. If, as admitted, all of the real estate situated in said borough was assessed, valued and returned at one third its actual value, for the purpose of taxation, it would be uniform at least. And now, as then, we decline <em>r </em>to interfere with the assessment and valuation, and hold that the assessment and levy of the taxes complained of in the plaintiffs’ bill were not unauthorized, nor such as they can be relieved from paying at this time and in this manner.

It can only be added after due public notice to the taxpayer and after his failure to pay; on the other hand, the same law benefits him to the same extent by a deduction, providing he pay within a reasonable specified time, and cannot be added until after his neglect and failure to pay for a period of six months from the time fixed for payment ; of such provision the taxpayer can have no just cause of complaint.

But we take the words ‘ borough and townships of this commonwealth ’ were meant to and do include all the territory and counties in the state. Boroughs and townships are the territorial divisions and bounds by which county commissioners levy and collect taxes under the general laws of the state. These were the limits of each county duplicate and collector before as well as since the act of 1885. That act in section 4 provides that the several county, borough, township, school, poor and other authorities now empowered, and which may hereafter be empowered to levy taxes within the several boroughs and townships of this commonwealth, etc., shall issue their respective duplicates of taxes assessed to the collector of taxes of their respective boroughs and townships. Section 5 provides that the collector of such taxes shall have all power heretofore vested in collectors of county taxes under existing laws and be subject to the same liabilities and penalties for neglect or violation of the duties of his office. Section 11 specially names and directs to and with whom the collectors must account and settle, and that the collectors of county and state taxes should settle with the county commissioners as heretofore.</p>
