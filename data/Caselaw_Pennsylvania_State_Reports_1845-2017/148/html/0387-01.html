His friend, Byers, was sent by him to B. F. Glenn &amp; Sons, real estate agents, who had been intrusted by defendant with the sale of a lot belonging to him. Byers concealed the object for which the lot was wanted. He was told that defendant wished to sell to some one who would improve, and thus benefit the adjoining property. Plans were sketched to show how dwellings would be built on the lot; there was a conflict of testimony as to whether plaintiff or Byers for him agreed to build dwellings. Plaintiff told Glenn that he was employed at the Baldwin Locomotive Works, which was false, and Byers confirmed the story. Subsequently an agreement of sale was executed. This agreement contained no promises or agreements as to the character of the buildings to be erected. After the signing of the agreement plaintiff disclosed his purpose of erecting a blacksmith shop, and defendant refused to execute a deed. The facts are further stated in the opinion of the Supreme Court.</p>

That object was to deceive Glenn; and Brown, being a blacksmith, would, by his appearance, give color to the statement, and induce Glenn not to inquire further into his business.”</p>

The substance of his third, fifth and sixth findings is that, at the time the agreement was signed no promises were made or agreement entered into between Brown and those who represented the defendant; that Brown did not then or at any time “ make any promises to, or enter into any agreements with, Robert Glenn or any other person as to what he would erect on the property he proposed to buy.”</p>

If the defence had been grounded solely on reformation of the contract by incorporating therein a building restriction alleged to have been omitted by accident or mistake, etc., the conclusion drawn by the learned master and court below would have been correct; but it is one thing to furnish such proof as will move a chancellor to reform a contract for the sale of land, and quite another to prove such unfairness or deception in its procurement as will induce him to withhold his aid and thus refuse specific performance of the tainted contract.</p>
    <p id="b418-6" data-blocks='[["BL_418.6",418,[246,1561,1169,544]]]'>There is also a marked difference between that degree of unfairness which will induce a chancellor to set aside a contract, and that which will induce him to withhold his aid in enforcing it: Cathcart v. Robinson, 5 Peters, 276. It is there said: “ A defendant may resist a bill for specific performance by showing that, under the circumstances, the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief he asks. Omission or mistake in the agreement, or that it is unconscientious or unreasonable; or that there has been concealment, misrepresentation or any unfairness, are enumerated among the causes which will induce the court to refuse its aid.”</p>

As was said in Orne v. Kittanning Coal Co., supra: “The doors are shut against one who, in his prior conduct in the very subject-matter at issue, has violated good conscience, good faith or fair dealing.” All these <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>were done by the plaintiff in the procurement of the contract which he asked the court below to enforce. He was unworthy of its aid, and his bill should have been dismissed. The decree is also erroneous, in that it includes defendant’s wife, who does not appear to have been a party to the proceeding.</p>
