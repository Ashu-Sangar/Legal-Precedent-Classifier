Thus, the advertisement of the city engineer for proposals for the work in question is referred to as “ Exhibit 3.” The plans and specifications, with a copy of the advertisement, and the plaintiff’s proposal, are mentioned as “ Exhibit 2.” A copy of the city treasurer’s receipt, given to the plaintiff for the certified check for $2,000, deposited with his bid, was described as “ Exhibit 4,” and all of these exhibits are made part of the case stated.</p>

There is no averment in the case stated that the treasurer had no authority to sign and deliver the receipt, precisely as it was given, and we know of no reason why it must not be regarded as being a part of the contract between the parties.

Regarded as the written expression of one of the terms of the contract, the case becomes very much simplified, and the receipt practically accomplishes the solution of the contention. It is in these words : “ Received of Mr. S. JB. Mutchler, on behalf of the city of Easton, a certified check on Phillipsburg N. J. Nat.

The provision in the notice to contractors, “ that the check is to be forfeited to the city of Easton, if the successful bidder does not enter into contract with the city and furnish a bond,” etc., would doubtless have justified a declaration of forfeiture by the department of sewers, but no such declaration was ever made.</p>
