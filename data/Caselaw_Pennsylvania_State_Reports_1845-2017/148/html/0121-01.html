At the time of the assignment he was possessed of three tracts of land which were subsequently sold under an order of court, and an auditor appointed to make distribution. The real estate fund amounted to $2,008.26 and the personal fund to $154.41.

These liens were filed in the protlionotary’s office of this county, as before set forth, and they were filed in order to become liens on the real estate of the assignor. On the other hand, the counsel for the judgment lien-creditors contend that owing to a defect in the wages claims filed, the judgments must be first paid in their order out of the real estate fund, so far as it will pay the same. They also claim a pro rata dividend out of the personal property fund. They further contend that the assignor, being a contractor and builder, and the wages earned by the respective claimants being for labor bestowed upon houses owned by other people, and which houses were erected by the assignor under contracts, therefore, the liens for such wages could not be entered so as to bind the assignor’s own estate; that he was not such a party as was embraced within the provisions of the laws relating to liens for wages and their preferences.</p>

(2) It should set forth the character of the services for which the claim is filed, and must state that the same were rendered in or about a business carried on by the party against whom the claim is filed, and is such as is defined by law. (8) That the labor was done by the claimant within six months preceding the date of the sheriff’s levy, or the date of the assignment.

They convey special favors and should be closely adhered to in all respects. The notice of the claims, either by filing a lien, or a notice in writing to the sheriff, under the acts of assembly relating to these laborers’ claims, is intended to serve the same purpose, that is, to inform <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>parties interested of the liens. The one must be as full and particular as the other, as to all the qualities and rights of the claim, and each must exhibit every fact to sustain the claim or the lien.

Uncertainty in both cases must be avoided. As to the proper notice to be given by the sheriff, our Supreme Court has passed upon that in a number of instances.

    <p id="b155-11" data-blocks='[["BL_155.15",155,[202,1531,1168,450]]]'>The learned auditor, and the court below, awarded the appellants a pro rata dividend out of the personal estate, but held that they were not entitled to come in upon the proceeds of the sale of the real estate. We think it very clear, under the act of April 9, 1872, P. L. 47, and the supplemental acts of June 13, 1883, P. L. 116, and June 3, 1887, P. L. 237, the appellants were not entitled to come in upon the proceeds of the real estate. We need not- discuss this question, as the learned auditor has given sufficient reasons for his conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b155-12" data-blocks='[["BL_155.16",155,[200,1989,1173,454]],["BL_156.1",156,[278,397,1173,191]]]'>It was contended, however, that, under the act of April 22, 1854, P. L. 480, the appellants were entitled to be paid in full on their respective claims, not exceeding $100 each, out of the personal estate. The act of 1854 is as follows : “ That in all assignments of property, whether real or personal, which shall hereafter be made by any person or persons, or chartered company, to trustees or assignees, on account of inability, at the time of the assignment, to pay his or their debts, the wages of miners, mechanics and laborers employed by such chartered <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>company or companies, shall be first preferred by such trustees or assignees, before any other creditor or creditors of the assignor ; provided, that any one claim thus preferred shall not exceed $100.”</p>
    <p id="b156-5" data-blocks='[["BL_156.5",156,[274,602,1173,442]]]'>The 3d section of the act of 1872 would seem to supply the act of 1854, but a careful examination of it leads us to the conclusion that it supplies it only in part. It refers to such persons as are engaged in such operations as are mentioned in the 1st section thereof. As it appears to be conceded that these beneficiaries are not included in the act of 1872, we see no reason why they may not claim under the act of 1854, to the extent of $100 each, out of the proceeds of the personal estate.</p>
