After carefully considering the reasons given by the controller, and after hearing the arguments of counsel in this case, we cannot sustain this position. It is sought, in the first instance, to pay for the construction of this sewer out of the general revenue. We think it cannot be doubted but that it is one of the inherent and implied powers of the city to pave, grade, sewer and otherwise improve its streets, and to pay therefor; and that this power exists without any express legislative grant. This inherent power of the city clearly exists unless it has been taken away by some legislation. The act of 1891, which is relied on as taking away this power, in no wise affects it. This act provides for a mode of assessing the <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>damages on the properties benefited, and was not intended to deprive the city of the general power to make these improvements at the expense of the city.</p>

There is nothing in the act of 1891 inconsistent with this provision of the act of 1889, and it is therefore not repealed by implication. The part of the act of 1889, providing for the assessments upon properties benefited as the councils may determine, is supplied and repealed by the act of 1891, which provides that these assessments shall be made by viewers appointed by the court. There is nothing whatever in this latter act from which it can be inferred that the method provided therein for assessing the cost of these improvements was intended to limit the power of councils to pay for the improvements in that way alone. The power therein given is additional to the power to do this work at the expense of the city. Whether the ordinance in controversy is properly drawn, and the property holders may defend or not on the ground that an assessment should have been made before the contract was entered into, is not the question now before us. All that is pertinent to the issue that is involved in this proceeding is, whether there was a sufficient appropriation, and this depends solely on the question whether the appropriation made out of the general revenue was within the power of councils ? If so, it was clearly the duty of the controller to certify the contract. The fact that it was sufficient in amount is not controverted, and we think the appropriation likewise legally made.</p>

The question now to be determined depends upon the construction given to the 5th section of article IX of the act of 1889. Has the controller, under said section, discretionary power, or is his duty only ministerial ? His duties are statutory, and as far as relates to the subject in controversy are contained in the section of the act of 1889 above referred to. He had no such duty to perform under the act of 1874, but under that act he had other duties, among which were the duties conferred upon him which are enjoined upon county <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>auditors by the laws of this state, while under the act of 1889 this provision is entirely omitted.</p>

These decisions were based upon the fact that under the act of 1874, and the acts governing the controller of the city of Philadelphia, his duties were such as to require judgment and discretion, and therefore were not ministerial. In both these cases, the court put great stress upon the fact that there was imposed upon him by the laws of the state all the duties now enjoined by law upon county auditors of the state. In case of Dechert v. Commonwealth, supra, Justice Clark, in delivering the opinion of the court, inter alia, said: ‘ It was his duty in any case, before countersigning the warrant, to know that the appropriation necessary for each department had been made, and that the total was within the estimate of the income, as required by the act of 1879; to be satisfied that the warrant covered items for which appropriations had been made, and that these appropriations had not been exhausted, as required by the act of 1856 ; these inquiries, as they involved no particular exercise of discretion, are perhaps of a clerical and therefore of a ministerial character only. But other duties devolved upon him ; as the superintendent of the fiscal affairs of the city, (act 2d Feb., 1854,) it was his duty to do what he might “ deem needful to protect the interests of the said city.” (Act 13th Feb., 1856.) To this end, (act 2d Feb., 1854,) he was invested with all the powers and directed to perform all the duties enjoined by law on county auditors; and as a legal sanction to the just and full performance on his part of these duties, in the interests of the city, it was declared (act 21st April, 1855) to be a misdemeanor in office, and so subjected him to the pains and penalties of the criminal law, if he should “ pass any bill or order for any object not authorized by law.” ’</p>

In both cases, therefore, the party had a legal remedy, notwithstanding the refusal of the controller to countersign the warrants. In the case of Dechert v. Commonwealth, supra, the court, on page 240, say: ‘ In the <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>event of the controller’s refusal to countersign any warrant, the courts of the commonwealth are open for vindication of the claimant’s rights as against the city, and if these alleged rights are submitted to the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction and are there finally adjudicated in his favor, either the neglect of councils to provide for payment, or the refusal of the controller to countersign a warrant in discharge of a legally ascertained liability of the city, would present a different question here.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b495-3" data-blocks='[["BL_495.4",495,[186,848,1166,1013]]]'>“ In the case at hand, if the duty of the controller to certify contracts is discretionary, both the contractor and the city is without remedy. It gives the controller a final veto wherever an appropriation of money is involved. That such a power should be intrusted to the city controller, who requires no qualification except the qualifications prescribed by the act of assembly for city treasurer, seems marvelous. We cannot, from a careful reading of the act, come to any such conclusion. The last sentence of section 5 of the act above quoted uses the following imperative language: ‘ It shall be the duty of the controller to certify contracts for the payment of which sufficient appropriations have been made.’ There is nothing whatever here which requires judgment and discretion. It is true, he must have knowledge of a fact, to wit: The fact that a sufficient appropriation has been made. This knowledge requires neither judgment nor discretion. To perform clerical duties, in most instances, requires a knowledge of some fact or facts. Where such fact or facts are acquired by mere inspection without the exercise of judgment, it cannot be said to confer on the party judicial or discretionary duties.</p>

All we decide is that his duties under the fifth section of article IX of said act, in relation to certifying contracts, are ministerial only. There is no inconsistency in the same officer being vested with both judicial and ministerial duties.
