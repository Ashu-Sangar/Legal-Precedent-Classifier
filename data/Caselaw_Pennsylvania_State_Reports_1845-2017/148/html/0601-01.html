But in the act of 1889, banks and corporations are expressly included in the enumeration of taxable owners, and no room is left for construction. The subjects of taxation are, inter alia, ‘ all mortgages, all money owing by solvent debtors, whether by promissory note, or penal or single bill, bond or judgment,’ and 4 all public loans whatsoever, except those issued by this commonwealth or the United States.’ The exceptions are ‘bank notes or notes discounted or negotiated by any banking institution, savings institution or trust company.’ If the case rested here the rule that the expression of one thing is the exclusion of others, would apply, and no room would be left for inferring that other exceptions were intended: Brocket v.

Interest-bearing bonds of a city, held by a savings bank, are clearly within the purview of the section, and, just as clearly, are not within any of the exceptions. Notwithstanding the shareholders are taxable on their stock, the bank is also taxable on the obligations in question, unless they are exempted therefrom by some subsequent section, or unless it appears from a fair view of the act as a whole that the former method of taxation was intended to be exclusive. This brings us to the third question.</p>

Are loans, secured and held as aforesaid, and constituting part of the capital and profits of a savings bank, exempt from such taxation when the bank has elected to pay into the state treasury, on or before the first day of March, a tax of six mills on the dollar upon the par value of all the shares of stock of said bank that have been subscribed for or issued?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b629-5" data-blocks='[["BL_629.6",629,[195,2332,1158,94]],["BL_630.1",630,[252,387,1171,1501]]]'>44 Section 25 of the act provides that, when any bank or savings institution makes the election referred to, 4 the shares, and <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>so much of the capital and profits of such bank as shall not be invested in real estate, shall be exempt from local taxation, under the laws of this commonwealth.’ If the bank does not make the election, a method is prescribed, whereby the auditor-general settles an account against the individual shareholders for the three mills state tax on shares, and he is directed to proceed to collect the same according to law, and to transmit the list and assessments made byr him to the commissioners, or board of revision, of the proper city or county, to be used by them in assessing taxes against shareholders. All this seems to be very plain, and to give no occasion for construction. The premium for paying the six mills tax on the par value of the shares is exemption from local taxation. There may be some compensation also, where the market value of the shares is greater than the par value. But, be that as it may, exemption of shares, and capital and profits not invested in real estate, from local taxation, cannot be construed to exempt money at interest, although constituting a part of the capital and profits of the bank, from state taxation, unless we assume that the legislature used the phrase, local taxation, in the sense of taxes levied under state, as distinguished from federal, laws. In that sense a state tax would be a local tax, but in no other, and, of course, the phrase was not used in that sense. The act of 1889 is a supplement to, and an amendment of the act of 1885, in which the language was, ‘shall be exempt from all other taxation under the laws of this commonwealth.’ The substitution, in the act of 1889, of the phrase ‘ local taxation under the laws of this commonwealth,’ shows an unmistakable intention to confine the exemption to taxation for local purposes, or by local authorities.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[252,1907,1165,499]],["BL_631.1",631,[167,372,1159,1567]]]'>“ But, it is argued, if a savings bank is subject to the three mills tax on that portion of its capital and profits invested in interest-bearing obligations, and the individual shareholders are subject to a like tax for the same purpose, on the value of their shares, there will be double taxation. But double taxation is not prohibited, and is sometimes unavoidable. It is unnecessary to cite the numerous cases sustaining it. In Fox’s Ap., <a href="/pa/112/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="112 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="546754" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0337-01">112 Pa. 337</a>-854, the power of the legislature to tax the capital stock of corporations, and also mortgages and other interest-bearing obligations of the corporation, was not doubted. The <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>present chief justice said : ‘ Were the tax of 1885 on mortgages extended to corporations, the result would be double taxation, which, while not beyond the powers of the legislature, is not to be presumed in the absence of a clear intent to impose it.’ The omission of corporations from the enumeration of taxable owners of interest-bearing obligations, in the act of 1885, was one of the reasons, if not the principal reason, for the passage of the act of 1889. In view of this fact, and of the plain language of the act, would it be safe to presume an intent to exempt all corporations from such taxation, merely because the individual shareholders are also taxable on the value of their shares ? We think not. In the first case the tax is on a part of the property of the corporation; in the other case the tax is on the property of the shareholders. Capital stock of a corporation is a different thing from shares of stock: Lycoming Co. v. Gamble, <a href="/citations/?q=47%20Pa.%20110" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="47 Pa. 110">47 Pa. 110</a>. The capital stock represents the property and assets of the company, which may consist in whole, or in part, of real estate. The certificates, or shares of stock, are the evidence of an interest which the holder has in the corporation, and it is well settled that this interest is personal property (Bouv. L. Diet., Personal Property), and, as such, follows the person of the owner: McKeen v. Northampton, <a href="/pa/49/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="49 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="998432" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0519-01">49 Pa. 519</a>; Com. v.

If there is this distinction between capital stock and shares, there is an equally plain distinction between part of the capital invested in interest-bearing securities and shares. Under the decisions both may be taxed for state purposes if the legislature so wills, and, in the case of banks and savings institutions, we think the intent of the legislature is free from all doubt. This is not necessarily double taxation, although we concede there are cases where it would amount to that, at least as against resident shareholders.</p>

In the former case the proviso is: ‘ That corporations .... liable to tax on capital stock under this section, shall not be required to pay any further tax on the mortgages, bonds and other securities belonging to them, and constituting any portion of their assets included within the <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>appraised value of their capital stock,’ etc. Banks and savings institutions are expressly excepted from the provisions of the section, and, therefore, from the proviso which, as will be seen at a glance, is quite different from the conditional exemption, clause of § 25. This difference shows what language the legislature would have used in the latter section if they had intended what the plaintiff claims.</p>
