The auditor erred in not finding as matter of law that the entry of judgment on the note of Vietor &amp; Achelis, as bearers, was irregular and void.” [3] The court overruled the exceptions; but directed an issue to be framed between Vietor &amp; Achelis, as plaintiffs, and the appellants, among others, as defendants, to try the questions whether the note upon which the Vietor &amp; Achelis judgment was entered was given by Johnson to them for a valuable consideration; and whether said note and confession of judgment were given for the purpose of hindering or defrauding the petitioners for the issue. A verdict and judgment were entered in this issue for the plaintiffs, in January, 1892; and, in February, the auditor’s report was confirmed absolutely.</p>

The principal contention was over the judgment of Yietor &amp; Achclis, which the appellants contended was a void instrument, and did not warrant the entering of judgment and the issuing of execution: See second specification. We cannot say that it was a void instrument. It was a note for $12,500, payable to the maker or bearer, with a confession of judgment for that sum. Upon this note judgment was entered by the firm, Vie-tor &amp; Aehelis, bearers, through their attorney. The consideration of the note was the subject of inquiry, both by the auditor and the court below, aided by the verdict of the jury in a feigned issue. We think it was entitled to participate in the distribution.</p>
