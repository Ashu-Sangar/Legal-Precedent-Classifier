He testifies: ‘ Went over the same road going to the creamery, took the other side going home. It was a distance of twelve feet long, the road was in such a condition, and from one part of the gutter all the way over to the other, all through the road, from one side of the road to the other. Then it was kind of watery, but when you looked at it you could see ground, but it was all watery that way, like I told you, when a horse or wagon came on, it was bound to go down ’ — page 4. He further testifies that he knew this hole was there for some months and he knew it was a dangerous place, page 10, and in this he was corroborated by several witnesses, who testified that the character of the road was apparent and dangerous. We then have this proposition clearly proven — a driver knows that part of a road is dangerous and that part can be safely traveled. In daytime he avoids the safe part which he had traversed in the morning and deliberately drives into a hole plainly visible and which he considers dangerous, when by continuing on the opposite side he would have had a safe path; an accident follows : in his own words, 6 when a horse or wagon came on, it was bound to go down.’ There was no question raised as to whether plaintiff’s son had exercised due care and <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>caution, and the court would, have been obliged to instruct the jury that ‘ whatever may have been the condition of the street, or however dangerous, if the plaintiff knew of such danger and could have avoided it by turning aside, or by going on the opposite side of the street, but instead of doing so chose to run the risk of passing over the dangerous spot and so encountered the hurt and injury complained of, he would be guilty of what is called in the law contributory negligence, and your verdict should be for the defendantCity of Erie v.

But in this case the plaintiff’s own testimony showed the absence of all care and caution, for the driver made no effort to avoid the danger but rather sought it. Where the evidence is uncontradicted that under such circumstances an accident happened because of a willful and deliberate driving into a dangerous place known to be such, it would be folly to submit to a jury the question as to whether due care had been exercised. And now, Sept. 21, 1891, motion refused.”</p>

In addition to the reasons therefor given by the learned judge below, it is by no means clear that the township was guilty of negligence. Conceding that the road was <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>bad, almost impassable, the fact must not be overlooked that it was a country road, and that its condition was tbe result of the weather. In this respect it was not unlike almost every other road in the rural districts after a frost and constant rains. It would be laying too heavy a burden upon townships to hold them responsible for the swampy and miry conditions of the roads at certain seasons. There is, of course, a difference in country roads at such times, owing principally to the character of the soil. If its condition is the result of the weather, and the nature of the soil, and not to the neglect of the township in keeping it in repair, we see no reason why the township should be held responsible for an accident, such as we have in this case.</p>
