There is but one point that will answer this intention and call for two straight lines. A beginning at any other point would be a deformity. All parties concede that it was to be a direct line, and the terminus at the wolf-trap, Big Bend or Brimstone Falls on the Loyalsock is conceded by all to be correct. All interested have regarded the point where the stone heap is, on the Genesee road, as the proper southeast corner since 1804. Both Shrewsbury and Elkland townships were originally formed on petition with their boundaries described therein, without a boundary line having first been run and marked. And whether Benjamin marked it or not prior to 1842, all parties have recognized it for seventy or eighty years, and it is further supported by the fact that the southeast comer of Elkland township, now Plunkett’s Creek, is only determined by the closing line of Elkland township when applied for and surveyed by Mr. Benjamin. Which is the north line of Muncy township, now Wolf and Mill Creek?

McHenry acknowledged this as the proper corner in 1842, when he ran the line at the request of the supervisors of Shrewsbury township and the court, without any order issuing from the court for that purpose. He ran the line up from Indian Pictures to the Genesee road; then went over to the other end and found that line to bear date of 1804. He ran it about one mile and three eighths, when its entire length is about <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>ten miles, and at the other end made the stone heap at the Genesee road, at the foot of the mountain. It was known as the Benjamin line, and although rather badly run, passed for the line at that date. It seems that Benjamin and his party, in 1804, did not run the line from the Brimstone falls further than the white ash at Mr. Hill’s, about one mile and three eighths, and then gave it up as did McHenry, in 1842, after going one mile and three eighths. In those days the territory was one vast wilderness and swamp, and McHenry continued the line through as in the return of Benjamin’s draft by plot and protraction, without marking it upon the ground all the way. He says in his testimony: ‘ Continuing the line southwestward to the poplar I found I was not within a mile or two of the point designed to be connected on the paper, and turned from there south, sixty-seven west until I struck the old Genesee road, and then down it to the stone heap.’</p>

Exhibit ‘D,’ being the copy of the straight, alleged Benjamin line of 1804, Col. McHenry says is his work. ‘ It seems to represent the boundary line from the wolf-trap through between Plunkett’s creek and Shrewsbury townships, beginning at a road lately laid out between Abraham Webster’s and John Hill’s, opposite the lake in the Allegheny mountains, and thence in a right line to the Big Bend in the Loyalsock. But I am not prepared to say where it is in relation to the wolf-trap. This don’t seem to connect with any other. This, the last course from the Loyalsock to the county line, seems to be above the wolf-trap. I do not know where the hemlock call there is located. Have no knowledge of it only as I see it here.

I never heard any one dispute that corner at the Genesee road. The overseers and supervisors of Shrewsbury township were with us and they didn’t dispute that McHenry ended his survey there.

They were blurred and quite dim, but still they could be read. We ran from Picture Rocks to the Genesee road at the stone heap. Parties there present told us that Wolf, Shrewsbury, Plunkett’s Creek and Mill Creek townships cornered at that point. We hadn’t yet fixed it as the point. Whilst we were there one morning trying to find the point to start, other gentlemen from Shrews-bury township and Mr. McHenry, the surveyor, who stated that that was the point he desired to make, but that he had started at the other end of the line, at a place called the wolf-trap, and came through. That he had made that as one point and this stone pile as the point at this end of the line. He said that these points were fixed by papers in the case. And as I said, that was the point we were trying to find when wo made this survey up from Webster’s when he told us where it was. We spent most of the day with Mr. McHenry, who was explaining the courses and distances that he ran in order to make this point, and when he came to the Genesee road and found that he would not strike it, he then struck across to the Genesee road and followed it to the point. That night we staid at Huntersville, and Judge Eldred spent the night figuring out the points of the compass that would take him from this stone pile to the wolf-trap in a direct line. The next morning we met at this stone pile on the Genesee road and proceeded to lay out a straight line from it towards the wolf-trap. We went as far as the Sullivan county line and drove in a post and piled some stones around it and put some witnesses on the trees, and left it as our line and’gave in our report.

It appears that upon the original petition, Stuart, Laird and Reeder were appointed viewers by the court, and from time to time continued by the court until 1887, when it was again continued and the above named persons ‘ released from service as viewers and the following surveyors appointed in their places: George W. West, Danville, Pa.; A. J. Guffy, Watsontown, Pa., and O. J. Reese, Goudersport, Pa., to which the commissioners of Shrewsbury township objected,’ etc. Subsequently an order issued to the first named commissioners to view, and the last named commissioners acting under it, they met all parties interested on the ground Dec. 27, 1887. After wonderful investigation, labor and care, they reported the three lines as filed in the clerk’s office, with conditional instructions to the court with reference to the approval of the same.</p>
