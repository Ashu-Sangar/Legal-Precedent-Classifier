J., specially presiding, it appeared that prior to 1887, the firm of Baird &amp; Co., composed of N. C. Harris, R. A. Elmer, <em>J. </em>C. Baird and S. C. Hall, was in the harness business. The firm was unsuccessful and was dissolved in the year named. Elmer withdrew to New York, where he died, and letters testamentary upon his estate were granted to his widow. At the time of the dissolution, the firm was indebted to the First National Bank of Athens, and the amount of the debt was then liquidated. Afterward, S. C. Hall, in the name of the firm, sued the bank for usurious interest paid, and recovered a certain sum of money. Sarah F. Elmer, executrix, assigned to F. K. Harris her claim on behalf of her testator against this fund. Harris began this suit by a summons, which was served upon Hall while temporarily in Pennsylvania.</p>

It seems the firm had occasion to borrow money of the bank at Athens, and about May 18,1887, the time of the dissolution, paid what they owed the bank. Afterwards S. C. Hall, in the name of the firm, sued the bank for usurious interest and recovered a certain sum of money. This suit was brought to recover R. A. Elmer’s share of it.</p>

We understood at the time that Hall was a resident of Pennsylvania.

L. 136, Purd. 509-13 provides that letters granted out of this commonwealth shall not confer any of the powers possessed by an executor or administrator under letters granted in Pennsylvania. See Sayre’s Ex’rs v. Helme’s Ex’rs, <a href="/pa/61/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="61 Pa. 299" data-case-ids="428569" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0299-01">61 Pa. 299</a>. This act cannot interfere with the administration of the estate in New York. By the letters there granted the administrator had undoubted power to pass the title to this claim to F. K. Harris. This she could not have done if S. C. Hall had resided in Pennsylvania. She had no control over the assets of the estate in Pennsylvania, but she could dispose of such as were in the state of New York, and as Hall resided there at the time of the assignment to Harris, we must give due effect to the laws of that state operating upon property within its limits. F. K. Harris thus becoming the legal holder of the claim, with power to sue in his own name* had the right to collect the debt anywhere he could get service on the defendant. The question seems to be governed by the principle of Moore v.
