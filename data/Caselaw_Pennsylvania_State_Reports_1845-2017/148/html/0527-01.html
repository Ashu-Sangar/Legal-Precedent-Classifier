Co., loaded on a freight car and consigned to the plaintiff. All ordinary precautions for safe carriage were taken. The testimony of the plaintiff was that after the train had passed Baltimore and passed into the control of defendant, it was suddenly stopped and then immediately started with such violence as to jerk both the mare and the man in charge of her off their feet. The mare was thrown with such force that her back was broken, and upon the arrival of the train in Philadelphia, by the advice of a veterinary surgeon, she was killed. Testimony on behalf of the defendant was to the effect that whatever injury occurred to the mare occurred before the arrival of the train at Baltimore.</p>

Ridout, who had charge of her, said that when they came into the tunnel in Baltimore she was thrown down by a sudden jerk and he was thrown down with her, and when they came to Philadelphia they had her examined by a veterinary surgeon, and it was found that her back was broken and she had to be killed.</p>

They had passed through one tunnel already, and that the colored man, that is Ridout, could give no reason why the horse was down. Another witness said that the mare had been frightened by a passing train and had broken her halter-strap and that was the cause of the injury. Now how did it occur ? Did it occur, as Ridout said, in Baltimore, by a sudden jerking of the train ? Ridout said the train stopped. Two other witnesses said the train did not stop. Ridout said the mare was not down before she came to Baltimore. Condon says she was down, for he saw her down. The flagman said he saw the colored man and he said the mare had been frightened by a passing train and had fallen down. Now, if the jury find that this train was suddenly stopped in a negligent and improper manner, in such a way as to throw the mare down, then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover in this suit. If, on the other hand, the mare shied at a passing train and that caused her to fall down and break her back, the company is not liable. If you believe Ridout, that the mare was killed by reason of the sudden stoppage of the car in Baltimore without any warning, then the railroad company is responsible for her value. On the other hand, if you believe she was killed by shying by being frightened by a passing train, then the company is not liable. [If you find that her injury and death arose from the negligence of the company in this case, then the plaintiff cannot recover more than $100. That is the amount at which the mare is valued in the bill of lading, and that under the law in Washington limits the amount for which the <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>railroad company is liable. That is the law of Washington where the mare was shipped, and is the law of Maryland where the mare was injured.] [1] [If you find for the plaintiff at all you cannot find for more than the $100 and interest since July, 1890.] [2] [The plaintiff is not entitled to recover for his expenses in looking after the mare. He is only entitled to recover the amount at which her value is limited in the bill of lading.] [3] ”</p>

The mare was shipped at Washington over the Baltimore &amp; Potomac R. R., and consigned to the plaintiff at Harsimus, New Jersey. It was claimed that when the train reached Baltimore, and had passed into the control and custody of the defendant company, it was suddenly stopped and then immediately started, with such violence as to throw the mare off her feet with such force that her back was <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>broken. The jury have found the fact of negligence. The shipping receipt contained this stipulation: “ When a valuation as agreed upon shall be named upon this shipping receipt, it is distinctly understood that such valuation shall cover loss or damage from- any cause whatever.”</p>
    <p id="b557-3" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[190,666,1158,606]]]'>The appellant shipped this mare under a special contract arising on a bill of lading. The valuation was that of the shipper.
