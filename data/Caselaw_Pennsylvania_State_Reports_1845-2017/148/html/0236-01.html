What those purposes may lawfully be, since the act of April 15,1884, is set forth in the proviso to section 3, clause 11, of that statute: 1 Purd. Dig., p. 364, pi. 14. Before its enactment, the general power of county commissioners to take lands was confined to such as were bought in by them to secure the county debts, on process from the courts, or their own process authorized by law, or mortgages given to secure the county debts: Vankirk v. Clark, 16 S. &amp; R. 286, 290. That they might enter into a valid agreement with a property holder adjoining, e. g., a county prison, not to build against its walls, with a view to preventing the escape of prisoners while the building was used as a place for their confinement, seems scarcely doubtful. And if they might do that by a mere agreement, they might, in order to be in position to insure the accomplishment of the purpose, do so by taking a fee in the property to be kept open for such purpose. But they could not take more, they could not make an investment of more, than was required by the immediate and lawful object in view; that is to say, whilst they could take a fee, that fee must be determinable upon the cessation of the necessity or occasion of its acquisition and the possibility of serving the purpose of its creation. <em>%</em>

(The employment of the word ‘ forever ’ seems insignificant in this connection; for, as has been seen, the estate might continue forever, and so in that case would the purpose. On the other hand, a grant of an estate ‘forever’ may yet be but of a life estate: 2 Blackst. Cornm., p. 107.) Hence there is a peculiar propriety in applying to the parties’ declaration of purpose the familiar principle of interpretation, <em>expressum facit cessare taciturn. </em>That declaration shows but one purpose, and shows it clearly. It was not to <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>afford light, air or access to the adjoining tenement, to add anything to it that was needful or convenient to its use and enjoyment, nor to increase the size of the plot upon which the prison stood, or to enhance its value, set off its architectural proportions, or protect it against fire. It was simply to serve the one declared object — the hindrance of the escape of prisoners, which the erection of walls contiguous to those of the prison would facilitate. In view of all the circumstances, there seems to arise from the express declaration of purpose a necessary implication of the exclusion of every other. .It is a rule in the construction of a statute, pleading, contract, will and other instrument that what is clearly implied is as much a part of it as what is expressed: U.

The instrument under consideration is, therefore, to be treated precisely as if it contained a declaration that the grant was for the purpose mentioned and no other. But, where an estate is conveyed in fee for a specified purpose ‘ and no other,’ the fee is a base fee determinable upon cessation of the use of the property for that purpose: Kirk v.

Of course not; but that, is not this case. In actions respecting real property, if there be no equitable ground of relief involved, the rights of the parties must be determined at law; the interference of equity in such a case resting on the principle of a clear right to the enjoyment of the subject in question and an injurious interruption of that right, which, upon just and equitable grounds, ought to be prevented, and the party, contesting that right, in the first instance dependent upon conflicting proofs, being entitled to have them passed upon by a jury : <a href="/pa/105/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="105 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="454298" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0480-01">Ibid.</a> A very different case is presented when the intervention of the court is asked upon a recognized ground of equitable jurisdiction; when the rights of the parties result from an undisputed written instrument, aided by facts that are admitted; when the injury complained of, arising from conceded acts, is partly subsisting and actual and partly anticipated, and of such a character as to afford no redress at law. No doubt, if the plaintiff were to proceed to build upon the strip of land in dispute, it is possible that a suit at law would be instituted against him in which his rights would eventually be passed upon.
