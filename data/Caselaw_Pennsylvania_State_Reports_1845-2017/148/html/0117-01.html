This suit has been brought to recover $75 a year due on the 1st Monday of October, of the years 1884, 1885,1886 and 1887. The defendant is a corporation authorized to transmit messages in various states of this union, including the state of Pennsylvania, and it is claimed in its behalf that no state is authorized to impose a burden of this character upon it. That such imposition-would be an interference with the right of carrying on what is called interstate commerce, and that the laws of the United States forbid such an interference, and it is also contended on its behalf that even if by the exercise of what is called the police power, the right to exact a sum exists, that this sum of $1.00 a pole is excessive. That the expense of inspecting the poles during the years in question amounts to nothing, and at the furthest it involves only the attention of the police officers for one or two days, and that these officers served at the rate of $40 a month, and that therefore it was excessive, and instead of being an exercise of police power, was by indirection a tax, and therefore illegal in as muchas it was imposed on this corporation that has a right to its business in the various states.</p>

    <p id="b145-10" data-blocks='[["BL_145.12",145,[175,1251,1180,1160]]]'>We agree with the learned judge of the court below that this case is ruled by Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Phila., 22 W. N. 39, where it was held that a municipality has a right, •and it is its duty, to supervise and control the erection and maintenance of telegraph poles and wires within its limits. Hence, where a municipality imposed by ordinance a license fee of $1 per annum on each pole, and of $2.50 per annum on each mile of wire within its limits, the court declined to rule that the fee so charged was so obviously unjust as to authorize a revision of the action of the city councils. In the case in hand, it appears that the city of Allentown enacted an ordinance requiring every telegraph, telephone or electric light company’s poles in the city of Allentown to be inspected by the police department, and that the same should be licensed, and requiring a fee of $1 each year to be paid for each pole. This ordinance was in the exercise of the police power of the city, and the only question was whether it was a reasonable exercise of such power. The amount of the license fee in such cases rests with the city councils in the first instance. It is only where such discretion has been abused that we are justified in interfering. We cannot -say that this discretion has been abused in this instance, or that the license fee is unreasonable.</p>
    <p id="b145-11" data-blocks='[["BL_145.13",145,[231,2430,357,41]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
