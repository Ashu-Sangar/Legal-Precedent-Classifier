A short time before decedent’s death he sent Handrick to the bank where the bonds had been deposited with á note to the cashier to “let Eugene have bonds to bring down home.” The cashier declined to do so, but himself took the bonds to Mr. Osterhout and handed them to him, and Handrick being then present, Osterhout handed the bonds to him, saying, “Eugene, here are the bonds.” Handrick left the room, and Osterhout said to the cashier that he always intended to do well by Eugene.

After testator’s death, Handrick claimed these bonds as having been given him by the testator; whereupon Keeney presented a petition, as one of the executors, to the orphans’ court, asking for a decree directing his coexecutor 1» surrender the bonds to the estate, and also for an injunction restraining him from selling or'disposing of them. The injunction was granted, and afterwards an issue framed, in which Keeney was plaintiff and Handrick defendant, and sent to the common pleas to try the disputed question as to whether the bonds had been given as alleged. It was upon the trial of this issue that the testimony above indicated was given. In rebuttal plaintiff offered to prove what property the testator possessed at the date of the making of the will, the proportion in which this property was divided under the terms of the will, and that this alleged gift if sustained, together with the specific legacies to defendant, would practically exhaust the estate of testator. The evidence was objected to and excluded.</p>

If you find that at the time F. W. DeWitt was there he expressed the thought and the intention of giving these bonds to E. S. Handrick, and did deliver them to him, then you would be justified in finding for the defendant upon that branch of the case. On the other hand if the evidence does not satisfy you that at that time P. M. Ousterhout did by words express the idea of a gift of that property to E. S. Handrick, then there was no gift made and so far as that particular time is concerned you ought to find that the proof of gift was not made out.] [7]</p>

It is true that where an attempt is made to prove a gift by the declarations of a donor, testimony of this kind should be carefully scrutinized. It is easily fabricated and hard to contradict, and it is always the duty of the jury to scan such evidence closely.</p>

Keeney, as executor of the last will and testament of P. M. Osterhout, deceased, was plaintiff, and E. S. Handrick was defendant. The issue was to try the question of ownership of seven bonds, of $1,000 each, formerly the property of the said P. M. Osterhout, deceased. The defendant contended that the bonds in question had been given to him by the deceased, shortly before Ms death. The plaintiff contended that there had been no such valid gift, and that he was <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>entitled to the possession of said bonds, as the executor of the estate of Osterhout.</p>

There was no question as to the delivery of the bonds by the testator to the defendant, who was his son-in-law. It was alleged, however, that the language of the testator, at the time of the delivery, and in connection therewith, was equivocal. Conceding this to be so, the meaning of testator’s language was for the jury. It is idle to say that it was not consistent with a gift, and there was other evidence in the cause tending to show that it was intended by the testator as a gift. In any event there was sufficient evidence upon this jxfint to submit to the jury, and, as it appears to have been submitted upon careful and satisfactory instructions by the court, we see no reason why the judgment should be disturbed.</p>
