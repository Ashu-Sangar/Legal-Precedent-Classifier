The by-laws of the corporation provided that said “ Company should be composed of representatives of lodges and encampments of the I. O. O. F., in good standing and working under the charters granted by the Grand Lodge and Grand Encampment of the state of Pennsylvania, who should subscribe for not less than ten lots in the said cemetery and pay the sum of $100,” and “ that every lodge or encampment becoming a member of this company shall be entitled to a lodge lot or plot of ground in the cemetery in which to inter the members of such lodge or encampment, their wives, or orphans, or visiting brethren, or any persons, except persons of color, to whom said lodge or en campment may see proper to extend the privilege of inter<a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>ment.” The by-laws also provided that every lot owner, on application to the proper officer, should receive a deed in fee simple for his or her lot or lots on payment of the purchase money. The plaintiffs were a subordinate lodge in good standing and working under a charter from the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. This lodge became a purchaser of ten lots in the cemetery and paid to the company the sum of $100, and the company by indenture on December 30, 1850, in consideration of a subscription for ten lots in said company and the full amount' of $100, did grant, bargain, sell and confirm unto George Root, trustee for said lodge, in trust for the use of said lodge, a certain lot or parcel of ground in said cemetery.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b521-5" data-blocks='[["BL_521.5",521,[183,1001,1160,1165]]]'>Plaintiffs immediately went into possession of their lot, which was inclosed by a fence, using it for burial purposes; and had been in undisputed possession to the time of the committing of the grievances complained of. A few years ago the city of Philadelphia directed the opening of Diamond, Norris and Twenty-third streets through the grounds of the Cemetery Company. It was alleged that the board of trustees entered into an arrangement whereby an exchange of property was effected for the purpose of squaring the lines of the lots and to avoid the angles resulting from the opening of said streets. Penn Township Lodge was represented by its trustee in the board of trustees in the Cemetery Company. He objected to the proposed changes and voted against them. It was further alleged on the part of the defendant company that the squaring of the cemetery lots required a replotting of that portion of the cemetery affected. The defendant company made a new avenue immediately upon and across the lot of ground which had been conveyed to the plaintiffs, which obliterated the inclosure and destroyed the marks where the interments had been made. This was done against the protest and objection of the plaintiffs, who refused to select a new lot which was offered them, claiming their right to retain the lot which they had paid for and which had ever since been in their undisputed possession.</p>
