If this note was given for the logs to be delivered under this contract of December 3,1868, and that contract was merged in the contract of the 21st January, 1869, then we do not see any difficulty in the way of the plaintiff recovering the amount of the note and interest; but if from the evidence the jury believe there were two contracts, the contract of December 3, 1868, and the contract of January 21,1869, and this note was given as an advance upon the contract of the 21st of January, 1869, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, because it does not appear and it is not claimed that any logs were delivered under the contract of the 21st of January, 1869 ; that is if you come to the conclusion that it was an additional contract to the contract of December 3, 1868, because all the logs . which were delivered by Cook to Billmeyer, Nogel &amp; Co. have been delivered under the contract of December 3, 1868.”</p>

    <p id="b359-7" data-blocks='[["BL_359.9",359,[201,825,1164,648]]]'>We think the court below was right in rejecting the paper referred to in the first specification of error. It purports to be an agreement between Samuel A. Cook and Billmeyer, Nogle &amp; Co., yet it is signed only by the said Cook. It is true it was found in the possession of the defendants, and produced by them upon notice. There was no evidence, however, that it was ever assented to by the defendants, and their possession of it implies no more than that it may have been sent to them for their consideration. Moreover, there was no evidence of the delivery of the saw logs referred to in the paper, and which would seem to be the consideration upon which the paper was based. An examination of the remaining assignments fails to disclose error.</p>
