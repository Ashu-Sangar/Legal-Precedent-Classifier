The moment their work differed from the work of the viewers of 1788, it ceased to have validity. The legality of their work and their findings depend on its correspondence with the location and opening of the road as already established by act of the law. The commission took no judicial authority by virtue of the act by which they were appointed. The commissioners under the act had no authority to interfere with rights outside of the road. That the commissioners, under that act, did not definitely ‘ retrace the original lines of the said road ’ is evident from the face of their report. They do not pretend they found any monument. They state that their location of the road is based on the statement of citizens — mere neighborhood talk — local tradition — that the several monuments which governed them were considered ‘ by old citizens of the place as authentic.’ Evidently, they deemed it ‘ expedient ’ to adopt <a id="p637" href="#p637" data-label="637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*637</a>the lines of the neighborhood and traditional talk. While it may be (and likely is) true that this line was a most available compromise between the conflicting claims of right by citizens of the place, ‘ strong evidence that the inhabitants had been regardful of metes and bounds and had shown a laudable spirit in carefully preserving the width of the road ’ is not the kind of evidence as to ‘ monuments ’ which the law recognizes. ‘ The several monuments that have governed them,’ are evidently the fences and houses on lots on the east side of the road — inhabitants on the west side could point to the same evidence in kind of an entirely different location of the road. Any owner of adjoining lots whose rights were interfered with by the location would not be bound by it, because the commission could not have exercised judicial rights. No notice of any kind was given to the public or the lot owners that the commission was proceeding to adjudicate their rights.

It has probably been so used for, at least, a hundred years. He further finds the fact that the alleged obstructions are not within the lines of the highway as it exists upon the ground. When once a public highway has been located and laid out upon the ground, and used by the public, its location cannot be changed, except by proceedings under the road laws.
