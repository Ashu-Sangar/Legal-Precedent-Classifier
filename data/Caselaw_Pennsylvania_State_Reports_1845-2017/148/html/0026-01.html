It was said in the opinion of the court: “ The motion to change the venue was in the sound discretion of the court below. The application was made upon the ground that a fair trial of the defendant could not be had in Potter county. The act of March 18, 1875, P. L. 30, provides that in criminal prosecutions the venue may be changed, for the causes enumerated in the act, when it ‘ is made to appear to the satisfaction of the court’ that the grounds upon which such application is made are well founded. In this case we are bound to presume that it did not appear to the satisfaction of the court that the defendant could not have a fair trial in Potter county. For anything the record discloses, the discretion of the learned judge was properly exercised. In any event, there was no such abuse of discretion as would justify our interference.

We do not think the act in question violates either of the constitutions referred to. Where a witness has been examined in the presence of the accused, and the latter has had a full opportunity to cross-examine him, we think the additional requirement, that the defendant should meet his accuser face to face, is fully complied with.</p>

To deny this right would, in many instances, seriously interfere with the administration of justice, if not wholly defeat it. The defendant is not injured in such case, because he has been brought face to face with the witness, and has cross-examined him when the testimony was taken. In Brown v. The Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/73/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="73 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1032346" data-case-paths="/pa/73/0321-01">73 Pa. 321</a>, it appeared that on the preliminary hearing before the committing magistrate, the defendant and his counsel being present, a witness was examined whose testimony was taken down by defendant’s counsel, and the witness having died before the trial, the notes of his evidence, proved by the counsel under oath, were offered in evidence, objected to and admitted. It was contended that, by the constitution of this state, the defendant was entitled to meet the witness face to face. It was held by <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>this court, in an elaborate opinion by Chief Justice Read, that the notes of the hearing before the magistrate were properly admitted.

It may be conceded that the conduct of the sheriff in this respect was officious and unauthorized. It is not the duty of that officer, when summoning a juror, to ask him any questions in regard to his bias or prejudice for or against the prisoner, nor whether he has any conscientious scruples against capital punishment. The questions, however, were such as are usually and properly asked in court of á juror before he is brought to the book. The court below appears to have thoroughly investigated this matter, and it is apparent that no injury was done to the prisoner. There was nothing to show that any person otherwise competent as a juror was rejected by him. He omitted to summon but two persons, and it is evident that if they had been summoned, they would have been rejected as incompetent. At the same time, it is to be observed that the proceeding was irregular, and not to be countenanced. If there was any reason to believe that the prisoner had been prejudiced by it, we would reverse this judgment and order a new trial. But we ought not to interfere with the administration of the criminal law, except for substantial reasons. A verdict twice rendered ought not to be set aside for the mistake of a bungling official, which has done no harm to the defendant.</p>

But there is nothing to show that any of them, at any time during the trial, was intoxicated or visibly under the effect of liquor. This matter is very fully referred to in the opinion of the learned judge below in refusing a new trial, and the circumstances detailed under which the liquor was used. Several of the jurors appear to have taken it for medicinal purposes, and none of them to have indulged to such an extent as to interfere with the proper performance of their duty as jurors. While there is no law which forbids the use of intoxicating liquors to jurors, even in a capital case, it is nevertheless the duty of the court, where the juror has indulged in their use, to scrutinize his conduct, and if it should appear that he has been intoxicated to any degree, a new trial should be granted. We are not prepared to say, however, that a verdict should be set aside for no other reason than that a juror has taken a glass of liquor. Were we to declare such an iron-clad rule to be the law, it would only be necessary for a friendly juror to smuggle a bottle of liquor into the jury room to set aside the verdict. The better rule is for the trial judge to forbid the use of liquor in the jury room, except by permission of the court, and for cause shown. There may be instances, indeed I have known such, where its use was necessary by reason of sickness or other cause. In such cases, a physician may be called in to examine the juror, and prescribe for him.</p>

The reference to intoxication in the tenth specification is entirely accurate, and as favorable to the prisoner as he had any right to expect.

It is predicated of the prisoner’s guilt of murder, coupled with a doubt as to whether the grade of the felony is higher than murder of the second degree. At most, it is nothing more than a prayer for a merciful disposition of a case, in which the petitioners were, at least, doubtful whether the crime was of the higher grade. It cannot therefore be doubted that the action of the court in waiving the juror aside was prompted solely by the consideration that, by merely signing the petition, he had forever disqualified himself from serving as a juror in this case, notwithstanding the commonwealth, or the defendant, or both, might be satisfied as to his competency and impartiality. If his examination on his voir dire had been permitted to proceed in the usual and orderly way, who can undertake to say that his answers to the questions that would have been propounded would not have convinced the court, as well as the parties, that he was just such a juror, and that he would have been accepted as such ? The right of challenge is vested by the law, not in the court, but in the respective parties to the issue. In effect, the action of the court in this case was a usurpation of that right. The juror was not challenged by either of the parties. His examination, for the purpose of ascertaining what, if any, opinion he then entertained on the subject of capital punishment, guilt or innocence of the prisoner, etc., preliminary to exercising the right of challenge, was arrested in limine by the action of the court in curtly dismissing the juror, and ordering the clerk to call another. The prisoner was thus deprived of the legal right, which he undoubtedly had, to then and there interrogate the juror as to all matters bearing on his competency, impartiality, etc., and, after eliciting the facts, to ask the court to decide any question that might arise thereon, and have the same made a matter of record for the purpose of review in this court. It is, of course, utterly impossible for any one to say what facts would have <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>been established and spread upon the record, if the legal right of the defendant had not been denied. It is no answer t'o say that the prisoner was not, and could not, have been prejudiced by the denial of the right in question. No appellate court has a right to speculate as to what may, or may not, have been the effect of the denial of a legal right. Nor will it do to say that, because the juror appended his name to the petition, he was irrevocably disqualified, and forever disbarred from serving as such on the trial of this case. Such a proposition as that must necessarily rest upon the absurd assumption that there could be no locus penitenthe in such a case, that the juror could not have been convinced, in the interim, that the opinion entertained when he signed the petition was erroneous, in that it was founded on a. misapprehension of the facts, etc. The former judgment was reversed by this court in May, 1890. The second trial commenced nearly a year thereafter. The petition must have been signed after the first judgment was reversed, but whether immediately thereafter or not does not appear. It is quite certain, however, that the time which must have elapsed between signing the petition and examination of the. juror was not so short as to preclude a change of opinion.</p>

If the juror had been permitted to testify to the circumstances under which his name was appended to the petition, it might have conclusively appeared that he signed at the request of some friend or neighbor, without having any knowledge of the facts stated therein, other than that communicated to him orally by others. But it is useless to speculate as to what facts might have been established if the court had not erroneously interposed and closed the door against further inquiry. It is quite sufficient, for present purposes, to know that the prisoner had a clear legal right to interrogate the jurór, and that, by the action of the court, the privilege of exercising it was denied.</p>

Before the jury was sworn, defendant petitioned the court for a change of venue, under the act of March 18,1875, which provides that the venue may be changed, on application of defendant, in certain specified classes of cases, the fourth of which is as follows:</p>
    <p id="b71-5" data-blocks='[["BL_71.6",71,[191,1369,1177,249]]]'>“ 4.

As to two of the three required facts, viz., that this is the second trial, and that the regular panel was exhausted without obtaining a jury, there could be no question, because they were matters of record, of which the court is bound to take cognizance. The only remaining fact, viz., that the evidence of the former trial was published within the county, was susceptible of positive proof, and defendant averred his readiness to produce it. The court, without affording him an opportunity of doing so, but assuming the truth of all the averments necessary to bring the application within the said fourth clause, refused to allow a change of venue, holding that in either class of cases specified in the act, the court, in the exercise of its discretion, might grant or refuse any application. In that, I think, there was error. It is true the language of the second section of the act <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>is, “if the court shall be satisfied of the propriety of such change of venue, and that the causes assigned therefor are true, etc.; ” but that language is applicable only to other clauses of the first section, in which the legislative intent to invest the court with such discretionary power is apparent.

Probably it was not intended as an effort to secure the selection of talesmen predisposed in favor of the commonwealth rather than the prisoner, but it has, at least, the appearance of being too dangerously near it to justify even the tacit approbation of this or any other court.</p>

      <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>In his opinion, denying the motion for a new trial, the learned president of the oyer and terminer says, inter alia: “ The sheriff in summoning talesmen asked them these questions;— whether they had any conscientious scruples on the subject of capital punishment; whether they had formed or expressed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner, and whether they had signed the petition requesting the court to accept a plea of murder in the second degree. This was but putting questions to the juror similar to those which are authorized to be put at the examination of the juror as to his competency. But the sheriff is not the proper officer to put such questions, nor decide upon the answer, as the competency of the jurors must be determined by the court. . . . The only instruction given by the court to the sheriff was not to summon persons as jurors who had signed the petition, as all such would be rejected; and the defendant cannot complain of this as error. As to the other questions propounded by the sheriff, he must have received his instructions from the district attorney.”</p>

    <p id="b73-4" data-blocks='[["BL_73.5",73,[186,1527,1174,607]]]'>It was not incumbent on the prisoner to show that he was prejudiced by what was done. It is enough to know that he might have been; and who can tell that he was not prejudiced ? The only safe rule is to characterize all such dangerous departures from established practice as errors. In the language of the learned judge himself, in the opinion above quoted from: “ It is of the first importance, in all criminal cases, but especially in a capital one, that the defendant should have a trial by a fair and impartial jury. It is a right secured to him by the Declaration of Rights, which declares that in all prosecutions by indictment or information, the accused hath a right to a trial, by an impartial jury of the vicinage.”</p>

Speaking of an error into which the court inadvertently fell on the former trial of this case, the present Chief Justice said: “We cannot treat this as an immaterial matter which did not prejudice the defendant. It may not have done so, but we cannot say so. The issue of life and death is so vast, both in this world and the next, that it is our duty to weigh every word carefully, and leave nothing to conjecture : ” Commonwealth v.
