H. Vail, of Blairstown, N. J., and about ten years before her death came to Scranton to reside. Shortly after moving to Scranton, she became estranged from her sister, the appellant, and her other relatives living in Scranton, and sent to England for her niece, the appellee, to come to this country and <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>live with her. In 1885 testatrix purchased a property in Scranton, and consulted an attorney in regard to it, telling him that she desired her niece, the appellee, to have it after her death. He advised her to take the title in her own name and make a will leaving the property to the appellee. The evidence as to the execution of the will was to the effect that the paper was drawn by Dr. Vail, of Blairstown, N. J., and by him sent to James A. Linen, of Scranton, whose wife was a cousin of Dr. Vail. Mr. Linen sent for the testatrix, read it to her at his house, and she said it was as she wished it to be. Mr. and Mrs. Linen were the only witnesses present. They signed as “ witnesses to the mark,” but a formal attestation clause appeared below their signatures. Mrs. Linen testified that she saw testatrix make her mark. “ My husband made the mark for her, or she made the mark herself, of course. No one guided her hand, as I know of. I cannot remember, it is so long since, but I suppose I saw her take the pen in- her hand and make the mark. . . . When she made the cross she had the pen in her hand.” Mr. Linen testified : “ I made the mark with her hand on the pen. ... I always witness marks in the same way. ... I take the pen, and ask the person who wishes to make their mark, put the hand on the pen, and while the hand is on the pen, I guiding it, make the cross.” Other witnesses testified that she did not make the mark, because she could not handle the pen ; she did not know how to hold it. The evidence as to testamentary incapacity was to the effect that she was “ nervous, very nervous; had a very poor head; the least noise would hurt her; she would have to lie down all on one side of her head.” A few days after she made the will, testatrix told appellee that she had made it and that she had left everything to her, that Mr. and Mrs. Linen were the witnesses, and that Dr. Vail had the will.</p>
