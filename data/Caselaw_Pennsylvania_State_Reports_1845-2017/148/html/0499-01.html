Some nine months thereafter the plaintiff wrote in reference to these coats, alleging that he had been obliged to dispose of the same at auction and had lost a considerable sum by them. Defendant being anxious to retain plaintiff’s good will, directed his son, Clarence Davies, who was employed as a traveling salesman, to allow plaintiffs’ $50.00 on account of these goods when he should next be in Philadelphia. The son visited plaintiff’s store for the purpose of endeavoring to sell goods, and offered to make the allowance of $50.00 as authorized. Plaintiff claimed that this was not enough and finally induced him to agree to take back the unsold coats. It then appeared that 170 of the original lot of 195 were still in plaintiff’s hands. These he shipped to defendant in New York, who refused to receive them and repudiated the contract entered into by his son.</p>
