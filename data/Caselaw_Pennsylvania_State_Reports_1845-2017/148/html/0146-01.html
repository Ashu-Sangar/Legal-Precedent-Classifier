On Feb. 9, 1884, the defendant conveyed the mortgaged premises, subject to the mortgage, to Ellwood Parsons, to whom he also,, at the same time, transferred, on the books of the plaintiff association, his stock in said association. On Oct. 6, 1885, Ellwood Parsons and wife conveyed the same premises, subject to said mortgage, to Martha Mcllvaine, and she, on April 23, 1886, conveyed it to Levi Haas. A bill to foreclose said mortgage was filed Aug. 26, 1887, and final decree made July 22, 1889. On Sept. 14, 1889, the sheriff sold the mortgaged premises under the fore<a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>closure proceedings, and sold, at the same time, the stock in the plaintiff association, pledged by defendant as collateral security, and the plaintiff purchased both premises and stock. This sale was confirmed on Sept. 25,1889, and on Jan. 1,1890, plaintiff sold said premises. On April 14,1890, the plaintiff entered judgment upon the bond accompanying said mortgage, in the court of common pleas of Chester county, Pennsylvania, and on the same day issued a writ of fieri facias upon the same. On April 21, 1890, on motion of defendant, a rule was granted upon the plaintiff to show cause why the judgment should not be opened, and he let into a defence, which rule was, on July 14, 1890, made absolute. On Aug. 18, 1890, by agreement of counsel, the case was considered at issue with the same effect as though a writ of scire facias had issued, and the proper pleas been pleaded. No proceedings were ever had on the bond in the state of New Jersey.</p>
