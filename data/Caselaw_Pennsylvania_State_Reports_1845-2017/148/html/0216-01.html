Jenkins died, having devised the property in dispute to his wife for life, and upon her death to his daughter Ann and his two sons, Thomas and Samuel, equally. In 1888, Samuel Jenkins and wife conveyed their interest to a third party, and upon the same date he reconveyed to the wife of the plaintiff in this case. These proceedings for partition having been instituted, at the trial defendants offered in evidence an instrument alleged to be a deed from said Samuel Jenkins to his brother Thomas, made, acknowledged and recorded in 1880, conveying all Samuel’s interest in the said property to Thomas. After reciting the title of the grantor correctly, the deed continued : “ Now this Indenture witnesseth that the said Samuel S. Jones, for and in consideration, etc.” Counsel for plaintiff objected “ because the grantor named is Samuel S. Jones, and not Samuel S. Jenkins, the deed offered in evidence is not connected with Samuel S. Jenkins, husband of Mary Ann Jenkins, plaintiff.”</p>

Gentlemen of the jury, your verdict in this case must be in favor of the defendants, because the evidence as it now stands, without looking to any question as to the evidence given by the plaintiffs to sustain the case, is to the effect that Samuel S. Jenkins conveyed away his inheritance under his father’s will, giving a deed to his brother, Thomas S. Jenkins, for all of his interest, on the thirty-first of July, 1880. It being in evidence that the defendants claim under that deed, we cannot in this action in partition, try out any question of title that there may be in regard to the validity of this deed. That must be tried out in an action of ejectment.</p>

    <p id="b244-6" data-blocks='[["BL_244.8",244,[288,674,1169,553]]]'>The only question presented by this record is the validity of the deed from Samuel S. Jenkins to Thomas S. Jenkins, and the only objection to said deed is that, in one portion of it, the name Samuel S. Jenkins is written Samuel S. Jones. This was clearly the blunder of the conveyancer. The deed purports to be a deed from Samuel S. Jenkins; it is signed by Samuel S. Jenkins, and acknowledged by him as his act and deed. It is seldom we have a case brought here upon such a bald and meaningless technicality. It was not error to receive the deed in evidence, nor was there any error in the instructions of the court in regard to it.</p>
