You have the testimony, upon that question, of the plaintiff himself, that he made out a statement of his loss, and that he mailed it to the company at Boston. He is corroborated by the testimony of Elmer Lee, that he saw the plaintiff prepare the item of his loss; that they met Mr. Lathrope and showed the envelope to him, and that Mr. Lathrope said it was all right, and that he saw these papers mailed. The mailing of a letter or a written instrument, in an envelope properly addressed and stamped, is some evidence that the party to whom it is addressed received it. It is not conclusive evidence, but it is evidence which the court must submit to the jury, to be considered in the light of other facts and circumstances of the case. It is not conclusive evidence, therefore, gentlemen of the jury, but it is some evidence that the party to whom the letter is addressed, when it is properly addressed and stamped when it is mailed, that the party to whom it is addressed received it. But that may be rebutted, and it may be rebutted by the testimony of the party to whom it was addressed, if he is a competent witness. So you have simply the fact that it was mailed. I do not wish to say that that is a fact that it was mailed, but you have the ' testimony that this statement of his loss was mailed. That is all the evidence that the company ever received it.

You have the testimony of Mr. Mel-chert, who says that during the time and including these two dates, the 12th of April to the 9th of June, he was in attendance in the office of the company and in charge of the mail; that he was there constantly during the business hours, and that he had charge of the mail, and that they received no such paper as is testified to by the plaintiff and Mr. Lee. You have also the testimony of Mr. Lathrope. He testifies positively that the only proofs, or alleged proofs, that were ever produced to him by the plaintiff were those which were inclosed in this envelope, which Mr. Melchert testifies he received on the 9th of June, and which admittedly contain what has been referred to as proofs of loss that were made out at a later date. You have the testimony of Mr. Lathrope that that is the only time that the plaintiff ever came to him with any alleged proofs of loss. The plaintiff himself, if I recall his testimony correctly, testifies to having gone to Mr. Lathrope but once with what he calls proofs or statement of loss. Of course, if the papers which Mr. Whitmore prepared, were the papers that were not received by the company until the 9th of June, then they came too late; they were not served on the company within thirty days, and the plaintiff would have forfeited his rights, because he did not comply with the contract.</p>

If they do not call for it, the presumption is that they are satisfied with it, and waive any further notice under their contract, but such a statement must be sent, some proofs of loss must be made out under the contract unless the company expressly waive it.] [8] Mere silence upon the part of the company is not a waiver in the absence of proofs of loss.</p>

The defendant company alleges that while the plaintiff may have an interest in the land on which this building stood, that he was not the sole owner of it; that he was virtually a tenant in common with others, and, therefore, he cannot recover. If that be the fact, if he was not the sole owner of this property, was merely a tenant in common of the land on which the building stood with others, then he cannot recover, but if he was the sole owner of it, if the property belonged to him, then, if he furnished proofs of loss in time, he may recover.</p>

His counsel allege that he did not understand the proper meaning of this expres<a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>sion, and, when they found out what the facts were, they had to recall him for the purpose of explaining his testimony yesterday. So they put him on the stand to-day, and he alleges that there was a parol partition made of this land, that they derived it from their father. You have the testimony of the plaintiff himself, that he wrote to his brother John, and that John made arrangements with Stephen, and wrote back to him that they were well pleased with his proposed putting up a building, and that he might have the lot on which the building was, and that Stephen was satisfied with it. You have the testimony of John, corroborating him in that respect. [Upon the part of the defendant the question is, you see, gentlemen of the jury, if these three brothers owned this land together, they had a right to divide it up any way to suit themselves.] [9] If they divided it up by parol, and allotted or assigned this lot upon which this building was erected to the plaintiff, Daniel, they had a perfect right to do so, [and if they did do that, and in pursuance of that division or partition the plaintiff erected this dwelling-house upon this lot, then the property belonged to <em>him; </em>he took the title of all three, he took the title of the other two'in addition to his own, and, therefore, was the sole owner of it.] [9]</p>

Now, if Stephen was not a party to this arrangement, the plaintiff never acquired Stephen’s title, no matter though John may have written that Stephen was satisfied, it was all right, that they were pleased that he was going to take this lot; if Stephen was not a party to this arrangement, John and Daniel could not get Stephen’s title.</p>

Now, did he state the fact correctly then ? This testimony, I say, is strongly corroborative of the testimony of Stephen, that there was never any partition. It is an admission, upon the part of the plaintiff, at a time when he was called upon to act, that he was not the sole owner of this property. Then you have also the testimony of the plaintiff, as given by him yesterday when upon the stand; of course, that is as it has been explained by him to-day. You have got to take the whole of his testimony together. It is for you to consider which you believe. In all these questions of disputed facts, where there is a conflict in the testimony, it is the duty of the jury to examine it closely, to sift it and scrutinize it, and find out which is true.

Although it is true, that if a letter be properly directed, stamped and posted, it may be prima facie evidence that the party to whom it was addressed received it, yet, when the party to whom it was addressed denies having received it, and proves that he did not receive it, the burden of proof is shifted and the prima facie proof is overcome, and it devolves on the party alleging the fact to prove that the party to whom the letter was addressed did receive it. Oral evidence cannot be given of any writing, the existence of which is disputed, which is material to the issue between the parties.

The plaintiff having failed to show that his alleged statement was of such a character as to constitute a sufficient and particular account of the loss, as required by the policy, therefore this did not constitute proofs of loss, and the verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>I decline to affirm that proposition, but I say to you again, as I said to you before in substance, that, if the plaintiff made out a statement of his loss, sufficient to give the company notice of his* loss, the amount of it, setting forth substantially, even though not accurately, or in detail, all the requirements of the policy, and the company accepted that and required no further proofs, they may be held to have waived further proofs of loss, and, if they waived it, why, the statement would be sufficient, provided it was a substantial compliance, even though it lacked some of the details required by the policy.

After the expiration of the thirty days within which the plaintiff should have furnished his proofs of loss, there must be shown an express agreement with the defendant company to file proofs to show waiver. Mere silence on the part <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>of the company is not enough to infer waiver. To constitute a waiver there must be shown some official act or declaration by the company during the thirty days, dispensing with it. Something from which the assured might reasonably infer that the underwriters did not mean to insist upon it. And no proofs of loss having been furnished in this ease, and there being no evidence to show waiver of such proofs of loss, the plaintiff cannot recover, and the verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>I decline to affirm that proposition. I will say, however, that silence alone would not constitute a waiver upon the part of the company, unless they had received this statement. If they received such a statement, as I have mentioned already, and then they were silent, that may be construed into a waiver. But, if they never received any such statement at all, their mere silence, even though they knew of the loss, would not be a waiver. They were not bound to do anything until they had received the proofs of loss required by the contract, and until the plaintiff made some effort at least— some substantial effort — to give them proofs of that kind, they were not bound to act. But, if they did receive such a communication, they were bound either to send it back and require additional proofs, or they may be held to have waived further requirements. [5]</p>

    <p id="b442-7" data-blocks='[["BL_442.10",442,[266,893,1165,348]]]'>There is no question as to the validity of the policy in suit, nor that the property insured was totally destroyed by fire on April 15, 1888, during the life of the policy. It was clearly shown, by undisputed evidence, that the value of the house and personal property destroyed considerably exceeded the amount for which they were respectively insured. The right of plaintiff to recover was resisted on two grounds :</p>
    <p id="b442-8" data-blocks='[["BL_442.11",442,[266,1248,1164,145]]]'>1. That he failed to comply with the provision of the policy requiring him, within thirty days after the fire, to furnish the company with the statement of proof of loss therein specified.</p>
    <p id="b442-9" data-blocks='[["BL_442.12",442,[266,1399,1165,144]]]'>2. That the house in question was “on ground not owned by the insured in fee-simple,” and his interest therein was “ other than unconditional and sole ownership.”</p>
    <p id="b442-10" data-blocks='[["BL_442.13",442,[265,1553,1166,196]]]'>Considerable testimony, bearing more or less directly on each of these propositions, was introduced and submitted to the jury, under instructions, which constitute the subjects of complaint in several of the specifications of error.</p>
    <p id="b442-11" data-blocks='[["BL_442.14",442,[262,1755,1168,652]],["BL_443.1",443,[199,394,1158,84]]]'>It was clearly shown that, within a day or two after the fire, notice of the total destruction of the house and contents was given to the company. Testimonj1- on behalf of plaintiff tended to prove that, within ten days thereafter, he prepared an itemized statement of his loss, inclosed it in an envelope, properly stamped, and addressed to the “ Dwelling House Insurance Company, Boston, Massachusetts,” and placed it in the post office, at Carbondale, Pa.; that, before mailing the package, he showed it to the company’s local agent at Carbondale, informed him that it was a statement of his loss, which .he was about forwarding by mail to the company, etc., and, in reply to the inquiry whether that was right the agent assented. These matters were all testified to in detail by the plaintiff <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>himself, and he was corroborated therein by a disinterested witness.</p>
    <p id="b443-5" data-blocks='[["BL_443.5",443,[194,498,1163,599]]]'>The testimony also tended to prove that, after waiting, in vain, several weeks for a reply from the company, plaintiff caused to be prepared and mailed to its home address, as before, a second itemized statement of loss. Pursuant to notice to produce both statements, etc., at the trial, the company brought into court the last mentioned paper, and denied receiving the other. In connection with the evidence tending to prove the preparation and mailing of the first statement, plaintiff offered in evidence the second statement or proof of loss, but being objected to by the company, as incompetent and irrelevant, because not furnished within thirty days after the fire, it was, for that reason, excluded.</p>
    <p id="b443-6" data-blocks='[["BL_443.6",443,[192,1110,1161,246]]]'>For the purpose of rebutting the inference that might be drawn from mailing the first statement within the thirty days, the company undertook to prove, by Mr. Melchert, one of its employees, that he had charge of its mail matter, and that the statement was never received by him.</p>
    <p id="b443-7" data-blocks='[["BL_443.7",443,[186,1366,1167,907]]]'>The testimony of both parties relating to the mailing of the first statement, etc., was fairly submitted to the jury, and they must have found as a fact that it was properly deposited in the post office, as alleged by plaintiff, and duly received by the company. There appears to be no error in admitting the testimony bearing on that question, or in the instructions which accompanied its submission to the jury. It is well settled that the fact of depositing, in the post office, a properly addressed, prepaid letter, raises a natural presumption, founded in common experience, that it reached its destination by due course of mail. In other words, it is prima facie evidence that it was received by tire person to whom it was addressed; but that prima facie proof may be rebutted by evidence showing that it was not received. The question is necessarily one of fact, solely for the determination of the jury, under all the evidence: Folsom v. Cook, <a href="/pa/115/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="115 Pa. 549" data-case-ids="551744" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0549-01">115 Pa. 549</a>; Insurance Co. v.

Hervey, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20Mass.%20188" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="130 Mass. 188">130 Mass. 188</a>.</p>
    <p id="b443-8" data-blocks='[["BL_443.8",443,[185,2281,1162,144]]]'>For the purpose of this case, therefore, it must now be accepted as true, that the first statement was received by the company within the required time.</p>
    <p id="b444-4" data-blocks='[["BL_444.4",444,[275,401,1173,1670]]]'>
      <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>It is, however, contended that the itemized statement in question was not shown to have been in accordance with the requirements of the policy, and hence it amounted to nothing, whether received or not. We cannot assent to that proposition. Assuming, as in view of the verdict we must, that the statement was duly received, the company could not in good faith treat it as a mere nullity. If it was found to be informal or defective, as proofs of loss, and the company was unwilling to accept it as such, it was its duty to return the paper, with specification of defects, so that plaintiff might have an opportunity of correcting them. When such statement of loss is furnished within the stipulated time, and there is nothing to show that it was not in good faith intended as a compliance with terms of policy, it is the duty of the underwriter, if it means to rely upon failure to comply, to give prompt notice of its objection, pointing out defects, etc. Such provisions in policies of insurance are intended for the information and protection of the underwriter, and cannot, with impunitjr, be used to ensnare the unwary and confiding. In such circumstances, the failure of the company to return statement of loss, or to notify the insured of defects therein, is some evidence for the jury of a waiver of strict compliance : Gould v. Dwelling House Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/134/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="134 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="814923" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0570-01">134 Pa. 570</a>, and cases there cited. In that case, our brother Mitchell, after reviewing the authorities, said: “ The result of the decisions may therefore be formulated in the following rule: If the insured, in good faith and within the stipulated time, does what he plainly intends as a compliance with the requirements of his policy, good faith equally requires that the company shall promptly notify him of their objections, so as to give him an opportunity to obviate them; and mere silence may so mislead him, to his disadvantage, to suppose the company satisfied, as to be of itself sufficient evidence of waiver by estoppel.”</p>
    <p id="b444-5" data-blocks='[["BL_444.5",444,[275,2078,1165,94]]]'>Every reputable and trustworthy insurance company recognizes the propriety of this rule, and acts upon it.</p>
    <p id="b444-6" data-blocks='[["BL_444.6",444,[276,2179,1165,289]]]'>The evidence in this case indicates that, in doing what he did, the insured intended in good faith to comply with the requirements of his policy. Self-interest could not have prompted him to do anything else. The defendant company, on the other hand, was so identified with the ease above cited as to be somewhat familiar with the rule therein stated.</p>
    <p id="b445-4" data-blocks='[["BL_445.4",445,[195,393,1165,602]]]'>
      <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>The further objection that plaintiff was not the sole and unconditional owner of the land on which his house stood, etc., involved questions of fact, which were also determined in his favor. There was some evidence tending to show that, by an amicable agreement with his coheirs, plaintiff became sole owner of that portion of the land on which he afterwards erected the house in question. The testimony was conflicting, but we are not prepared to say that it was not proper for the consideration of the jury. It was fairly submitted to them, and they must have found that there was a family arrangement or agreement whereby plaintiff became entitled in severalty to the land on which his house stood.</p>
