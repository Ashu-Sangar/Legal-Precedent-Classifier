The auditor allowed her at the rate of $1.75 per week for the entire time, and awarded her the sum of $470.50. An exception having been filed in the orphans’ court to this claim, the learned judge below sustained said exception, upon the ground that the appellant could not have recovered “by due course of law” because there was no contract to pay for her services.</p>
    <p id="b295-6" data-blocks='[["BL_295.6",295,[169,1609,1169,810]],["BL_296.1",296,[282,378,1171,1214]]]'>A considerable amount of learning has been wasted in this ease, in defining what is “ due course of law.” It is sufficient to say, for the purposes of this case, that the presentation of the claim to the orphans’ court, and its adjudication by that court, is “ due course of law.” It may be conceded that, had there been no reference to this claim in the will, it could not have been recovered in the orphans’ court, nor by a suit at law. There was no evidence, outside of the will itself, of a contract between the appellant and her father, that she was to be paid for her services. We regard the will, however, as a distinct recognition of such contract, and that she had performed the work and labor under it. But there was no recognition of the amount she was to be paid. Hence, the testator provided that her portion of the estate should be increased by whatever may be recovered against the estate by “ due course of law.” In other words, her legacy was increased by that amount. Any <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>other construction of the will renders it insensible in this respect. It is inconceivable that the testator would have recognized this claim, and have directed its payment, unless he considered that the appellant had a valid claim for some amount. Just what amount was due he left to be determined by due process of law. This was his obvious meaning. The case is somewhat analogous to Sinclair’ Ap., <a href="/citations/?q=116%20Pa.%20816" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="116 Pa. 816">116 Pa. 816</a>. There a testator in his will, made in 1885, provided: “ It is my will, and I do order, that the balance due my old creditors, whose claims were compromised, be paid in full.” He had failed in 1877, and in 1883 had made a compromise with his creditors. It was held that, under this provision, the creditors were entitled to be paid their original claims, with interest, treating the composition payments as partial payments at date when made. Justice Clark there said: “ When the testator directed that ‘ the balance due his old creditors, whose claims were compromised,’ should be paid, he, of course, did not mean the balance which was legally due to them, for that would give the provision no effect whatever. He meant that his executors should pay to them the balance which was justly due and ought to be paid to them respectively, although there was no legal obligation resting upon him for payment thereof, either debt or interest. It is a legacy, the amount of which, however, is to be computed upon the footing of his previous claims.”</p>
