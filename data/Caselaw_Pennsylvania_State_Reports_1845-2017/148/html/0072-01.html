This writ was returned ‘ Nihil,’ and on February 10, 1891, an alias writ was issued, which was also returned 4 Nihil.’ The defendant then filed an affidavit of defence in which he alleges that having received no notice that the interest was due and the time of payment having inadvertently escaped his notice, and that of the cashier charged with the payment of such sum, until more than thirty days had elapsed after the same was due, they in February, 1891, sent a check to plaintiff for the interest, which was returned with the information that the mortgage had been foreclosed. The defendant now offers to pay interest and costs and asks that <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>judgment for the principal sum and five per cent attorney fees be refused.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b100-5" data-blocks='[["BL_100.6",100,[254,697,1175,961]]]'>“As the exercise of this power is not imperative on the court, it ought not to be used except in cases where the defendant is likely to suffer an injury through no fault or neglect of his own. In this case he entered into a perfectly valid contract, the terms of which were presumably for his own benefit and advantage. Mortgages like this are usual, and there can be no misunderstanding their meaning. Because of their terms the borrower secures loans which he could not otherwise obtain, and when he enters into a binding contract he must observe its terms or bear the consequences. The payment of interest promptly is one of the important parts of the transaction; upon its faith the lender makes his calculations, and failure to receive it promptly may entail great loss upon him. The very object of inserting the clause declaring the whole amount to become due is to secure the prompt payment of the interest on the debt. This being the contract agreed upon, we ought not to establish another for the parties, which we do when we say that although the mortgagor has failed to perform his part, yet that the plaintiff shall not be entitled to the remedy agreed upon.</p>

The notion that seems too much to prevail (and of which the facts in the present case furnish an example), that a party may be utterly regardless of the stipulated payments, and that a court of chancery will almost at any time relieve him from the penalty of his gross negligence, is very injurious to good morals, to a lively sense of obligation, to the sanctity of contracts, and to the character of this court.’</p>
