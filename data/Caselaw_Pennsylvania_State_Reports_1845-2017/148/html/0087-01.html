At the time of its passage and acceptance the intersection of Main and DeKalb streets was macadamized with crushed cinder and limestone. The defendant company, after completing its road, reconstructed the street with the same material then used by the borough. Subsequently the borough authorities determined to pave the intersection of said streets with Belgian blocks, and after notice to defendant, and upon their neglect to do so, the borough performed the work, and now seeks to recover from defendant a share of the cost.</p>

On the other hand, the contention of thé borough is that this duty devolves upon the defendant as often as the borough may see fit to change the character of the street. The ordinance is loosely and inartificially drawn, and some parts of it can scarcely be explained; but it is our only guide to ascertain the rights of the parties to it.</p>

To ‘ reconstruct ’ means to construct <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>again — to rebuild. Does this mean once or as many times as the borough may see fit to change the character of the street ? If I agree to reconstruct a house burned down, is not my obligation fulfilled when I once restore it to its original condition ? In construing an ordinance or agreement of this kind words are to be used in their usual and ordinary acceptation, and as consistent as possible with the understanding of the parties at the time.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b116-5" data-blocks='[["BL_116.5",116,[253,783,1177,1664]]]'>“ It was manifest that in building their road the defendants would be compelled to tear up the street. The borough is charged with the duty of keeping the streets in good order and condition. For the privilege thus granted of occupying the street the borough required that it should be under no expense to restore it or thereafter to keep that part between the tracks in repair. It, therefore, stipulated that the defendant should reconstruct said streets with the same kind of material used in the remaining portion of said streets, and keep the same in good order and repair throughout the entire length thereof. The plain reading of the ordinance requires this and nothing more, and, in the absence of anything to show a contrary intentjfit speaks for itself. It must be remembered that this is the borough’s own requirement, to which the defendant was asked to submit, and it had the right to infer that it meant what it plainly said, and nothing more. The obligation of the defendant, is to be found in its acceptance of the grant. The act of assembly incorporating these companies is silent as to their duty in respect to the matter here in dispute, except that permission must first be obtained from the local authorities, who can prescribe reasonable conditions; and that is what was attempted in this case. The argument that the liability of the defendant follows from its act of occupying the street cannot prevail in face of the fact that the extent of the liability is defined by the borough. The mere privilege, unaccompanied with conditions, would not of itself impose any burden such as is here claimed. A railway company would have as much right to use the street with its cars, if they could be used with ordinary wheels, as other persons do, and there would be no difference between a street car and a cab or omnibus; but as they require tracks, which necessarily occupy the street, and to some extent change its character, permission is required to do that which otherwise would be a nuisance.</p>

      <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>“ If it is claimed that this will put the borough to great expense, if it shall hereafter desire to change the character of our streets traversed by these companies, it may be answered that they had the power of protection in their own hands, and that, in the absence of express liability, the companies ought not to bo subjected to great expense merely because the borough authorities may desire to experiment with different kind of paving.</p>

Assuming that the defendant would be liable to reconstruct the second time with Belgian blocks, that would be the case of a street 4 not macadamized,’ in which event the borough is to furnish the materials, and until this was done the defendant would not be liable. We are unable at present to give any intelligent construction to the words 4 nothing herein contained shall be construed to compel the borough authorities .... to furnish any material to said company to macadamize any street between the tracks of said company until said borough directs all of the street to be macadamized,’ it having already been provided that such furnishing was only to be done in streets not macadamized.

It provides that4 if at any time the town council of said borough shall be of opinion that the same [street] is not in that proper order and repair required for the transportation of persons or property along the same,’ notice shall be given to the company of that fact, and viewers will be chosen. The borough shall then choose one, the railway company shall choose another, and the two thus chosen shall select the third. If the railway company neglects or refuses to comply with the provisions of the section, then the borough shall select the viewers, whose duty it shall be to 4 report whether the said street or streets are in the proper condition for the transportation of persons or property along the same.’ If the viewers shall find that said streets are not in said condition, then notice is to be given to the company, and, on their neglect to repair, etc., the borough shall do the work and charge the company with the expense.</p>

      <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>“We think this position is not tenable, for two reasons: First, because this was not a ease contemplated by said section. It was not pretended on the trial that the streets were not in the proper condition for the transportation of persons or property. The sole contention was as to whether the borough had the right to change the character of the paving and charge defendant with the cost, they having neglected to put down Belgian blocks after notice to do so. And, secondly, as a general submission to viewers not named, and to be appointed in the future, no matter of dispute having yet arisen, it was revocable, and not binding, on either party.
