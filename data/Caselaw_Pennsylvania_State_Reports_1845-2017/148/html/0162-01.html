    <p class="summary" id="b189-4" data-blocks='[["BL_189.5",189,[186,1054,1175,1363]]]'>“ A public corporation is one which cannot carry out the purposes of its organization without chartered rights from the commonwealth. Railroads, canals and gas companies must have the right of eminent domain in order to perform their functions. Their property, which is indispensable to their chartered rights, is represented by their capital stock, and as such is taxed specially by the legislature, and the law will not subject it to duplicate taxation by mere inference. It must expressly be made subject by statute. Such of the property of such a corporation as is not indispensable, but is merely convenient, is held subject to taxation under the general law assessing such property. A private corporation, which needs no chartered rights in order to carry on its business, stands in no different position from an individual: Allegheny Co. v. Mc-Keesport Diamond Market Co., <a href="/pa/123/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="123 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="967158" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0164-01">123 Pa. 164</a>. An illustration of this principle is given in Appeal of the City of Pittsburgh, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20Pa.%20376" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="123 Pa. 376">123 Pa. 376</a>. ‘A mere private corporation,’ says the court, ‘needs no franchise from the state in order to carry on its business. Men may manufacture shoes without corporate power, but they cannot occupy streets or property of private individuals without corporate power or warrant from the state. They need a delegation of sovereignty, and in such cases their works may properly bo called public works.’ It was therefore held that the gas pipes of an incorporated company for the supply of natural gas to consumers are not assessable eo nomine for local taxation, either as land or as a part of the company’s capital stock. <em>§</em>
