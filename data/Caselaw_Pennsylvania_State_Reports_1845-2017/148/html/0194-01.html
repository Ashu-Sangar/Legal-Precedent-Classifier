The prayer was for a rule upon defendant and other “ persons interested,” and the effect of the rule if made absolute would be to postpone the rights of another judgment creditor not named in the petition nor included except under the general term “persons interested.” The attorney of this latter party was present in court, and the petition was read in his hearing.</p>

J., the facts appeared to be as follows: William A. Olver was defendant in several judgments in which he appeared simply as a codefendant with his son, the other defendant in the judgment, though his actual relation was that of surety for the said son. On October 8, 1890, land of W. A. Olver was sold under one of these judgments, in which the other defendant was G. D. Olver. On October 4, 1890, execution was issued upon a judgment in which G. D. Olver was sole defendant, and lands of the said G. D. Olver levied upon. On October 6, 1890, W. A. Olver presented a petition to the court setting forth the fact that in the judgment upon which his lands <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>bad been sold lie was only surety for G. D. Olver, and praying to be subrogated as plaintiff in that judgment, whereupon a rule was granted “on G. D. Olver and parties interested to show cause why subrogation should not be made as prayed for, returnable at next term.” On October 7, 1890, plaintiff presented a petition alleging the same facts, and asserting her right as a judgment creditor of W. A. Olver to subrogation in his place, and a similar rule was granted. At the time these rules were taken W. H. Lee, Esq., attorney for Matthew Clemo, plaintiff in the execution issued against G. D. Olver on October 4, was present in court, the petitions were read in his hearing and he knew that the rules to show cause were granted.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b221-5" data-blocks='[["BL_221.5",221,[199,1019,1163,657]]]'>On November 28, 1890, the land of G. D. Olver was sold under the execution issued October 4 to Clemo, the plaintiff in the writ, for a sum insufficient to discharge the amount of his judgment. The sheriff made return to the writ that he had sold the lot, had paid off a small prior judgment, and had taken plaintiff’s receipt on account of his judgment for the balance of the purchase money. Exceptions to this return were filed by W. A. Olver, and also by plaintiff, as follows : “ Exceptants deny the right of Clemo, lien creditor, to proceeds of sale, and claim them under pending proceedings for subrogation to rights of William A. Olver as a surety for George D. Olver, in judgment No. 284, May term, 1887, which judgment was paid with proceeds of surety’s property.” [1]</p>

Olver to be subrogated to the rights of the plaintiff in the judgment which had been paid out of his land, and the right of plaintiff to such subrogation in right of W. A. Olver, of whom she was a judgment creditor, was not disputed. The question was whether such subrogation should be allowed to prejudice the rights of Clemo to the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale of the lands of G. D. Olver upon which his judgment, so far as appeared by the record, was a first lien. Service of the rules was not made until December 1, the return day of the rule and three days after the sheriff’s sale, (the rules of court requiring that it should be served twenty days before its return day.) The question was whether Clemo had knowledge or notice of these rules, and on this point the court said:</p>

It is enough to say that this information did not come to Mr. Lee in the course of any business which he was transacting for Mr. Cierno. Mr. Ciernois not named - in either of the petitions or rules. If he is included at all it is under the general term ‘ persons interested/ and nothing in the petitions or rules discloses any interest possessed by him. It would be monstrous to hold that in such a case Mr. Cierno is to be charged with knowledge of the proceedings because his attorney happened to be in court when the petition was presented, even though the attorney may have been able to see that the proceeding was in fact directed against his client, who was not named in it. The rules were simply the process by which the parties were to be brought before the court, and for this purpose, especially as to an unnamed party, they possessed no efficacy until they were served. Mr. Lee had a right to suppose they would be served, and that until such service they called for no action on the part of his client.</p>
