He also gives in evidence that proofs were furnished them about ten days after the expiration of the thirty days, and that these proofs were not returned, nor did he receive any reply objecting to these proofs nor to the lateness of time at which they were received. There is no doubt about the fact that the letter containing these proofs was sent, because you have the evidence here of the receipt which was given for this letter, and also the receipt of the company, I believe, that received the letter inclosing these proofs, provided you believe the evidence of Mr. King who was sworn on that subject. It is also contended that there is other evidence from which a waiver may be inferred. Statements that were made by the adjuster and by Mr. Schweiker at the time when they were together with Mr. Weiss in the office of Mr. Schweiker. — Statements in reference to their non-liability upon this policy, and there may be other circumstances which I do not remember, but we submit all the facts that have been shown on the part of the plaintiff to you, and ask you to determine from them whether the company actually did waive the proofs required by this policy, or did not waive them. If the company intended to insist upon a full compliance with this condition, and did nothing which would induce the other party to believe that they dispensed with a compliance with it, then there would be no waiver. But, do all the acts of the company’s agents taken together convince you that the acts were of such a character as would mislead the plaintiff, and thereby prevent him from making his prooís in time ? Because, if the proofs were delayed on account of any acts done by the agent or agents of the company, then such delay is an excuse, and the company <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>cannot take advantage of it; and this is based upon the principle that a man cannot take advantage of his own wrong. If he has in some way misled another party to his hurt, he cannot afterwards say that 4 Now, you didn’t carry out what you were required to do, and you cannot recover.’ The sole question is whether the company or its authorized agents was guilty of such conduct, such acts, as would constitute a waiver or an excuse on the part of the plaintiff for not furnishing the proofs in the thirty days. If they were sufficient, then there was a waiver, and it is for you to determine upon the sufficiency. . . .</p>

Now, among the conditions in this policy, is á clause which reads as follows: 4 Or if the assured shall sell or transfer the property described herein, or incumber the same without the consent of the company indorsed hereon, the policy shall be void,’ etc. Now, did the plaintiff do that ? If he did, then he can’t recover, even though the company did waive the proofs of loss. Now, the incumbrances are in evidence before you. You will bear in mind that when this property was purchased he was to pay $2,200 for it, that there was upon it at that time $1,500 mortgage in favor of Lucy Munson, and that mortgage he assumed, so that the balance of the purchase money to be paid by him was only $700. This was in the fall of 1888. He got possession of the premises at that time, and he got his insurance on the 16th of March, 1889. Well, he didn’t get his deed, as I have it on my notes, until April 18, 1889. So that you will perceive, gentlemen, that this insurance was effected before he got his deed,, and he still owed $700 on the property as purchase money; therefore, the amount of the incumbrances which were upon the property at that time was $700. Now, it does not appear from any evidence in this case that their agent asked him whether or not there was any incumbrances, or what incumbrances there were upon it, and they cannot therefore take advantage of the fact that there was $700 of incumbrances upon it at that time. In order to constitute a breach of this condition, it would be necessary for the defendant to show that <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>there were afterwards more incumbrances put upon this property by him than the amount of $700.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b379-3" data-blocks='[["BL_379.4",379,[182,505,1169,1001]]]'>“Although there may have been other incumbrances put upon this property, yet, if at no one time the amount exceeded $700 besides this mortgage in controversy (because that was on too), then they have not shown that there was a breach of that condition. An insurance contract is a contract of indemnity. The intention of that provision is that they shall know just exactly how much this man is worth, and how much he owes or is incumbered. Well, now, if he is not incumbered any more; if some old incumbrances are paid and he puts new ones on in their place, and it don’t make it any higher than it was in the beginning, the company is not injured, and they could not take advantage of that, in my judgment. And I therefore instruct you if you find the incumbrances that he put on afterwards did not in the aggregate amount to more than the incumbrances that were on it before — if enough of the incumbrances were paid off before the new ones were put on so that the whole amount of the incumbrances at any time did not exceed $700, then this condition in the policy has not been broken, and the plaintiff is not, on that account, to lose his claim.</p>

Now, suit was commenced on the mortgage which was on this property at the time when this insurance was effected. It was a scire facias issued upon that mortgage for the purpose of getting it into judgment, so as to enable the mortgagee to proceed and levy upon this property and sell it if the debt was not paid. It was a proceeding to enforce the conditions of the mortgage, and it would not amount to a foreclosure until a sale was made, because up until a sale was made, the right to redeem existed, and the mortgage could have been extinguished by payment at any time, and the company, therefore, could not possibly have been injured by the mere issuing of the scire facias. We do not think that this clause in the policy means the mere issuing of a scire facias in order to obtain a judgment upon a mortgage. It has reference to a foreclosure proceeding whereby the right or equity of redemption in the mortgagor is to be extinguished and the right to the property forfeited; and there<a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>fore we will instruct you in this case that that condition has not been violated by the mere issuing of a scire facias on a mortgage.”</p>

D. Schweiker, the local agent in Williamsport, was communicated to Frederick Weiss, the assured, within thirty days, and he refusing to sign and make affidavit to the same or accept the sum offered as a compromise, does not constitute a waiver of the proofs required by the policy.

The loss was a total one upon buildings. The proofs were furnished in a few days after the time limited in the policy. Prompt notice had been given to the company of the loss, and the latter sent its agent and adjuster to investigate it. The company denied all liability under its policy. The adjuster attempted to settle for $750, and left, saying he would be back again in a short time. The proofs of loss were received by the company and retained for eighty-six days, without any objection thereto, upon any ground, until it filed its affidavit of defence in this case. It has been decided in numerous cases that, where an insurance company retains the proofs of loss without objection for a considerable period of time, it is a waiver of any defects therein: German &amp; American Insurance Co. v.
