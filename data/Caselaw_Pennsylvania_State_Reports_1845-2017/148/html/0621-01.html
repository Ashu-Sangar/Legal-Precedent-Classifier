This railroad had, for 20 years, constituted a main line over which passed daily a great number of trains. Said “ Carbondale road ” was likewise crossed at grade, by the tracks of the Butler Coal Company about 200 feet south of “ Ferry road; ” this railroad was operated by gravity and was abandoned in 1878.

The defendant’s bridge was frequently threatened with disaster from ice and recurring floods, and in 1865 and in other years prior to 1875 had been several times severely damaged by drift. The channel of the river is near the eastern <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>shore and the current sets in that direction. In the year 1875 the larger part of the defendant’s bridge was swept away. In its reconstruction the safety of the structure itself required that the Pittston or eastern end of the bridge be elevated at least eight feet, but it was by the defendant’s officers thought advisable to avoid not merely the dangers from floods, but to avoid also the dangers arising from crossing at grade the several railroad tracks already mentioned. Another reason, too, that exercised some influence in this direction was that an elevation of only eight feet and continuing the use of the ‘Ferry road’ as an approach would involve a grade from the westerly end of the canal bridge of one foot in seven. Thereupon the defendants applied to the borough council of the borough of Pittston for permission to make the proposed change in their bridge and to extend the same to Main street. After reasonable notice to the property owners interested, the council, on the 15th April, 1875, passed a resolution: ‘ Granting to the Pittston Ferry Bridge Company the right and privilege of extending their bridge across the Susquehanna river along and over Mill street (the ‘Ferry road’) to Main street, such extension to be wholly or in part over Mill street to Main, as said company may elect, and the bridge so erected over Mill street to be not less than twelve feet high above Mill street at any point, and to be constructed of iron and supported by iron columns, to be so constructed and supported as not to interfere with public travel under said bridge on the part of Mill street covered by said bridge.

The said approach was supported in part by four iron pillars and a stone pier, which the commonwealth claims were located in the public highway and obstructions to public travel. From the evidence and an inspection of the premises I am satisfied that the pillars were neither an obstruction to travel nor located in the public highway, but were located on the wing walls of the said canal bridge, the distance between the posts being twenty feet in width. The ‘ Ferry road ’ is now no longer used as a road at this point, because of the removal of the canal bridge and construction of the new road as stated in the 9th and 10th conclusions of fact. It is impossible to say with any degree of certainty, whether or not the stone pier is on the highway. It is located opposite the end of the ‘ Ferry road,’ is four feet thick and is twenty-eight feet in length along the ‘ Carbondale road,’ and is twenty-eight and one half feet distant diagonally from the corner of the mill, and twenty-five feet from the corner of the warehouse, and say twenty feet from its platform. This space is sufficient for the very limited amount of travel on these roads. As already stated, the exact limits of the ‘ Carbondale road,’ as originally used, were undefined, and the testimony of the witnesses in this re-, spect is conflicting, and is largely matter of belief, founded not upon any exact data, but upon recollection of immediate surroundings many years ago. The preponderance of this testimony, I think, is in favor of the view that this stone pier is partly, at least, in the original lines of the ‘ Carbondale road,’ but since 1860 has been also within the twenty feet claimed and appropriated by the Pa. &amp; N.

      <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>“ It is claimed by the defendant that this structure, extending longitudinally over the ‘ Ferry road ’ and across the ‘ Carbon dale road ” is a necessary approach to the bridge proper, and therefore it had the right to erect and maintain it. This claim is based on the following findings of fact to which no exception has been taken: The defendant’s bridge was frequently threatened with disaster from ice and recurring floods, and in I860 and in other years prior to 1875 had been several times severely damaged by drift. The channel of the river is near the eastern shore, and the current sets in that direction. I11 its reconstruction after being swept away in 1875, the safety of tire structure itself required that the eastern end of the bridge be raised at least eight feet. The right to maintain is necessarily implied in the authority to erect a toll-bridge, and if experience or a change in the current or volume of the stream demonstrated the fact that the safety of the structure itself required that it be raised, we think that the company had the right to raise it and to extend the approaches, if tliat became necessary to the use of the main structure. But having located the eastern terminus of the bridge in 1850, and maintained it at the same point for the period of twenty-five years, it would seem clear that the right and power of the company in this regard would be measured by the actual necessity of the case, and not by the mere convenience of the public or the discretion of its managers. The question is not what were the discretionary powers of the company in 1850, before its managers had exercised their right to choose a site for the eastern terminus, but wliat were tlieir powers in 1875, after they had made their choice and limited themselves thereby for so long a time. What authority bad tbe company to raise the eastern end of the bridge eight feet beyond the point of absolute safety to the structure, and then to connect it by an overhead structure with a highway not in existence at the time it was first built ? They answer that it was necessary, because if the bridge had simply been raised eight feet at its eastern end, which was but fifty-six feet from tbe western end of the canal bridge, it would have required a rise of one foot in seven in order to reach it, and that this would be too steep a pitch to be practicable. But the commonwealth’s counsel contends, and the master so finds, that this difficulty might have been overcome by extending the abut<a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>ment sixty-six feet into the river, which would have afforded sufficient room to rise. Against this it is argued that the defendant’s right to further encroach upon the river (itself a highway) and extend the abutment in that direction is no clearer than its right to extend the superstructure in the other direction. The inference asked to be drawn is that the company, notwithstanding its first location in 1850, had a choice of methods in rebuilding the bridge in 1875, one to raise it eight feet at its eastern end and to extend the abutment into the river a sufficient distance to make a practicable approach by the highways with which it originally connected and was intended to connect, the other to raise the eastern end sixteen feet and extend the bridge above the highways referred to a distance of two hundred and one feet to a highway not in existence, and so far as appears not in contemplation when the charter was granted or even when the company defined the terminus of the bridge in its first location.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b654-4" data-blocks='[["BL_654.5",654,[278,1255,1166,1161]],["BL_655.1",655,[183,378,1159,2028]],["BL_656.1",656,[259,375,1163,397]]]'>“ Notwithstanding the plausibility of the defendant’s argument in justification of its action in 1875, we are of the opinion that its right to adopt the former method, if the safety of the bridge required it, was clear, while its authority to adopt the latter method was, to say the least, extremely doubtful. The defendant’s franchise involved the right to build necessary-piers in the river, and its power to repair and rebuild is expressly recognized in the charter. This means a power to rebuild on the same site expressly described in the charter or selected by the company in the original exercise of its power, not on some other site that may be more desirable. It seems to us that there is a manifest difference between raising or changing the grade of a bridge and correspondingly changing the height and location of the supporting piers, and changing the terminus, as was done in this case, because the latter involves a second taking while the former does not. We cannot escape the conclusion that the defendant company was influenced in its choice of methods in 1875, not so much by regard for the navigation of the river Susquehanna, as by the desire to make an approach to its bridge which would avoid crossing at grade the railroad tracks that had been laid between 1850 and 1875. However desirable this might be, not only for its own profit, but also for the convenience and safety of the pub-<a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>lie, we look in vain in its charter for any authority to do more than erect and maintain a toll bridge over the river Susquehanna. Whatever power was necessary to carry out this public purpose may safely be implied, including, as we have seen, the right to make necessary approaches, but, for all powers beyond that which later developements may have shown it is desirable for it to have, it must go to the legislature. ‘ We cannot widen the limits set to their privileges, because they have found them inconveniently narrow. We have no more right or authority to stretch an old act of incorporation than we have to make a new one: ’ Com. v. Erie N. E. R. R. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=27%20Pa.%20352" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="27 Pa. 352">27 Pa. 352</a>. In construing this charter it is to be noticed that Main street, with which the bridge now connects, was not in existence in 1850. The bridge that the defendant company was authorized to build was intended to take the place of the ferry and to connect with the roads that led to it. It surely could not have been in the mind of the legislature at that early date to bridge those very highways, one longitudinally and the other at right angles, and to connect with a road not in existence on the bluff beyond. Nor did the corporators of the company so construe the powers granted by the charter. Their action in locating the eastern terminus at the point they did, and maintaining it there for a period of twenty-five years, are facts entitled to great, if not controlling, weight, and nothing short of actual necessity, which, as we have seen, did not exist, would entitle them to make a second choice. The cases cited by the plaintiff’s counsel as to the effect of the first location and long continued use arose, it is true, between railroad companies and private parties, but it will be seen that most of them were decided upon a construction of the charter powers of the corporation, and in the case of Little Miami R. R. Co. v. Naylor, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Ohio%20St.%20236" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Ohio St. 236">2 Oh. St. 236</a>, the court said: ‘ The same principle applies whether the case be that of an attempt to relocate on the property of an individual, or that of using a street or highway for the purpose.’ The general principle that a continued use with the assent of all parties for a great length of time has an influence in the construction of all written instruments is applicable in the construction of a charter. In the case of Com. v. Deerfield, heretofore cited, it was declared that the reasonable approach which a corporation is im<a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>pliedly authorized to make for a bridge ‘ may be fixed by the practical construction which has been applied in the exercise of the franchise by its owners with the acquiescence of the public.’ See also Currier v.

The former were set (approximately speaking) at the several corners of the canal bridge, and were twenty feet apart, while the canal bridge was but eighteen feet wide. The stone pier is opposite the end of the ‘ Ferry road,’ and is four feet thick and twenty-eight feet in length along the ‘ Carbondale road.’ The particulars in which it is claimed that the structure is an encroachment upon and an obstruction of the public highway, and therefore a public nuisance are: <em>(a) </em>the four pillars; (b) the stone pier; <em>(o') </em>‘ a noisy; horse frightening, filth dropping bridge floor.’</p>

But the fact that the thing complained of is a public nuisance must first be established, and if it be in serious doubt upon the evidence the court will not interfere until it has been established in a court of law. And where it is not a nuisance per se, but is only so because of certain features or circumstances surrounding it which may be corrected, the court will not decree that the structure be utterly demolished, especially if on the whole it is a public benefit, but will limit its decree to the correction of those things which are harmful to the public. In short, the court will abate only so much of the thing as is a nuisance. Dyer v.

At all events, owing to the steepness of the descent into and ascent out of the old canal- bed it would be extremely inconvenient, and this inconvenience and danger would be greatly enhanced by compelling the public to cross the several railroad tracks at grade in order to reach the entrance of the bridge. On the other hand, if the objections to the elevated approach and its support which we have heretofore considered are removed, we agree with the master in holding that no such appreciable injury to the public has been shown as would constitute an actual nuisance. Indeed, we think he has clearly shown that to decree a total removal of the present approach and to compel a return to the former state of things would be a positive injury to the public without any corresponding public benefit. Whatever may be the rights of the parties in a court of law, a court of equity is not bound to interfere to prevent a corporate act simply because it is ultra vires any more than the court is bound to enjoin every illegal act of an individual: Morawetz on Corporations, §1041; Attorney General v.

    <p id="b658-8" data-blocks='[["BL_658.10",658,[262,1542,1166,195]]]'>This bill was filed in the court below to restrain the defendant company from rebuilding the elevation and extension of its toll bridge described in the bill, in a southeasterly direction from the southeasterly bank of the Susquehanna river.</p>
    <p id="b658-9" data-blocks='[["BL_658.11",658,[258,1746,1168,651]],["BL_659.1",659,[208,375,1159,249]]]'>It appears that the bridge of the defendant company had been frequently threatened with destruction from ice and high water, and, upon several occasions, prior to 1875, had been injured to a considerable extent. In the year 1875, the larger part of the bridge was swept away by a flood. In rebuilding it the safety of the structure itself required it to be elevated. This was accordingly done with the consent of the council of the borough of Pittston, and of a number of the property owners more immediately affected by the change. This elevation of the bridge rendered it necessary to construct an elevated approach thereto some 300 feet in length in the borough of Pittston. This approach crosses two public highways, but in such manner as not to interfere to any appreciable extent with the public travel upon <a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>said highways. It also extends over the Lehigh Valley Railroad, and thus avoids one of the most dangerous grade crossings in the state. The master and the court below agree that the approach, as constructed, was a great advantage to the general public, and that it was not a public nuisance.</p>
    <p id="b659-3" data-blocks='[["BL_659.4",659,[206,632,1161,288]]]'>In the year 1885, the approach referred to was destroyed by fire, and when the defendant company came to rebuild they were confronted with this bill in equity, filed by the attorney general on behalf of the commonwealth, at the instance of certain parties who objected to its construction in the same manner as heretofore.</p>
    <p id="b659-4" data-blocks='[["BL_659.5",659,[207,939,1159,552]]]'>The case has been so exhaustively discussed, both by the learned court below and the master, that little remains to be added. The two controlling charges in the bill, and the two points pressed upon the argument, were that the acts complained of were ultra vires the corporation, and that they amounted to a nuisance. The master found against the commonwealth in respect to both; the court held that the structure was not a nuisance, but that it was in excess of the powers of the corporation. For reasons, however, which we need not state here, but which are entirely satisfactory, the court declined to grant an injunction, and dismissed the complainant’s bill.</p>
    <p id="b659-5" data-blocks='[["BL_659.6",659,[203,1500,1163,908]],["BL_660.1",660,[232,368,1167,1101]]]'>We would not hesitate to affirm the decree, without more, upon the opinion of the learned president of the court below, but for the reason that we do not agree with the proposition that the defendant company had no power to make this extension. The grant of the power to construct the bridge carried with it the right to elevate it to a sufficient height to avoid the danger of ice and floods. The fact that it had been injured several times from such cause, and finally almost wholly swept away, is conclusive evidence that the original construction was too low. In rebuilding it the company had the right to elevate it in such manner, and to such a height, as in their judgment would obviate the danger referred to. The original construction did not exhaust the power of the company in this respect. It might not relocate the bridge, for the power to do that was exhausted by its original location, but it could change the elevation of the bridge to the extent that experience showed it to be necessary. The right to elevate it carried with it by necessary implication the right to construct reasonable and proper <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>approaches. This power is absolutely essential to the enjoyment of the franchises of the company, for of what possible use would be a bridge, either to its owners or the public, without a practical approach thereto? The peculiar situation of the ground where the bridge ends on the southeast side of the Susquehanna river, in the borough of Pittston, and of the public highways at that point, including the crossing of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, renders an approach of the character complained of, if not an absolute necessity, at least a very great convenience to the traveling public generally, and a protection from grade crossing accidents at the railroad. Under these circumstances we can readily understand why the learned court below, and the master, declined to find this construction to be a public nuisance, and to decree its removal. It would have been a misapplication of equity to apply to this case the doctrine of Reimer’s Ap., <a href="/pa/100/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="100 Pa. 182" data-case-ids="498374" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0182-01">100 Pa. 182</a>, and that line of cases, in which parties have been enjoined from projecting bay windows and other similar constructions into a public street or highway. Such constructions were an interference with the public right, for a strictly private purpose, while in the case in hand the construction was for a public purpose, and for the public convenience.</p>
    <p id="b660-4" data-blocks='[["BL_660.5",660,[234,1486,1165,449]]]'>The commonwealth has moved with a leaden heel in this matter, and while the great delay does not bar her right, it is not without weight in considering the character of this construction. Had it been the public nuisance which she now alleges it to be, it is hardly likely so long a time would have elapsed before anyone complained of it. The further fact that those that are now most active in pressing this case, or their predecessors in title, assented to the original construction, is not without weight.</p>
    <p id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.6",660,[235,1942,1160,95]]]'>The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>
