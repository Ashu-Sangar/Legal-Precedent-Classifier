The defendants claim that she has not so proved her claim in this case — [that she has failed to furnish clear, full and satisfactory evidence that she purchased the property with money belonging to her own separate estate: and they claim that it was the money of her husband that paid for the property, and that the title was put in her name to cheat and defraud defendants’ creditors, and particularly Thomas Connerton, one of the defendants. If you find such to be the ease, that the property was thus acquired and the title put in Honora Delaney for such purpose, then the defendants would be entitled to your verdict.] [1]</p>
