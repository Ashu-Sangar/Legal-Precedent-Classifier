The question raised is whether such a beneficiary is entitled to subrogation against the estate of the insured decedent for that portion of the life insurance proceeds which were applied to satisfy a loan made by decedent for which the policy had been assigned as collateral.</p>

At the time of assignment to the Citizens Bank, the policy proceeds were payable to the decedent’s estate.</p>

      <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>On November 9, 1950, Ernest Furbee, a Vice-President of the Mellon Bank, at the request of decedent, notified the Insurance Company that Green wished to change the beneficiary to Irving Saul, a grandson of the decedent,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">*</a>

On March 19, 1953, Green executed and delivered to the bank a new note in the amount of $3,500; part of the loan thus obtained was used to liquidate prior obligations to the Bank. This new note, of $3,-500 was the only debt for which the policy was collateral at Green’s death.</p>

    <p id="b262-6" data-blocks='[["BL_262.6",262,[218,1093,1145,152]]]'>Of primary importance are the following clauses of decedent’s agreement with the Bank in which he assigned the insurance policy as collateral:</p>

    <p id="b263-6" data-blocks='[["BL_263.6",263,[137,965,1154,1178]]]'>Appellant further relies for subrogation on the testamentary direction to pay debts. Every borrower and every bank and every other lender knows that the parties intend a bank loan secured by an insurance policy to be paid shortly after decedent’s death, out of the proceeds of the insurance policy, and not out of the insured’s estate where the claim may be contested and may be paid, if there are available funds, one or more years after the insured’s death. An insured knows at the time he makes the collateral loan that unless he clearly otherwise provides, the loan will be paid out of the proceeds of the policy and the named beneficiary of the policy will be paid only the remaining balance. There can be no subrogation in this collateral loan situation in the absence of (1) clear language in the will (or in the assignment or terms of the policy) directing subrogation, or (2) an oral agreement with decedent which is proved by evidence which is clear, direct, precise and convincing.

There the insured was adjudicated a weak-minded person nearly 30 years after procuring his insurance. It thereafter became necessary, in order to pay his necessary hospital and living expenses, for his guardian, with the approval of the Court, to borrow money, using the policy as collateral. Thus the insured’s only intent with respect to the proceeds of the policy was ascertainable as of the time he designated the beneficiaries, when he himself was of sound mind. At such time, his intent was that his beneficiaries should receive the full amount of the policy, and therefore subrogation against his estate was permitted.</p>
