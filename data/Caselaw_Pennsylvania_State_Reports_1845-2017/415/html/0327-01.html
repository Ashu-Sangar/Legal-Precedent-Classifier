Moreover, there were several voting machines in which <em>no votes were cast in Row B, </em>but votes were cast in Rows A and C.

Not one of these ballots is marked according to law. In McCowin’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/165/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="165 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="862118" data-case-paths="/pa/165/0233-01">165 Pa. 233</a>, the present Chief Justice, after quoting from sections 14 and 22 of the act, said: ‘The marking mentioned in the last quotation is applicable only to candidates whose names are printed in the official ballot. <em>They cannot be legally voted for in any other way than by marking </em>as specified in said section.’ ...

For reasons already stated we decline to hold that the mark of a one (1) in the square provided for the cross mark, or a cross mark (X) in the square below it has the effect of a cross mark (X) in the proper place for it.

    <p id="b438-6" data-blocks='[["BL_438.7",438,[225,997,1146,364]]]'>(II) Appellant next relies upon Article XII, §1216(d) of the Election Code of 1937, supra, which pertinently provides (as above noted) : “At primaries, he shall vote for each candidate individually by operating the key, handle, pointer or knob, <em>upon or adjacent </em>[not below, or in the row of the opposite party] to which the name of such candidate is placed.”</p>

Furthermore, under appellant’s theory, the word “adjacent” could mean (1) <em>above, </em>or (2) <em>below, </em>or (3) to the <em>left, </em>or (4) to the <em>right, </em>or (5) <em>near </em>to the candidate’s name, which realistically is both impractical and absurd. Section (d) clearly and undoubtedly means that a particular voting machine can have a pointer or lever which can be pulled down <em>upon </em>the name of the candidate of his choice, viz., a Jamestown machine, or a different type of machine, viz., a Shoup machine which was used in a number of wards. The Shoup machine has a pointer or lever on the right side of the candidate’s name (and can be pulled to the left and just beside the candidate’s name) and consequently is <em>adjacent </em>to the name of the candidate. The Legislative <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>Act is both clear and realistic. The word “upon” clearly covers and, we repeat, applies to the present Jamestown machine; the word “adjacent” would cover and apply to a different machine known as the Shoup machine, where the pointer and appropriate voting space is, we repeat, on the right of and next to the candidate’s name.</p>
    <p id="b439-3" data-blocks='[["BL_439.5",439,[139,736,1149,570]]]'>(Ill) The third reason urged by appellant is its desire to carry out the <em>surmised </em>intention of the voters and thus avoid “disfranchising” many voters. Such alleged disfranchisement is more superficial than real. In the first place, if there was any disfranchisement the voters carelessly or unthinkingly disfranchised themselves. But even this alleged disfranchisement would apply only to a vote for a United States Senator; it does not affect or invalidate these voters’ votes for other candidates on the ballot or on the loan question.</p>

At the present time the manner of voting on voting machines is governed, insofar as primary elections are concerned, by §1216(d) of the Election Code (25 P.S. §3056) which, I repeat, provides, in pertinent part: “At primaries, he [the voter] shall vote for each candidate individually by operating the key, handle, pointer or knob,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_18" id="ref_footnote_3_18">18</a> upon or adjacent to which the name of such candidate is placed.” That provision <em>clearly </em>states <em>how </em>the voter shall vote, i.e., by operating the lever, but does it provide with any degree of clarity <em>where </em>or <em>by which lever </em>the voter shall vote? The phrase “upon or adjacent to which the name of such candidate is placed” is clearly adjectival in nature, descriptive of the lever which the voter shall operate and limits and restricts the voter to that lever which is “upon or adjacent to” the candidate’s name. The Avord “or” is used as a disjunctive particle that marks an alternative and differentiates between that lever which is <em>“upon” </em>and that lever which is “adjacent to”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_19" id="ref_footnote_3_19">19</a> The use of the word “or” together with the fact that “upon” and “adjacent” are not only not synonymous but differ <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>in meaning<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_20" id="ref_footnote_3_20">20</a> point to a possible legislative intent that either one of two levers may be operated by the voter, i.e., that lever “upon . . . which the name of [the] candidate is placed” or that lever “adjacent to which the name of [the] candidate is placed.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_21" id="ref_footnote_3_21">21</a> In my opinion, the legislative description of the lever to be operated by the voter is vague, uncertain and ambiguous. From the language employed it is arguable that “upon” refers to the lever directly <em>above </em>the name of the candidate and that “adjacent” refers either to the lever <em>below </em>or the lever <em>above </em>the name of the candidate because both levers are “adjacent” to the candidate’s name. This loosely and carelessly drawn piece of legislation is not only uncertain and ambiguous but confus<a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>ing. At best, the legislative direction in §1216 (d) is doubtful and, in such event, the statute must be construed in the manner most favorable to the voter: <em>Independence Party Nomination, </em>supra. In view of the uncertain and dubious language of the statute, how can we now hold that the operation of the lower levers in panel “C”, even though such operation recorded the votes in the blank spaces on Row C, constituted a <em>clear </em>violation of, or a <em>clear </em>noncompliance with, the language of §1216(d) of the Election Code so as to justify the disfranchisement of upwards of 5000 voters?</p>

With that I thoroughly disagree. In many areas of the law courts must and do ascertain, from language and/or conduct, the intent of an individual. As an example, time and again we have said that, in the construction of wills, the “polestar” is the intent of the testator and we then have proceeded, by placing ourselves in the “armchair” of the testator and by examining the language and scheme of his will and the surrounding circumstances, to ascertain what the testator intended: <em>Woodward Estate, </em><a href="/pa/407/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="407 Pa. 638" data-case-ids="1307398" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0638-01">407 Pa. 638</a>, 640, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.2d%20732" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="182 A.2d 732">182 A. 2d 732</a>. Was such intent arrived at by “guess”, speculation or conjecture? I think not. In the case at bar, believing as I do that in election cases we must give recognition to the intent of a voter if ascertained, why cannot we place ourselves in the position of a voter in the polling booth, examine what confronted him and what he did and, considering all the surrounding circumstances, ascertain his intent? Granted that in construing a will we have principally the language of the testator before us and we determine what he meant by what he said, it seems to me that we can just as well determine what a voter meant by what he did; conduct can be just as eloquently communicative of intent as the written word. The ascertainment of the voters’ intent is not a “guess”; it is an opinion arrived at after a careful <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>marshalling of all the data necessary to the formulation of such opinion.</p>

The majority opinion offers several alternatives, i.e., such votes were “protest” votes, “cross-over” votes or “mistake votes”. If there were “protest” votes, against whom or what was the protest? On this subject the record is silent and the majority opinion furnishes no support for its suggestion. Were these “cross-over” votes? Appellee contends that Republican and Non-Partisan voters “crossed over” and registered their votes for Democratic candidates. In support of this contention, appellee points out that the levers in panel “0” were unlocked to Republican and Non-Partisan voters as well as Democratic voters, that on 17 voting machines used only by non-Democratic voters a total of 60 votes appeared in the senatorial columns of Row C and that, by a projection of the ratio shown on those machines to all the machines in the thirteen wards, the conclusion must be reached that approximately 1378 of the 5624 votes in Row 0 were cast by Republican or Non-Partisan voters.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_26" id="ref_footnote_3_26">26</a> In this connection, it must be noted that the total number of votes cast in Rows B and C were less than the total number of Democratic voters who actually voted.

Such a contention, unsupported as it is by any proof, falls in the face of the presumption long adhered to by this Court that, when a person acts, it is to be presumed that he acts in compliance with, not in violation of, the law: <em>Simon Election Case, </em><a href="/pa/353/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="353 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="465840" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0514-01">353 Pa. 514</a>, 521, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20A.2d%20243" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="46 A.2d 243">46 A. 2d 243</a>. To paraphrase the language of Chief Justice Maxey in <em>Simon, </em>supra, illegality cannot be proved by merely showing illegality-facilitating circumstances. What appellee — and now the majority of this Court — urges is that it is <em>possible </em>that there were “cross-over” votes cast in Row C; I would remind appellee and the majority of this Court that we said in <em>Winograd v. Coombs, </em><a href="/pa/342/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="342 Pa. 268" data-case-ids="1206966" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0268-01">342 Pa. 268</a>, 271, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20A.2d%20315" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="20 A.2d 315">20 A. 2d 315</a>: “Judicial decrees cannot be founded on possibilities”. Were these “mistake” votes? On this there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever, and I will not classify, simply by rote, the 5000 odd votes cast in this manner as “mistakes” and reject them out of hand. If any conclusion is a pure “guess”, it is the majority’s conclusion that the votes in Row C were in “protest” or “cross-over” or by way of “mistake”. The fallacy of the majority’s position in this respect is self-evident: its complete rejection of the factual data on this record. What is even more astounding is the clear implication in the majority opinion that, even if the voters’ intent were ascertained, such intent would not be recognized because voters, in the manner of their voting, failed to comply with the letter of the election statute!!</p>
