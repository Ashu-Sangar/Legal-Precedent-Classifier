The Communists weekly proclaim their desire for “peaceful coexistence” while (1) frequently insulting our Country, (2) abducting American citizens, (3) violating treaty after treaty, (4) burning our embassies, (5) shooting down our fliers, and (6) committing other acts of violence and hate, including a promise to “bury” us, (7) denouncing us in the United Nations’ meetings and (8) publicly threatening us in many parts of the world, (9) establishing a Communist base in Cuba 90 miles off our shore and (10) aiding that nation in its attempts to spread revolutions, hatred of the United States, and Communist forms of Government throughout Central and South America. (11) Moreover, many believe that the friendly government of China was abandoned by the policies of official Washington on the ground (a) that Chiang Kai-Shek’s government was corrupt and (b) that the Chinese Communists, unlike the Russian Communists, were merely “agrarian reformers”. (12) More recently, Washington denounced the sale by a British Company of busses to Cuba on the ground that it aided that Communist regime, even though it shored up the sagging economy of Britain, while we sold our wheat to Russia on the ground that it helped our economy and <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>was visible evidence of our Country’s desire to encourage a genuine peaceful coexistence with that arch-Communist Country, ignoring the indisputable fact that it aided that Communist regime.

In no other way can the menace and dangers of Communism be as clearly and succinctly brought home to the American people. To hold these words or any of said expressions libelous would realistically and practically put an effective stop to searching and illuminating discussion and debate with likely dire results. It is absolutely essential for the existence and preservation of our Country that opinions on such vitally important and highly controversial issues should be vigorously argued and debated, and this applies especially to persons in public life.
