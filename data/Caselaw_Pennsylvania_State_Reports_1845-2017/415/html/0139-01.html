A defendant on trial for a misdemeanor knows the charge he must meet and knows that, in the event of a conviction, he may have to pay costs as well.

By this argument, appellant concedes that there is a hearing afforded, but apparently believes that the Act should provide for a separate hearing on the matter of costs. The trial on the substantive offense offers ample opportunity to defend on the basis that defendant’s conduct warrants neither a verdict of guilty nor imposition of costs. In the language of the Superior Court: “He has an opportunity to be heard on the <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>question of costs.

It is sufficient to note that where a defendant <em>refuses </em>to pay the costs or to provide security therefor, his confinement is the result of the court’s exercise of its power to punish contempt. As the Superior Court observed: “But if he is unable to pay the costs, he may be exonerated from paying them by proceeding under the insolvency act. This procedure is available to him not only after he has been committed to prison for failure to pay the costs, but also before he is committed. Thus, an acquitted defendant upon whom costs have been imposed may be discharged from paying them without having to undergo any actual imprisonment.
