    <p id="b201-5" data-blocks='[["BL_201.6",201,[154,784,1149,905]]]'>The ingredients for popcorn are coconut oil, salt and popping corn. The oil is preheated to 80 degrees fahrenheit, and eight ounces is poured into a popcorn kettle. Berio’s plants have banks of popping kettles, each of which is about 16 inches in diameter and 16 inches high. Between 28 and 30 ounces of corn and 2 ounces of salt are placed into a kettle with the oil. When the eorn-oil-salt mixture reaches about 450 degrees, the moisture in the corn turns to steam and “explodes” the corn, thus increasing the volume of each kernel from 30 to 36 times its original size. The process requires constant agitation of the mixture to prevent scorching. As a kettle slowly fills to overflow, its hinged top opens and the popped corn is expelled. The popped corn falls on a conveyor belt and is separated into waste and merchantable corn by passing through a perforated drum.</p>
