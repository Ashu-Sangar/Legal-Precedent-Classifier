Shortly thereafter, <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>fearing detection and arrest, they decided to leave Buzzard’s Bay where they had been residing, traveled to Bangor, Maine, and eventually to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to hide out.</p>

Although they had relatives and close friends in the city, they continuously concealed their real identity and refrained from contact with persons who knew them.</p>

At ten o’clock that morning, they took at gun point an automobile and its owner (one Ralph Gallagher) from the parking lot of La Salle College, Philadelphia. Gallagher was later forced into the trunk of the automobile where he remained imprisoned for several hours. The Coyles then drove around the city to find “an easy job to rob.” About eight-thirty o’clock that evening, they committed an armed robbery of a Philadelphia taproom known as the Wistar Tavern. They fled the scene in the Gallagher automobile, later abandoning it in another section of the city, with the owner left in the locked trunk. They then returned to their apartment.</p>
    <p id="b484-6" data-blocks='[["BL_484.7",484,[230,1660,1147,201]]]'>Following this episode, their fear of apprehension increased and they both armed themselves with concealed, loaded revolvers every time they ventured forth from the apartment.</p>

They began sneaking out of the apartment in the early morning hours and stealing milk from porches of residences nearby. The method of operation was for one of the brothers to approach the residence to get the milk while the other would stand armed nearby to “cover him.” If anyone tried to apprehend them, it was agreed that they would shoot their way out if necessary.</p>

It is also important that when Lt. Cullinane interrogated appellant, he was not investigating the killing here in issue but rather carrying through the Massachusetts police investigation of the Middleboro robbery. The Kane killing was, therefore, not the main focal point of the interrogation but merely a corollary thereof. It was, therefore, not such a “critical stage” in the proceedings of the present case that the absence <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>of counsel would vitiate any damaging admissions as to the present issue.</p>
    <p id="b504-4" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[221,462,1147,361]]]'>Immediately before the appellant was interviewed by the District Attorney of Philadelphia, <em>it is uncontradicted </em>that the assistance of counsel was offered and rejected.

    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[219,844,1150,1274]]]'>When appellant was interviewed by Mr. Peruto on the night of June 18th, admittedly no request for counsel was made. The opportunity to restate appellant’s description of the event was his own idea. It is undenied also that he was warned that anything said would be taken down and used against him in court, which is at least close to saying he had the right to remain silent. When Mr. Peruto was first advised of Attorney Duffy’s presence and intercession on appellant’s behalf and this was related to the appellant himself, the latter flatly rejected her assistance. This, of course, was in line with his previous conduct when offers of similar assistance were also rejected. From the sum total of all of the circumstances, it is clearly evident to us that the appellant was fully aware that the assistance of counsel would be provided if he wished it, and that as of that time, he desired to give his version of the events involved without such assistance. In this connection, it is significant to note that the appellant was not an illiterate; that he was 24 years of age; that he had completed two years in high school and three and one-half years’ service in the Air Force of the United States.</p>

In <em>Jackson, </em>it was held that the practice, pursued in this case and in this Commonwealth for many years, of having the jury which determines the guilt question also solely resolve the voluntariness of incriminating statements, is in violation of due process of law. It does not necessarily follow that the appellant is entitled to a new trial. However, under <em>Jackson, </em>the appellant is entitled to have a hearing consistent with the requirements of due process, separate and apart from the proceedings before the trial jury, wherein the question of voluntariness shall be determined by a Court.

But as to Jackson, who has already been convicted and now seeks collateral relief, we cannot say that the Constitution requires a new trial if in a soundly conducted collateral proceeding, the confession which was admitted at the trial is fairly determined to be voluntary.”</p>
