When plaintiffs-appellant’s case was finished except for the testimony of a vital witness who was out of the state and unavailable, the court continued the hearing and fixed a subsequent date for the accommodation of this witness. After three such dates for hearing had been scheduled, and two months had passed without this testimony being available, the chancellor in the interests of expediency directed that the defendants proceed Avithout prejudice and reserving the right to apply for a compulsory nonsuit, when the plaintiffs-appellant’s testi-<a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>mony was in fact completed. To this, all counsel agreed. It was after the plaintiffs had completed their case in chief that the judgment was entered without consideration being given to the evidence of the defendants.

The statute does not cover, nor does it purport to cover, a situation in which a judgment of nonsuit is entered by the presiding Judge and an appeal from <em>that </em>judgment is taken directly to this Court. Certainly it is a better and wiser practice to move the Court in banc to set aside the judgment of nonsuit. However, recent cases recognize that a plaintiff may <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>appeal from the entry of a judgment of nonsuit. For example, in <em>Schneider v.

    <p id="b129-4" data-blocks='[["BL_129.5",129,[138,608,1149,472]]]'>It is clear that the losing party (a) may appeal directly from the judgment of compulsory nonsuit entered by the presiding trial Judge, or (b) may appeal the refusal of the Court in banc to set aside a compulsory nonsuit. Since this statute is clearly discretionary so far as the Court in banc is concerned, a direct appeal from the trial Judge’s entry of judgment of compulsory nonsuit is undoubtedly permissible. For this reason I must dissent from the Order to quash.</p>
