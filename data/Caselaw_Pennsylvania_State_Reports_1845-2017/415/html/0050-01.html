When the bids were opened on the appointed date, that of B. &amp; B. in the amount of $346,000 was the lowest submitted. However, the bond accompanying the bid, while signed by B. &amp; B. and a responsible corporate surety, and in every other respect complete, did not contain any specific penal sum in the blank space provided. District, acting on advice of <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>counsel, rejected R. &amp; B.’s bid solely because the bond did not conform to the specified requirements. The next lowest bid in the sum of $347,200 was announced as the lowest valid bid received.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The president of R. &amp; B., who attended the meeting, immediately publicly announced that the omission was unintentional and that his company was ready, able and willing to perform.</p>

District is fully protected. The bond is valid and enforceable notwithstanding the omission. See, <em>Wiley v. Moor, </em>17 S. &amp; R. 438 (1828), and <em>Costen’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/13/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="13 Pa. 292" data-case-ids="965010" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0292-01">13 Pa. 292</a> (1850), and 6 Vale Penna.

See, <em>Dodge v. St. John, </em><a href="/ny/96/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="96 N.Y. 260" data-case-ids="556017" data-case-paths="/ny/96/0260-01">96 N.Y. 260</a> (1884), and <em>Burns v.

R. &amp; B. therefore, submitted a bond in an amount at least equal to 25% of its total bid. The omission was of a nonessential and results in an advantage to District and the taxpayers. Even if the invitation to bid did not so provide, the bidder could not withdraw the bid or escape the liability merely because of the omission: <em>Colella v. Allegheny County, </em>supra. Nor can surety escape liability because the condition of the bond is more comprehensive than required: <em>Philadelphia v. H. C.

For instance in <em>Whitemarsh, </em>the bid was not signed by the offeror, despite the fact that the express provisions of the invitation to bid provided that no proposal would be considered which was not signed by the person submitting it. Moreover, in that case the contractor was declining to honor its bid. In <em>Harris, </em>the security accompanying the bid was in an amount less than that required. The bid was, therefore, fatally defective.</p>

This is not correct. The bond provided for confession of judgment in the event of default “in the sum named in this bond” and further provided that the assessment of damages shall <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>be restricted “to those stated in the above condition of this obligation,” and that the judgment so entered would be final, without right of appeal, certiorari, writ of error or motion to open or strike off. Under the circumstances, the “sum stated in the bond” is the sum which the contractor and surety undertook to pay in the event of default on the bid. The omission involved did not prevent the entry of judgment by confession for that amount. See, 6A Standard Pennsylvania Practice, Judgments §215, p. 474, and <em>Kros v. Bacall Textile Corp., </em><a href="/pa/386/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="386 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="1268330" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0360-01">386 Pa. 360</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.2d%20421" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="126 A.2d 421">126 A. 2d 421</a> (1956).</p>
