The majority, in concluding otherwise, fails to give adequate consideration to the mental and physical condition of the ninety-year-old testatrix and to the circumstances at the time she followed the recommendation of her advisor in affixing her mark to a letter directing the sale of the stock (five years-after the execution of her will).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a>

On that day he went to decedent’s house, made his recommendation and presented her with a letter directed to First National Bank of Lawrence County directing it to sell her Shenango stock at the price offered. Because of her long-time association with the pottery company, decedent was upset to think that the pottery was going to be sold and was going out of the Smith family. However, she concurred in Mr. White’s recommendation that the stock should be sold and started to write her signature on the letter to the bank, which Mr. White had prepared. She was physically unable to complete her signature and she, therefore, stated that her incomplete signature was to be treated as her mark. . . .</blockquote>

He recognized, however, that in view of her advanced age — she was approximately 90 years of age — and her weakened condition, some question might later be raised as to her capacity. . . .</blockquote>

        <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>“Mr. White testified at length concerning his contacts with Mrs. Smith from the time her husband died in 1955. During this period he saw her several times a week. She was ill and was hospitalized for eight days in October 1956. When, after this illness, it came to his attention that Mrs. Smith had paid a certain bill twice, Mr. White concluded that she was getting a little confused in her mind, and in March of 1957 recommended that her affairs be handled by the bank. Thereafter, the bank took over her business affairs, keeping her accounts, making her bank deposits and paying her bills.</blockquote>

She remembered things that had happened in the past, but she frequently forgot recent occurences. She occasionally failed to recognize friends, but until within a few days of her death in 1961, she always recognized Mr. White and expressed pleasure at seeing him. Some days she was better than others. At the time when Mr. White was discussing with Mrs. Smith the offer to purchase her stock, Mrs. Smith did not remember how many shares she had and there were some days when she could not remember the names of all of her relatives.</blockquote>

Mr. White expressed the view that because it was hard for her to remember the names of all her close relatives and because he thought that she did not know the exact number of shares of stock she owned, she was not competent to make a codicil to her mil. No one ever discussed with Mrs. Smith the ademption problem.” </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>
