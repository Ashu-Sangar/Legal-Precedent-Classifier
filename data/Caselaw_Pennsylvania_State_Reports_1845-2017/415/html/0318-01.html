Pusti, Jr. purchased four automobile collision policies from appellant Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (Nationwide) in 1958. All were purchased through the same agent and were identical. Each policy covered a separate automobile owned by him.

Pusti, John’s mother, was struck and killed by an automobile and John (Administrator) is the administrator of her estate. It is conceded that the estate is entitled to recover only under Part (C). Each family compensation rider provides for a death payment of $5,000. The question raised is whether her estate is entitled to recover $5,000 under each rider for a total of $20,000 or whether her estate is limited to a total recovery of $5,000, i.e., limited to a recovery under one rider only.</p>

Administrator bases his estoppel argument on the contention that Nationwide provided no additional coverage by virtue of the addi<a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>tional riders. Sucb is not the circumstance. <em>The coverage under Part (A) of each rider is in addition to that provided by Part (A) of every other rider since each of the Part (A) coverages is restricted to the one automobile specifically described in that policy. </em>Further, the coverage of Part (A) may well have been the major inducement for the purchase of the additional family compensation riders since Part (A)’s combined coverage of persons injured, cause of injury and relationship of insured to a person injured is more extensive than that of Parts (B) and (C). Hence, this is not a situation where the insurer collects a premium and provides no benefits for that premium.</p>

We have carefully analyzed these and similar insurance cases involving estoppel<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and find that doctrine here wholly inapplicable. In <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>each of the cases applying estoppel three essential elements were present: (1) a policy condition (2) which policy condition would void the entire policy and frustrate the entire purpose of the insured, and (3) the insurer’s knowledge that the policy condition was inconsistent with the facts of the insured’s situation. As demonstrated below, these elements are not present in the instant case; therefore, the case authorities do not support a finding of estoppel here.</p>
    <p id="b421-4" data-blocks='[["BL_421.7",421,[143,857,1150,204]],["BL_422.1",422,[224,354,1150,796]]]'>First, a policy condition was present in each of the cases applying estoppel. In the majority of these cases the condition in issue stated that the policy was void if the policyholder had other insurance which was not <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>endorsed on the application or policy<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> or if the policyholder had other than sole and unconditional ownership of the insured property<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> or if the policy’s description of the use or condition of the property insured was inaccurate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The policy conditions relate generally to the quality of moral or other risks assumed. See Morris, Waiver and Estoppel in Insurance Policy Litigation, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%20925" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="105 U. Pa. L. Rev. 925">105 U. Pa. L. Rev. 925</a> (1957). In effect, an insured is penalized by a voidance of the entire policy where the policy condition is not satisfied. In the case at bar the Limitation Provision is not a policy condition. It does not void the rider; it is not related to the quality of the risks assumed; nor does it penalize insured for failing to satisfy a condition. Thus, a policy condition is not present here.</p>
    <p id="b422-4" data-blocks='[["BL_422.5",422,[225,1161,1145,201]],["BL_423.1",423,[136,365,1157,1986]]]'>Second, the entire policy was voided and there was entire frustration of the insured’s purpose in each of the cases invoking the doctrine of estoppel. The conditions in those cases Avere designed to render null and <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>of no legal effect the entire liability of the insurer and thus to deny every benefit to the insured under the policy. In the case at bar the family compensation rider provides coverage for an indefinitely large number of persons causing injury, a wide variety of relationships between automobile and injury and a wide variety of causes of injury. The number of permutations and combinations of risks assumed by the insurer are enormous, and its potential liability under any one policy is open-ended. Further, Nationwide agreed to assume absolute liability without regard to the fault of the claimant. However, it did not attempt by the Limitation Provision to void any or all of these permutations and combinations of risks assumed under any one rider. The Limitation Provision does not exclude recovery under any one rider by each and every beneficiary injured or killed in the same or successive accidents. Here, Nationwide simply (1) limited the cumulative piling up of multiple recoveries (2) by one person (3) under several policies (4) as a result of injury to that person (5) where that person falls within the beneficiary class of other family compensation riders. The impact of this limitation is somewhat like that of the widely used pro rata other insurance clause which, broadly speaking, limits an insured’s recovery under a policy to the proportion which that policy amount bears to the total amount of insurance in force on the same risk. Our courts have long upheld such clauses. See <em>Vrabel v. Scholler, </em><a href="/pa/369/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="369 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="1232369" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0235-01">369 Pa. 235</a>, 243, <a href="/citations/?q=85%20A.2d%20858" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="85 A.2d 858">85 A. 2d 858</a> (1952) and cases cited therein. We do not construe this narrow limitation as entirely voiding the additional riders. Nor does the record contain any facts upon which we might conclude that Administrator’s failure to obtain quadruple recovery for the estate of his mother frustrated his entire purpose in purchasing the three additional family compensation riders.</p>
    <p id="b424-3" data-blocks='[["BL_424.4",424,[240,350,1155,1373]]]'>
      <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>Third, in each of the cases applying estoppel, the insurer knew that the policy condition was inconsistent with the facts of the insured’s situation. For example, in those cases the insurer knew that the insured had other insurance not endorsed on the application or policy or that the insured was not the sole and unconditional owngr of the property insured. Despite this knowledge the policy condition would have voided the policy in just such situations. Our courts have not permitted insurers to assume this inconsistent and inequitable position. In the instant case Administrator argues that it is inconsistent for Nationwide to have issued “the additional accidental injury or death coverages if it did not intend to provide the separate $5,-000 coverage under each of the policies, since under no circumstances would there be any benefit whatsoever . . . under the additional policies unless such provisions were each separately effective. . . .” However, the additional riders did provide additional benefit under Part (A); and there is no evidence that the sole purpose in the acquisition of the additional riders was or was not for the coverage extended by Part (A). Hence, we conclude that Administrator’s assertion that the Limitation Provision was inconsistent with the issuance of additional family compensation riders is without merit.</p>

Such an argument does not raise an estoppel. Eather, it embodies a request that this Court recast the parties’ bargain. Each additional rider and premium brought substantial additional benefits, and it is neither possible under the evidence nor our function under the law to calculate their worth. Hence, Administrator must <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>be held to the bargain struck by tbe insured when he purchased the additional policies.</p>
