On February 13, 1964, all defendants were served with copies of the complaint. All defendants except Kates filed appearances within the prescribed twenty day period, and also filed answers on March 5, 1964. On March 5, 1964, Richmond entered judgment against Kates for want of an appearance and for failure to file an answer.</p>

The petition averred that Kates was insured against liability; that on March 4, 1964, his insurance carrier forwarded the file to its counsel, and when counsel attempted to enter his appearance on March 5, 1964, the default judgment had already been entered against Kates. The petition also averred that Kates “has a just and meritorious defense to the plaintiff’s claim”, but did not set forth, as better practice requires, the details of such defense.</p>
