The owner of the restaurant ordered appellant and Ford to stop their noise or go outside. Finnie thereupon jumped up and said, “Well, I will be back.” <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>Finnie then left the restaurant and returned in about 12 or 15 minutes.
