The basis of their claims was that Fineberg, who had reported and paid tax as a wholesaler, should have reported and paid tax as a retailer. Fineberg promptly paid the claimed amounts and appealed to the County Court of Allegheny County which sustained his position and ordered the additional amounts refunded. The City and School District appealed.</p>

    <p id="b208-4" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[215,1155,1149,957]]]'>Fineberg, as well as the court below, relies strongly on the <em>Paper Products </em>case. There we held, inter alia, that a taxpayer who sold wrapping supplies to other persons, which other persons used them in connection with their sales of goods to customers, was a wholesale vendor because the taxpayer’s customers transferred title to the wrapping supplies to the ultimate consumers and included the cost of such supplies in the markup of the goods sold. It is true in the present ease that the cost of the uniforms is included by the laundry service companies in their rental charge, but it is equally true that title to the uniforms does not pass to the customers of the service companies. In other words, the service companies do not resell the uniforms. A resale by Fineberg’s customers is a necessary finding to a conclusion that Fineberg is a wholesaler; since no such finding can be made, the position of the City and School District must be upheld.</p>

The ultimate consumer is, in fact, the person to whom the buyer from taxpayer leases the uniforms.</p>

Such a construction renders mere surplusage language intended by the Legislature to have meaning and is in violation of the principles of statutory construction. See Statutory Construction Act, May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, §51, 46 P.S. §551.</p>

They did include not only vendors but dealers. Can it reasonably be said that persons who buy clothing, wearing apparel, and continually lease out uniforms for industrial employees, take them back for re-laundering and leasing to the same customers or to other customers, are not dealers in goods, wares and merchandise? True, a dealer is also one who buys something in order to sell it, not one who buys to keep or makes to sell. One may be a dealer who buys to sell, and he may be a dealer who buys to lease, he may be both. ... A person who buys clothing, then sells it or leases it to industrial launderers and/or their employees usually under a lease-use-agreement which pro<a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>vides for and includes the laundering service is a dealer within the language indicated in our local mercantile license tax acts, ordinances and regulations, supra.”</p>

Similarly, we must here recognize that the uniforms are used in direct connection with the sale of the product sold by the purchasers from taxpayer, uniform leasing and laundering service, and that the cost of the uniforms is calculated into the price of the service being sold.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

The more important basis of <em>Paper Products </em>is that the paper was used directly in the sale by the retailer. The uniforms here are even more directly involved in the sale, since the sale of the service requires that use of the uniform be included.</p>
