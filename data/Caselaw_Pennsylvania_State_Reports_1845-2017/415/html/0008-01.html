Counsel for Mary contends that such language “points only to the wife of [Erny] living at the time of his death [Mary].” In support of such contention, it is argued that: (a) Erny’s failure to designate Agnes <em>by </em>name, although continuously designating his foster daughter, Thelma, by name, reveals an intent to benefit the wife who would be his wife when he died; (b) that, having been childless in his 20 year marriage with Agnes and Agnes, then being 42 years of age, it is unlikely that Erny was then thinking of any possible children by Agnes, hence, in the use of the phrase “issue of their joint bodies”, Erny must have been referring to his time-of-death wife; (d) that the phrase “living at the time of his death” clearly identifies the person contemplated by the word “wife” as the “time-of-death wife”.</p>

The third wife claimed, as his surviving wife, the income from the corpus of the trust. The lower court, relying on <em>Anshutz </em>and <em>Solms </em>and the <em>naming </em>in the codicil of Rita Buzby, held that the testator had intended Rita to share in the income. This Court reversed and awarded the income for life to the third, or “time-of-death”, wife. In so doing, this Court, while distinguishing <em>Anshutz </em>and <em>Solms</em>

      <em> </em>rejected as <em>inflexible </em>the “safe general rule” enunciated in <em>Anshutz. </em>The rationale of <em>Buzby </em>is: (a) there is no <em>inflexible </em>rule of construction or a presumption arising from the use of the word “wife”; (b) the codicil, which named “Rita” as the wife, was not conclusive since the codicil, ultimately, Avas not dispositive of any of testator’s estate; (c) had testator meant “Rita” as his wife, he could have so stated; (d) the use of the generic word “wife” was highly significant; <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>(e) the inclusion of the son’s “children” with the “wife” as income beneficiaries indicated that testator did not contemplate Rita’s children, of whom it was probable, after thirteen childless years, there would be none; (f) since the “children” of P. W. Buzby by <em>any </em>subsequent wife would qualify as income beneficiaries, ergo, the mother of such children should qualify; (g) the phrase “following him” identified “wife” as “time-of-death” wife.</p>

Settlor died in 1922 and the son in 1955, without issue. The son had five marriages.

When the instruments were executed, Donald Pettit had a wife, Jane, and one child. After the settlor’s death, <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>Donald and Jane were divorced and Donald remarried. The Conrt held that the words “widow” and “wife” meant Jane and awarded the income to her. The court, recognizing <em>Buzby </em>but relying in part on <em>Anshutz </em>and <em>Solms, </em>stated it “is a general rule of law that where a gift is made to a person described by relationship to another, even on a contingency that may not happen (to the widow of A), and where a person existing at the execution of the instrument meets the description or may fulfill the contingency, such person is intended as the beneficiary” and that “ ‘widow’ would be construed as ‘wife’ and the ordinary rule of identification of beneficiaries would apply that they are determined as of the execution of the instrument”. However, the court did recognize that such rule is not inflexible, as <em>Buzby </em>stated, and that reliance should primarily be placed on the intent of the settlor of the trust as evidenced by the language of the trust instrument. In Bravo, the court emphasized the importance of the language of the gift-over clause to the charity, i.e., “If . . . Donald Pettit and his wife should die without issue surviving them” and considered that such language suggested common issue rather than issue of Donald alone, that the phrase “Donald Pettit and his wife” treated Pettits as a couple, and that such language <em>strongly </em>suggested that a specific wife was in settlors’ minds. The court concluded that the settlors intended by the words “widow” and “wife” the “time-of-the-trust” wife — Jane.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>
