She created a testamentary trust of one-third of her residuary estate to pay the income to her son Robert for life, with the remainder to his issue. Robert was not only the life tenant, he was also Executor. Robert died on March 18, 1961. Ninety-six percent of the trust consisted of stock in the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company. The Mellon Bank paid a 2% common stock dividend in 1958, in 1959, in 1960, and in 1961.</p>

From the Decree of the Orphans’ Court, which confirmed the Account and dismissed the exceptions, Robert’s Executrix took this appeal.</p>

Application of the Act; Powers of Settlor. — This act shall govern the ascertainment of income and principal . . .: Provided,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> That the person establishing the principal <em>may himself direct </em>the manner of ascertainment of income and principal <em>... or grant discretion </em>to the trustee or other person, <em>to do so and such provision </em>and direction, where not otherwise contrary to law, <em>shall control, </em>notwithstanding this act.”</p>

Article Nine, after giving to the Trustee very wide and <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>broad powers, pertinently provides: “I authorize the trustee in its sole discretion to do any or all of the following: (a) <em>to apply to principal in whole or in part extraordinary dividends, </em>regardless of the form in which they are paid, and rights to subscribe to stock; (b) to amortize from income premiums paid for investments which are callable or have a fixed maturity; (c) to amortize from income the waste represented by the return from a wasting asset or dividends from a wasting asset corporation; (d) to pay carrying charges on unproductive or underproductive property from income; and (e) to apply to principal in whole or in part the proceeds of the conversion of unproductive or underproductive property.”</p>
