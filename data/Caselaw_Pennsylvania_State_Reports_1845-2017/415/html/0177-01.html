There is no provision for appeal from the order of court approving the bond; but, in recognition of the constitutional right of trial by jury, for the purpose of determining the amount of damages, express provision is made for appeal from any preliminary assessment of damages ‘by viewers or otherwise.’ In practice, the court is generally careful to require a bond sufficiently large in amount to cover all damages to which the landowner may be entitled; but, whether that be done <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>or not, the power of the jury, in the premises, is wholly unaffected by the amount that may be named in the bond.”</p>
