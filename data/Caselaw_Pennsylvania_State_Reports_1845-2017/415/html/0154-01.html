L. 1333, §1403, as amended (25 P.S. §3153) (hereinafter referred to as the Election Code).</p>
    <p id="b253-10" data-blocks='[["BL_253.15",253,[135,1582,1150,475]]]'>“There were four candidates for the three offices of county commissioner and prior to the computation and canvassing of the ballots of absentee electors it appeared that Oscar E. Kehler (D) had received 19,626 votes; W. Fred Kohler, Jr. (R) 19,480 votes; George F. Perles [Perles] (D) 19,060 votes; and Fred E. Hoffman [Hoffman] (R) 18,729 votes. The ballots of absentee electors received by the county board of elections (and not then counted) totalled 765.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

As the remaining ballots were removed from their outer envelopes, counsel for Perles began to challenge,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> ultimately challenging 485 of the remaining 619 votes. These challenges were overruled. “After all of the ballots of absentee electors had been thus canvassed (and with the apparent agreement of all parties including the interested candidates, their attorneys and watchers, the tabulators, the county chairmen of the two major political parties, and the two common pleas judges sitting as a return board) <em>the still-sealed inner envelopes containing the overruled, challenged ballots were commingled with the envelopes containing unchallenged ballots and at that point they were all opened and the ballots therein </em>counted.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> (Emphasis supplied). Perles received votes on 96 of the absentee ballots and Hoffman on 505. When these ballots were tabulated with the other ballots cast, the final result was a victory for Hoffman by 78 votes.</p>

      <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>The counting of the absentee ballots was concluded on November 17, 1963, and the votes were tallied on November 18 and 19. On November 22, 1963, the board signed the official books which confirmed the results of the canvass and computation of the absentee ballots. On November 22, 1963, Perles filed an appeal, and Hoffman moved to dismiss the appeal as having been untimely filed. On December 3, 1963, the two law judges of Northumberland County disqualified themselves from hearing the appeal because they had previously acted as the return board in the election. This Court then appointed Judge R. Dixon Herman of the 12th Judicial District to specially preside in the matter. Argument was held on December 18, 1963, and on January 2, 1964, the appeal was dismissed and the order of the County Return Board affirmed. It is from this action of the court below that Perles now appeals.</p>
    <p id="b255-4" data-blocks='[["BL_255.5",255,[135,1326,1151,572]]]'>Our review of this case is in the nature of narrow certiorari.

L. 1333, §1407, 25 PS §3157. This statute provides, ‘No appeal shall be allowed or granted from any order or decree of the court of common pleas made in pursuance of this section.’</p>
    <p id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.6",255,[131,1918,1152,475]]]'>“The scope of review, therefore, in this Court is in the nature of narrow certiorari and the inquiry is limited to a determination of whether or not the court had jurisdiction; whether or not the proceedings were regular; whether or not the court exceeded its power and authority; and, whether or not there was a violation of constitutional rights. <em>The question of the validity of ballots involved is not for us to say: </em>[citing cases].” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

      <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>It appears that Perles is now asking us, by couching his argument in terms of “jurisdiction” and “authority”, to pass again upon the validity of the ballots. This we cannot do: <em>Meell, </em>supra.</p>

This question is now raised for the first time and for that reason cannot now be considered. As we said in <em>Archbishop O’Hara’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/389/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="389 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1273994" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0035-01">389 Pa. 35</a>, 46, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.2d%20587" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="131 A.2d 587">131 A. 2d 587</a>: “It is well settled that, as to appellants, ‘matters not raised in, or considered by, the court below cannot be invoked on appeal even though they involve constitutional questions’: [citing cases].”</p>
    <p id="b256-6" data-blocks='[["BL_256.7",256,[234,1324,1149,688]]]'>It may not be amiss to note that even if our scope of review did permit us to inquire into the validity of the ballots and, upon such inquiry, we determined that <em>some </em>of the ballots were invalid, such a determination would not require the elimination of <em>all </em>the absentee ballots, as urged by the appellant. This is an instance where one rotten apple does not spoil the entire barrel. The envelopes containing the votes, to which challenges were made and overruled, were mingled with the unchallenged votes and all the absentee ballots were opened and counted. As a result, there is no possible manner whereby we could determine which votes, if any, were cast illegally.</p>
    <p id="b256-7" data-blocks='[["BL_256.8",256,[234,2022,1147,96]],["BL_257.1",257,[135,367,1150,956]]]'>The disfranchisement of even one person validly exercising his right to vote is an extremely serious mat<a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>ter. If, assuming, arguendo, <em>some </em>but not all of the ballots were invalid, and we should declare <em>all </em>the absentee ballots void because of the few that might be invalid, we would be disfranchising a large number of voters whose votes have not been shown to be invalid. In <em>Norwood Election Contest Case, </em><a href="/pa/382/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="382 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="1259949" data-case-paths="/pa/382/0547-01">382 Pa. 547</a>, 552, <a href="/citations/?q=116%20A.2d%20552" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="116 A.2d 552">116 A. 2d 552</a>, this Court stated: “Every rationalization within the realm of common sense should aim at saving the ballot rather than voiding it. Speaking to this very point, Chief Justice Maxey stated in the Bauman case <em>[Batman Election Contest </em>Case, <a href="/pa/351/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="351 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="462720" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0451-01">351 Pa. 451</a>, 454, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20630" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="41 A.2d 630">41 A. 2d 630</a>]: 'The power to throw out a ballot for minor irregularities, like the power to throw out the entire poll of an election district for irregularities, must be exercised very sparingly and with the idea in mind that either an individual voter or a group of voters are not to be disfranchised at an election except for compelling reasons.’ ”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
