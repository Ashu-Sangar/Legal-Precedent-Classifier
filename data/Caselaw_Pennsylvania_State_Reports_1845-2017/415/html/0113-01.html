They urge that such customer meters are used directly in the operation of “delivering or rendering of a public utility service” and are, therefore, exempt under the above utility exclusion provision. The Com<a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>monwealth vigorously replies that meters are not used in delivering or rendering of public utility service but argues that their function is to measure and record customer utilization. The argument continues that meters are used “in managerial sales or other non-operational activities,” a use made specifically taxable.</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[229,667,1147,631]]]'>We are not here presented with statutory language which requires either a search for legislative intention or the application of rules of statutory construction. The public utility service language is clear and unmistakable. The Legislature has classified not only the public utility property uses excluded from taxation, but also the property upon which the tax is imposed. The determinative inquiry here is whether meters are used in the direct operational function of rendering a public utility service or whether the property is utilized in the nonoperational (“managerial sales”) activities.</p>
    <p id="b214-5" data-blocks='[["BL_214.6",214,[228,1310,1151,737]]]'>Although “public utility service” is not defined in the Act (and there appears no reason why the Legislature should engage in repetitive definition of an already well understood term), there is no uncertainty, as to what it embraces. The Legislature, in the Public Utility Law, defines “service” as being used “in its broadest and most inclusive sense, and includes any and all acts done, rendered, or performed, and any and all things furnished or supplied, and any and all facilities used, furnished, or supplied by public utilities ... in the performance of their duties under this act to their patrons . . . and the public. . . .” Act of May 28, 1937, P.

Appellants also are required to provide, install, maintain and operate “all equipment necessary for the regulation and measurement of gas furnished to its customers.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Similarly, the tariffs filed with and approved by the Commission, as required by law, authorize the sale of metered service and commit the utilities to furnish and install the meters on the premises of the customer in order to deliver that type of service.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Thus, ap<a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>pellants are legally required to render to their customers not merely gas and electric service but metered gas and electricity. The delivery and performance of such service, under the regulations imposed upon appellants, necessarily entails the use of meters. So employed, they function in the distribution line to the consumer and are used directly and operationally in the rendering of a metered utility service.</p>
    <p id="b216-4" data-blocks='[["BL_216.6",216,[255,784,1149,739]]]'>The Commonwealth concedes that property used in delivering gas or electricity up to the point of entry into the meter is used directly in the operation of a public utility service and is not taxable. However, the Commonwealth argues that equipment used beyond that point, including the meter itself, is not part of the operation of the service and that use of the meter is part of the managerial activities of the public utility. Such a result, in effect, places meters in the same category as office furniture, equipment, supplies and the like. To the contrary, the difference between the use of meters and of office items and their respective direct relationships to furnishing energy to a customer is apparent.</p>
    <p id="b216-5" data-blocks='[["BL_216.7",216,[253,1533,1147,472]]]'>The position of the Commonwealth is unrealistic and unsupportable. Its weakness is that it fails to give adequate consideration to the physical and practical circumstance that only by transmission of the energy to and through the meter is the gas or electricity actually made available for the customer’s use in the only legally permitted way. It is only in metered form that appellants may furnish and the customer may utilize this service.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>
