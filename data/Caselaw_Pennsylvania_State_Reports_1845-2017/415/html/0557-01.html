Tbe relevant reason and basis for this Court’s reversal in tbe <em>Pascarella </em>case is contained in tbe Opinion of the Court (page 20) : “'There was no evidence definitely or even by inference pointing to tbe fact that tbe bulldozer or equipment of S. A. Whitney &amp; Company caused tbe injury to tbe building. In fact, tbe direct evidence was that it [tbe damage to tbe Hotel] was caused by Coleman’s bulldozer . . . .”</p>

    <p id="b659-8" data-blocks='[["BL_659.8",659,[126,1720,1149,420]]]'>Tbe crucial issue in this case is whether the Resolution of tbe City of Bradford is a contract of indemnity against liability or a contract of indemnity against loss. Tbe lower Court held, and we agree, that <em>it was a contract of indemnity against loss, </em>and since no loss has been suffered by Coleman, no recovery can be bad by him under tbe indemnity contract given by tbe City of Bradford to tbe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>

In 16 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of L. (2d ed.) 178, the rule is thus stated, <em>“where the contract is strictly one of indemnity the indemnitee cannot recover until he has suffered actual loss or damage; </em>the mere incurring of liability gives him no such right; but where the contract is to protect against liability, the indemnitee may recover as soon as his liability has become fixed and established, even though he has sustained no actual loss or damage at the time he seeks to recover.” ’ ”</p>
