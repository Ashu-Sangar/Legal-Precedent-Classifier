First, since the court below took no additional testimony, our scope of review is to determine whether the Board committed a manifest abuse of discretion or an error of law: <em>Brennen v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/409/0376-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="409 Pa. 376" data-case-ids="1883219" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0376-01">409 Pa. 376</a>, 379, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.2d%20180" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="187 A.2d 180">187 A. 2d 180</a>; <em>Crafton Borough, Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/409/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="409 Pa. 82" data-case-ids="1883277" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0082-01">409 Pa. 82</a>, 85, 86, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.2d%20533" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="185 A.2d 533">185 A. 2d 533</a>. Second, the Board’s power to grant a variance from a zoning ordinance “is to be sparingly exercised and only under peculiar and exceptional circumstances”: <em>Sgarlat v. Kingston Borough, Bd. of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/407/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="407 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1307430" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0324-01">407 Pa. 324</a>, 330, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.2d%20769" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="180 A.2d 769">180 A. 2d 769</a>; <em>Cresko Zoning Case, </em><a href="/pa/400/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="400 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1292521" data-case-paths="/pa/400/0467-01">400 Pa. 467</a>, 471, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.2d%20219" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="162 A.2d 219">162 A. 2d </a><a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a><a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.2d%20219" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="162 A.2d 219">219</a>. Third, in order “to obtain a variance the law is well settled that a <em>petitioner must prove </em>(1) the variance will not be contrary to the public interest; and (2) <em>unnecessary </em>hardship will result if it is not granted” : <em>Silverco, Inc. v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/379/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="379 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1253588" data-case-paths="/pa/379/0497-01">379 Pa. 497</a>, 503, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.2d%20147" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="109 A.2d 147">109 A. 2d 147</a>, and cases therein cited. Fourth, a variance should be granted, assuming it is not contrary to the public interest, only “where the property involved is subjected to an unnecessary hardship unique or peculiar to itself, and not to general conditions in the neighborhood which may reflect the unreasonableness of the zoning ordinance”: <em>Magrann v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/404/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="404 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1301500" data-case-paths="/pa/404/0198-01">404 Pa. 198</a>, 200, <a href="/citations/?q=170%20A.2d%20553" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="170 A.2d 553">170 A. 2d 553</a>. Fifth, a rezoning cannot be accomplished under the guise of a variance: <em>Richman v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/391/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="391 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="1276863" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0254-01">391 Pa. 254</a>, 259, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.2d%20280" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="137 A.2d 280">137 A. 2d 280</a>. Lastly, one who seeks a variance cannot be heard to complain of a hardship involved when the same condition was present to his knowledge when he purchased the property: <em>Upper St. Clair Twp. Grange Zoning Case, </em><a href="/pa/397/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="397 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1286254" data-case-paths="/pa/397/0067-01">397 Pa. 67</a>, 71, 72, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.2d%20768" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="152 A.2d 768">152 A. 2d 768</a>; <em>Cresko Zoning Case, </em>supra, 472.</p>
    <p id="b386-5" data-blocks='[["BL_386.5",386,[223,1478,1152,849]]]'>The land upon which Fidelity desires to construct a branch bank has been for many years zoned “R-4”, i.e., a residential area in which the land uses are single family dwellings, a municipal building and a telephone control office. <em>If allowed by the Board as special exceptions, </em>other uses in an “R-4” area are agriculture, a nursery, a greenhouse, the keeping and raising of livestock, a club, a fraternity house, a lodge, a hospital or sanitarium as well as religious, educational or philanthropic purposes. Moreover, certain so-called “accessory uses” are permitted, <em>by way of special exceptions, </em>such as a “professional office or studio” of members of certain specified professions, provided that such uses are carried on “by members of the family in rooms which are located in a dwelling in which the petitioner resides”.</p>

While two blocks to the north of County Line Road is the Rosemont Station of the Pennsylvania Railroad and a bloek away are a diner and two gasoline stations, our examination of the record leads us to agree with the court below that the use of the property as a branch bank “would constitute the first commercial inroad into this particular section of Radnor Township.”</p>

Such finding does not, however, command the grant of a variance, even if the public interest would not thereby be adversely affected. As a general rule, if the land, as a practical matter, cannot be utilized for residential purposes, then the land should be rezoned by an appeal to the legislative body. Such rezoning cannot and must not be accomplished under the guise of a variance.</p>

Examining the record before this Board it is clear beyond question that, when Fidelity purchased this land, the land was zoned residential, that such fact was known to Fidelity and that, despite such knowledge and with its eyes open, Fidelity purchased this land. Under such circumstances Fidelity is in no position to claim an “unnecessary hardship”. Our case law on this subject could not be <em>more </em>clear.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The Board stated: “The fact that [Fidelity] purchased the property when it already was in this predicament is irrelevant.” The Board, in so finding, completely ignored the law and, in so doing, committed an error, of law for which its decision must be reversed. Fidelity’s knowledge of the zoning restriction of the use of this land when it purchased it bars effectively the requested variance.</p>
