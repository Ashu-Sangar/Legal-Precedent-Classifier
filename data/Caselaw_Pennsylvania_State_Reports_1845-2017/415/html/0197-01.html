Shoyer, being of the opinion that the appeal raised substantial issues of fact, impaneled a jury to hear and determine the several issues. After taking voluminous testimony, two issues were presented for determination by the jury: (1) was decedent at the time of the execution of the disputed writing of May 16, 1961, a person of sound mind? and (2) was the disputed writing of May 16, 1961, procured by undue influence, duress or constraint practiced upon the decedent by Weissman or others on his behalf? The jury answered both questions in the affirmative, i.e., that decedent on May 16, 1961, was a person of sound mind but that the will had been procured by the exercise of undue influence. The chancellor entered a decree which affirmed the jury’s verdict and invalidated the will. The court en banc, expressly joined in by the chancellor, however, modified the chancellor’s decree by setting aside the will <em>both </em>on the ground that decedent was not of sound mind and that the will was procured by undue influence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Prom that decree this appeal has been taken.</p>

We have read and carefully considered <em>all </em>the evidence, that of proponent-appellants as well as contestant-appellees; in so doing, we have been mindful wherein the burden of proof rested, of the fact that opinion evidence carries little weight, of the importance to be attached to the testimony of the scrivener and the subscribing witnesses and all the other rules enunciated in our case law as guiding principles in this area of the law. It will serve no useful purpose to recite the evidence as presented, either at length or eapsulized. It is sufficient to state that our examination and scrutiny of this record leads us to thoroughly agree with the final conclusion reached in the court below that the alleged will must be invalidated both on the ground that decedent on May 16, 1961, did not possess testamentary capacity as well as on the ground that the writing of May 16, 1961, was procured by the exertion upon decedent of undue influence by Weissman, who then occupied a confidential relationship to decedent. Such conclusion is bottomed not upon conjecture, surmise or suspicion but upon evidence clear and convincing in <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>its nature. The evidence on this record irresistibly commands the invalidation of this will, and we sustain the court below in arriving at such result.</p>

At the outset of the hearings and now, the proponent-appellants contend that <em>all </em>the judges of the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County were disqualified to hear and determine this matter and that a judge from outside Philadelphia County should have been designated to try this cause. The background for this contention is that Philip Klein, a brother of President Judge Charles Klein of the Orphans’ Court, had acted as counsel for the decedent for a brief period of time prior to May 16, 1961, that he had consulted with the decedent about making a will, that such representation of the decedent was <em>at Weissman’s suggestion and request, </em>that he, in company with Weissman, examined, under a restricted power of attorney, the contents of one safe deposit box of decedent and that later, upon learning that Weiss-man alone had examined the contents of another safe deposit box and that decedent, contrary to her expressed instructions to Philip Klein, desired to leave her entire estate to the Weissmans, Philip Klein, suspicious that all was not proper, withdrew from the matter. Suspicious that something untoward was about to take place, Attorney Klein brought the matter to the attention of President Judge Klein. Moreover, while still representing decedent, Philip Klein asked Attorney Tawresey, who for a number of years had been a law clerk of the Orphans’ Court and was then an “examiner” for the court, to accompany him to see the decedent and Attorney Tawresey acquiesced in such request and did visit decedent with Philip Klein. It is to be noted that Attorney Tawresey’s visit to decedent was at Philip Klein’s request and not, as appellants suggest, by reason of any impulsion on the part of the court or any member thereof. Upon <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>such a background it is urged that <em>all </em>the judges of the court became disqualified to sit and determine this cause.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> This contention is clearly without merit. There is not a scintilla of evidence that any member of the court had any interest whatsoever in this matter. Simply because the suspicion of a member of the bar was reported to the court and that an employee of the court had some knowledge of the matter did not per se disqualify the members of the court. The presence of Attorney Tawresey at the hospital with Philip Klein was not in an official capacity nor as a representative of the court. The disqualification of all the judges was not called under the circumstances herein presented.</p>

We have carefully examined those portions of the record which reflect the chancellor’s actions in this respect and we are satisfied that, under the circumstances in this case, the chancellor did not err. Even so, if appellants’ position is correct, a new trial should follow but appellants forget that any verdict by a jury in this area of the law is advisory and not binding on the court and, if error was committed, it was ultimately for the court, not the jury, to resolve this matter.</p>

The chancellor, although requested, refused to permit the jury to be polled.</p>
