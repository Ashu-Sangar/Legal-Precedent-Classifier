He was convicted on all four indictments and sentenced to the Eastern State Correctional Institution for an indeterminate term of from five to ten years.</p>
    <p id="b165-7" data-blocks='[["BL_165.13",165,[156,1489,1148,152]]]'>An appeal was timely filed to the Superior Court, pro personam, which was eventually quashed because of failure to properly perfect it.</p>
    <p id="b165-8" data-blocks='[["BL_165.14",165,[155,1653,1149,306]]]'>Subsequently, a petition for habeas corpus was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County which was dismissed.

The single legal question in issue is whether or not he understandingly and intelligently waived his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel. We conclude that he did not.</p>

When the case was called for trial, <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>a representative of the Philadelphia Defenders’ Office appeared on behalf of Me Warren, but declined to represent McCray because he believed a conflict in interest existed. The assistant district attorney then questioned McCray as follows: “Q. McCray, stand up. Do you have a lawyer? A. No, sir. Q. Can you afford a lawyer? A. I have tried unsuccessfully to retain counsel. I was talking to Mr. Cain. However, since it is listed for this morning, I am willing to go along with it for trial to be disposed of, sir.”</p>
    <p id="b166-4" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[227,870,1145,149]]]'>The court then entered the discussion with a single question: “Q. You are willing to proceed without an attorney? A. Yes, sir.”</p>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.6",166,[225,1030,1146,365]]]'>The trial, without more, then proceeded with McWarren’s counsel attempting to prove that the crimes involved, if committed, were the acts of McCray. The sole factual witness for the prosecution was the victim, a fifteen-year old girl, who had given birth to a child out of wedlock some months before. Both defendants were found guilty.</p>

    <p id="b167-3" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[138,566,1149,1297]]]'>However, the Supreme Court of the United States has also decided that counsel need not be forced upon a defendant and that, under appropriate circumstances, he may waive the right to be so represented. <em>Carter v.

However, for the waiver to be valid and effective, it must be the competent and intelligent act of the accused: <em>Johnson v.

In determining whether or not the right to the assistance of counsel is “intelligently” waived, all of the facts and circumstances of the particular case, including the background and conduct of the accused, must be examined and considered, <em>Johnson v.

    <p id="b168-4" data-blocks='[["BL_168.5",168,[234,715,1151,1265]]]'>In the present case, the crimes charged were of a very serious nature. The defendant McCray’s position was difficult even if properly represented. The possible defenses available were involved and in some instances highly technical. Despite this, the trial court made no attempt to acquaint him with an apprehension of the charges or the possible defenses thereto. He was not asked if he understood the substantial differences in the various indictments. The possibility of the defense of reputation for prior unchasity by the victim to the rape indictment was unmentioned. Likewise, the right to subpoena witnesses and the very important factor involving the possible effect of the adverse position of the co-defendant and his counsel were not alluded to. In fact, the trial court made no analysis at all. McCray was confronted, not only with the efforts of the district attorney to convict, but also the determination of counsel for the co-defendant to ¡dace the blame upon him. Under the circumstances, it is difficult to conclude that a fair hearing ensued or that an extremely important and fundamental right was intelligently forfeited. In any event, the trial court took no steps to make sure that the latter was the case.</p>
