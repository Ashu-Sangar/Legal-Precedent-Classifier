While we agree that distribution of an estate is exclusively in the orphans’ court, this rule has no application here for (1) the assets sought to be sold do not include estate assets but are all assets of the partnerships, and (2) the relief Martin and Sidney seek is not distribution of assets but dissolution and winding up of partnerships and an accounting of the surviving partners’ interests therein as well as that of the deceased partner.

UPA §§72(2) (a), (b), 72(2) (e). In addition, specific partnership property may not be made subject to attachment or levy for the individual debt of a partner although a partner’s judgment creditor may subject that partner’s share of profits to the lien of a charging order.

UPA §72(2)d. Further, where a partner dies and the business is continued without a settlement of accounts, as in the case at bar, the Act specifically limits the estate to (1) <em>ascertainment </em>of the <em>“value </em>of [decedent’s] interest<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> at the date of dissolution” and (2) <em>receipt </em>“as an ordinary creditor [of] an amouut equal to the <em>value </em>of [decedent’s] interest. . . .” UPA §104.

L. 512, as amended, §546, 20 P.S. §320.546. We do not agree. The application of that section of the Fiduciaries Act is specifically limited to “property belonging to the estate.” The above described nature of the subject matter of the proposed sale demonstrates that the Estate has no specific property interest therein. The subject matter of the proposed sale is the totality of the assets of the partnerships. The requirements of §546 of the Fiduciaries Act are therefore inapplicable.</p>

Appellant is further protected from abuse by his co-executors for they serve in two fiduciary capacities — first as partners under . UPA §54 and secondly as executors. Should the execution of the sale by the co-executors raise doubt as to the discharge of their fiduciary duties, the remedy of surcharge is available to appellant.</p>

Martin and Sidney are both plaintiffs and defendants — in the latter instance, in their capacity as co-executors. In an action which has been brought by them as partners or individually against themselves as co-executors, they are in effect suing themselves. In this action they seek the right to purchase the partnership assets <em>in their individual capacity. </em>There is an obvious and great conflict of interest in this proposed sale. While technically, no prior approval of the Orphans’ Court is necessary, and a sale could be set aside by appropriate proceedings in the Court of Common Pleas or a claim for surcharge could be presented in the Orphans’ Court if fraud or collusion occurred, I believe that these are not adequate remedies. The facts and circumstances are so very unusual that I believe it is equitable, wise and necessary to secure the prior approval of the Orphans’ Court to all the executors to bid and purchase the partnership assets <em>in their individual capacity, </em>even though the sale of partnership assets is conducted by and under the Order of the Court of Common Pleas, and even though eventually all of the fiduciaries will have to account in the Orphans’ Court for Abraham’s interest.</p>

Ellis on September 1, 1961, the partnerships which existed between him and his three sons (each partner having a 25% interest) were dissolved. Paragraph eleven of each of the complaints recognizes the termination of the partnerships by reason of the death of the co-partner. Dissolution of a partnership by death of a co-partner is the undisputed mandate of Section 31 of the Uniform Partnership Act, March 26, 1915, P. L. 18, 59 P.S. §93(4), which states: “Dissolution is caused <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>... by the death of any partner . . . .” The partnerships pleaded in the complaints already had been dissolved by operation of law. <em>Froess v.

They seek, rather, equity’s decree approving acquisitions by appellees of their deceased father’s interests in the partnerships. That this is the real substance of the complaints is made obvious by the requests that the sale of assets be limited to the parties holding partnership interests. Thus, appellees seek equity’s direction, and approval to limit the participants in the proposed transaction to themselves and appellant, their brother-co-fidú'ciary. While the propriety of granting this unusual request is not before us at this time, the request itself is evidence that what is primarily , sought is the purchase of decedent’s interests rather than the dissolution of the partner? ships.
