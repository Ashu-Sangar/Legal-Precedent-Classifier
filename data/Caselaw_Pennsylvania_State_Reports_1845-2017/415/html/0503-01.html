The first of these is that plaintiff manufactured evidence in order to show alleged payments on account of the option price. Disagreements arose between the parties concerning the exact amount which had been paid on the option agreements. Before this suit began, counsel for all concerned suggested that each compile a list showing what each believed the correct amounts to be.</p>

Their conclusion was that together they had paid $23,500 toward the contract purchase price. A second list prepared solely for Bennard estimated his individual share of the payments at $10,375. Similarly, defendant, in his handwriting, prepared his estimate and he indicat<a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>ed uncertainty over several of the items listed. Later, these lists were offered at trial for the convenience of counsel, the parties and, hopefully, the chancellor. They were not evidence and were never received by the court as evidence. The chancellor, upon a careful analysis of the entire record, made his own independent determination of what amounts had been paid.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> There is no indication whatever of willful falsification, and certainly defendant was not prejudiced by the court’s receipt of these suggested aids in view of the court’s conclusion that neither of the amounts estimated by Bennard and Merton were correct.</p>

This was one of the checks which the chancellor accepted as being a payment under the agreements. On direct examination, plaintiff admitted that he had placed the notation “Paid to date — $18,000.00 A.T. Co. Stock” on the check after it was returned to him. Plaintiff had the problem of reconstructing his payments once he was aware a dispute was in the offing. That he did not <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>make the notation in the first instance was a matter to be considered by tbe chancellor in weighing plaintiff’s credibility in the light of the total circumstances. Our examination of the record leads us to conclude, as did the chancellor, that the record fails to support the contention that plaintiff fraudulently reconstructed the payments.</p>

Plaintiff admitted this and contended he did so for the purpose &lt;5f insuring available copies of the material. Some of this data related to the present litigation, while other parts pertained to support proceedings which plaintiff’s mother, Edna, instituted against the defendant. These records were primarily material in this case as refutation of defendant’s contention that he was not competent at the time the option agreements were executed. Plaintiff assisted the defendant in many of his enterprises and he had access to substantial portions of his father’s files.</p>

Although plaintiff’s conduct was not entirely proper under the exist<a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>ing circumstances, it was not of such a nature as would require us to hold that the chancellor abused his broad discretionary power in finding that plaintiff’s conduct had no substantial bearing on the merits and on plaintiff’s ultimate right of recovery. It appears likely that the records were not privileged and could have been obtained by ordinary judicial process. This would have been the safest course for plaintiff to have pursued. However, his action in following a less proper route does not, of itself, amount to such inequitable conduct as would bar recovery.</p>

First, defendant distorts the record since plaintiff did not deny having received money from his father on this date; he indicated that he did not know whether he had or not. More importantly, nowhere does defendant relate this transaction to the facts of this case or the immediate issues involved. The point raised by defendant is devoid of materiality and does not constitute evidence of any fraud whatever.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

At trial, Bennard admitted that his co-plaintiff did not authorize him to execute the affidavit on his behalf, but that he did so on the advice of counsel who represented both him and his brother. Defendant now -contends that Bennard’s conduct in this regard renders his hands unclean. The court below attached no significance to this strained argument, nor do we.</p>
    <p id="b611-5" data-blocks='[["BL_611.6",611,[113,955,1158,795]]]'>Defendant’s second major argument is that the decree is invalid because a fatal variance exists between plaintiff’s proof and his complaint.
