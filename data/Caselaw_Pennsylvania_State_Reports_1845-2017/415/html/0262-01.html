Wallace Mathis, an employee of Kulzer, and the plaintiff in this case, was designated as foreman of the job. On the morning of April 9, 1957, he arrived at the plant of the steel company between 8 and 8:30 o’clock where he was met by a Kenneth Buffington, the defendant’s maintenance coordinator, who made all the arrangements to have Mathis and his materials come into the plant, and pointed out to him the places on the ridge of the roof where the ventilators were to be installed. There can be no doubt that while Wallace Mathis was on the defendant’s property the morning of April 9, 1957, he was there as a business visitor and that the Lukens Steel Company owed him the duty of reasonable care to make its premises safe for him and to give him adequate warning of any dangers known to it and unknown to Mathis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

From the eaves the roof on both sides sloped inwardly to a peak or ridge, the slope measuring 6 inches to the foot. About a foot inside the eaves, on the north slope of the roof, rose a series of 14 poles or wire towers, each 12 <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>feet 8 indies high, and each hearing two cross arms, the higher one holding in place three wires.</p>

He held in his hands two ropes. He succeeded in tying one of them around the upper cross arm and was about to fasten the other rope close by, when there shot through his body 13,200 volts of electricity.</p>

When Mathis was hit by the lightning bolts which shot from the wires, he was working in the explicit area in which he was to perform his duties. He was on land to which he had been brought by the defendant’s own employee. He was engaged in the very task he had come to fulfill, under some supervision of the defendant company.</p>

It was urged there, as here, that the plaintiff had no need to go to the roof of the transformer house and had he not done so, he would not have been injured. This Court said: “The defendant argues that there was no need for the plaintiff to go to the roof. The plaintiff was a seasoned structural iron worker and has explained why he made the trip in question. In the face of this explanation, which was fortified by other circumstances and accepted by the jury as reasonable, one cannot arbitrarily conclude that Cooper ascended to the roof for the purpose of obtaining fresh air . . . When a workman in the discharge of his duties proceeds from a place where it is necessary for him to be to another place where it is necessary for him to go, the law will not proclaim him guilty of contributory negligence <em>if he moves over a route unknown to him in the exercise of his normal faculties, to be </em>dangerous.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

He testified that in 1952 he had worked on the roof of this very building. Two other Kulzer employees testified to. having worked on the identical roof four or five years before, and one of them specified that he had hauled materials to the roof in approximately the same manner Mathis had attempted the operation. During one of these previous <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>jobs the block and tackle attachment had remained on the crossbar for some four weeks, so that the defendant could not help but know of the practice. The evidence on this point on the plaintiff’s side was not without contradiction, but the general picture which was created, negatived entirely any reasonable inference that the plaintiff, while engaged as a professional mechanic on this particular job, was a transgressor on the defendant’s property, or was ever so regarded by anyone.</p>
    <p id="b365-4" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[130,893,1151,579]]]'>No evidence was presented which could justify a reasonable conclusion that Mathis conducted himself as a trespasser. So long as a worker does not intentionally stray from the locus in quo of his assigned task and continues to employ his faculties and strength in the reasonable completion of that task, he may not be characterized a trespasser. A worker who dutifully attends to his job with his eyes always on the accomplishment of his mission may not be branded a trespasser if, in the fulfillment of his responsibilities, he errs in judgment.</p>

If, for instance, while Mathis was on the roof of the defendant’s building, he had suddenly decided to engage in a kite-flying diversion or had set off on an exploration in the eaves for birds’ nests, it could properly be argued that he had abandoned, at least temporarily, the purpose for which he was legally on the defendant’s premises and the jury could determine from the facts if from a business visitor he had metamorphosed himself into a trespasser. But to say that a workman, without deviation from his main task, and while doing the very job for which he was invited to be on the defendant’s premises, and without going be<a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>yond the physical limits of the area to which he has been invited, may become a trespasser is not only factually unrealistic in projection, but legally wrong. When the trial judge thus injected into his charge the proposition of trespass without any substance to support it, he rang a bell of misinstruction, whose discordant notes could not but have confused the jury as to the true issues in the lawsuit.</p>

It argues that the plaintiff could not help but see these signs and goes further with an assertion that since the plaintiff did not deny the existence of the signs, he in effect admitted their existence and posting. The plaintiff testified that he did not see such signs. It is not logical to maintain, as the defendant here insists, that the plaintiff’s statement he did not see the sign, when he was in a position to see it if it existed, is not a positive refutation of the statement that the sign was there.</p>

From this wholly noncommittal reply, the trial judge assumed that somehow Mathis was charged, through Travis, with knowledge of the 13,200-volt danger of the wire towers.

All the authorities agree that it is incumbent upon the owner of the premises upon which persons come by invitation, express or implied, to maintain such premises in a reasonably safe condition for the contemplated uses thereof and the purposes for which the invitation was extended.’ . . . An owner of a building owes no statutory duty to the employee of a contractor, in order to guard against injury to the employee, to instruct him as to the dangers of the employment, or to give him a reasonably safe place in which to work. While the owner in such case is required to use reasonable care to guard the employees against injury, he will not be liable where causes of the injury intervened which he neither did nor could expect . . . ‘An owner of a building is not liable for injuries to a servant or to a person lawfully upon his premises by reason of latent defects of which he was ignorant and which <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>could not have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable care and diligence.’ . . . ‘An occupier of premises owes to business invitees the affirmative duty of [exercising reasonable care in] keeping his premises reasonably safe, and of giving warning of any failure to maintain them in that condition.’ ”</p>

Routman warned one of his employees, Smith, of this danger and instructed him to turn off the gas while working in the vicinity of the heater. Smith repeated this instruction to his fellow-employee Engle and Engle replied: “Okay.” Engle did not, however, turn off the gas as he went into the danger zone and succumbed to contact with the deadly carbon monoxide. In his charge to the jury, the judge instructed them that there was a burden of proof on the part of the plaintiff to show “affirmatively” that the landowner “did <em>not </em>notify the contractor.” (Emphasis supplied) This Court affirmed the charge. We hereby repudiate it. The ruling implied in the charge would declare that if the injured person cannot show that the landowner did <em>not </em>notify the independent contractor of the danger on his property, the legal presumption would follow that the owner <em>did </em>notify the contractor. To place the burden of proof on a negative proposition of that sort on a person who in most cases cannot possibly know what transpired between two persons with whom he may not have had any contact whatsoever is a burden so excessive as to be unrealistic, unreasonable and unjust, and we hold that no such burden exists in the law.
