        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nThis appeal involves the validity of votes cast in Row C \u2014 which is miscalled by the appellant a \u201cblank\u201d row \u2014 on voting machines in 15 wards in Philadelphia. An analysis of the facts and the law, as well as the prior decisions of this Court require an affirmance of the Order of the lower Court. That Order affirmed a unanimous decision of the Board of Elections which held that votes in the so-called (but miscalled) blank Row C were invalid and void.\nThe Jamestown machine, which is involved in 13 wards, was set up as portrayed by the photographic exhibit of the voting machine which appears above and is made a part hereof.\nRow C (erroneously called by appellant \u201ca blank row\u201d) is the row here involved. Row 0 was marked on the left in relatively small capital letters \u201cspecial election\u201d, and in enormous capital letters \u201cREPUBLICAN\u201d. A long line was then drawn through the middle of this horizontal row with an arrow at the end pointing to a Republican candidate Edward IT. Rovner, with a pointer or lever over his name. A photograph of the pertinent parts of the voting machine is attached and made a part hereof as above mentioned, and clearly shows how to vote for a Democrat, if that was the voter\u2019s desire.\nSubsection (d) of Article XII, \u00a71216 of the Election Code (Act of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1333, 25 P.S. \u00a73056) provides as follows: \u201c(d) At primaries, he shall vote for each candidate individually by operating the key, handle, pointer or knob, upon or adjacent to which the name of such candidate is placed.\u201d\nIf there had been, on the part of any voter, the slightest doubt concerning (a) the set-up of the voting machine, or (b) the sample ballot, or (c) the way to vote for the candidate of his choice, he could lawfully and without the slightest difficulty have obtained assistance, explanation, directions and instructions. Subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a71216 of the Election Code pertinently provide as follows: \u201c(a) In districts in which voting machines are used, the election officers shall, with the aid of the diagram authorized by this act and the mechanically operated model, instruct each elector before he enters the voting machine booth regarding the operation of the machine, and shall give the elector opportunity personally to operate tlie model, (b) If any voter, after entering the voting machine booth and before the closing of such booth, shall ask for further instructions concerning the manner of voting, any one of the election officers may give him such instructions, . . . .\u201d\nFurthermore, every voter was entitled to a large sample ballot which informed him twice \u2014 not in confusing language, as appellant asserts, but in brief clear language, with a crystally clear picture or diagram\u2014 what a careful look at the voting machine would have rendered unnecessary, viz., to vote for a candidate of his choice he should \u201cturn down a pointer over the name of each candidate in your own party row\u201d\nWhether the instructions on the sample ballot were ambiguous and confusing as appellant contends, or were crystal clear as we assert, can be easily determined by reading it. It pertinently provides: \u201cGENERAL PRIMARY AND SPECIAL ELECTION, TUESDAY, APRIL 28, 1964 (large caps)\n\u201cinstructions to voter (Smaller caps)\n\u201c2nd. Turn down a pointer over the name of each candidate in your own party row that you wish to vote for, from this position >-....... \"\u25a0 v C to this position and leave it there.\n(You will note on the Ballot that the Republican Party occupies the first horizontal row, the Democratic Party the second horizontal row .... Just remember to turn down a pointer over the name of each candidate you wish to vote for . . . .)\u201d\nNotwithstanding all of the foregoing, and although these (Jamestown) voting machines have a lever (pointer) right over or above the name of each Republican candidate to pull down if the voter wishes to vote for a Republican, and a similar lever in the row right over or above the name of the Democratic candidate of his choice, if he wishes to vote for a Democrat, appellant contends that if a voter votes in a different party Row and in a different space his vote must nevertheless be counted \u2014 and it must be counted as if it were cast in the row and in the space and for the person whom the Court thinks the voter meant to vote for, but didn\u2019t. In every election there are always some or many ballots which are held to be void and thrown out and not counted. Appellant contends that there were nearly 6000 votes for the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate in 13 wards. Even if this be accurate, when broken down it amounts to less than 12 to a division and less than 7 to each voting machine used in the 13 wards.\nSome voters pulled down levers into the miscalled \u201cblank\u201d Row C \u2014 a Republican row \u2014 under three spaces in Row B (the row above C) where a Democrat\u2019s name appeared and some levers under five spaces in Row B, where no candidates\u2019 names appeared in Row B. These are the votes which are challenged in this appeal. No one knows or can determine \u2014 except by guessing, \u2014 whether such votes, or indeed any votes in the blank spaces in Republican Row C, represented (1) protest votes, or (2) non-partisan votes, or (3) Republican votes, or (4) Democratic votes, or (5) votes for Rovner, or (6) \u201cmistake\u201d votes; but in any event, they were illegally cast and were clearly and undoubtedly void votes! Moreover, there were several voting machines in which no votes were cast in Row B, but votes were cast in Rows A and C. This would indicate that these particular voting machines were used only by Republicans and Non-Partisans. Nevertheless, appellant contends that the votes of all Republicans and Democrats and Non-Partisan and protesting and mistaken voters which were cast in this Republican Row C, (1) were valid votes, and (2) were cast in favor of the Democratic candidate whose name, if any, appeared above or near these blank spaces in Republican Row C. If the pointers which were pulled down into Republican Row C under the name of Blatt or Roberts or Musmanno, represented valid votes for the nominee in Democratic Row B, Genevieve Blatt would have received 2,094 votes, David B. Roberts 181 votes, and Michael A. Musmanno 3,349 votes.\nWhat is the use of a State having election laws to govern an election, what is the use of having clearly marked voting machines, and rows on the voting machines which were clearly marked for a Republican pandidate and for a Democratic candidate, as well as clearly marked sample ballots, if a Court has the right and power \u2014 as appellant argues \u2014 to ignore and nullify all of these and substitute its \u201cguess\u201d as to whom a voter intended to vote for if he hadn\u2019t voted carelessly or hurriedly or absent-mindedly or stupidly or protestingly and illegally?\nFurthermore, appellant\u2019s contention not only ignores the clear language of the Act and the clear setup of the voting machine and the clear language of the sample ballots, but it also flies in the teeth of numerous prior decisions of this Court: Weber Appeal, 399 Pa. 37, 159 A. 2d 901; Pfaff v. Bacon, 249 Pa. 297, 95 A. 71; Rodgers Contested Election, 234 Pa. 512, 83 A. 476; Dailey\u2019s Appeal, 232 Pa. 540, 81 A. 655; Gulick Appeal, 192 Pa. 446, 43 A. 972; Newberry Township Election, 187 Pa. 297, 40 A. 822; Contested Election of Flynn, 181 Pa. 457, 37 A. 523; McCowin\u2019s Appeal (Little Beaver Township School Directors\u2019 Election), 165 Pa. 233, 30 A. 955; Lawlor's Contested Election, 180 Pa. 566, 37 A. 92; Redman\u2019s Election, 173 Pa. 59, 33 A. 703.\nThese cases in principle directly rule the instant case and require this Court to hold such votes to be void. For example, in Contested Election of Flynn, supra, the law required the ballot to be marked with an X opposite the name of the candidate for whom the voter wished to vote. One ballot was marked in the proper space but with a 1 instead of an X. Another ballot was marked with an X in the vacant square to the right of but below the name of the candidate. The third ballot was marked with a 1 on the line and in the square opposite a candidate\u2019s name and with an X in the vacant square below, viz.:\nNotwithstanding the fact that the voters\u2019 intention was clear, the Court voided all three ballots, thereby giving the election to the apparent loser, and said: . . On one of the ballots in question there is no mark in the square opposite the name of the candidate, but there is a cross mark (X) in the square below it. Not one of these ballots is marked according to law. In McCowin\u2019s Appeal, 165 Pa. 233, the present Chief Justice, after quoting from sections 14 and 22 of the act, said: \u2018The marking mentioned in the last quotation is applicable only to candidates whose names are printed in the official ballot. They cannot be legally voted for in any other way than by marking as specified in said section.\u2019 ... To hold that the ballots in question are valid is to set aside the plain provisions of the act prescribing the place and manner of \u2018marking,\u2019 and to substitute therefor the surmises of the election officers and the courts respecting the intention of the voter.\n\u201cThe presumption is that the voter knows where and how to mark his ballot. He is furnished on his request with a card of instruction and a specimen ballot, and if by reason of any disability he desires assistance in the preparation of his ballot he is permitted to select a qualified elector of the district to aid him in the preparation of it. . . . For reasons already stated we decline to hold that the mark of a one (1) in the square provided for the cross mark, or a cross mark (X) in the square below it has the effect of a cross mark (X) in the proper place for it. It follows that the ballots in question should have been rejected as illegal.\u201d\nWeber Appeal, 399 Pa., supra, likewise controls in principle the instant case. Weber Appeal involved the validity of 16 stickers for a \u201cwrite-in\u201d candidate, because of the manner in which the stickers had been attached.\nChief Justice Jones, speaking for a unanimous Court, refused to permit the stickers attached to a card to be regarded as votes for the candidate whose name was on the stickers and pertinently said (page 44) : \u201cThe technicalities of the Election Law (and they are many) are necessary for the preservation of the secrecy and purity of the ballot and must, therefore, be meticulously observed. Thus it is, that any write-in or sticker which covers more of the ballot than the blank space provided therefor invalidates the vote for the office under which the write-in or sticker appears. See McCowin\u2019s Appeal and Lawlor\u2019s Appeal, supra. . . . A misplaced write-in or sticker, whether on a ballot or on a voting machine, is of no legal efficacy whatsoever. To hold otherwise would render facile the way to fraudulent voting and the thwarting of the electorate\u2019s will.\n\u201cWhat this court said in Rodgers\u2019 Contested Election, 234 Pa. 512, 519, 83 A. 476, is presently peculiarly apposite: While it may be that the Court in this instance correctly guessed the intention of the voter, yet the fifty-seven mutilated ballots were not marked in accordance with the instructions contained in the Act of Assembly, and under the well established doctrine in this State they should not have been counted; to permit the counting of such ballots would be a precedent fraught with grave dangers for the future.\u201d\nIn Peck v. Lackawanna County Board of Elections, 44 Lackawanna Jurist 97, Justice Eagen of this Court, then a Judge in Lackawanna County, said that votes cast on a voting machine row in exactly the same way as they were cast in the instant case would be invalid. That case involved a mandamus proceeding concerning the locking of a voting row, so that well intentioned votes which were carelessly or stupidly \u201clevered\u201d would not be invalidated.\nIn the course of his Opinion Judge Eagen said (page 98) : \u201cThe unfortunate and repeated occurrence of a candidate losing hundreds of votes intended for him by well intending voters pulling a lever over a blank space under his name will be corrected by the ballot label setup proposed for use in this election.\u201d\nThe only exceptions are two classes of cases, neither of which is applicable \u2014 (1) minor irregularities, es-specially if committed by election officials, and (2) cases where a voter voted correctly in the right row and in the right square and in the right space, but then added something which was surplusage.\nAppellant gives three major reasons to support its contention:\n(I) General expressions in Opinions in entirely inapposite cases about protecting the vote and the voter. Every Judge favors protecting the voter if. that can be done in accordance with the law. However, the generalized quotations which appear throughout appellant\u2019s brief appeared in cases which, we repeat, have no relevance and no pertinency to the questions here involved.\n(II) Appellant next relies upon Article XII, \u00a71216(d) of the Election Code of 1937, supra, which pertinently provides (as above noted) : \u201cAt primaries, he shall vote for each candidate individually by operating the key, handle, pointer or knob, upon or adjacent [not below, or in the row of the opposite party] to which the name of such candidate is placed.\u201d\nThe interpretation which appellant places upon the word \u201cadjacent\u201d would allow a voter to vote on one machine both \u201cupon\u201d and \u201cadjacent\u201d to a candidate, or \u201cupon\u201d or \u201cadjacent\u201d to a candidate. Furthermore, under appellant\u2019s theory, the word \u201cadjacent\u201d could mean (1) above, or (2) below, or (3) to the left, or (4) to the right, or (5) near to the candidate\u2019s name, which realistically is both impractical and absurd. Section (d) clearly and undoubtedly means that a particular voting machine can have a pointer or lever which can be pulled down upon the name of the candidate of his choice, viz., a Jamestown machine, or a different type of machine, viz., a Shoup machine which was used in a number of wards. The Shoup machine has a pointer or lever on the right side of the candidate\u2019s name (and can be pulled to the left and just beside the candidate\u2019s name) and consequently is adjacent to the name of the candidate. The Legislative Act is both clear and realistic. The word \u201cupon\u201d clearly covers and, we repeat, applies to the present Jamestown machine; the word \u201cadjacent\u201d would cover and apply to a different machine known as the Shoup machine, where the pointer and appropriate voting space is, we repeat, on the right of and next to the candidate\u2019s name.\n(Ill) The third reason urged by appellant is its desire to carry out the surmised intention of the voters and thus avoid \u201cdisfranchising\u201d many voters. Such alleged disfranchisement is more superficial than real. In the first place, if there was any disfranchisement the voters carelessly or unthinkingly disfranchised themselves. But even this alleged disfranchisement would apply only to a vote for a United States Senator; it does not affect or invalidate these voters\u2019 votes for other candidates on the ballot or on the loan question.\nThe test which appellant urges us to adopt \u2014 no matter how window-dressed or camouflaged, is a \u201cguess\u201d test \u2014 it isn\u2019t what the voter did that counts, its what the Court guesses he intended to do, but didn\u2019t. Such \u201cguess\u201d test would undoubtedly often produce confusion, uncertainty and interminable delay in election cases, thus jeopardizing a candidate\u2019s opportunity for successfully campaigning; it would multiply \u201celection litigation\u201d; and it would sometimes produce chaos in Government.\nAppellant attempts to justify its \u201cguess\u201d as to \u201cthe intention\u201d of the voters by citing several cases which state that ballots must not be \u201cthrown out\u201d, or \u201can election voided\u201d, or \u201cvoters disfranchised\u201d for \u201cmere minor irregularities\u201d or \u201ctechnical violations\u201d. Until this argument was urged upon the Court, no one ever dreamed that to vote Republican, intending to vote for a Democrat was \u201ca minor irregularity\u201d or \u201ca technical violation\u201d. In spite of the appellant\u2019s guess, a vote for a Republican, or a vote in a row clearly marked \u201cRepublican\u201d is not a vote for a Democrat!\nTo summarize: In order to reach its conclusion, appellant misinterprets or ignores (1) the clear (pertinent) election laws, and (2) the set-up of election machines which are clear to everyone except to a careless or an absent-minded or a hurried or an unthinking voter, and (3) the marked sample ballots which contain (a) very brief, clearly worded instructions, instructing a voter twice in clear, simple, brief language which lever to pull down in order to vote for the Democrat or Republican candidate of his choice, as well as (b) a crystally clear illustration, and (4) the words at the left end of Row (C) which state in small capital letters \u201cspecial election\" and in very large capital letters \u201cREPUBLICAN\u201d, and (5) the line through the middle of Row C, with an arrow at the right end where the name of the candidate, Edward H. Rovner, appears, and (6) many prior decisions of this Court which, we repeat, in principle directly rule the instant case. Furthermore, appellant has not been deprived of any right ordained or guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.\nFor each and all of these reasons, we affirm the Order of the Court below, which affirmed the unanimous decision of the Election Board.\nOrder affirmed.\nMr. Justice Eagen concurs in the result.\nMr. Justice Musmanno and Mr. Justice Cohen took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nComposed of two Democrats and one Republican.\nHerein called and referred to as a lever.\nItalics throughout, ours.\nIf the Election Board had had locked (or blocked off) at a cost of $3,000 the blank spaces on Row C, it would have prevented those controversial votes.\nJustice Cohen quoted the Weber decision with approval in a recent dissenting opinion in Reading Election Recount Case, 410 Pa. 62, 66, 188 A. 2d 254, saying on pages 68 and 69: \u201c. . . It is not important and of no great consequence that the government of the City of Beading may or may not be changed by the action of the majority \u2014 what is important and of great consequence is that our court has misread, misinterpreted and misapplied a clear legislative pronouncement. This is particularly true in the interpretation of the election laws which are basic to our democratic system. Hence, I am impelled to follow what Chief Justice Jones said in Weber Appeal, 399 Pa. 37, 44, 159 A. 2d 901, as recently as 1960: \u2018The technicalities of the Election Haw (and they are many) are necessary for the preservation of the secrecy and purity of the ballot and must, therefore, be meticulously observed.\u2019 \u201d",

        "text": "Concurring Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts:\nI join in the opinion of the Chief Justice. An examination of the record facts, particularly of the voting machines which were set up as illustrated in the diagram, which will be found in the reporter\u2019s statement of the case, convinces me of the correctness of the result here reached. However, I do feel that I must add these observations.\nThis opinion is in no way a reflection upon any of the litigants. It is rather an expression of regret for the unfortunate positions in which they have been placed by the inexcusable conduct of the County Board of Elections. Neither of the reasons offered by the Board for its failure to prepare properly the voting machines by locking levers over blank spaces in rows C and D, as legally commanded, even approaches an acceptable explanation. The Board improperly disregarded mandatory provisions of the Election Code and failed to perform clearly directed legal duties.\nIt is erroneous to assume that those voters who pulled levers in row C intended to vote for candidates whose names appeared above those levers but actually in row B. Such an assumption would be founded on nothing more than the exercise of retroactive clairvoyance as to what was intended on April 28 by 5,624 lever markings over blank spaces recorded on 908 voting machines in 512 election districts in 13 Philadelphia wards.\nIt is unmistakably evident from the ballot faces of the voting machines, as illustrated in the diagram, that votes for Democratic candidates whose names appear in the second horizontal row, marked \u201cB\u201d, may be recorded only by the operation of levers above their names, as the hand pointer in that row clearly indicates. Moreover, there runs through the center of the blanks in row C (and also D) a heavy black line from column 1 through column 39 where an arrow points to the special election in column 40.\nLikewise, the sample ballot contains four specific instructions which state with unmistakable clarity that to vote for a candidate, \u201cTurn down a pointer over the name of each candidate in your own party row that you wish to vote for.\u201d (Emphasis in the original.) This instruction also advises that \u201cthe Democratic Party\u201d occupies \u201cthe second horizontal row\u201d (here row B), and in at least two other places the voter is cautioned that he may vote only for candidates of his party in the primary.\nIt is an undisputed fact that levers in row C were operated in columns 1, 17, 18, 19 and others in which no names appeared either above in row B or below the levers in row C. Of particular interest is the use of columns 17, 18 and 19 in row C for the election of delegates to the Republican National Convention. If the \u201cvotes\u201d recorded in columns 2, 3 and 4 of row C were validly cast for candidates in row B, so also were the \u201cvotes\u201d in the remainder of row C, an obviously absurd conclusion.\nIt is conceded that all voters who entered the 908 voting machines in question could, irrespective of their party registrations, turn down levers in any of the columns in row C from column 1 through column 39 as well as the lever in column 40 for the special election. It is likewise undisputed that voters other than registered Democrats could and did operate levers in row C. It would be fallacious to assume that since more Democrats appeared at the polls than the total votes cast for all Democratic senatorial candidates in rows B and C (assuming that the votes in C were for those candidates), only registered Democrats operated levers in row C. Those voters who pulled levers in row C may have done so for the same reason as those Democrats (7,168) who failed or refused to vote for any of the senatorial candidates.\nNor can it be assumed that only registered Democrats voted in row C because it is unlawful to cross party lines in the primary, although the machines did not preclude such crossovers. It may just as easily be assumed that the Democratic voters who intended to vote for the candidates followed the explicit voting instructions and pulled levers only in row B. Otherwise, the Legislature engaged in meaningless enactments of precautionary requirements to prevent crossover voting. The Legislature would have needed only to rely on a presumption that no one acts or votes contrary to the instructions and the Election Code.\nTo hold that the votes cast below the names of the candidates are valid would require the interpretation of \u201cupon or adjacent\u201d in \u00a71216 (d) of the Election Code as \u201ceither upon or adjacent.\u201d Under such a view, voters would be given the choice of pulling down the lever over the candidate\u2019s name, as the instructions provide, or pulling down the lever under the name, as appellants would have us hold. Appellants contend that the levers in row C, with no names appearing below them, are \u201cadjacent\u201d to the names in row B and would have us credit row C candidates with votes both above and below their names. The appearance of names in row C below the levers in row C would not make those levers any less \u201cadjacent\u201d to the names in row B. Thus, the absurd situation would result that in a general election, for example, the candidate in row A might also claim votes cast below in row B as \u201cintended\u201d for his name in row A and \u201cadjacent\u201d to it.\nSome concern has been voiced that by not counting the markings over the blanks in columns 2, 3 and 4 in row C and by not attributing those votes to candidates whose names appear in row B, 5,624 voters will be disfranchised. The application of this kind of paternalism would ignore the fact that 24 out of every 25 voters who entered the voting booths in the districts in question voted correctly, regularly and in accordance with the instructions to voters. Also, no one knows who pulled the levers in row C, their party registrations, and the reasons for preferring to pull levers in row C rather than those in either rows A or B (it being admitted that all voters could operate levers in row C). Moreover, no one knows whether those who operated the levers in row C did so by mistake or by design, just as no one knows why 7,168 Democratic voters who entered the voting booths chose not to cast votes for any of the senatorial candidates.\nRealistically, those voters who pulled improper levers in row C, columns 2, 3 and 4, are no more disfranchised than those who operated levers in other columns in that row where there were no names above or below. Thus, the voter who undertook to operate levers contrary to instructions and to established custom or who chose not to pull any lever at all is no more entitled to have his \u201cvote\u201d counted than the voter who failed to appear at the polls.\nTo give so much weight to so conjectural an expression of a minute minority (less than one out of 25) indeed would be an extreme overemphasis of the possible disfranchisement of 5,624 voters to the utter disregard of the more than 120,000 voters (both Republican and Democratic) in these districts who voted properly and in accord with the instructions on use of voting machines. This becomes even more apparent in light of the more than 1,000,000 votes properly cast without irregularity in the Democratic primary throughout the state.\nFurthermore, it cannot truthfully be said that these 5,624 voters would be disfranchised since many may have voted correctly for other candidates, on the loan question, and in the special election.\nVoting machines have been used in this Commonwealth for more than thirty years in the conduct of thousands of local, state and national election contests. No one has ever successfully contended that levers in one row may be utilized to vote for candidates whose names appear in another row.\nUnder the circumstances here presented, our Court may not order row C \u201cvotes\u201d to be counted for candidates whose names appear in row B.\nNeither Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368, 83 S. Ct. 801 (1963), urged at argument, nor any earlier or more recent decision, compels, supports or even suggests a result contrary to that reached here. The Supreme Court did not say nor imply and surely did not intend that invalidly cast votes be counted under the doctrine of \u201cone man, one vote,\u201d or any other theory just as that Court would not demand that each voter who appeared at the polls cast a vote for each office.\nWe must not be misguided or misled by what is asserted to be possible disfranchisement of those relatively few voters who operated levers in a manner other than in accordance with the clear instructions and the election laws. Our concern must lie primarily with the preservation of the sanctity of the election process by giving effect to those votes properly cast. To do otherwise is to ignore the prescribed rules of the contest. Obviously, such action destroys not only the recognized machinery for expressing and recording the preference of voters but also imperils the whole orderly electoral process.\nAnother look at the diagram (of the face of the voting machine ballot) reinforces the correctness of the determinations of the Board and the court below. That additional look also further re-emphasizes the propriety and wisdom of affirmance here.\nThe initial reason given for the failure to block all levers in rows O and D except for those to be used in the special election was that the Board did not wish to spend the $3,000 such action would require. At oral argument, the Board asserted that it had attempted to obtain covers for those levers approximately ten days prior to the election but that the manufacturer could not supply them in time.\nIn those divisions where separate machines were used for the Republican and Democratic primaries, respectively, votes were cast beneath the names of the Democratic candidates for the Senate in row O on the Republican voting machines. The proportion of such votes in row 0 to the total Republican vote on these machines was approximately the same as the proportion of row O votes to total votes on machines used for both parties. It should also be noted that some \u201cvotes\u201d even appeared in columns 2, 3 and 4 of row D.\nIn the 15 wards in question (including two using the Shoup machines), 80,412 Democrats signed voters\u2019 certificates, whereas a total of only 73,244 levers were pulled down in both rows B and O combined in columns 2, 3 and 4. (Figures supplied by Democratic City Committee.)\nAn assumption that no crossovers took place is consistent with the \u201cunwise\u201d pre-election position of the Board of Elections that it would be unnecessary to lock rows C and D. However, following the election, the Board was satisfied that voters other than Democrats voted in row O and so found as a fact.\nEven more confusion and uncertainty would result in a primary election in which the number of candidates for any office requires more than one row for listing their names.\nThus, the suggested interpretation of \u201cupon or adjacent\u201d would render useless thousands of voting machines in the Commonwealth.\nMore than 120,000 voters appeared at the polls in the wards here involved.\nThe total of votes cast in columns 2, 3 and 4 of row O was much greater than the totals in columns further down the row.\nIn Application of Lester, 127 N.Y.S. 2d 272 (S. Ct. 1953), as in the instant case (except for the special election), the Republican candidates were on row A, Democratic candidates on row B, and no candidates on row O. There, as here, the law required that each lever on row O should be locked. In both cases, this was not done and constituted an absolute failure to perform a duty specifically commanded by statute. There, as here, when the machines were opened, it was found that some levers had been pulled in row C. It was maintained that since the votes cast in row O were in closest proximity to row B, it was to be inferred that those who pulled levers in row O did so with the intention of voting for the candidates in row B. The New York court rejected this contention, just as did the Philadelphia County Board of Elections, the court below, and now this Court. The New York court held that the inference there urged \u201c. . . is not the only inference to be drawn. No one knows what voters cast their votes on Bow C. If it were done by error, rather than by design, then not even the voters who did so, could now so state, since they are probably without knowledge that they did so. There is no way of telling whether those who cast their votes on Bow C did so designedly, because they had no intention of voting for either of the two major parties\u2019 nominees.\u201d Id. at 276.\nIn this proceeding no claim was made by a voter or litigant that any voter was denied the right to vote or refused the opportunity to cast his ballot. So, too, no federal question \u2014 constitutional or otherwise \u2014 was properly or precisely raised, submitted or argued in this appeal. The record fails to reveal the presence of any such question.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMe. Justice Jones:\nConvinced that the decision of the majority of this Court, which results in the disfranchisement of thousands of voters, is contrary both to law and common sense, I register my dissent.\nThe stated bases of the majority\u2019s ruling are: (1) the election law clearly proscribes the manner in which these disputed votes were cast; (2) the \u201cset-up of [the] voting machines\u201d was \u201cclear to everyone\u201d; (3) the \u201csample ballots\u201d [herein called by the statutory term \u201cspecimen ballots\u201d] were clearly worded and illustrated and they instructed the voters which lever to operate; (4) the words \u201cSpecial Election, REPUBLICAN\u201d to the left of Row C and the line drawn horizontally across Row C on the machines constituted clear instructions which were ignored by the voters; (5) the case law in this Commonwealth \u201cdirectly rule[s] the instant case\u201d. In this opinion, I shall endeavor to demonstrate \u2014 not in the same order \u2014 the infirmity of each and all the bases upon which the majority opinion rests.\nOn this appeal we are called upon to determine the validity of certain votes allegedly cast for certain candidates in thirteen wards of the City of Philadelphia at the primary election held on April 28, 1964.\nThe disputed votes were cast upon voting machines, not paper ballots. In tbe thirteen wards involved in this appeal a special election was conducted for representative in the U. S. Congress; by reason of that fact, two additional horizontal voting rows were added to each machine. The top row of each machine contained the designation of the various offices for which the electors were to select candidates, including that of representative in the U. S. Congress. The second row \u2014 Row A \u2014 at the extreme left whereof was the name \u201cRepublican\u201d \u2014 , contained the names of the Republican candidates for the various offices and within each ballot label thereon were a numeral or numerals and the name or names of the Republican candidate or candidates for the particular office. The third row \u2014 Row B \u2014 , at the extreme left whereof was the name \u201cDemocratic\u201d \u2014 -, contained the names of the Democratic candidates for the various offices and each ballot label thereon was arranged in the same manner as in Row A. The fourth row \u2014 Row C \u2014 , at the extreme left whereof appeared the words \u201cSpecial Election, REPUBLICAN\u201d, contained no names whatsoever, except that at the extreme right end thereof appeared the name of the Republican congressional candidate at the special election, and, across Row C, was an arrow which extended to the ballot label wherein appeared the name of the Republican congressional candidate. The fifth row \u2014 Row D \u2014 , at the extreme left whereof appeared the words \u201cSpecial Election, DEMOCRATIC\u201d, was similar in all respects to Row C, except that at the extreme right thereof appeared the name of the Democratic congressional candidate. Upon this appeal,- we are concerned only with the validity of the votes cast in Row C by the depression of the levers directly above Row C and below the names of the Democratic candidates in Row B, excluding, of course, votes cast in Row C for the Republican congressional candidate at the special election.\nBetween the top row and Row A and extending horizontally across the machine was a panel of levers marked \u201cA\u201d; between the second row- \u2014 Row A \u2014 and the third row \u2014 Row B \u2014 was another panel of levers marked \u201cB\u201d; between the third row \u2014 Row B \u2014 and the fourth row \u2014 Row C \u2014 was another panel of levers marked \u201cC\u201d. When a Republican voter entered the polling booth, the levers in panel \u201cA\u201d- \u2014 above the names of the Republican candidates \u2014 were unlocked and the levers in panel \u201cC\u201d \u2014 below the names of the Democratic candidates \u2014 were unlocked but the levers in panel \u201cB\u201d \u2014 below the names of the Republican candidates \u2014 were locked. When a Democratic voter entered the polling booth, both the levers in panel \u201cB\u201d \u2014 above the names of the Democratic candidates \u2014 and the levers in panel \u201cC\u201d \u2014 below the names of the Democratic candidates \u2014 were unlocked so that a Democratic voter could depress and operate either the levers above or below the Democratic candidates\u2019 names. However, no Democratic voter could vote more than once or for more than one candidate (where only one was to be nominated).\nThat which has given rise to this controversy is the undisputed fact that all the levers in the panel marked \u201cC\u201d were permitted to remain unlocked and susceptible of operation by the voters whereas only the lever in the panel marked \u201cC\u201d above the name of the Republican congressional candidate should have been permitted to remain unlocked. Complete responsibility for this improper condition of these voting machines must rest upon the City Board of Hlections [the Board], It is undisputed that the Democratic County Committee (the present appellant), prior to the date of the primary election, advised the Board of the improper condition of these machines and requested the Board to lock the levers in panel \u201cC\u201d, except as to the Republican congressional candidate. The Board refused tbe committee\u2019s request and, as the court below sagely observed, \u201c[t]hat was not a wise decision\u201d.\nAfter the election was held and the votes canvassed, it was then discovered that, in the thirteen wards involved in this appeal, 5624 voters had cast votes in Row C by the depression of the unlocked levers in panel \u201cC\u201d directly below the names of the Democratic candidates for the U. S. Senate listed in Row B. The Board, inter alia, refused to count and credit such votes. An appeal was taken by the committee to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County and that court upheld the action of the Board. Prom that order, the present appeal was taken.\nThe rationale of the court below, adopted in large part by the majority opinion, was: (a) that the failure of the voters to indicate their choice in accordance With the election statute rendered void their votes; (b) in reliance on Contested Election of Flynn, 181 Pa. 457, 37 A. 523, that \u201cneither our courts nor our election officers are permitted to surmise the intention of the voters, and '[that] an elector\u2019s non-compliance with proper voting procedure is in\u00e9xcusable\u201d; (c) that the depression of a lever above a blank space on Row C constituted an inexcusable noncompliance with statutorily-required voting procedure on the part of tlie voters; (d) that the attempted vote in a blank space on Row C constituted a nullity.\nAt the outset, reference must be made to the respective positions taken by the Committee and appellee. The Committee contends: (1) that the intent of the voters, if it can be ascertained, should control, that it is to be presumed that a vote is validly cast and that the disfranchisement of voters should not be permitted because of minor irregularities or technical violations of the election procedures; (2) that the intent of the voters who depressed the levers in panel \u201cC\u201d is clear, i.e., to vote for the particular candidates whose names appeared directly above the levers; (3) that, in ascertaining the intent of the voters, consideration must be given to the fact that the voting took place on complicated voting machines upon which, through the election officials\u2019 inaction, a condition had been permitted to exist whereby the voters could depress either the levers in panel \u201cB\u201d or panel \u201cC\u201d, and, under such circumstances, courts and canvassing boards should exercise great liberality in determining the validity of votes cast in Row C; (4) in the absence of evidence to the contrary and in view of the presumption that voters vote legally, the votes cast by the depression of the levers in panel \u201cC\u201d must be regarded as having been cast by Democratic voters rather than by \u201ccrossover\u201d Republican and Non-Partisan voters. Appellee takes the position: (1) that the votes recorded in Row C are void because they were not recorded in the proper voting space; (2) that the case law, cited by the Committee, is inapposite because such case law dealt with votes cast in the proper voting space whereas in the case at bar the votes were cast in an improper space; (3) that the depression of the levers on the blank spaces in Row C constituted an \u201cinexcusable noncompliance\u201d with proper voting procedures; (4) that the record indicates \u201ccross-over\u201d voting by Republican and Non-Partisan voters whose votes cannot be segregated from votes cast by Democratic voters and, therefore, all the votes cast in Row C must be declared void.\nCertain matters are beyond question. First, there is neither allegation nor proof of any fraud on the part of the voters, the election officials, or anyone else. Second, this controversy would not be before us were it not for the impact of the validity of these votes on the contest for the Democratic nomination for the U. S. Senate. Third, a proper setup of the voting machines would have insured that the levers in panel \u201cC\u201d were locked and placed in a condition wherein they could not have been depressed and the sole responsibility for this improper setup of the machine rests with the Board. Fourth, the votes recorded in Row C were made by voters who depressed the levers in panel \u201cC\u201d. Fifth, the total number of votes in Rows B and C in the Democratic senatorial contest was considerably less than the total number of Democratic voters who entered the voting booths, i.e., those voters who signed the requisite affidavits and voted. Lastly, an examination of the face of the voting machines, with particular reference to the ballot label wherein the names of the Democratic senatorial candidates appeared, indicates that the upper levers \u2014 those in panel \u201cB\u201d\u2014 and the lower levers \u2014 -those in panel \u201cC\u201d \u2014 were equidistant vertically from the names of the respective candidates and in exact juxtaposition horizontally to such names.\nInitially, we must inquire whether the operation by the voters of the levers in panel \u201cC\u201d, directly below the candidates\u2019 names, violated the election statute and to that end we must examine the election statute to ascertain how a voter must vote on a voting machine.\nSection .1216 of the Election Code purports to answer that question, its heading being \u201cInstructions of voters and manner of voting, in districts in which voting machines are used.\u201d Section 1216(a) provides for the instruction of electors by the election officials \u201cwith the aid of the diagrams authorized by [the] act and the mechanically operated model.\u201d Section 1216(d) provides the manner of voting on a voting machine at a primary election: \u201cAt primaries, he [the voter] shall vote for each candidate individually by operating the key, handle, pointer or knob, upon or adjacent to which the name of such candidate is placed.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). In construing \u00a71216(d), we must recall that which this Court said in Independence Paidy Nomination, 208 Pa. 108, 112, 57 A. 344: \u201cThe constitution confers the right of suffrage on every citizen possessing the qualifications named in that instrument. It is an individual right and each elector is entitled to express his own individual will in his own way. His right cannot be denied, qualified or restricted, and is only subject to such regulation as to the manner of exercise, as is necessary for the peaceable and orderly exercise of the same right in other electors. The constitution itself regulates the times and in a general way the method, to wit: by ballot, with certain specified directions as to receiving and recording it. Beyond this the legislature has the power to regulate the details of place, time, manner, etc., in the general interest for the due and orderly exercise of the franchise by all electors alike. Legislative regulation has been sustained on this ground alone: [citing a case]. Anything beyond this is not regulation but unconstitutional restriction. It is never to be overlooked therefore that the requirement of the use of an official ballot is a questionable exercise of legislative power and even in the most favorable view treads closely on the border of a void interference with the individual elector. Every doubt, therefore, in the construction of the statute must be resolved in favor of the elector\u201d. (Emphasis supplied).\nThe approach to a construction of \u00a71216 (d) of the Election Code must begin with an examination of our statutory law, past and present, prescribing the manner in which an elector must cast his vote for a candidate whose name appears on the ballot. It must be noted, of course, that until the passage of the Voting Machine Law of 1929 (Act of April 18, 1929, P. L. 549), all voting was by paper ballot and, therefore, the pre-1929 statutory law referred only to voting by such method.\nSection 14 of the Act of 1893 (Act of June 10, 1893, P. L. 419) provided, inter alia, that the ballot should \u201cbe so printed as to give to each voter a clear opportunity to designate his choice of candidates by a cross-mark (x) in a square of sufficient sise at the right of the name of each candidate and inside the Une enclosing the column\u201d (emphasis supplied), and \u00a722 of that act provided, inter alia, that the voter should prepare Ms ballot by placing \u201ca cross (x) ... opposite the name of the candidate of bis choice for each other office to be filled, according to the number of persons to be voted for by him for each office, . . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied). This act clearly indicated how and where on the ballot the voter must cast his vote, i.e., the voter was required to place a cross (x) in a square to the right of and opposite the name of the candidate of his choice.\nSections 1J and 22 of the 1893 statute were amended by the Act of 1903 (Act of April 29, 1903, P. L. 338). However, that statute, insofar as presently pertinent, did not change the manner of casting a vote as required by the 1893 statute.\nIn 1919, the legislature again amended \u00a722 of the 1893 statute: Act of July 9, 1919, P. L. 829. As this Court said: \u201cThis amendment of 1919 was enacted to give effect more adequately to the intent of the voter; it is remedial in purpose and should be liberally construed to the end intended.\u201d: Gegg\u2019s Election, 281 Pa. 155, 160, 126 A. 260. So far as presently pertinent, the 1919 statute provided that a voter \u201cmay . . . make a cross-mark in the square to the right of any individual candidate whom he favors\u201d and, where more than one candidate is to be elected to any office, \u201cthe voter shall, if he desires to divide his vote among candidates of different parties, make a cross (x) mark in the appropriate square, to the right of each candidate for whom he desires to vote . . .\u201d The pertinent sections of the 1893 statute were finally repealed by the Election Code of 1937 and \u00a71215 (b) thereof now provides the manner of voting on paper ballots, i.e., that a voter, at a primary election, \u201cshall vote for the candidates of his choice for nomination or election, ... by making a cross (X) or check (V) mark in the square opposite the name of the candidate. ...\u201d\nSuch examination of our statutory law, past and present, on the manner of voting by the use of paper ballots indicates beyond question that the legislature clearly directed both how a voter should vote, i.e., originally by a cross, but now by a cross or check, and where such vote should be marked, i.e., in the square opposite the candidate\u2019s name, etc. Therefore, in considering our case law dealing with irregularities in the manner of voting on paper ballots, it must be kept in mind that the legislature has always clearly declared both how and where votes on paper ballots must be cast.\nHowever, an examination of the legislative direction as to the manner of voting on voting machines reveals an entirely different situation. In making this examination it must be noted that voting machines, whether the rows thereon be arranged vertically or horizontally, contain \u201cballot labels\u201d, i.e., \u201cthe cards, papers or other material, containing the names of offices and candidates . . .\u201d (Election Code of 1937, \u00a71101, 25 P.S. \u00a73001), and these \u201cballot labels\u201d are comparable to the squares on the paper ballots.\nThe Voting Machine Act of 1929, now repealed by the Election Code of 1937, was silent on the manner of voting a ballot on a voting machine. At the present time the manner of voting on voting machines is governed, insofar as primary elections are concerned, by \u00a71216(d) of the Election Code (25 P.S. \u00a73056) which, I repeat, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAt primaries, he [the voter] shall vote for each candidate individually by operating the key, handle, pointer or knob, upon or adjacent to which the name of such candidate is placed.\u201d That provision clearly states how the voter shall vote, i.e., by operating the lever, but does it provide with any degree of clarity where or by which lever the voter shall vote? The phrase \u201cupon or adjacent to which the name of such candidate is placed\u201d is clearly adjectival in nature, descriptive of the lever which the voter shall operate and limits and restricts the voter to that lever which is \u201cupon or adjacent to\u201d the candidate\u2019s name. The Avord \u201cor\u201d is used as a disjunctive particle that marks an alternative and differentiates between that lever which is \u201cupon\u201d and that lever which is \u201cadjacent to\u201d. The use of the word \u201cor\u201d together with the fact that \u201cupon\u201d and \u201cadjacent\u201d are not only not synonymous but differ in meaning point to a possible legislative intent that either one of two levers may be operated by the voter, i.e., that lever \u201cupon . . . which the name of [the] candidate is placed\u201d or that lever \u201cadjacent to which the name of [the] candidate is placed.\u201d In my opinion, the legislative description of the lever to be operated by the voter is vague, uncertain and ambiguous. From the language employed it is arguable that \u201cupon\u201d refers to the lever directly above the name of the candidate and that \u201cadjacent\u201d refers either to the lever below or the lever above the name of the candidate because both levers are \u201cadjacent\u201d to the candidate\u2019s name. This loosely and carelessly drawn piece of legislation is not only uncertain and ambiguous but confusing. At best, the legislative direction in \u00a71216 (d) is doubtful and, in such event, the statute must be construed in the manner most favorable to the voter: Independence Party Nomination, supra. In view of the uncertain and dubious language of the statute, how can we now hold that the operation of the lower levers in panel \u201cC\u201d, even though such operation recorded the votes in the blank spaces on Row C, constituted a clear violation of, or a clear noncompliance with, the language of \u00a71216(d) of the Election Code so as to justify the disfranchisement of upwards of 5000 voters?\nMoreover, even the most cursory comparison of the several statutes, past and present, prescribing the manner of voting on paper ballots with the statutory provision prescribing the manner of voting on voting machines reveals that the case law on paper ballots and irregularities in voting thereon cannot be considered as precedents in determining the manner of voting on voting machines and irregularities in such voting.\nHowever, assuming, arguendo, that the operation of the levers in panel \u201cC\u201d was a technical noncompliance with \u00a71216(d) and assuming that the intent of those who so operated the levers can be ascertained, does the fact of such technical noncompliance with the statute per se invalidate these votes? The court below and the majority of this Court equate noncompliance with the election statute with invalidity of the votes, regardless of the intent of the voters; in so doing, in my opinion, they err.\nFrom 1893 until the passage of the 1919 statute our courts did maintain a rigid and unbending rule which, in effect, rendered invalid any votes cast which were not in strict and literal compliance with the statute, regardless of whether the intent of the voter could be ascertained from the ballot: McCowin\u2019s Appeal, supra; Redman\u2019s Election, supra; Contested Election of Flynn, supra; Newberry Township Election, supra; Dailey\u2019s Appeal, supra; Rodgers\u2019 Contested Election, supra. The rigidity of such a rule is particularly difficult to understand since \u00a727 of the 1903 statute, at least impliedly, granted recognition and consideration to the ascertainment of the voter\u2019s intent.\nHowever, since the passage of the 1919 statute this Court properly has been more liberal and has given recognition and weight to the intent of the voter, once ascertained. In Knight v. Coudersport Borough, 246 Pa. 284, 289, 92 A. 299, we approved that which was said in Black on Interpretation of Laws: \u201cIf the law itself declares a specified irregularity to be fatal, the courts will follow that command, irrespective of their views of the importance of the requirement. In the absence of such declaration, the judiciary endeavor, as best they may, to discern whether the deviation from the prescribed forms of law had or had not so vital an influence on the proceedings as probably prevented a free and full expression of the popular will. If it had, the irregularity is held to vitiate the entire return; otherwise, it is considered immaterial.\u201d See also: Fish\u2019s Election, 273 Pa. 410, 117 A. 85; Gegg\u2019s Election, supra. The attitude of our Court in this area of the law, in recent times, has been well epitomized in Norwood Election Contest Case, 382 Pa. 547, 552, 116 A. 2d 552: \u201cEvery rationalization within the realm of common sense should aim at saving the ballot rather than voiding it.\u201d In McCracken Appeal, 370 Pa. 562, 566, 88 A. 2d 787, we said: \u201cIn any disputed election, nothing can be more vital towards the accomplishment of an honest and just selection than the ascertainment of the intention of the voter.\u201d See also: James Appeal, 377 Pa. 405, 408, 105 A. 2d 64; Reading Election Recount Case, 410 Pa. 62, 66, 188 A. 2d 254. If, from the ballot cast, the intent of the voter in his choice of a candidate for office can be ascertained, then such ascertained intent must be granted full recognition and the ballot counted, even though there be a technical noncompliance with the election statute. See: Arnold Borough Contested Election, 307 Pa. 536, 161 A. 536.\nWhat was the intent of the voters who operated the levers in panel \u201cC\u201d? In my opinion, such intent was to vote for the Democratic senatorial candidates whose names appeared directly above the levers operated. When a voter depressed the lever in panel \u201cC\u201d directly below the name of Genevieve Blatt, he intended to vote for Miss Blatt; likewise, as to those voters who depressed the levers directly under or below the names of David Roberts and Michael Musmanno. In Peck v. Lackawanna County Board of Elections, 44 Lack. Jurist, 97, Judge (now Mr. Justice) Eagen fully recognized that such was the intent on the part of voters pulling a lever under the name of a candidate. As a matter of fact, the court in Application of Lester, 127 N.Y.S. 2d 272, so heavily relied on by appellee, conceded that \u201cpractical experience has demonstrated that there may be much force in [the] argument\u201d that those who cast their votes in Eow C of a voting machine do so in error by pulling the lever below rather than that above the candidate\u2019s name, at the time intending to vote for such candidate.\nThe majority opinion, labeling the finding of the voters\u2019 intent as a \u201cguess\u201d, concludes that such a \u201cguess\u201d as to intent, if permitted to stand, would occasion dire results perhaps even \u201cchaos\u201d in government. With that I thoroughly disagree. In many areas of the law courts must and do ascertain, from language and/or conduct, the intent of an individual. As an example, time and again we have said that, in the construction of wills, the \u201cpolestar\u201d is the intent of the testator and we then have proceeded, by placing ourselves in the \u201carmchair\u201d of the testator and by examining the language and scheme of his will and the surrounding circumstances, to ascertain what the testator intended: Woodward Estate, 407 Pa. 638, 640, 182 A. 2d 732. Was such intent arrived at by \u201cguess\u201d, speculation or conjecture? I think not. In the case at bar, believing as I do that in election cases we must give recognition to the intent of a voter if ascertained, why cannot we place ourselves in the position of a voter in the polling booth, examine what confronted him and what he did and, considering all the surrounding circumstances, ascertain his intent? Granted that in construing a will we have principally the language of the testator before us and we determine what he meant by what he said, it seems to me that we can just as well determine what a voter meant by what he did; conduct can be just as eloquently communicative of intent as the written word. The ascertainment of the voters\u2019 intent is not a \u201cguess\u201d; it is an opinion arrived at after a careful marshalling of all the data necessary to the formulation of such opinion.\nIf the voters by depressing the levers did not intend thereby to vote for the candidates whose names appeared directly above such levers, what did they intend? The majority opinion offers several alternatives, i.e., such votes were \u201cprotest\u201d votes, \u201ccross-over\u201d votes or \u201cmistake votes\u201d. If there were \u201cprotest\u201d votes, against whom or what was the protest? On this subject the record is silent and the majority opinion furnishes no support for its suggestion. Were these \u201ccross-over\u201d votes? Appellee contends that Republican and Non-Partisan voters \u201ccrossed over\u201d and registered their votes for Democratic candidates. In support of this contention, appellee points out that the levers in panel \u201c0\u201d were unlocked to Republican and Non-Partisan voters as well as Democratic voters, that on 17 voting machines used only by non-Democratic voters a total of 60 votes appeared in the senatorial columns of Row C and that, by a projection of the ratio shown on those machines to all the machines in the thirteen wards, the conclusion must be reached that approximately 1378 of the 5624 votes in Row 0 were cast by Republican or Non-Partisan voters. In this connection, it must be noted that the total number of votes cast in Rows B and C were less than the total number of Democratic voters who actually voted. If appellee\u2019s contention is sound, then over 1300 Republican or Non-Partisan voters directly violated the election laws by participating in a Democratic party primary. Such a contention, unsupported as it is by any proof, falls in the face of the presumption long adhered to by this Court that, when a person acts, it is to be presumed that he acts in compliance with, not in violation of, the law: Simon Election Case, 353 Pa. 514, 521, 46 A. 2d 243. To paraphrase the language of Chief Justice Maxey in Simon, supra, illegality cannot be proved by merely showing illegality-facilitating circumstances. What appellee \u2014 and now the majority of this Court \u2014 urges is that it is possible that there were \u201ccross-over\u201d votes cast in Row C; I would remind appellee and the majority of this Court that we said in Winograd v. Coombs, 342 Pa. 268, 271, 20 A. 2d 315: \u201cJudicial decrees cannot be founded on possibilities\u201d. Were these \u201cmistake\u201d votes? On this there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever, and I will not classify, simply by rote, the 5000 odd votes cast in this manner as \u201cmistakes\u201d and reject them out of hand. If any conclusion is a pure \u201cguess\u201d, it is the majority\u2019s conclusion that the votes in Row C were in \u201cprotest\u201d or \u201ccross-over\u201d or by way of \u201cmistake\u201d. The fallacy of the majority\u2019s position in this respect is self-evident: its complete rejection of the factual data on this record. What is even more astounding is the clear implication in the majority opinion that, even if the voters\u2019 intent were ascertained, such intent would not be recognized because voters, in the manner of their voting, failed to comply with the letter of the election statute!!\nMoreover, we cannot, and must not, overlook the fact that it was the carelessness on the part of the Board in permitting the levers in panel \u201cC\u201d to remain unlocked and susceptible of operation which created the condition on the basis of which we are now asked to invalidate these 5624 votes. Over eighty years ago, this Court in Contested Election of Wheelock, 82 Pa. 297, 299, said: \u201cIf we, by our decision, should permit the carelessness ... of [election] officers ... to defeat the election . . ., we would thus make the people suffer for an act in which they did not participate, and which they did not sanction.\u201d More recently, we arrived at the same result in Simon, supra.\nAppellee asks this Court to invalidate the 5624 votes cast in Row C in the Democratic senatorial contest as well as all the other votes cast in Row C for other candidates. In so doing, reliance is placed principally on Flynn, supra, Weber Appeal, 399 Pa. 37, 159 A. 2d 901, and Application of Lester, 127 N.Y.S. 2d 272. Factually, both Flynn and Weber completely differ from the case at bar and are, therefore, inapposite. Moreover, Flynn dealt with statutory provisions applicable to paper ballots, not voting machines, and Flynn represents a rule of extreme rigidity no longer followed by this Court. Even if Lester had been determined under statutory provisions similar to the statutory provisions as to voting-machine voting in Pennsylvania \u2014 which it was not \u2014 , even so I am neither bound by Lester nor impressed by its rationale.\nGreat emphasis is placed by the majority on the specimen ballots which, in the majority view, contained \u201cclearly worded instructions\u201d and a \u201ccrystally clear illustration\u201d on the manner of voting, instructions allegedly ignored by the voters. The printing and delivery of specimen ballots is covered by the Election Code (\u00a71007) but it is significant that when the legislature provided the instructions to be given by election officers to voters on voting machines, specimen ballots were not mentioned (Election Code, \u00a71216(a), (b)). To say, as does the majority, that the voters ignored the specimen ballots clearly implies that the voters saw these ballots but there is no evidence such ballots either were seen by, or available to, the voters. As a matter of fact, even the legislature did not contemplate that each voter receive a specimen ballot because it required delivery of specimen ballots to tbe election officers, only in tbe ratio of one specimen ballot for each five official ballots. Moreover, specimen ballots \u201care supposed to be like tbe [official ballots] in every essential particular\u201d (Knight v. Coudersport Borough, 246 Pa. 284, 288, 92 A. 299) and the specimen ballots in tbe wards involved in tbis appeal were not \u201clike tbe official ballots\u201d. On tbe specimen ballot, tbe levers are shown in tbe ballot labels wherein appeared tbe candidates\u2019 names; on the machine the levers were outside tbe ballot labels. On the specimen ballot, in tbe Democratic column and below tbe word \u201cDemocratic\u201d, was tbe letter \u201cB\u201d followed by a pointing band which did not point to any row of levers; on tbe voting machines, the letter \u201cB\u201d is above tbe word \u201cDemocratic\u201d and the pointing band points to tbe levers in panel \u201cB\u201d. A comparison of tbe specimen ballot and the face of tbe voting machine readily indicates tbe nonconformity of tbe former with tbe latter.\nTbe majority takes refuge in tbe statement that tbe machines were \u201cclear to every one\u201d. The weakness of tbis statement is well illustrated by an incident which took place in tbe hearing in tbe court below when tbe very intelligent counsel for the Board, requested by tbe court to point out tbe levers in panel \u201cC\u201d, depressed the levers in panel \u201cD\u201d. This incident emphasizes, if any emphasis be needed, tbe complexity and intricacy of tbe voting machines which confused these voters.\nTbe power to throw out ballots should be exercised very sparingly and only for \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d (Bauman Election Contest Case, 351 Pa. 451, 454, 41 A. 2d 630) and \u201c \u2018 \u201c the rights of voters are not to be prejudiced by tbe errors or wrongful acts of election officers\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Wilkes-Barre Election Contest, 400 Pa. 507, 513, 162 A. 2d 363).\nIn summary, I am of tbe opinion that: (1) \u00a71216-(d) \u2014 which establishes tbe guideline for voting on voting machines at primary elections \u2014 does not, although it should, proscribe the depression of a lever below the name of a candidate; (2) under the language of the carelessly drafted \u00a71216 (d), at best, it is doubtful that the depression of a lever below the name of a candidate violates \u00a71216(d) and any doubt in the construction of the statute must be resolved in favor of the voter; (3) even if the manner of voting in the case at bar be considered a violation of \u00a71216(d), the violation was of such nature, that, if the voters\u2019 intent can be ascertained, such intent should govern; (4) it is clear beyond question that the voters, depressing the levers in panel \u201cC\u201d, intended thereby to vote for the candidate whose names were above such levers; (5) the suggestion in the majority opinion that the votes recorded in Row C were \u201cprotest\u201d, \u201ccross-over\u201d or \u201cmistake\u201d votes is based on conjecture and not upon proof of the quality upon which a judicial decree can be predicated; (6) even though the operation of the levers in panel \u201cC\u201d violated \u00a71216 (d), the intent of the voters being evident, there is no \u201ccompelling reason\u201d to justify the invalidation of the votes and disfranchise thousands of well-intentioned voters.\nLastly, I am reminded that in Simon Election Case, 353 Pa. 514, 519, 46 A. 2d 243, we said: \u201cThe courts have never been able to lay down a precise standard by which it can be determined in a given case whether the irregularities [on the part of the officials conducting an election and making the electoral count] are of sufficient magnitude to justify the rejection of an entire poll in any district in which the question arises. The facts in each case must be considered and a determination reached as to whether justice is more likely to be done by counting the votes, despite the irregularities, or by refusing to count them because of the irregularities.\u201d Under the facts as presented on this record, I am convinced that \u201cjustice is more likely to be done by counting the votes\u201d than \u201cby refusing to count them\u201d.\nThe right to vote for United States Senator is protected and guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States (Art. I, \u00a7\u00a72 and 3; 17th Amendment). The right to vote obviously carries with it the right to have one\u2019s vote counted. In U. S. v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 314-16, 61 S. Ct. 1031, 85 L. Ed. 1368, the U. S. Supreme Court has recognized as a right \u201csecured by the Constitution\u201d the right of voters \u201cto cast their ballots and have them counted\u201d. As a result of the majority view thousands of voters have been denied this constitutional right. The Supreme Court of the United States in Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368, 380, 9 L. Ed. 2d 821, 830, declared \u201c \u2018 the right to have one\u2019s vote counted\u2019 has the same dignity as \u2018the right to put a ballot in a box.\u2019\u201d See also: Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1, 11 L. Ed. 2d 481, 486. A study of the majority opinion does not reveal any sound, let alone compelling, reason for the denial of this right.\nThe record in this case and our applicable law, statutory and decisional, compel me to recognize the intent of the voters. I cannot in good conscience on the facts of this case be a party to the disfranchisement and denial of the constitutional right of these thousands of voters. In my opinion, these voters should be validated; right and justice command that result. I would reverse the order of the court below.\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien joins in this dissenting opinion.\nIn all tbe wards involved in this appeal, the Jamestown type of voting machine \u2014 wherein the voting rows are arranged horizontally \u2014 was used. In the 43rd and 49th wards, which are not involved in this appeal but to which reference is made in the briefs, the Shoup type of voting machine \u2014 wherein the voting rows are arranged vertically \u2014 was used.\nFrom the \u201cballot label\u201d containing the name of the office \u201cRepresentative in Congress\u201d on the top row, an arrow, pointing downward, crossed Rows A and B and ended at Row C.\nThe majority opinion repetitively condemns the Committee\u2019s reference to Row C as a \u201cblank row\u201d. The fact is that Row C was \u201cblank\u201d in that it did not contain the names of any candidates, except that of the Republican congressional candidate.\nBoth the levers in panel \u201cB\u201d and in panel \u201cC\u201d above and below a particular candidate\u2019s name could not be depressed and operated so that the voter could vote twice for such candidate. The majority opinion states: \u201cThe interpretation which [the Committee] places upon the word \u2018adjacent\u2019 [in the statute] would allow a voter to vote on one machine both \u2018upon\u2019 and \u2018adjacent\u2019 to a candidate . . . Wo one contends a voter could vote both above and adjacent to the candidate\u2019s name; it is undisputed that the set-up of the machines did not permit such dual voting.\nCf. Section 1107 of the Election Code (25 P.S. \u00a73007) which specifically provides: \u201cNo voting machine shall, upon any examination or reexamination, be approved by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, or by any examiner appointed by him, unless it shall, at the time, satisfy the following requirement: ... (e) It shall preclude each voter from voting for any candidate, or upon any question, for lohom or upon which he is not entitled to vote, and from voting for more persons for any office than he is entitled to vote for, and from voting for any candidate for the same office or upon any question more than once, except in districts and for offices where cumulative voting is authorized by law. (f) It shall be capable of adjustment by election officers, so as to permit each voter at a primary election to vote only for the candidates for nonpartisan nomination, if any, and for the candidates seeking nomination by the political party in which he is registered and enrolled, if he is enrolled as a member of a political party, and so as to preclude him from voting for the candidates seeking nomination by any political party in which he is not enrolled.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).\nCounsel for Miss Blatt (the appellee) contends the Committee should have applied for relief to the courts and that, not having done so, the Committee cannot now be heard to complain. Appellee fails to take into account that she had equal opportunity to act and did not do so. If any fault is to be imputed to the Committee in this respect, appellee must share in it.\nThe majority opinion seeks to minimize the result of its ruling by stating that the \u201cnumber of questioned votes\u201d was \u201cless than 12 to a division and less than 7 to each voting machine used in the 13 wards\u201d. What the majority opinion fails to state is that there were 908 voting machines and 512 election districts in the 13 wards involved in this appeal.\nThe court below, significantly, failed to note that the lever which the voters depressed was directly deloiv the name of a Democratic candidate.\n5624 votes were cast in Row O by the depression of levers in panel \u201cC\u201d below the names of the three candidates for the Democratic nomination for the U. S. Senate. Of such votes cast, a tabulation shows: 2094 for Genevieve Blatt, 181 for David Roberts and 3349 for Michael Musmanno. It is highly significant that, throughout all the voting districts involved in this appeal, there was a definite pattern of voters utilizing the levers in panel \u201cC\u201d to cast their votes.\nExcept, of course, the lever above the name of the Republican congressional candidate.\nAct of June 3, 1937, P. R. 1333, \u00a71216, 25 P.S. \u00a73056.\nIn the case at bar, small demonstration machines were furnished to the voting places, but such machines did not contain Rows O and D. The voting machines themselves contained no instructions and.the sample ballots only added to the confusion, see, infra.\nConstruing this statute, this Court held that a strict compliance was required to validate a vote: Contested Election of Flynn, 181 Pa. 457, 37 A. 523 (where on one ballot a \u201c1\u201d rather than an \u201cx\u201d was placed, on another ballot an \u201cx\u201d was placed to the right of the candidate\u2019s name but not in the square opposite the candidate\u2019s name and on a third ballot where a \u201c1\u201d rather than an \u201cx\u201d was placed in the square opposite the name of the candidate and an \u201cx\u201d placed to the right of the name but not in the square opposite the name and all three ballots were held void). See also: McCowin\u2019s Appeal, 165 Pa. 233, 30 A. 955; Redman\u2019s Election, 173 Pa. 59, 33 A. 703; Newberry Township Election, 187 Pa. 297, 40 A. 822. Cf. Gulick Appeal, 192 Pa. 446, 43 A. 972.\nThe 1903 statute used the words \u201cvoter may\u201d, instead of \u201cvbter shall\u201d, but this Court held that such change of language was immaterial: Dailey\u2019s Appeal, 232 Pa. 540, 81 A. 655.\nSubsequent to the 1903 statute, this Court continued to require a literal and strict compliance with the manner of voting prescribed in the statute: Dailey\u2019s Appeal, supra; Rodgers\u2019 Contested Election, 234 Pa. 512, 83 A. 476; Pfaff v. Bacon, 249 Pa. 297, 95 A. 71. In Pfaff, it is interesting to note the language of Mr. Justice Mestbezat, in dissent, that a \u201cballot cannot be rejected unless it is so marked as to make it impossible to determine the voter\u2019s choice. This is the only ground or reason for which a vote may not be counted.\u201d (p. 312).\nThe Act of June 22, 1931, P. L. 628, further amended \u00a7\u00a714 and 22 of the 1893 Statute but in a manner not presently pertinent.\nThe Act of June 3, 1937, P. D. 1333, \u00a71215, as amended by the Act of January 8, 1960, P. L. (1959) 2142, \u00a73, 25 P.S. \u00a73055.\nIn this opinion I have adopted the language of the parties and refer to the \u201ckey, handle, pointer or knob\u201d as the lever.\nDilks v. Flohr Chevrolet, 411 Pa. 425, 431, 192 A. 2d 682; Marnell v. Mount Carmel Jt. School System, 380 Pa. 83, 88, 110 A. 2d 357.\nWords of a statute must be construed \u201caccording to their common . . . usage:\u201d Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, \u00a733, 46 P.S. \u00a7533; Breslow v. Baldwin Township School District, 408 Pa. 121, 182 A. 2d 501. In Commonwealth v. Lanzetti, 97 Pa. Superior Ct. 126, 128, it was said: \u201c. . . we are not justified in going so far as to hold that the word \u2018upon\u2019 is to be construed as \u2018adjacent\u2019.\u201d \u201cUpon\u201d has been defined as \u201cupward so as to be on\u201d, \u201con or upon one\u201d, \u201con the surface\u201d: Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed.), p. 2800. \u201cAdjacent\u201d has been defined as \u201cLying near or close to; sometimes, contiguous; neighboring. ... it implies that the two objects are not widely separated, though they may not actually touch\u201d: Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. \u201cAdjacent\u201d has been construed in the courts: Allentown v. Wagner, 27 Pa. Superior Ct. 485, 493 (\u201cimplies nearness to but not necessarily actual contact\u201d) ; Camp Hill Borough, 142 Pa. 511, 517, 21 A. 978 (\u201cadjoining or contiguous\u201d) ; Hanifen v. Armitage, 117 F. 845 (\u201clying near, close, or contiguous, but not actually touching\u201d).\nThe majority opinion says the statute is \u201cboth clear and realistic\u201d and that the \u201cword \u2018upon\u2019 clearly covers, and, . . ., applies to the present Jamestown machine; the word \u2018adjacent\u2019 would cover and apply to a different machine known as the Shoup machine . . . .\u201d Such construction is completely unsupported by any evidence whatsoever. When the election statute was enacted were there Jamestown and Shoup machines? If there were, did the legislature have knowledge of such fact? This is a startling example of statutory construction by judicial wishful thinking.\nPfaff v. Bacon, 249 Pa. 297, 95 A. 71; Rodgers\u2019 Contested Election, 234 Pa. 512, 83 A. 476; Dailey\u2019s Appeal, 232 Pa. 540, 81 A. 655; Gulick Appeal, 192 Pa. 446, 43 A. 972; Newberry Township Election, 187 Pa. 297, 40 A. 822; Contested Election of Flynn, 181 Pa. 457, 37 A. 523; McCowin\u2019s Appeal, 165 Pa. 233, 30 A. 955; Lawlor\u2019s Contested Election, 180 Pa. 566, 37 A. 92; Redman\u2019s Election, 173 Pa. 59, 33 A. 703, relied on by the majority, all dealt with voting by paper ballots, and, in no sense, control the case at bar.\nIn Bodgers, this Court, even though it conceded that the court below had ascertained the voter\u2019s intent, refused to accord any weight to such intent. ,\nInter alia, \u00a727 provided: \u201cIf a voter has marked his ballot otherwise than as directed by this act, so that for any reason it is impossible to determine the voter\u2019s choice for any office to be filled, his ballot shall not be counted for such office; . . . .\u201d.\nSuch is the rule in other jurisdictions: Green v. Independent Consolidated School District, 252 Minn. 36, 89 N.W. 2d 12; Redfearn v. Board of State Canvassers, 234 S.C. 113, 107 S.E. 2d 10; Hall v. Barton, 290 Mass. 476, 195 N.E. 753; Turner v. Board of Education, Ky., 266 S.W. 2d 321; Matter of Creedon, 264 N.Y. 40; Thompson v. Boling, 240 Ky. 340, 42 S.W. 2d 321.\nThis is sheer speculation. There was no evidence that 17 voting machines were used only by Non-Democratic voters. This was a presumption indulged in by the appellee and unfortunately accepted by the majority. Courts \u201ccannot act on conjecture.\u201d (Matter of Creedon, 264 N.Y. 40). It could well be that the 60 votes (about 3 to a machine) were cast by voters, who, like the rest of the 5624 voters, voted beneath the name of the candidate instead of above the name.\nIt is interesting to note the perspective of the appellee, the court below and the majority of this Court which is directed to and concentrated on the fact that the questioned votes were cast in \u201cblank spaces\u201d. Such perspective overlooks completely the fact that the thrust of \u00a71216 (d) is directed to the operation of the levers, not to the place of recordation of the votes. The criterion by which the validity of the votes cast must be determined is ewcluswely that furnished by the statute.",
