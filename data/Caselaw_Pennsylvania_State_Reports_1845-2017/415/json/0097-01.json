        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nThis is an appeal from the Order of the Court of Common Pleas No. 7 of Philadelphia County refusing to quash an appeal from the Zoning Board of Adjustment (hereinafter referred to as Board).\nGerson Kravitz, trading as Normandie Cleaners, filed an application with the Board for a Certificate to use the property situate at 414-416 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, for a coin-operated laundry. On August 29, 1963, the Board rendered a decision refusing to issue the Certificate. On September 6, 1963, Kravitz\u2019s attorney wrote to the Board requesting a re-hearing. The Board on September 16, 1963, denied the request for a re-hearing and on October 9, 1963, appellee filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Board which was granted by the lower Court.\nThe Board filed with the lower Court a motion to quash the appeal. The lower . Court dismissed the motion to quash and the Board thereafter appealed to this Court.\nThe Act of May 6, 1929, P. L. 1551, \u00a78, 53 P.S. \u00a714759 and \u00a714-1806 of the Philadelphia Code, provide that the petition for certiorari \u201c. . . shall be presented to tlie court within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in the office of the Board \u201d The time for filing the petition expired on September 28, 1963.
