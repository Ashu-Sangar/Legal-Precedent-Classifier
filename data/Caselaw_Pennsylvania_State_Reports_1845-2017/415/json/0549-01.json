        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nPlaintiff-administratrix appeals from a judgment of nonsuit. The judgment of nonsuit was entered in a trespass action brought by plaintiff for damages for the death of her intestate.\nDefendant operates railway cars by cable on two tracks from the bottom of a hill to the top of a hill in Pittsburgh on a steeply inclined track. The track on this particular hill was 2644 feet in length, with an elevation of over 400 feet.\nPlaintiff pleaded two factual theories to establish her right to recovery. The first theory pleaded was that on or about October 8, 1953, decedent boarded defendant\u2019s car and while a passenger fell or was thrown by the rough motion of the car to his death on the railroad tracks. Plaintiff also alternatively pleaded that decedent, aged 13, was struck by defendant\u2019s car on or about October 8, 1953, while traversing a footpath that crossed defendant\u2019s railway tracks on the hillside.\nPlaintiff utterly failed to prove how or in Avhat manner decedent\u2019s death occurred. However, plaintiff did prove that the decedent\u2019s dismembered body was found widely scattered along the east rail track about halfway up the incline, and it is clear that defendant\u2019s easternmost car had passed over decedent\u2019s body at least once. Plaintiff further proved that decedent Avent to an evening football game, that after the game he went to the defendant\u2019s station at the foot of the incline, and that he was last seen alive while standing in a line of approximately 75 to 100 people who intended or desired to board the next car when it arrived.\nNo one knows whether decedent actually boarded the car or how and in what manner his death occurred. Plaintiff further proved (a) that the tracks had been unlighted for some time prior and subsequent to the evening in question, and (b) that the cars had previously had only one light on each car, and (c) that these incline cars had been operated previously in a jerky manner and had no accompanying guard. There was no proof that these fads existed at the time of the death, or caused or had any connection with decedent\u2019s death.\nIt is clear, we repeat, that no evidence whatever was presented as to how or in what manner decedent met his death. There was absolutely no proof or evidence of negligence and it is clear that a verdict under all these circumstances would be based upon nothing but conjecture and guess.\nIn Flagiello v. Crilly, 409 Pa. 389, 187 A. 2d 289, the Court said (pages 390-391) : \u201c. . . It is hornbook law that a judgment of nonsuit can be entered only in clear cases and plaintiff must be given the benefit of all evidence favorable to him, together with all reasonable inferences of fact arising therefrom, and any conflict in the evidence must be resolved in his favor: Castelli v. Pittsburgh Railways Company, 402 Pa. 135, 165 A. 2d 632; Stimac v. Barkey, 405 Pa. 253, 174 A. 2d 868; Borzik v. Miller, 399 Pa. 293, 159 A. 2d 741.\n\u201cThe law is likewise clear that the plaintiff has the burden of proving by a fair preponderance of the evidence that defendant was negligent and that his negligence was the proximate cause of the accident: Stimac v. Barkey, 405 Pa., supra; Schofield v. King, 388 Pa. 132, 130 A. 2d 93.\n\u201cThe mere happening of an accident or the mere fact that a moving vehicle collides with a pedestrian or with another vehicle does not establish negligence nor raise an inference or a presumption of negligence nor make out a prima facie case of negligence: Bohner v. Eastern Express, Inc., 405 Pa. 463, 175 A. 2d 864; Stimac v. Barkey, 405 Pa., supra; Gatens v. Vrabel, 393 Pa. 155, 142 A. 2d 287; Schofield v. King, 388 Pa., supra; Ebersole v. Beistline, 368 Pa. 12, 82 A. 2d 11; Hulmes v. Keel, 335 Pa. 117, 6 A. 2d 64; Niziolek v. Wilkes-Barre Railway Corp., 322 Pa. 29, 185 A. 581.\n\u201cIt is also well settled that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur does not apply and a jury is not permitted to find a verdict based on surmise or guess: Schofield v. King, 388 Pa., supra; Smith v. Bell Telephone Co., 397 Pa. 134, 153 A. 2d 477.\u201d See also: Izzi v. Philadelphia, 412 Pa. 559, 195 A. 2d 784.\nApplying these authorities to the evidence in this case, we find no merit in any of plaintiff\u2019s contentions. Judgment of nonsuit affirmed.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents.",
