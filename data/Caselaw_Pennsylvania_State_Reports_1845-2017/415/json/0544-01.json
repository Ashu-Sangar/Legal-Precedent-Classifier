We have today reviewed constitutional questions closely related to those raised by this petition in Commonwealth ex rel. O\u2019Lock v. Rundle, 415 Pa. 515, 204 A. 2d 439 (1964), and in Commonwealth ex rel. Goodfellow v. Rundle, 415 Pa. 528, 204 A. 2d 446 (1964).\nWe are satisfied that the incomplete record before us requires that we remand the case to the court below for further consideration in light of today\u2019s decisions.\nThe petition for allocatur is granted, as is the petition to proceed in forma pauperis. The orders of the Superior Court and the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County are vacated. The record is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County for further consideration.",
