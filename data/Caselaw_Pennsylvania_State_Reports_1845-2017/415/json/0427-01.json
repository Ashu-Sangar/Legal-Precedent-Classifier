        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nFlorence Tack Norvell died August 24, 1921. Her will, dated August 9, 1919, created a trust out of which the present controversy arises. Appellants are life tenants under the trust and are entitled by its provisions to receive all of the income. The trust also establishes alternative remainders over in named and unascertained persons.\nOn March 4, 1960, the trustees filed their fifth account. The petition for distribution, filed June 1, 1960, requested the court to approve distribution to the life tenants of the proceeds from the sales of stock subscription rights and of certain shares of stock received by the trustees as stock dividends. Following our decision in Catherwood Trust, 405 Pa. 61, 173 A. 2d 86 (filed July 26, 1961), the trustees withdrew the suggested schedule of distribution. On December 20, 1961, the trustees filed a supplemental petition for distribution and took the position that, in view of Gather-wood\u201cthe entire apportionment matters referred to in the Petition for Distribution need not be presented.\u201d\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny County, by decree of April 29, 1963, approved the distribution to principal of cash from the sale of rights and the shares of stock received as stock dividends. This allocation was made under the Principal and Income Act of July 3, 1947, P. L. 1283, which Catherwood Trust, supra, held constitutionally applicable to trusts created prior to the effective date of the Act.\nSpecifically, this appeal challenges the constitutional validity of Sections 3(1), 5(1) and 5(2) of the Act. Section 3(1) provides: \u201cAll. . . dividends on corporate shares, payable other than in shares of the corporation itself of the same kind and rank as the shares on which such dividend is paid, . . . shall be deemed income, unless otherwise expressly provided in this act.\u201d\nPrior to September 30, 1963, Section 5(1) directed: \u201cAll dividends on shares of a corporation, forming a part of the principal, which are payable in the shares of the corporation itself of the same kind and rank as the shares on which such dividend is paid shall be deemed principal. . . .\u201d\nSection 5(2) reads: \u201cAll rights to subscribe to the shares or other securities or obligations of a corporation, accruing on account of the ownership of shares or other securities in such corporation, and the proceeds of any sale of such rights shall be deemed principal. . . ,\u201d\nThe alleged infirmity is one of deprivation of property without due process of law. It is vigorously contended that the Principal and Income Act, as applied to this trust created years prior to the effective date of the Act, deprives the life tenants of their property without due process, in violation of Article I, \u00a7 \u00a71 and 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\nAppellants urge that, as life tenants, they are entitled to all the return derived from the principal of the trust and that the first sentence of Section 5(1), directing that \u201call dividends on shares . . . shall he deemed principal,\u201d establishes a conclusive statutory presumption contrary to actual fact and violates the constitutional due process provisions. Substantially the same attack is made on the first sentence of Section 3(1) to the extent that it excludes from income stock dividends (of the same kind and rank as the shares on which paid).\nAppellants assert, and we agree, that the contentions presently advanced were not raised or directly settled in Catherwood. We do feel, however, that the implications of that decision are unmistakably pertinent and persuasive here.\nIn essence, appellants argue that the Legislature has improperly and conclusively defined principal so as to preclude the life tenants from proving that the stock dividends here are \u201cin fact\u201d income. This position appears based on the premise that income has a distinct, fiscal meaning (presumably, that accorded the term under the Pennsylvania Rule of Apportionment prior to the Principal and Income Act). And appellants insist that the statute may not, by means of an irrebuttable presumption, constitutionally preclude them from establishing that the distributions in controversy fall within the meaning they seek to give income.\nAppellants place their heaviest reliance on Heiner v. Donnan, 285 U.S. 312, 52 S. Ct. 358 (1932), but that reliance is unfounded, especially since Seiner dealt with a statute establishing, in effect, a rule of evidence. There the statute provided that gifts in excess of $5,-000 made within two years of the donor\u2019s death were to be deemed as having been made \u201cin contemplation of death.\u201d No opportunity was afforded to prove that a gift within the two year period was not so made. Accordingly, the value of the gift was taxable under other provisions of the taxing statute.\nIt is important to note that the amount of the gift was not taxable in Seiner unless made in contemplation of death, and that \u201ccontemplation of death\u201d had a meaning which Congress did not seek to change. The Supreme Court held the statute invalid as \u201can attempt, by legislative fiat, to enact into existence, a fact which here does not, and cannot be made to, exist in actuality . . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 285 U.S. at 329, 52 S. Ct. at 362. Moreover, the Supreme Court made it quite clear that the statute was not intended to operate as a change in the substantive law, i.e., that there was no congressional intention to tax gifts not made in contemplation of death. 285 U.S. at 328-30, 52 S. Ct. at 362-63.\nIt seems clear to us that the Principal and Income Act does not establish, as appellants contend, a rule of evidence, i.e., a presumption contrary to the actual facts. What the statute expressly does is to set forth a substantive rule of law defining income and principal. See 4 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a71353-54 (3d ed. 1940); 9 Wigmore, op. cit. supra, \u00a72492; cf. United States v. Carlisle, 234 F. 2d 196, 199 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 841, 77 S. Ct. 63 (1956); Bowers v. United States, 226 F. 2d 424, 428 (5th Cir. 1955); United States v. Jones, 176 F. 2d 278, 288 (9th Cir. 1949); City of New Port Richey v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., 105 F. 2d 348, 351 (5th Cir. 1939); Commonwealth v. Brue, 284 Pa. 294, 296, 131 Atl. 367, 368 (1925).\nIn City of New Port Richey v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., supra, an argument similar to that presently advanced was rejected. The court said: \u201cWe recognize that the legislature cannot make certain facts conclusive proof of another ultimate fact when there is no logical connection or probability in experience to connect them. But the real legislative intent may not be to make a rule of evidence, but a rule of substantive law, and if the legislature may constitutionally do the latter, the form of the words used will not defeat the intent.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 105 F. 2d at 351.\nIt is clear that the Legislature, by the 1947 Act, intended to, and did, change the substantive law by declaring that certain kinds and classes of stock dividends constitute principal. Thus, a new definition of income was statutorily established. Here, unlike Heiner, the statute enacts into existence, not a fact, but a definition of a term theretofore subject to judicial determination.\nWe are therefore led to the question whether the Legislature possesses constitutional authority to define income. This determination, in turn, depends on whether income, as used in the statute, enjoys such a fixed definitional status that it may not be legislatively disturbed. In Gatherwood we attributed to trust income no such undisturbable status.\nWe held in Catherwood that life tenants have no vested interest in a court-made rule of apportionment. 405 Pa. at 72-73, 77, 173 A. 2d at 91, 93. Although the life beneficiaries there (as the life tenants here) enjoyed a vested right to the income of the trust, no vested right exists in the functional, operational or definitional methods of ascertaining from time to time what constitutes such income. Due process does not mandate that prior decisions or rules remain effective and controlling forever. Thus, it is settled that there is no vested interest in a definition or method of ascertaining income. This conclusion is supported by compelling reasoning and the clear weight of authority.

Ct. 384 (1944).\nWe have no hesitancy in concluding that the Legislature has the power to define income. In the light of the complexity of current corporate finance, the definition of income is a function which the Legislature is well suited to perform. \u201cIn the area of apportionment of stock distribution between income and corpus beneficiaries, the elements of fairness, practicality and changing conditions dictate that freedom be given to lawmaking bodies to promulgate rules applicable to existing trusts.\u201d King, supra, at 357. See also Burke, J., in Matter of Fosdick, 4 N.Y. 2d 646, 655, 176 N.Y.S. 2d 966, 973, 152 N.E. 2d 228, 233 (1958): \u201c[T]hat function [altering definitions in this area] is for the Legislature alone.\u201d\nIn the use of its definitional powers, of course, the Legislature may not act arbitrarily. Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502, 537, 54 S. Ct. 505, 516 (1934); Maurer v. Boardman, 336 Pa. 17, 25, 7 A. 2d 466, 473 (1939), aff\u2019d, 309 U.S. 598, 60 S. Ct. 726 (1940). In the face of the generally known and experienced difficulty, complexity and uncertainty under the prior rule of apportionment in ascertaining the \u201cintact value\u201d of designated shares of stock at a given time, the Legislature acted to provide for a fairer, more orderly and more uniform apportionment between income and principal. The particular definitions which the Legislature adopted by the 1947 Act represent what that body determined to be a pragmatic necessity for a current, definite, more understandable and more workable rule of fair apportionment. Such action by the Legislature, providing for remedial and commercially useable standards, is an entirely desirable legislative function. Legislation based on such broad public policy and realistic considerations is entirely proper and manifestly reasonable. The absence of arbitrariness is further attested to by the fact that the 1947 Act, in effect, basically adopts the long-established and well-regarded \u201cMassachusetts Rule of Apportionment\u201d embracing substantially the same definitions. The rationale behind that rule is, in our view, a reasonable one, based on substantial considerations. That rule has received approval (at one time or another) in a great many jurisdictions, either by judicial decision or by legislative action. Such overwhelming support for the rationale on which our statute is based confirms our view of its reasonableness.\nAppellants make a further argument. They suggest Sections 3(1) and 5(1) of the Act are void because they are repugnant to the definitions in Section 1 of the Act, especially the definitions of \u201cprincipal\u201d and \u201cincome.\u201d There \u201cprincipal\u201d is defined as \u201cany . . . personalty which has been so set aside by the owner thereof . . . that it and any substitutions for it are eventually to be conveyed, delivered or paid to a person, while the return therefrom ... is in the meantime to be taken or received by . . . another person.\u201d \u201cIncome\u201d is defined as \u201cthe return derived from principal.\u201d Appellants urge that the contested stock dividends are not a \u201csubstitution\u201d for the assets of principal, but rather are a \u201creturn\u201d on principal. Therefore, their argument continues, Sections 3(1) and 5(1), by allotting such stock to principal rather than to income, are repugnant to Section 1 and consequently void.\nThis reasoning assumes that the words \u201csubstitutions\u201d and \u201cincome\u201d have meanings unrelated to what follows in the remainder of the Act. We see no inconsistency between the sections. The words \u201csubstitutions\u201d in the definition of principal and \u201creturn\u201d in the definition of income are, in themselves, not self-contained definitions; they are merely descriptive. What is a \u201csubstitution\u201d or a \u201creturn\u201d is defined by later sections, including Sections 3(1) and 5(1).\nFailing to find the constitutional deficiencies which appellants assert, or any similar or other infirmity, error or defect, the decree below must be affirmed.\nDecree affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nThe life tenants\u2019 father is one of the contingent remainder-men and joins them.in this appeal.\nThe sales of' rights covered the period 1952-58. All stock dividends were well in excess of six percent of the outstanding shares of that class. . \u25a0\nSince the trust was created prior to the enactment of the Principal and Income Act, and since all the stock dividends and all subscription rights sales occurred after the enactment of the Principal and Income Act, the statutory rules classifying such receipts as principal was held to govern this transaction. Since the stock dividends here involved all exceeded this Court\u2019s \u201cstock dividend of 6% or less\u201d rule in Pew Trust, 411 Pa. 96, 191 A. 2d 399 (1963), that rule does not apply.\nOf course, the settlor may set out his or her own definition of what is meant by \u201cincome,\u201d in which case \u00a72 of the Act provides that the settlor\u2019s meaning shall prevail and the statutory definitions do not apply. P. L. 1283, \u00a72, 20 P.S. \u00a73470.2.\nChief Justice Bell noted in Pew Trust, supra, note 3, that \u201cthe object and purpose of this proviso was undoubtedly to preserve to every settlor and every testator his basic centuries old right to determine to whom his property should go, and how\u2014 whether outright, or conditionally, or in trust, i.e., what he wanted to go to his life tenant as income and what to his remainderman as principal.\u201d 411 Pa. at 105-06, 191 A. 2d at 405.\nSubsequent to our decision in Pew Trust, supra, note 3 (filed May 29, 1963), holding that stock dividends of \u201c6% or less\u201d of the outstanding shares of the same class on the record date are applicable to income, this sentence was amended by Act of August 1, 1963, P. h. 442, \u00a71, 20 P.S. \u00a73470.5(1), effective September 1, 1963, and provides: \u201cCorporate distributions made to a trustee in the shares of the distributing corporation, however described or designated by the distributing corporation, shall be deemed principal but if the number of shares of any class distributed to shareholders of such class is six percent (6%) or less of the number of shares of that class outstanding on the record date for such distribution, the shares so distributed shall be deemed income.\u201d\nBoth our ruling in Pew and the provisions of the 1963 amendment declare that only stock dividends of 6% or less are income. Each such dividend is considered separately without reference to the trust or corporate year. In contrast, the New York statute allocates to income the first 6% of larger dividends and limits the total receivable income of this type to 6% in any particular year. See N. Y. Pers. Prop. Law \u00a717-a(3) (effective June 1, 1965); Second Report of the New York Commission on the Modernization, Revision and Simplification of the Law of Estates 322 (1963).\n\u201cThis section [5(1)] abolishes the so-called \u2018Pennsylvania\u2019 rule of apportionment of dividends, and the basic significance of \u2018intact value.\u2019\u201d 20 P.S. \u00a73470.5(1), Commission\u2019s Comment.\nIt is common experience that \u201cincome\u201d is a term which is, and always has been, defined differently for various purposes by governmental agencies, regulatory bodies, taxing authorities, legislators, accountants, securities analysts, bankers, financial writers, lawyers and laymen.\nThe difficulties are aggravated by current methods of corporate financing, changes in capital and share structure and varying procedures for corporate distributions.\nThe Massachusetts Rule formed the basis for \u00a75 of the Uniform Principal and Income Act. 112 U.
