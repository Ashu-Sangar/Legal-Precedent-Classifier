    <p id="b193-6" data-blocks='[["BL_193.5",193,[170,961,1163,957]]]'>Whether we apply to the residuary clause of the will the technical rules of construction, or give to it the plain meaning which its words import and its grammatical structure requires, the result is the same. When there is a testamentary gift to one'person, and to the children of another person who stand in the same relation to the testator, the donees, take per capita. This rule under the English authorities yields to slight indications of a contrary intent; and in Pennsylvania the contrary intent is inferred where under the intestate laws, which are always resorted to in cases of doubtful interpretation, the distribution would be made per stirpes, as in the case of a gift to a son or brother of the testator and to the children or heirs of a deceased son or brother. Where, however, the gift is to persons or classes of persons who stand in the same relation to the testator, the analogy furnished by the intestate laws indicates a division per capita, for in such cases, under sec. 14 of the act of April 8, 1883, and sec. 1 of the act of June 30, 1885, persons so standing, “ if there he more than one, shall take in equal shares.” ■</p>
    <p id="b193-7" data-blocks='[["BL_193.6",193,[169,1937,1166,347]]]'>The benefit here was evidently intended for the legatees individually, as nephews and nieces, and not as representing their parents, who in two instances are still living and were entirely passed over. The nephews and nieces are treated as if their parents were dead; and in that case, if there were no will, the estate would go per capita under the intestate laws, to the beneficiaries and others occupying the same position.</p>

That having been done, distribution under the law would then' be per capita; and the presumption is in favor of such an intention on the part of the testator in the absence of evidence in the will of a purpose to further supersede the statute. The will seems clearly and affirmatively to show that the distribution was to be in equal shares.</p>

Its manifest object was to limit the generality of the preceding words, and to define the persons who were to take. She had before written “ my nephews and nieces,” which included all her nephews and nieces. This was not her purpose, and she proceeded to designate those who were to take in order to exclude the others-The design was not to classif}’, but to discriminate and ex elude.</p>

The expression “share and share alike ” standing- alone might refer to a division among classes as well as among individuals ; but this cannot be said of “ each to take,” which, unless applied to individuals, as the grammatical structure of the paragraph requires, must be regarded as redundant and meaningless.
