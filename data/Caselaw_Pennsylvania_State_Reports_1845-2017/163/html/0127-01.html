In most of the cases which arise the employee cannot recover, because of the fact that he accepts the risks of the employment, or because of the fact that an accident had arisen from the negligence of a co-emploj'ee. There is no such distinction drawn in the agreement which is here made, but the benefits are benefits which are conferred upon those who are subjected to an accident in whatever way it may occur. The contract provides that it shall be an agreement between the employee and the company; and it appears, from the evidence in this case, that it has been accepted by the company, because they have paid into the fund of the relief association a sum amounting to $100,000. There is a provision in the agreement that it shall operate as a release of all claim of damages against the said company. It provides that: ‘I agree that acceptance of benefits.from said relief fund for injury or death shall operate as a release of all claims of damages against the company.’' It appears, therefore, that it is not a release in all cases upon its terms, but that what constitutes a release, according to the contract between the parties, is the acceptance of the benefits after the injury has occurred. Now that, assuredly, is of great advantage to the employee, because it permits- him, after he knows the extent of his injury and the manner in which it has occurred, to say whether or not he will take the benefits provided for by the contract, or whether he will rest upon his right to sue and claim damages for negligence. I cannot see that it is any different from a compromise of a case made between the parties, since it gives the employee the right to determine his course of conduct after he has ascertained the <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>extent of his injuries.] [9] Nor do I see that it offends against any principle of the law. It is contended that the contract is one that is ultra vires, one that the railroad company has no authority, under the terms of its charter, to make. That question would arise upon a suit to enforce the contract, but I do not think it arises in the case of an executed contract between the parties. It would certainly be a great hardship to say, after a man had received what was coming to him under the terms of the contract, and is called upon to meet its requirement with respect to the other side, that it was ultra vires. For this reason I do not think that principle is involved in this case.</p>

    <p id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.6",157,[125,429,1179,1006]]]'>The release was admissible under the plea of not guilty. By the strict letter of the Procedure Act of 1887 “ the only ple.a in the action of trespass shall be not guilty,” though the pleadings are to be “subject to the rules of the respective courts as to notice of special matter.” The rule of the court below prescribes that defences previously pleaded specially or given in evidence under equitable pleas, shall be admissible under tbe geueral issue upon notice given ten days prior to the trial.. This court does not interfere with the interpretation by the lower courts of their own rules, except in cases of plain mistake which has inflicted substantial injury on the party complaining. But here we. see no error. The present action in its nature is trespass on the case, and the legislature, in an effort, however misdirected, to get rid of technical distinctions by calling all actions ex delicto trespass, and limiting the plea to not guilty, certainly did not mean to tie them all down to the technical restrictions of that plea in that action at common law. In actions. on the case a release was admissible in evidence without being pleaded: 1 Chitty, Plead. 491 e; Greenwalt v. Horner, 6 S. &amp; R. 71.</p>
    <p id="b157-6" data-blocks='[["BL_157.7",157,[123,1455,1174,448]]]'>The further objection that the release was not admissible because in form it did not comply with the act of May 11, 1881,-P. L. 20, requiring copies of the application etc. to be attached to the policy, is sufficiently answered by the consideration that that act applies only to policies issued by insurance companies, and the relief association is not an insurance company but <em>a, </em>beneficial association, Com. v. Equitable Asso., <a href="/pa/137/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="137 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="821444" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0412-01">137 Pa. 412</a>; N. W. Masonic Asso. v.

    <p id="b157-7" data-blocks='[["BL_157.8",157,[115,1913,1189,508]],["BL_158.1",158,[250,391,1166,1580]]]'>It is further objected, and this is the only substantial ques-. tion in the case, that the release was void as against public policjq and a number of cases are cited to show that a common carrier cannot make a valid contract against his own negligence. •It was quite unnecessary to go out of our own state for authority on that proposition; it is not questioned here any more than elsewhere, but it is wide of the point in this case. There is no provision exempting the company from liability for future negligence. The benefits, by the regulations of the relief association, become due to members whenever disabled by accident <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>in the railroad company’s service, or by sickness or injury other than in the company’s service, without reference to the question of negligence at all. As these provisions include benefits in eases of accident pure and simple, of injury by the negligence of fellow workmen, and by the member’s own contributory negligence, it is apparent that they cover a wide field in which there is no liability of the railroad company at all. Such cases are probably a large majority of those occurring to railroad employees, and the association therefore is of the highest order of beneficial societies. But even in eases of injury through the company’s negligence'there is no waiver of any right of action that the person injured may thereafter be entitled to. It is not the signing of the contract but the acceptance of benefits after the accident that constitutes the release. The injured party therefore is not stipulating for the future, but settling for the past; he is not agreeing to exempt the company from liability for negligence, but accepting compensation for an injury already caused thereby. He may as well accept it in installments as in a single sum, and from an appointed fund to which the company has contributed, as from the company’s treasury as a result of litigation. The substantial feature of the contract which distinguishes it from those held void as against public policy is that the party retains whatever right of action he may have until after knowledge of all the facts, and an opportunity to make his choice between the sure benefits of the association or the chances of litigation. Having accepted the former he cannot justly ask the latter in addition. This feature of the case brings it on all fours with Graft v. R. R. Co., 8 Atlantic Rep. 206, where a release under similar circumstances was held to be a conclusive bar. There is no public policy which the contract can be said to transgress.</p>
