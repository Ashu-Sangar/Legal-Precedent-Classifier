The question here is not the construction of a power given to a donee, devisee or grantee, or to a trustee fdr appointment, or for the purpose of defining the limitations of an estate, or regulating its future control or management. .It is, on the contrary, a question which relates simply to the construction of a written authority given by the owner of the property to a naked agent appointed for a specific purpose, with no interest in the subject of the power and no authority beyond it either expressed or implied. A, being desirous of changing an investment, employs B to sell his house. Would not any one in the place of A be justly astonished if he was informed the next day that B had not sold his house but mortgaged it; that he had not found a purchaser, but had placed an incumbrance upon the property, and that the owner was not to get the price of the property which he had directed to be sold, but would thereupon be bound by a solemn obligation to pay the interest upon a loan, which he had never authorized, and did not want, but which had been securely fastened upon his property, and that he was to be bound for its payment by a bond which he had never given any authority to any one to.sign or seal for him. This is the whole case so far as it relates to the construction of the letter of authority given by the plaintiff to William B. Robins, December 26,1888. That a naked agent who is authorized by a letter of attorney to sell for his constituent has no authority to mortgage, is plain alike upon principles of reason, and by all the authorities upon the subject. They have been diligently collected and clearly stated by the learned master in his very able and lucid printed report in this case. So that it is quite unnecessary for me to recapitulate them here.

The master has analyzed and dissected each one of them with great skill and perspicuity in his report, for the purpose of showing the fundamental difference between those cases and the present case; but it was, in my opinion, an unnecessary labor, for these cases have no application to the case in hand. They relate to a totally different subject, viz., the construction of powers given to devisees, or trustees for devisees, to enable them to raise a fund for the accomplishment of a specific purpose contemplated by the donor of the power—a purpose as readily effected by a mortgage as by a sale. They are not at all applicable to the case of a mere' agent employed by the owner for the sole purpose of making a sale, with no other purpose in view and no authority whatever beyond that specific purpose. The concise phrase, which has grown into a convenient legal apothegm, ‘ a power to sell is a power to mortgage ’—is applicable only to the doctrine of power as applied to cases of the kind which I have already mentioned, and even there has its exceptions and limitations, but it has no legitimate or proper application to the construction of a letter of attorney given to a mere agent employed for no other purpose than to sell a house for the owner, and not authorized, either by the words or intendment of the instrument, to do anything else. It might, with as much justice and propriety, be applied to a letter of attorney authorizing an agent to sell stocks, and for the purpose of justifying him in pledging the stocks, contrary to his orders, instead of selling them.</p>

That Robius knew that he had no such authority is evident from the fact that when, subsequently to the execution of the letter of attorney, he conceived the idea of obtaining a loan by mortgage upon the property from the Western Saving Fund he procured from Mrs. Campbell another power of attorney (June 10,1889), which specifically authorized him to make and deliver a bond and mortgage to the Western Saving Fund for $6,000.</p>

They were very caréless in lending Robins the money without sufficient proof of his authority from Mrs. Campbell to borrow it. As it was, the defendants acquired no title to the property, and no rights against the plaintiff by the bond and mortgage executed by Robins to them December 23d, 1890, any more than if they had been forgeries, from which, indeed, they are not far removed, for it is clear that Robins had no right to execute them in her name.</p>

The Real Estate Title Company who insured the defendant’s title, and by whom the settlement was made, were, as the master reports, the agents of the defendants in paying off the preceding mortgage and taxes. They were virtually payments made by the defendants, who were mere volunteers paying off incumbrances upon a property to which they thought they had a good title as mortgagees, but to which they had none. There was no privity whatever between them and Mrs. Campbell, who did not receive a. cent of the money they loaned to Robins, and who was entirely ignorant of the whole transaction, the loan having been fraudulently concocted by Robins, who appropriated the net proceeds to his own use. The defendants occupy towards the plaintiff the attitude of a stranger interfering without her knowledge or consent with her property for what they supposed to be for their own best interests. In making these payments they were mere volunteers, for there was neither privity of estate,- privity of contract, nor privity of any kind between them and the plaintiff, and the law is well set-.tied that the principles of subrogation in equity do not apply in favor of volunteers. Voluntary payment of a mortgage-debt by one who sustains no legal relation to the property or <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>the owner cannot operate to subrogate him to the rights of the former holder of a satisfied mortgage. It has been decided that even one who loans money to another to pay the mortgage has no claim to subrogation to the right of the mortgagee. A good illustration of the principle is the familiar case of a surety who pays the debt of his principal. and becomes thereby entitled to the securities of the creditor; a stranger, or one standing in no legal relation to the debtor, would have no such right. I have not been able to find any authority which would justify the claim of the defendants to be subrogated to the former rights of the owners of the satisfied mortgage and liens in this case. Maurer’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/86/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="86 Pa. 380" data-case-ids="1056606" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0380-01">86 Pa. 380</a>, much relied on by the defendants, was a totally different case from the present. There the married woman herself received the money and herself applied it to the payment of the preceding mortgages. In the present case the plaintiff had nothing to do with the payment and no knowledge of it whatever. The present case is the case of a volunteer loaning money on a worthless security given by a third party in the perpetration of a fraud which he had planned for his own benefit, and-then, without the knowledge of the owner, paying off an incumbrance to increase its own security. It is unnecessary to go through the cases upon this subject. They have been collected and discussed by the master with the same diligence and ability which characterizes the rest of his report.”</p>

It can hardly be supposed that a power there given, as in this case, for the purpose of changing investments, was supposed by the' testatrix to confer a power to create an indebtedness and to secure the same by an incumbrance. This court, however, disregarded all considerations of the reason which moved the testatrix to confer the power, and interpreted the words by the light of its past decisions. It deemed it more important to sustain a rule of property than to make effectual a possible special intent.</p>

Dolan and its train of cases, resulting in the declaration- that a power to sell land includes a power to mortgage, are entirely inapplicable in the interpretation of a mere letter of attorney with a naked authority to sell, uncoup- • led with any interest in the land or the fund.</p>
    <p id="b655-3" data-blocks='[["BL_655.4",655,[147,747,1170,506]]]'>The instrument now in question was essentially of this latter class. So far as this matter is concerned it is in the following words: “ Do make, constitute and appoint William B. Robins of said city, attorney at law, my true and lawful attorney, for me and in my name, to grant, bargain and sell in fee simple all real estate owned by me, including all ground rents, on such terms and for such prices as he may see fit, and to make, execute and deliver all necessary deeds and assurances to the purchasers and to assign all policies of insurance on said properties or with said ground rents.”</p>
    <p id="b655-4" data-blocks='[["BL_655.5",655,[145,1261,1170,507]]]'>It cannot be questioned that this is but an ordinary letter of attorney to sell real estate in fee simple. It is nothing but a naked authority to sell and make deeds to the purchasers, without any interest, whatever in the proceeds, without any power to invest the same or to exercise any kind of control over them. There was no power to raise money for any trust, or to pay debts or charges, or to provide a fund for any charitable or other purpose or for the support of any third person. In short there was no power of any kind whatever, to do more than simply to sell'the property and to make deeds to the purchasers.</p>

Instead of being the seller of real estate in the enjoyment of the fruits of the sale, she was converted into a debtor with all the duties and obligations which that relation implies. We do not know of any doctrine in the law of principal and agent which will permit such a result to be accomplished in such a mode. The books abound with endless decisions which are in utter' hostility with such a transaction as a valid act.</p>

For failure in her payments she would become personally liable for the moneys due, and be subject to a general judgment which would be a lien upon all her real estate, and®upon which process of execution might issue and be levied upon her personal property. In point of fact, a warrant of attorney for the entering of judgment against her for the debt, was contained in the bond executed in her name by her attorney, under an authority which gave him only a bare light to sell her lands. It is not credible that the citizen can be held subject to such consequences, so entirely inconsistent, unexpected and hostile to his express intent, in an instrument of such a character. Whatever else may be said of such a paper, it must be conceded that, in its terms, and in its legal substance, it is a plain, simple letter of attorney establishing the relation of principal and agent between the parties to it. It must therefore be regarded as subject to the rules and requirements of that branch of the law in any event, and if these will not permit it to be used for an ulterior purpose such as is claimed in the present case, then it cannot be so used.</p>

The plaintiff was not consulted about it and had no knowledge of it. There was no privity of any kind between the plaintiff and the defendant, and the latter was under no compulsion to make the payment for the protection of its interests. The payment was doubtless made so as to make its mortgage a first instead of a second mortgage. But that consideration would give no right of subrogation to the holder of the second mortgage. It seems to us that the case of McCleary’s Appeal, 20 W. N. 547, covers every aspect of this. There the first mortgage was an un<a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>doubtedly valid lien upon tbe property for $925. The second mortgage was a forgery, and the holder, as here, desiring to have the first lien extinguished, paid $600 of the mortgage money, $1,400, to the agent of the owner of the.property, who, with $825 furnished by the owner, paid the $925 due on the first mortgage, had it satisfied, and surrendered the bond and the mortgage to the owner. When the forgery was discovered, the holder of the second .mortgage filed a bill praying a cancellation of the entry of satisfaction, and subrogation. Both the court below and this court held that this could not be done, and dismissed the bill upon the express ground that, although the first mortgage was an unquestioned lien, and the money, to the extent of $600, was paid by the holder of the second mortgage, he was a mere volunteer in making such payment and was not entitled to subrogation.</p>

It will not arise in favor of a stranger, but only in favor of a party who, on some sort of compulsion, discharges a demand against a common debtor. There the maker of a promissory note for $700 gave a judgment for that amount to his indorser to protect him against liability on his indorsement. After-wards, at the maturity of the note, another person consented to indorse a new note to take up the first one upon the express assurance of the maker that the judgment should be assigned to the second indorser for his protection against liability for the same debt. The judgment was assigned shortly after to the second indorser, who was ultimately obliged to pay the note. The property of the maker being sold upon execution process, the holder of the assigned judgment claimed a share in the distribution of the proceeds as against -'udgments obtained subsequently to the assigned judgment. Priority in the distribution was allowed to the assigned judgment in the court below, but this court reversed the decree, holding that the second indorser was a mere volunteer, and that as the first judgment had served its purpose of protecting the first indorser, it could not be used <a id="p636" href="#p636" data-label="636" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*636</a>to protect the second indorser although assigned to him for that purpose by the first indorser as a condition of the second indorsement. While we decided that if the judgment had been held by the bank which discounted the note, as a part of their security, subrogation would have been granted, even against intervening judgment creditors, we held also that it could not be granted-to one who came in as the indorser of a new note given to take up the first note, because he was a .stranger to the first contract, and was to be regarded as a mere volunteer. Woodward, J., said: “ While subrogation is founded on principles of equity and benevolence, and may be decreed where no contract exists, yet it will not be decreed in favor of a mere volunteer, who without any duty moral or otherwise pays the debt of another: Hoover v. Epler, 2 P. F. Smith, 522. It will not arise in favor of a stranger but only in favor of a party who, on some sort of compulsion, discharges a demand against a common debtor: Mosier’s Appeal, 6 P. F. Smith, 76. . . . There was no privity of interest, and no contract relation, between Bauer and Banker. Bauer could create no duty to himself by a volunteered intervention for Banker’s relief. He became Adam’s indorser without being under any legal or moral compulsion, and he had no existing interest, ascertained or contingent, to protect. He had no equity to entitle him to subrogation.”</p>

The defendant simply loaned the money, and, in order to remove a prior lien, paid it off without, the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff. If a right of subrogation is acquired in such a state of facts we see no reason why it may not exist in every case of officious payment of the debt of another. Yet it is perfectly clear under all the authorities that such payments do not give any right of subrogation to the debt discharged.</p>

In such a case instead of creating any right of subrogation, the payment operates as the absolute <a id="p637" href="#p637" data-label="637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*637</a>discharge of the debt so paid.
