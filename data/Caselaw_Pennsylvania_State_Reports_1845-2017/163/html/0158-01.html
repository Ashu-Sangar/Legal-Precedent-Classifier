It was the right of the defendant to have <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>the jury consider the advantages to the plaintiff’s. property which were special to it, and they should not have been confined to the advantage which it received “ over and above that to any other property.” The plaintiff’s property was not the only property taken, and presumably not the only property which received special advantages. Against the demand of each claimant it was for the jury to consider the advantages special to his property, but according to the instruction given this could be done only as to the claimant whose property had been most increased in value; and as to his property the allowance to the defendant would be limited to the increase over any other property, and not to the increase over the general advance in values.</p>

It was an incorrect statement of the rule, and calls for a reversal of the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b188-5" data-blocks='[["BL_188.5",188,[269,1369,1168,851]]]'>The submission to the jury of the effect of the destruction of the landing of James Mahaffey was also error. This landing was not on the plaintiff’s property, but on another tract of land in which he had no interest, and as to which he possessed no right. -Nothing was done on the plaintiff’s property to obstruct the way to a landing, but the landing of another person was destroyed. This landing was on the property of James Mahaffey ; it had belonged to him, and he had received compensation for its destruction. Yet the jury was allowed to consider it “ as bearing upon the question as to whether or not the property as a whole is inconvenienced and has suffered injury by reason of the construction of the railroad.” As in Grorgas v. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/144/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="144 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="823772" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0001-01">144 Pa. 1</a>, the plaintiff was deprived only of what did not belong to him. For the reasons stated the eighth, ninth, eleventh, thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth assignments of error are sustained, and the judgment is reversed and a new venire awarded.</p>
