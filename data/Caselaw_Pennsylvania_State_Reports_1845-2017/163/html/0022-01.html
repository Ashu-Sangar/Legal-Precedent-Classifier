Respondents are authorized by said act to extend their routes on certain streets named therein, ‘ and on such other street or streets south of Christian street west of Twentieth street north of Columbia avenue and east of Third street as the councils of the city of Philadelphia may from time to time permit or authorize.’ It is contended on behalf of the commonwealth that this language must be so construed as to permit tracks to be laid only on such street or streets as are at the same time south of Christian street and west of Twentieth street, or as are at the same time north of Columbia avenue and east of Third street, while respondents contend that they are authorized by the act to lay their tracks on any street or streets south of Christian street, north of Columbia avenue, west of Twentieth street, and east of Third street.</p>

We should not hesitate to apply this principle if we could find the language of the act to be ambiguous or of doubtful import, but after the most careful consideration we are unable to doubt its meaning. Counsel suggest that there are three possible interpretations of the clause in question, which are thus stated in their brief: ‘ It might be said that the grant authorizes the occupation only of such streets as comply with all the terms of the description; that is to say, it authorizes occupation only of some street which would be south of Christian and also north of Columbia avenue, and west of Twentieth and also east of Third street.’</p>

This leaves the grammatical construction precisely as before, and yet no one would contend that it does not clearly express that respondents could occupy any of the streets outside of the region bounded by the four streets named.

    <p id="b53-8" data-blocks='[["BL_53.8",53,[117,1200,1166,710]]]'>The facts so found, together with a full consideration of the questions involved and leading up to these conclusions, are all clearly and concisely stated in the opinion of the learned judge of the court below. As will be seen therein, the defendants base their right, to construct and operate the railway in question, upon said act of November 23, 1873, and the ordinance approved October 28, 1890. In addition to the powers theretofore granted to said Union Passenger Railway Co., the first section of said act authorizes it to extend its routes on certain specified streets in said city, “ and such other street or streets south of Christian street west of Twentieth street north of Columbia avenue and east of Third street as the councils .... may'from time to time permit or authorize to be used by said company with single or double tracks.”</p>
    <p id="b53-9" data-blocks='[["BL_53.9",53,[116,1917,1178,248]]]'>Two of said streets,—Christian in the southerly and Columbia avenue in the northerly section of the city,—run nearly east and west, and both are crossed at right angles by the other two,—Third and Twentieth streets—while York street, the lo-. cus quo, is north of and parallel with Columbia avenue.</p>
    <p id="b53-10" data-blocks='[["BL_53.10",53,[115,2174,1166,244]],["BL_54.1",54,[264,385,1161,655]]]'>The commonwealth’s contention is that the clause above quoted was not intended to embrace any street other than those streets and parts of streets within the lines of the. southwesterly angle formed by the intersection and extension of the lines of Christian and Twentieth streets, and also those within <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>the lines of the northeasterly angle formed by the intersection and extension of the lines of Third street and Columbia avenue. If the clause had been so worded as to read “ South of Christian street and west of Twentieth street, north of Columbia avenue and east of Third street,” there would be some ground for holding that streets and parts of streets, not within the lines of one or the other of said angles, were intended to be excluded; but there is nothing in the act itself or in its title, or dehors both, to justify any other construction than that given by- the court below. Everything that is necessary to be said on the subject will be found in the clear, concise and exhaustive opinion of its learned president; and on it we affirm the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b54-5" data-blocks='[["BL_54.4",54,[311,1049,356,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
