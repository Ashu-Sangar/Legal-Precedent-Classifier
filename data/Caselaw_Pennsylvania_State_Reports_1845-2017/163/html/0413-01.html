It must not be forgotten that this whole business was managed by the counsel for Mrs. Irwin and the estate. It was his duty to protect the estate as much as it was the duty of the executrix and his knowledge was her knowledge. As he could acquire no interest for himself, antagonistic to the estate, neither could he do so for his client, the executrix. She could not intrust him with the sole management of the estate and thus allow him to secure for herself an advantage which she was not permitted to do herself. He knew that the claim could be bought for $1,000 and he secured its purchase with the object, as he says, of having it in friendly hands. But what kind of friendship would that be which would buy a claim for $1,000, and then claim $15,000 for it. The rule appears to be imperative that the trustee cannot acquire an advantage or interest in a claim against the estate beyond the amount actually advanced for it. In this case by inducing others to buy up the claim for her use she was enabled to hold it until an advantage was secured hostile to the trust.</p>

Sanford, 1 Leading Cases in Equity, Hare and Wallace’s Notes, 3d Am. ed., p. 91, it is said: ‘It is a principle firmly maintained in the equity jurisprudence of this country, that a trustee is not at liberty to act or contract for his own benefit in regard to the subject of the trust, and .that the advantage of all that he does about the trust property shall accrue to the cestui que trust, if the latter desire it.- An independent interest in a trustee in the subject of the trust, would in its very nature be an interest hostile to the cestui qui trust, and that is. repugnant to the relation which the trustee has assumed. So far as he acts about the property for himself distinctly, he divests himself of the character of trustee for another, and this by his own act he cannot do. Whenever one person is placed in such relation to another by the act or consent of that other, or the act of a third person, or of. the law, that he becomes interested for him or interested with him in any subject of property or business, he is- prohibited from acquiring rights in that subject antagonistic to the person with whose interests he has become associated, and in Hill v. <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>Frazier, <a href="/pa/22/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="22 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="413713" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0320-01">supra,</a> it was said that, ‘ One who is charged with the duty of paying debts cannot make a speculation by buying them for his own use, whether he does it with his own money or not.’ The principle would be of little value if the act condemned could he done by the counsel for the trustee even without her consent or knowledge. The counsel in many cases, as in this, transacting all the business of the estate,, possessed of the knowledge thus gained, could thus secure claims for the trustee indirectly, what the law could not permit to be done directly. No better illustration of the mischief of such a rule could be had than is furnished in this case. If the counsel had at once notified Mrs. Irwin of the assignment and her interest therein she could have relinquished her claim or presented it for the benefit of the estate and thus have acted as the law requires, and she states in her testimony that she would not have confessed the judgment for more than $1,000 had she known the facts. By concealing them from her she was induced to claim an advantage for herself as against those she represented in her' capacity of executrix. We are therefore of opinion that as to other creditors this judgment cannot be enforced for more than $1,000 with interest from Feb. 9, 1881, but that it can be used until a dividend thereon pays that amount. We cannot therefore open or set aside the judgment, but by virtue of the power vested in us as a court of chancery, we can restrain collection beyond the amount really due.”</p>

The claim was purchased Feb. 9, 1881, and the judgment was entered Nov. 26,1886. The negotiations for the purchase were conducted by the attorney who recommended it; the assignment of the claim was delivered to him by the sellers, who received his check in payment of the sum for which they sold it, and he immediately made a memorandum on the back of the assignment showing how it was acquired and under what instructions he held'it. These instructions were to collect the claim, account to the purchasers for the money they invested in it, with interest thereon, and to pay the balance to the executrix. When the creditors of the estate attacked the judgment entered on the claim and succeeded in the lower court in setting it aside, he advised the surviving plaintiff and trustee therein to appeal to this court, but the latter declined to do so until indemnity was furnished against all costs and expenses of such appeal. It seems from this that he was anxious to maintain the judgment against the estate. A singular fact in connection with the transaction is that he carefully concealed it from <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>the executrix for whose benefit it was made. For ten years or more the trust feature of it was known only to him and the purchasers of the claim. The silence of the parties to the transaction in reference to the trust created by it is suggestive of a consciousness, or, at least, an apprehension on their part that the law would not enforce the. trust against the creditors of the estate.</p>
    <p id="b446-5" data-blocks='[["BL_446.4",446,[269,746,1170,1681]],["BL_447.1",447,[142,401,1168,1277]]]'>We think the evidence in'the case fairly establishes the existence of the facts recited, and that it fully justifies the conclusion that the nephews of the executrix were persuaded by the attorney of the estate to purchase the Woods claim “ with the understanding, intention and instructions ” that he should collect it and pay to her whatever was realized upon it above the cost of acquiring it. Such is the conclusion reached by the learned judge of the court below upon a careful consideration of all the testimony, and we see no reason to doubt the correctness of it. The controlling question arising from and founded upon it is whether the trust in favor of the executrix is enforceable against the creditors of the insolvent estate. The issue is in fact, though not in forpi, between them. The purchasers of the claim are not now demanding, and they have never demanded, anything from the estate on account of it beyond the amount they paid for it, together with interest thereon. The transaction evidenced by the assignment from one of them to Geo. W. Irwin was made to gratify the desire of the attorney of the estate to sustain the judgment, and it does not affect in any degree the rights of the real litigants, nor was it intended to do so. The law does not countenance speculation in claims against an estate by a person charged with the duty of administering it. He is not allowed to purchase such claims for his own profit. If he buys them for less than their face value he can only recover from the estate the amount he paid for them. If, in this case, the executrix had bought the Woods claim with' her own money for one thousand dollars, that would be all she could recover from the estate on account of it. The same rule applies to her attorney, who was her legal adviser in the administration of the estate, and who did most of the work pertaining to it. If she had induced her nephews to buy the claim, as they did, for her benefit, would she have been entitled to the profits, if any, derived from the purchase ? <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>If so, she would have acquired by it an interest in the claim adverse to the. estate she represented, and accomplished by indirection what she could not do directly, and what, the law does not tolerate. The creation of the' trust in her favor was due to the efforts of her counsel, and the parties to the transaction did not inform her that she was the beneficiary in it. But we think these facts do not give additional force to her contention or place her on better ground in this litigation than she would have occupied if she had done for herself what her counsel did for her. To this point the language- of the learned judge of the court below is so pertinent that we quote it. He said: “.It must not be forgotten that this whole business was managed by the counsel for Mrs. Irwin and the estate. It was his duty to protect the estate as much as it was the duty of the executrix, and his knowledge .was her knowledge. As he could acquire no interest for himself antagonistic to the estate, neither could he do so for his client, the executrix. She could not intrust him with the whole management of the estate and thus allow him to secure for herself an advantage which she was not permitted to do herself.” Without further elaboration of the subject we conclude that there is no error in the rulings, instructions or decree complained of. The latter is in conformity with well established principles recognized in the textbooks and enforced in the cases cited in the opinion of the court below, and in the briefs of the appellees.</p>
