It is the exclusive province of the jury, in the first place, to determine all disputed questions of fact, from the evidence before them; and then their special verdict is made up of those findings of fact, together with such undisputed facts as may be necessary to a just'decision of the cause. If important undisputed facts are omitted by mistake from the special verdict, or are incorrectly recited therein, the court may, upon full proof thereof, so amend dr mould the verdict as to make it conform to the undisputed facts. This should be done when the verdict is rendered or as soon as practicable thereafter. The court, in considering a special verdict and entering judgment thereon, is necessarily confined to the facts found and embodied in the verdict; the latter cannot be aided by intendment or extrinsic facts that may appear in the evidence. It is an inflexible rule that in a special verdict no inferences whatsoever, as to matters of fact, but only inferences of law and of legal construction are allowable: 4 Minor’s Inst. 752; Wallington v.

While these findings of fact, except those contained in the' third clause, may be regarded as distinct and sufficiently specific, it will be observed that the special verdict is silent as to terms and conditions of the policy given in evidence. , There is no finding that any lumber was destroyed by fire on May 19, 1891, or at any other time. These and other facts, obviously necessary to a just decision of the case, are left to conjecture, or must be sought for in the evidence. That, of course, is contrary to every correct precedent and cannot be sanctioned. Again, assuming, for the sake of argument, that the findings in the third clause are- sufficiently distinct and certain, and that they relate to a condition of things existing at a time and place material to the matter in controversy, there is nothing in the special verdict to which they are applicable. It is claimed that these findings-establish a breach of the “space clause” in the policy; but hów can we know that without going outside of the. special verdict and resorting to the evidence to ascertain <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>what the alleged “ space clause ” is ? Without further comment on this branch of the case, we are of opinion that, according to the authorities above cited, the special verdict is essentially defective and should be set aside.</p>

Defendant having been duly notified of the total loss, immediately sent its adjuster, Mr. Taylor, to the premises for the -purpose of inquiring into the circumstances of the fire and adjusting the loss. After making such examination as was deemed proper, an’d with a full knowledge of all- the circumstances attending the loss, etc., he informed plaintiffs that there would be no objection to payment, so far as the “space clause ” was concerned. The only objection he suggested was that plaintiffs had little if any lumber in the yard at time the fire occurred. As clearly shown by subsequent 'correspondence, the company, with full knowledge of all the facts, took the same position, and finally refused to pay on the sole ground 'that the lumber covered by the policy did not belong to plaintiffs. Under date of July 3, 1891, its general agent at Philadelphia wrote plaintiffs’ attorney thus: “ I note what you say as to the general agreement, as to the law of the case, between yourself and.'. . . our counsel, but with respect to the fact, it does not appear at all probable that we can come to a better understanding, as I have made a thorough investigation into <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>the matter, and believe that I can prove beyond all question that there was not a foot of lumber at the time of the sale in the yard of-Stevenson’s marked as the property of McCormick &amp; Son.”</p>
    <p id="b216-4" data-blocks='[["BL_216.4",216,[279,589,1175,503]]]'>A few days thereafter plaintiffs’ attorney again wrote, inclosing .notice of appointment of referee, etc., and said: “ I learn 'that no formal proof of loss, as required by the policy, was made. The reason it was not done was, that your adjuster, Mr. Taylor, said to.Mr. R. W. McCormick that no formal or other proof than he had was necessary. I don’t want any technical question about this formality to arise, to trouble us hereafter, and if you are not satisfied with what your adjuster ■ has done in this regard, I desire that you say.so now, so that we may put ourselves in proper shape.”</p>

You are therefore at liberty to bring suit at once, any right of exemption from suit under the 14th clause of the Royal policy being waiv.ed.”</p>

With that mutual understanding, plaintiffs were virtually invited to bring suit for' the purpose of determining that fact and nothing else. In view of the testimony it would be idle to suggest that the effect of the “ space- clause ” was overlooked by the company until after suit was brought. Such a thing is simply impossible, or at best extremely improbable; but, if it were otherwise, every principle of good faith and fair dealing required the company <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>to notify plaintiffs, when they were invited to bring suit to settle the question of ownership, that-the space clause would be made a ground of defence. If such notice had been given, non constat that they would'have risked the outlay of employing counsel, and the expenses of conducting a useless lawsuit. If, by.its willful conduct, the company led the plaintiffs on and induced them to incur expenses for the purpose of establishing their ownership of the lumber, in the belief that there was no other question in the case, justice and equitjr both forbid that in such circumstances the company should be permitted to impale them on the “ space clause.” If such a thing can be done, it would be difficult to conceive of a plainer case of bad faith, by which a party is induced to change his position for the worse and involve himself in useless trouble and expense. In view of its legitimate bearing, and tendency to prove such facts as ought to constitute a waiver of the space clause and estoppel, we think the proposed testimony was relevant. In connection with other evidence in the cause, it presents questions of fact which are proper for the consideration of the jury.</p>

Thereupon suit was brought and, at the trial, the company sought to interpose the additional defence that the proofs of loss were not filed in time. Mr. Chief Justice Church, speaking for the court of appeals, said: “I think it was estopped from so doing. The plaintiffs’ claim was challenged for fraud and that only. They acted upon it and brought an action, incurring large expense in its prosecution. Non constat, if the failure to file the proofs in time had been insisted on, but that the plaintiffs would have acquiesced in it and refrained from prosecuting, and thus they might be injured by the change of ground on the part of the defendant. Every consideration of public policy demands that insurance companies should be required to deal with their customers with entire fairness and frankness. They may refuse to pay, without specifying any ground, and insist upon any available ground, but when they plant themselves upon a specific defence, and so notify the assured, they should not be permitted to retract after the latter <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>has acted upon their position as announced, and incurred expenses in consequence of it.”</p>

Mr. Chief Justice Paxson in that case said: “ When an insurance company attempts to defeat a recovery upon a condition that was intended solely for its own benefit, and which deprives the assured, however honest his claim may be, of the indemnity which he paid for, it is not too much to hold the conipany to entire good faith.
