But where, as here, the shares pledged never stood in the name of the pledgor, but passed at once from the former owner to the pledgee, without anything done by the former to set them apart from other like shares of the latter, or even a request preferred to this effect,- -it is not perceived how, with any show of reason, it can be made a subject of complaint, that the pledge, necessarily, was mingled with the other similar stock of the pawnee. The plaintiff, by her agent, dealt throughout with the defendants as stock brokers, engaged in the business of buying and selling stock on their own and others’ ac-r count, and so constantly receiving and again transferring shares of stock, either by a blank power or bj’ a simple order of transfer entered upon the books of the corporation.

It would be difficult to imagine a severer application of the rule than was unhesitatingly made in Graeff’s Appeal^ supra. The creditor had three judgments, which were liens on the debtor’s real estate, and after the assignment the land was sold and the proceeds paid two of the judgments in full and part of the third, j'et in the distribution of the personal estate it was held that the creditor was entitled to a dividend on his entire debt, to wit, the amount of the three judgments.

The partners are. liable individually, but it is by reason of their membership of the firm, and their individual property is liable only secondarily. It is the settled rule that where there are partnership and sepárate creditors, and partnership and separate assets, and the firm is insolvent, each class has priority upon its respective estate : Black’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20Pa.%20508" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="44 Pa. 508">44 Pa. 508</a>. The appellant was in both classes, he had a judgment in each which gave him a primary claim on that particular fund. Such claim in either class was not lessened, nor its position altered in regard to its own class by his possession of collateral security in the shape of a primary claim ih the other. If he had had government bonds or railroad or other stock of an individual partner pledged for the firm debt, or a mortgage on individual real estate, his case would have been expressly within the decisions already cited, and there could have been no doubt that his claim on one fund would have been unaffected <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>by his security on the other.

The cases already cited, to which on this point may be added Miller’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/35/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="35 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="990502" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0481-01">35 Pa. 481</a>, Jordan’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/107/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="107 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="8856313" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0075-01">107 Pa. 75</a>, and Boltz’s Estate, <a href="/pa/133/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="133 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="812873" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0077-01">133 Pa. 77</a>, have settled that.the creditors become equitable owners of an insolvent estate in the proportions of their debts at the time .of the assignment. As on the one hand subsequent partial payment through means of outside collaterals does not diminish a creditor’s proportionate share of the assets assigned, so on the other an enlargement of his'claim by judgment including interest or penalties cannot increase such share. This was expressly decided in regard to an insolvent corporation, in Dean &amp; Son’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/98/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="112" data-cite="98 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="496927" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0101-01">98 Pa. 101</a>, in which the decision was rested on the rule above cited as to ownership by the creditors, and it was said that there was no reason why the same principle should not apply to both corporations and individuals. This case is the corollary of that, and we see no good ground to question the result then reached. The auditor’s first report reducing all judgments to an amount representing their value at the date of the assignment was correct, and the learned court was in error in calculating the dividend of the Indiana bank on a larger basis. Pittsburg and Steubenville R. R.’s Appeal, <a href="/grant/2/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="113" data-cite="2 Grant 151" data-case-ids="227731" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0151-01">2 Gr. 151</a>, is cited for the contrary view, but it is no authority for that position. In'that case a judgment had been recovered subsequent to the assignment, in which interest at twelve percent as a penalty had been included. The auditors allowed a dividend on the principal but not on the penalty. This court <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>held that the fact of its being recovered after the assignment gave the auditors no right to go behind the judgment; as to them it was conclusive in regard both to principal and penalty. The question of reducing it, together with the other claims, to its value at the uniform date of the assignment was not raised or decided.</p>
    <p id="b180-4" data-blocks='[["BL_180.4",180,[250,691,1165,1366]]]'>III. The claim of Redstrake was allowed in full on the ground that the stock was his property and its conversion was a breach of trust which enables him to follow the proceeds specifically. The facts will not sustain this view. The stock was Reds'trake’s, but it was converted prior to the assignment though on the same day, not directly by Jamison &amp; Co. but by creditors with whom they had pledged it. If the pledge was itself a conversion, as to which the facts are not clear, then the case is still stronger against the view taken by the learned court below. In either case no part of the proceeds can be traced directly to the assets which passed to the assignee. In a certain sense and as between Jamison &amp; Co. and Redstrake there was a breach of trust. But it was only such a breach as occurs whenever there is a wrongful conversion of one man’s property by another who has it in his hands, and not the technical breach of trust which authorizes a court to follow the proceeds through all their transmutations until thejr come to the hands of an innocent purchaser for value. This is not a question of Redstrake’s rights against Ja'mison &amp; Co. but One of distribution among the latter’s creditors, who by the assignment became owners of the assigned estate in the proportions of their claims at that date. When the assignment was made Redstrake’s property was gone; none of it came to the hands of the assignee; all that Redstrake had left was a claim for its conversion. The assignee took the assets subject to that claim and nothing more. There was no basis on which payment in full should have been decreed.</p>

In regard to measure of damages the claims of Redstrake, Bearn, Dow and Cooper are of the same nature, to wit, the pledge for their own debts by Jamison &amp; Co. of stocks belonging to the claimants and held as collaterals for other purchases, and the sale by the pledgees of the collaterals so pledged. On this state of facts the cases are not distinguishable from Work v. Bennett, <a href="/pa/70/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="70 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="1028151" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0484-01">70 Pa. 484</a>, where it was held that the measure of <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>damages was the market value of the stocks at the date of the-conversion. The auditor in his first report awarded dividends in accordance with this rule. Such award was correct and it was error to change it. Just what change was intended to be made by the court below is -not easy to grasp, as it is said with apparent correctness that the opinion and the decree are not consistent, 'and that many of the exceptions sustained are not consistent with the opinion or with each other. It is not worth our while to attempt to untangle the skein. We have indicated the. principles on which distribution should be made, and so far as appears to us the auditor’s first report conformed to them. Unless there are some points of discrepancy which have escaped us in going through the thirty-eight assignments of error in this appeal, and the nine others in the appeals argued with it, distribution should be made in accordance with that report.</p>
