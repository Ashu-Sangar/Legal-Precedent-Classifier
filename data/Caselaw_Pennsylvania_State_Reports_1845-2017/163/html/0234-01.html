But the attitude of courts' towards this defence has materially changed; the considerations which induced the legislature to pass the law have induced the courts to enforce it as a measure beneficial to the community, tending to quiet disputes, and on the whole to the promotion of justice, though in individual cases it may he apparently otherwise. Courts of equity are bound by the statute as courts of law, and enforce its provisions in the same spirit. Both at law and in equity the defence may be waived, and will be, considered as waived unless setup in the pleadings, before judgment.</p>

If it is lost it is by reason of the implied waiver arising from the fact that it was not interposed before judgment. But in this case the defendant has never had a day in court, nor any opportunity to set up his defence. The judgment was confessed upon a warrant of attorney simultaneous with the bringing of the suit, and this application was promptly made when notice of this was brought to the defendant. Notwithstanding the dictum of so' able a jurist as Mr. Justice Mitchell, in Woods v. Irwin, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20Pa.%20295" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="141 Pa. 295">141 Pa. 295</a>, we are of opinion that where a defendant in a judgment confessed, who has- had no day in court, promptly applies to have the judgment opened on the ground that the debt was barred by the statute before the judgment was entered, he should be given an opportunity to set it up, evén although no other ground <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>of defence be shown. It may be a dishonest defence, morally speaking, but neither courts of law nor equity are privileged to apply any other ethical standard than those established bylaw. There is no moral reason why a court should refuse to open a judgment in such a case as the present, which would not apply to any other case where the statute of limitations is relied upon, alone and unsupported by other defence.</p>

There was no trial on the merits after the rule to open was made absolute, and it is certainly a serious question whether an appeal can be taken at this stage of the proceedings, there being no final judgment. This question is not raised however by a motion to quash or in any other manner. It is not possible to consider now the other subjects which are discussed in the paper-books, as there is nothing to bring them on the record. The question whether the court of common pleas may open a judgment which has been entered upon an obligation not under seal after the expiration of six years from its maturity, is res adjudicata. It was positively decided in several of our modern cases, and had been substantially determined many years prior to either of them: Herman v. Rinker, <a href="/pa/106/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="106 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="455693" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0121-01">106 Pa. 121</a>; Sossong v.

    <p id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.8",261,[168,1563,1169,546]]]'>In the present case the defendant’s obligation was an ordinary promissory note dated November 10,1873, payable at one day after date, with an authority to any attorney to confess judgment for the amount of the note. It was not under seal. There was no judgment entered on the note until June 2,1881, more than seven years after its maturity. Other matters of defence were alleged in the defendant’s petition, but the court, in the order opening the judgment and granting an issue, prohibited any other plea than the statute of limitations, and thereupon the plaintiff took the present appeal without going.to tidal.</p>

We held not only that the judgment might be opened, but that, on the trial, any defence could he made Which could have been made if the action liad been brought upon the original instrument, without the powpr of attorney to confess judgment. We recognized the propriety of the ruling in Herman v. Rinker, that a judgment by confession might be opened for the very purpose of letting in the plea of the statute of limitations, and said: “ We held it was a matter in the discretion of the court below in any.event, and we could see no error in opening the judgment. A very sufficient reason lies in the fact that the defendant has had no hearing. When judgment is entered by confession, and, if upon the face of the obligation containing the authority to enter judgment it appears that tlie statute was a bar to the debt when the judgment was entered, it follows'that the defendant has had no opportunity to present a perfectly lawful and proper defence.”</p>
    <p id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.4",262,[242,1260,1167,298]]]'>That is this case precisely. On the face of the judgment note it appears that the judgment was entered at a time when the statute was a bar to the debt. That being so it follows that the defendant lias had no day in court when he might plead 'the bar of the statute. He is therefore entitled to be heard on that subject.</p>
