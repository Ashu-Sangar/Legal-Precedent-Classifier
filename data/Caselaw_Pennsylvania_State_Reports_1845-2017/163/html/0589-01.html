The defend<a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>•ant demurred to the claim on the ground that plaintiff’s compensation was fixed by the act of April 6, 1871, at $3,000, and he could lawfully claim compensation only under that act. His claim covered salary for the seven months ending July 31, 1891, during which time the fees earned and received by the county amounted in gross to $20,036.84. After deducting amounts payable to his deputies, there was a balance in favor of the county of $5,171.24. His claim for the seven months, was $2,916.66|.</p>

We think this case is not ruled- by that, as appears by our opinion in McCleary v. this same defendant herewith filed. [The second case above.] If the office of clerk of the courts had been compensated wholly by a salary, the judgment in this case would' have been right; but as a considerable part of the compensation is made up of fees, Bell v.
