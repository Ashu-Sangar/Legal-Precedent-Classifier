The grantees' in the deed presented the deed to the registry bureau for registry, and the same was registered Jan. 7, 1871. The deed was not registered in the name of the three owners, but in the name “ Henry Holthausen et al.” A claim for taxes was subsequently filed,, and, in the suit upon ■ the claim, the owners were suggested as “ Henry Holthausen et al.” Judgment was entered for want of an appearance, and the property was sold under a writ of levari facias to John Bardsley, and a deed was made to him. No notice was served upon Charles E. Claghorn, or Anna M. Fryer, executrix of Joseph C. Fryer, except by posting a notice on the premises, and they had no knowledge of the filing of the claim, or of the proceedings thereon, or the sale, until 1892.

Fryer purchased, as tenants in common in equal shares, the land in question, and their deed therefor was duly recorded September 23d following. As required by the registry act, they presented the deed to the proper officer for regis<a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>try, and he stamped thereon that the same was duly -registered January 7, 1871. Having thus performed their duty, the said owners had a right to rely upon the guarantee of the registry act that no proceeding should be taken, against their property except by process issued in their names as registered owners, and that proper effort would be made to serve such process on them. The act declares: “ If said duty .... shall have been . discharged by the party who shall have acquired title, in whatsoever manner, before the tax accrued as a lien of record, for which the same shall have been sold, the purchaser at the tax sale shall not acquire the title of such person who shall have performed said duty, or of his heirs and assigns, unless the sale shall have been made in the name of such owner, after service of process upon him, as in the ease of suit by summons.”</p>
    <p id="b367-5" data-blocks='[["BL_367.4",367,[134,1117,1164,1016]]]'>As has been suggested, the property was carelessly and negligently registered, not in the name of three owners, as it should have been, but in the name, “Henry Holthausen, et al.” The abbreviation, “ et al.” was thus substituted for the names of Charles E. Claghorn and Joseph C. Fryer, two of the owners. This was never corrected, nor does it appear that any effort was made to correct it. On the contrary, when the citj' filed its claim, the patent blunder of the registry bureau was repeated by the law department, notwithstanding the registry disclosed the date of the deed, etc., and the words “et al.” clearly indicated that Henry Holthausen was not the only owner. The result was that plaintiffs were deprived of that protection which it was the chief object of the registry act to ensure. The court was clearly right in virtually holding that the proceedings, from the defective registration down to the sale of the property both inclusive, were a series of blunders, the .consequences of which could not be visited on the plaintiffs. If defendant’s contention should prevail, the registry act, instead of being a protection to law-observing property owners, would be a snare into which any one might fall.</p>
