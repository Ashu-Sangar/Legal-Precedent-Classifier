The petitioners contend that so far as wholesale licenses are concerned, a discretion is vested in the court of quarter sessions to grant transfers of licenses from place to place under the language of the act of 1858, which mentions three cases <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>under which transfers can be made, and they are, (a) where’ the party licensed shall die, <em>(b~) </em>where the party licensed shall remove; (c) where the party licensed shall cease to keep such house.</p>
    <p id="b507-5" data-blocks='[["BL_507.4",507,[131,611,1180,557]]]'>And in all of these three cases the license may be transferred or license be granted to the successor of such party. Now it is respectfully contended that if the three cases for transr fer mentioned in said act were intended to apply to transfer-only from person to person, there would be' no need to make distinction, as is made in said act, between a renewal or ceasing to keep said house, because the said clauses are not in the conjunctive but in the disjunctive, and a removal, unless it is held to amount to the same as ceasing to keep such house, must necessarily give to the court a discretion to grant a,license, in the case of a removal to another place.</p>
    <p id="b507-6" data-blocks='[["BL_507.5",507,[130,1178,1179,507]]]'>If the act of 1887 did not interfere with the exercise of a discretion in the court to transfer liquor license from place to place, the right of the court still exists, since the act of 1891 contains nothing to interfere with the right of the court to make such transfer. • It is respe'ctfully submitted that, the view-of the court below, namely, “ that the advertisement required-by the act of 1887 and 1891, is of .no avail if transfers were allowed,” is without force, because, since. Blumenthal’s Casé, transfers are made without advertisement, though the act of 1887 especially requires full advertisement.</p>

The jurisdiction vested in the judges of the quarter sessions to grant liquor licenses and, in certain circumstances, to authorize the <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>licensee to transfer his license to his successor in the business, etc., is purely statutory. There ’appears to be nothing in the law. however that authorizes them to sanction the transfer of licenses from one locality to another. It therefore follows that in refusing to authorize the transfer of plaintiffs’ license, as prayed for, the defendants acted strictly within the line of official duty, and there is nothing on which to sustain this proceeding.</p>
