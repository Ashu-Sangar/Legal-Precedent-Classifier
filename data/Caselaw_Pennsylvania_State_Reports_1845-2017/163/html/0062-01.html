They required of him, as of others, the payment of a fixed charge on all cattle received. In January, 1882, he made out a statement of the amount he had paid them, and demanded that repayment should be made on the ground that the charges exacted were unjust and illegal, as no accommodations had been furnished him, and the landing in their yards was the landing for delivery by the railroad companies.</p>

On the day that the statement, which amounted to $1,241.40, was rendered by the defendant, he purchased of Martin, Fuller &amp; Co. cattle amounting in price to over $4,000, and offered to pay for the same; first deducting the $1,241.40 which he claimed was due him.</p>
