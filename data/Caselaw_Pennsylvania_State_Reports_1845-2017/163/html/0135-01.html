If, therefore, the guard rails were up as defendant alleges, it necessarily follows that the plaintiff and Mrs. Mowrey did not and could not go off the bridge as they allege ; and if they did not <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>go off the bridge in the manner alleged by them, the plaintiff cannot recover in this action, and it is immaterial how the accident occurred. Were there guard rails up, as alleged by the defendant ? Upon that question of fact considerable testimony has been produced, and without further remark we will leave it to be decided by you in accordance with the weight of the credible testimony in the case. If there were no guard rails was the township guilty of negligence in not providing them in the first instance, or in not replacing them after they had been broken down, if they were provided in the first instance ? If proper guard-rails were originally provided, but were broken down or removed through no fault of the defendant or its officers, then the inquiry would arise, did they have actual notice that they were down, or had they been down for such length of' time that in the exercise of the care required of supervisors they ought to have known that they were down ? The court does not declare, as an absolute, unqualified rule of law, that it was the duty of the township to erect and maintain guard rails on this bridge or its approaches. Whether it was their duty, and whether the omission to provide barriers at the side of the bridge was negligence, is a question of fact to be decided by' the jury. In some cases it would be negligence ; in other cases it might not be. The question is to be determined by the jury on a fair and reasonable view of all the facts and circumstances of the case, taking into consideration the length of the bridge, its width, its height, the nature of the approaches, the amount of the travel, and all of the circumstances. Upon this question we quote from a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Plymouth Township v. Graver, <a href="/citations/?q=125%20Pa.%2032" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="125 Pa. 32">125 Pa. 32</a>.” .... Plaintiff’s point was among others as follows :</p>
