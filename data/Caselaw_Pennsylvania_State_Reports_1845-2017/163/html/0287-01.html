The policy in question was undoubtedly a policy executed by one hundred individual persons and contracting for individual liability of all. The point is made in argument that, although the word “ company” is used in the act it must be held to mean “ corporation ” only, upon the plain reading of the act, and we think this proposition is entirely correct. The act of 1876 is a supplement to the act of April 1,1873, P. L. 20, entitled an act to establish an insurance department, and is itself entitled as follows, “A supplement to an act entitled ‘ An act to establish an insurance department,’ approved the fourth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three, providing for the <em>incorporation </em>and regulation of insurance companies, and relating to insurance agents and brokers and to foreign insurance companies.” The first section of the act provides “ that any ten or more persons, citizens of this commonwealth, may associate in accordance with the provisions of this act, and form, an <em>incorporated company </em>for any of the following purposes,” enumerating four different purposes. The second section provides that the persons associating themselves together shall do so “ by articles of agreement in writing for the purpose of forming an insurance company, which agreement shall specify the name by which <em>the corporation </em>shall be known,” etc. Then follow numerous provisions regulating the details of the organization and government of companies formed under the act, including joint stock companies, and in which the companies formed are constantly described or referred to as “incorporated under this act.” Thus section 34 provides that “ Companies <em>incorporated </em>under this act, must be organized upon the joint stock or the mutual plan, and the power to insure upon both plans shall not exist in the <em>corporation </em>except temporarily,” etc. Section 35. “ If any <em>corporation </em>created under this act does not commence to issue policies within one year from the date of its letters patent, its <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>
      <em>corporate </em>powers and existence shall cease.” Section 39. “ The charters for <em>incorporations </em>named in this act may be perpetual or limited in time,” etc. Section 40. “ That no fire, marine, or fire and marine insurance company, <em>incorporated </em>by any other state or government shall be authorized to transact business in this state unless,” etc. Section 42. “That every insurance company of this state, <em>incorporated </em>or organized after” April 4, 1873, “ which has failed to file with the insurance commissioner a certified copy of its charter, shall file such copy within ninety days,” etc'., and “ every <em>company </em>hereafter organized shall file a copy of its <em>charter </em>with the commissioner within ninety days from the date of said charter,” etc. The 43d and 44th sections describe the organizations as companies, evidently meaning corporations, as for instance in the 44th the words occur, “ with the agents of any insurance <em>company </em>not <em>incorporated </em>in this commonwealth.” The 46th section imposes a penalty upon persons transacting business as insurance brokers without a certificate of authority <em>as aforesaid. ■ </em>Then comes the 47th section which imposes penalties upon persons acting as agents for insurance companies of any other state or government. It is perfectly clear that the word “ companies ” is here used, as it is throughout the act, as the equivalent of the word “ corporations.” They are indiscriminately and constantly employed as synonyms in all the sections of the act in which they appear, and as this view is consistent with the subject of the legislation as described in the title, and in the chief enacting section, the first, which authorizes only the formation of <em>incorporated </em>companies, we do not feel at liberty to diverge from that construction, in considering the 47th section.</p>

The eleventh section of that act is the one which prohibits the transaction of business by agents until they have procured from the insurance commissioner a certificate that the company they represent has complied with the requirements of the act of 1873. A reading of that section convinces us that the companies referred to in the 11th as also in the 10th section are incorporated companies. The eleventh section refers to the <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>tenth in designating the kind of companies which shall obtain certificates and those companies as described in the 10th section, “ any insurance company of another state or foreign government.” It can scarcely be considered that this description was intended to include any other than regularly incorporated companies.</p>
