In that year, 1888, the city for its own purposes changed the grade of Roxborough avenue. It is contended, on the part'of the plaintiff, that that . was an injury to the value of his land. It is contended that it was an injury, as I understand it, for two reasons. In the first place some thirteen and one half feet were taken from his ground along Roxborough avenue, and in the second place for a distance of some three hundred feet on the upper side of Manayunk avenue there was an elevation of Roxborough avenue so that it stood above the plaintiff’s land at one point eleven feet or <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>more, and the effect of it was that all along the three hundred feet it was raised above the plaintiff’s land. That is the main part of the contention of the plaintiff with respect to his injuiy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b370-5" data-blocks='[["BL_370.4",370,[254,607,1164,607]]]'>“ On the other hand the defendant contends that before this change of grade was made on Roxborough avenue there was a descent of some twenty-three and one half feet in two hundred and seventy feet from Pechin street, making a very steep descent, and at the junction of Roxborough avenue and Manayunk avenue there was what is called a basin, Roxborough avenue rising from that point on toward Belair street and toward Terrace street, and as after the change of grade there is a gradual, descent from Pechin street along the front of the plaintiff’s property of not more than two and one half feet, in one hundred, that the plaintiff has been benefited by that change in the grade.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b370-6" data-blocks='[["BL_370.5",370,[251,1221,1166,812]]]'>“ The city also contends; as I understand counsel for the city, that if there has been an injury to the plaintiff’s land much of the injury is due not to the change of grade on Roxborough avenue but to the opening of Manayunk- ayenue and Pechin street. Upon this latter question you will remember that what you have to consider is the effect upon the whole of the plaintiff’s land of the change of Roxborough avenue alone. - Tf there has been any injury which is the result of the opening of other streets, Manayunk avenue and Pechin street, you must dismiss that from your consideration entirely. Although these streets may have been opened at or about the same time, the question is exactly as if those streets had been open at some other time, in the past, or as if they remained to be opened in the future. ■If such streets have been opened the plaintiff either has recovered his damages or will have an opportunity to recover damages for the injury resulting from the opening of those streets.”</p>

    <p id="b372-5" data-blocks='[["BL_372.6",372,[247,444,1173,1627]]]'>Under the'pleadings and the agreement of the parties the jury were charged with the duty of ascertaining from the evidence submitted to them, the depreciation, if any, in the market value of the plaintiff’s property caused by the widening and change of grade of Roxborough avenue. In the performance of this duty it was proper for them to take into consideration the condition of the property immediately before the work of widening and changing the grade of the street was commenced and the condition of it.immediately after the work was completed. It was competent for the parties to present evidence descriptive of its condition at either time, and evidence explanatory of the effect upon it of the work done. But the condition referred to must be an actual condition discoverable by observation of the' property, not a prospective or possible one depending for a physical existence upon the future action of the municipality. Hence a street laid out but not opened cannot be taken into consideration in assessing the damages caused by the opening or change of grade of another street upon the same property. Negley Avenue, <a href="/pa/146/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="146 Pa. 456" data-case-ids="827936" data-case-paths="/pa/146/0456-01">146 Pa. 456</a>. If Manayunk avenue was opened and graded before Roxborough avenue was widened and the grade of it physically changed, the plaintiff could not, in a proceeding for the assessment of the damages sustained by the opening and grading of the former, have acquired or lost anything by the contemplated or prospective change of the grade of the latter. It logically follows that proceedings for the assessment of damages caused by the opening and grading of Manajurnk avenue are not admissible to affect a claim for damages caused by the widening and physical change of grade of Roxborough avenue. It is proper to state in this connection that there was no offer to prove on the trial of the present case that the damages claimed in it were recovered, or the plaintiff’s right to them adjudicated,in any former proceeding.</p>
