Plaintiff proposed to purchase the lands, and had full knowledge of the extent of defendant’s agency. After the negotiations had been begun, defendant told plaintiff that the owner had authorized him to sell the land, but he showed plaintiff no written authority. The sale was then concluded and plaintiff paid to defendant portions of the purchase money, but at very irregular intervals, and never tendered the balance due. <em>Held, </em>that there was no such fraud on plaintiff as prevented the running of the statute of limitations against his claim.</p>

The plaintiff’s whole cause of action hinges, on the narrow question <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>of fact whether defendant represented that he had a “ power of attorney ” or merely an “ authority ” to sell. If the latter then' there was no fraud, for it is clear that he had verbal authority and that his arrangement with plaintiff was ratified by Mackey. But even if the defendant represented that he had a power, or a warrant of attorney, the weight of the evidence is that plaintiff knew the whole situation and was not in any way deceived. Defendant had a written letter of attorney from Mackey, duly recorded, giving him authority to lease and managé the property, collect the rents, etc., but not 'extending to a power to sell, and plaintiff himself testified that defendant told him “ he had no power of attorney to sell ” but was going to Philadelphia to see Mackey, and subsequently said “he had got it fixed all right.” As well and tersely stated by the learned judge below, “ we have the undisputed fact that Davis knew it was Mackey’s land, and also knew that Hawkins’s power of attorney did not authorize him to sell and convey land, and when Hawkins told him Mackey authorized him to sell it, and produced no written authority, the inference is irresistible that Davis knew Hawkins’s authority was by parol.” The whole evidence shows that the transaction was conducted in a loose and informal waju By the contract as set forth in the receipt for the first payment, the rest of the purchase money was to be paid at stipulated times and amounts, the last being three hundred and fifty dollars due July 1,1878. There is no pretence that these terms were complied with by plaintiff. On the contrary his payments were irregular both as to time and as to amount, and the last one was never made in full at all, though nearly twelve years elapsed between the time it was due and the bringing of this suit. In the meantime Mackey had died, and his heirs for a time at least disclaimed any interest in the land. The whole matter was allowed to run on at the loosest possible ends. Whatever may be the rights of Mackey’s heirs or representatives to an account from defendant for tlieSnoney paid him by plaintiff, it is entirely clear that there was no such fraud on the latter as prevented the running of the statute of limitations against his claim, even as to money paid after' Mackey’s death, when defendant’s authority, whatever it was, had expired.</p>
