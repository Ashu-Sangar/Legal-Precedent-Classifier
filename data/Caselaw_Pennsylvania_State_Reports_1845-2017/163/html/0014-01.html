These four children of Benjamin Obenstein claimed before the auditor the personal estate of decedent as nearest of kin.

Not a single witness was called who knew anything of the life of either of them before Susan became the wife of Henry Pickens. The most that was proved to establish the fact of marriage was the declarations of the decedent to the witness, Isaac Zern, when he remarked to him some twenty years ago that Benjamin Obenstein was his half-brother; that when Benjamin died he said his half-brother had died; that when decedent’s sister Betsy died he directed the witness to go for the preacher to conduct the funeral services and to send a postal card to each of his half-brother’s (Benjamin’s) children. He told the same witness on another occasion that his father, Henry Pickens, had to pay too much when old Obenstein came back, so that he would go away again; that old Obenstein was a German, and that when he landed in this country he was indebted for his passage across the <em>ocean; </em>that Obenstein came to his mother’s home and married her, and her father finding that Obenstein was not free he went and paid the fare for Obenstein and then wanted Obenstein to work two years, for him. Then, he continues, Obenstein went off, and upon returning later, found that Susan was living with Henry Pickens, father of decedent, who had to pay him twenty dollars to go away again. In this the witness is corroborated by his wife, Leah Zern. In addition to the above, claimants called <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>as a witness Susanna Obenstein, widow of the-said Benjamin Obenstein, who is now about eighty-eight years of age, by whom were proven certain declarations made by Susan Brockey (then Pickens), and among other things witness asked her, how is it that Benjamin is called Obenstein and lie was raised by Pickens ? She replied, my first husband’s name was Obenstein ; we lived together not a year and had a little.boy, but that he did- not live long ; then we lived together a couple of years longer and got another little boy, and we raised that one and you have him for a husband; that Benjamin often spoke of Samuel, the decedent, and his sisters as his half-brother and half-sisters, and they spoke of him as their half-brother, and that she often spoke of her having been married to Obenstein before she was married to Pickens ; that decedent spoke to witness of the relationship and of Benjamin as his half-brother.

It was admitted that Benjamin Obenstein and Samuel Pickens were children of the same mother, that the father of the former was John Obenstein and of the latter Henry Pickens. The marriage of their mother to Henry Pickens was amply established by proof of cohabitation and reputation, and the question was whether she had previously married John Obenstein.</p>

The learned auditor held that, the marriage being denied,' the presumption of the legitimacy of the issue did not prevail, and that the burden of proof was upon the appellant, and that the proof offered was insufficient to support his claim.

In the absence of all evidence the presumption was the .other way, and after this lapse of time could not have been removed except by clear proof. There was nothing in the admitted facts upon which his right prima facie rested, to suggest the illegitimacy of any one in either line of descent. Their common ancestor, Susan Pickens, had at different times lived with John Obenstein and Henry Pickens, and had borne children to each. The cohabitation with one commenced fully ninety years ago, and that with the. other a few years later. The last survivor of these persons died over thirty years ago. There was no distinct evidence of a marriage to either, but presumably she was the lawful wife of each. Such a presumption is entirely consistent with the facts as established by the testimony, but if conflicting presumptions arose that in favor of innocence and legitimacy <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>would prevail. It was error to hold that the simple denial of marriage before the auditor, without a word of testimony upon the subject, imposed upon the appellant the burden of the proof of the legitimacy, of his ancestor. This burden however he accepted, and offered the only proof of which the subject was susceptible, which, although hearsay, was competent and conclusive. This was by evidence of statements made long before any litigation arose, by pérsons related to the family and now dead. These statements establish the first marriage, the cohabitation, the birth of issue, the death of the first husband, the second marriage, the birth of children by that, and the recognition, during the lives of all these parties, of the relationship between the decedent and the father of the appellant. This testimony throughout was clear, distinct and consistent, and no attempt was made to contradict it. The only doubt suggested was by the statement of Samuel Pickens that John Obenstein returned after the marriage of Henry Pickens to his mother and was paid to go away. It must be remembered that in the same connection he said that his mother had been married to John Obenstein, and that he was speaking of a matter of which he had no personal knowledge. There is nothing in this to give rise to the presumption of the illegitimacy of Benjamin Obenstein, and there is nothing else in the case upon which such a conclusion can be based.</p>
