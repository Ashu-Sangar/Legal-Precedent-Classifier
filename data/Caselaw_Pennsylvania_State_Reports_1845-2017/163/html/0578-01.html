Therefore the legislature passed the act of March 31, 1876, entitled “ An act to carry into effect section 5," article xiv of the constitution, relative to the salaries of county officers, and the payment of fees received by them, into the state or county treasury, .in counties containing over one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants.”</p>

The 5th section declares that: “ All county officers within the counties to which this act applies .... and their several deputies and clerks, shall be paid for their services by fixed and specific salaries, which shall be a charge upon the treasury of the county to which each shall respectively belong, to the extent of the fees collected and paid.in by each officer respectively, or earned, where' fees are chargeable upon the county treasury.” The 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th sections relate to the adjustment of the salaries of the officers and clerks, where the-fees do not reach the amount of salaries, and <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>provide that the county commissioners and controllers shall constitute a board for supervision and adjustment, and further provide for an appeal from their decision to the court of common pleas. The 12th section fixes the annual salary of the sheriff in counties containing over 800,000 inhabitants at $15,000. In those under 300,000 and over 250,000, at $6,500. In those under 250,000 and over 150,000, the same amount was fixed for the sheriff, but the salary was put at a lower figure than in the second classification, for some other of the county officers. Section 15 enacted that the salary so fixed should be in lieu of all fees and mileage now received. Sections 16, 17 and 18 provide that certain officers shall be paid quarterly, who shall be deemed county officers, and also when the act shall take effect.</p>

Then came the act of June 13,1883, entitled “ An act to fix the salaries to be paid county officers in counties containing over five hundred thousand inhabitants, being a supplement to an act approved 31st March, 1876, entitled ‘ An act to carry into effect section 5, article XIV, of the constitution, relative to salaries of county officers .... in counties containing over one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants.’ ” The act contains but two sections; Section 1“ Be it enacted: that in counties containing over five hundred thousand inhabitants, the annual salaries of county officers shall be as follows, namely : Of the sheriff, fifteen thousand dollars,” and further, along with the sheriff’s, a schedule of the salaries of all other county officers. Then section 2 particularizes all the salaries to be paid under the act of 1876, so far as relates to counties containing over 300,000 inhabitants, and expressly repeals so much of said act as embraces that class ; and further directs that the supplement shall only affect officers elected after its passage. By the census of 1890, Allegheny county had a population of <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>551,959, so that, as far as population is concerned, it came within the terms of this supplementary act, and within the terms of the unrepealed provisions of the original act of 1876.</p>
    <p id="b608-4" data-blocks='[["BL_608.4",608,[252,522,1171,1469]]]'>But it is argued, the act of 1876 does not apply to Allegheny county, because all the county officers of that county were Salaried under the provisions of the act of 6th March, 1872, relating to Allegheny county, and the former being a general affirmative statute, does not, without positive repugnancy, repeal the particular or local statute. That this is a settled .rule of construction cannot be questioned; and, although it is manifest the constitution of 1874 sought to enforce uniformity of compensation of county officers in counties of the same class, the end must be attained by laws which leave no doubt of their intent to repeal local laws not in conformity with the general law. The rule of construction on this subject has been stated in Johnston’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=38%20Pa.%20511" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="38 Pa. 511">38 Pa. 511</a>, where it is held, following Harcourt v. Fox, 1 Shower’s R. 520, an affirmative statute introductive of a new law on the same subject does imply a negative of the former law, if they are repugnant. Or, as stated in Dillon on Municipal Corporations, section 54, for which he cites cases in our own and many other states: “ It is a principle of very extensive operation, that statutes of a general nature do not repeal by implication charters and special acts passed for the benefit of particular municipalities'; but they do so, when this appears to have been the purpose of the legislature. I£ both the general and the, special acts can stand, they will be construed accordingly. If one must give way, it will depend upon the supposed intention of the lawmaker, to be collected from the entire course of legislation, whether the charter is superseded by the general statute, or whether the special charter provisions apply to the municipality, in exclusion of the general enactments.”</p>

      <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>If, under the act of 1872, the office of sheriff of Allegheny county was a purely salaried office, there would be no such inconsistency between it and the act of 1876, as would work a repeal of the former; for, the mere fact, that under the last, a higher compensation was awarded sheriffs, than under the first, would only indicate a legislative intent that other sheriffs ■should be paid more. But in ascertaining the legislative mind, we must take into consideration, first, the moving cause of the general law. The members -of the general assembly were bound to enact the necessary laws to carry into effect the eon■stitution of 1874. .That said in unmistakable terms, “You must regulate by law the compensation, of all county officers, ■and, in all counties having over 150,000 population, they shall be paid by salaries, and they must pay all fees into the state or ■county treasury.” Here was a positive command that in this ■class of counties these officers must be paid by salaries and not •by fees; it was not to compensate them by part salary and part fees, but wholly by salary. As shown by the debates, the very ■object of the provision was to relieve the public in large counties from obnoxious exactions and exorbitant and vexatious charges, ■•prompted by the self interest of the officer, when the fees went into his own pocket.</p>
    <p id="b609-3" data-blocks='[["BL_609.4",609,[140,1506,1178,287]]]'>And in the same spirit, as shown by the first words of the first section of the act of 1876, the legislature obeyed this mandate : “ All fees .... received by each and every county officer .... shall belong to the county.” It then fixes the salaries which they were to receive, and this was all they were to receive.</p>
    <p id="b609-4" data-blocks='[["BL_609.5",609,[142,1813,1175,303]]]'>Now take the act of 1871 to which that of 1872 is a supplement.

The fee for serving a writ could be verified by an inspection of the fee bill; the number of miles the sheriff or <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>his deputies traveled to serve it, was, in many cases, incapable of verification, and conscious wrong was often submitted to. Did the legislature intend, by the act of 1876, that in the second most populous county in the commonwealth, the most prominent county officer should retain a large part of his fees and a large part of his power of exaction, in the face of the constitutional command? Or did they intend to embrace him, and all sheriffs receiving fees in counties of like population, in the language, “ In all counties in this commonwealth containing over one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants, all fees . . . received by each and every county officer .... shall belong to the county?”</p>

It was held, in an opinion approved by this court, that the district-attorney, under the act of 1876, was entitled to a salary of §5,000, and all fees were payable into the county treasury; on the ground that the acts of 1871 and 1872 were irreconcilably inconsistent with the act of 1876, and were clearly intended to be repealed by the last mentioned act.</p>

That case involved the compensation of the county treasurer, which was fixed by the local acts of May 1, 1861, and March 11,1870. As presented in the court below, and on ap-. peal in this court, the sole question was, whether the salary of this officer was fixed by the local act of 1870, or by tbe general law. Under either act, it was assumed, by counsel and by the-<a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>court below, that he would be paid a salary. Not whether he should be paid fees and' salary under a local act or wholly salary under a general act.</p>

Here there is irreconcilable hostility between the principles on which' the statutes are founded; one is passed to strike down the fee system with its abuses; the other clings to and nourishes it. In the Bell case, as argued* both statutes accomplished the same end, that sought for by the fundamental law, compensation wholly by salary; in the case before us, if affirmed, the worst feature in the fee system, sheriff’s mileage, will be retained.</p>

Allegheny County, <a href="/pa/149/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="149 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="832571" data-case-paths="/pa/149/0381-01">supra,</a> it is assumed throughout, that the question was whether a local salary act was impliedly repealed by a general salary act passed since the adoption of the constitution. The paper-books give no intimation that the compensation of that officer was partly fees. In Com. v. Grier, supra, President Judge Ewing distinguishes that case from Bell v. Allegheny County, because, in Bell’s case, the salary of the county treasurer had been definitely fixed without any fees, at the date of the adoption of the new constitution. It is suggested now, by appellee’s counsel, that the county treasurer, under another local act, that of 1872, was entitled to receive one dollar fee for each printed bond' in license cases. Whether the preparation and printing of this bond was intended to be an item of expense to be thus charged for, or a fee for services, is not’ clear. But, however this may be, this court, and all others, hear and decide cases on the issues presented of record; the judgments in them are authority for what is passed on and decided. They are not precedents for issues not raised until two years after final judgment. Bellv. Allegheny-County is the law of that case and all others like unto it. It is not authority in the cases of other county officers, where the contention is on radically different facts. It is not clear to us from the computation of fees earned and received that, the whole of plaintiff’s claim is allowable, therefore the judgment of the court below sustaining the demurrer is reversed at costs of appellee, and the record is remitted that the cause may be proceeded in to final judgment.</p>
