He engaged rooms and board for them at a hotel, where he paid their board. Defendant, offered to pay his wife $125 a month, but she refused the offer, claiming that it was insufficient. There was evidence that defendant’s income from his banking business was $20,000 per year. The goods for which suit was brought were ordered by and delivered to defendant's wife after the separation. Bills for similar articles previously ordered by her had been paid by defendant. There was no evidence that plaintiff knew of the separation when the goods were delivered.

    <p id="b672-7" data-blocks='[["BL_672.11",672,[246,1196,1168,859]]]'>An examination of the testimony, in support of the plaintiff’s claim, cléarly shows that it was not only proper for the consideration of the jury, but, if believed, would have warranted them in finding that the defendant, without apparent justification, practically deserted his wife and child, and neglected to make such provision for their support and maintenance as their necessities required and his own financial condition would have enabled him to furnish. It also shows that the goods for which suit was brought,—consisting chiefly of toilet articles, drugs, medicines, infant’s food, etc., ordered by and delivered to defendant’s wife for the use of herself and their infant child,— were necessaries suitable to their condition and circumstances. Bills for similar articles, previously ordered by her, had been presented to and paid by defendant. There is no evidence that plaintiff was aware of any change in the domestic relations of the defendant and his wife until payment of the account in suit was demanded and refused by defendant.</p>
