Dorey, W. Dorey, and Eowler that they should plant tobacco and harvest and pack the crop, of which they were to receive one half. There was to be no actual division of the tobacco, but McCormick was to sell it and divide the proceeds. McCormick sold the whole crop of the farm to defendant, receiving at the time of the sale two hundred dollars. The Eowler crop seems to have been destroyed, and was not delivered. The crop of the two Doreys, which was valued at twelve hundred and-six dollars, was delivered. Defendants, claiming that the two hundred dollars paid at the time of the sale was paid on account of all three crops, deducted that amount, and paid to McCormick one thousand and six dollars. Subsequently McCormick and the two Doreys brought <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>suit to recover the two hundred dollars. It appeared that McCormick had paid to the Doreys one half of the sum for which their crops were sold, and that he had paid Fowler for his claim. The court left it to the jury to say whether the two hundred dollars had been paid on account of all three crops, or on account of the Fowler crop alone, as plaintiffs claimed. <em>Reid, </em>that a verdict and judgment for defendants should be sustained.</p>

No actual division of the tobacco was to be made, but McCormick was to sell the whole crop of the farm, and divide the proceeds.

So that you see the whole question in this' case for your determination is'whether or not the $200 was to be applied to the Fowler crop, and if it was, whether the Fowler crop or any portion of it was merchantable, and whether or not it was offered to be delivered by Mr. McCormick and the defendants refused to take it, in which case there cóuld be a recovery for the plaintiff, otherwise the verdict must be for the defendants in both cases.] ” [3]</p>

It was raised on his farm, under an arrangement with Fowler and the Doreys which he described on the. trial as follows : “ They received the half for planting it and working it, and taking care of it and packing it.” Surely this arrangement did not make the parties to it tenants in common of the tobacco or partners in raising it, nor establish between them the relation of landlord and tenant. Fowler and the Doreys were employees of McCormick in raising the tobacco, and were to receive one half of it as compensation for their labor. They were croppers, and as such they acquired no property in the tobacco before it was divided: Fry v. Jones, <a href="/rawle/2/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Rawle 11" data-case-ids="1820571" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0011-01">2 Rawle, 11</a>; Adams v.

The conditions on which the jury were permitted to so consider it were that the payment was- made on account of the tobacco which McCormick sold to the defendants at that time, or that he became indebted to them in that amount by his failure to deliver the Fowler crop in accordance with his agreement. We think the instructions, read in the light of these conditions or qualifications and the evidence in the case, were promotive of justice and free from error. In the first place McCormick, as apparent owner of the tobacco, agrees to sell and deliver it to them. Their agreement was in writing and with him. The designation of the tobacco in this agreement as the “Wm. Dorey crop and Al. Dorey crop ” or “ the Fowler crop,” did not make Fowler or the Doreys parties to the agreement or partners of McCormick in the sale, nor was it intended to do so. In the next place it appears from the testimony of McCormick that he paid the Doreys one half the <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>sum for which the Dorey crops were sold, and it appears from the evidence of Fowler that, shortly after the sale of the tobacco to the defendants, McCormick paid Mm for his interest in or claim upon it, in consummation of previous negotiations between them in relation thereto. From the evidence produced by the appellants it therefore appears that the defendants paid McCormick for all the tobacco he delivered to them, that he paid the Doreys all they were entitled to receive under his agreement with the defendants, and that he purchased and paid for the interest or claim of Fowler. He was therefore the sole equitable owner of the claim in suit, and the first payment made by the defendants, whether on account of all the tobacco purchased at that time or on account of the Fowler crop alone, was available as a set-off or equitable defence to it: Childerston v. Harnmon, 9 S. &amp; R. 68.</p>
