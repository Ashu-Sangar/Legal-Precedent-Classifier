No facility to fraudulent dealing is afforded by it, that is not- afforded, in the same degree, by a naked contract of bailment. Such a transaction includes two distinct but consistent contracts, the one taking effect, if at all, when the other is spent. The contract of bailment preserves the ownership of the bailor during the particular relation created by it, and the contract of sale, which supersedes it, transfers the title as soon as it is called into action, by payment of the. price.”</p>

Sharp, <a href="/pa/51/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="51 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="999837" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0026-01">51 Pa. 26</a>, was decided. The ultimate object there was a sale, but a preservation of the title in the grantor with possession in the grantee was desired and accomplished, until, by the payment of the full consideration, the provision for a sale was brought into action. The contract there was a lease of two billiard tables for nine months, upon payment of definite sums for the use of the tables, and upon the whole amount being paid a bill of sale was to be executed transferring the title. We sustained the contract in both its aspects, and declared it to be a bailment for use of the tables with provision for sale in case of the payment of the price. This is what was said, Agnew, J. : “ That a sale of the billiard tables -was contemplated in the lease between Sharp and Goff of the 16th of November, 1865, is manifest in the writing itself, as well as from the other evidence in the cause. But it is the character of the sale which must determine when the title vested. The bill of sale of the 18th November, 1865, was not signed, and before Sharp, the manufacturer, parted with his possession, he had a right to dictate the terms of its transfer. He lived in the city of New York, and the tables were to be taken by Goff into Pennsylvania. The article of lease, as it is called, was the final act of the parties, executed, as its own provisions show, before .Sharp had <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>parted with his control. By its terms it is clearly a bailment for use (inaccurately termed a lease), with a provision for a sale in case the price of the tables should be fully paid. The possession was delivered to Goff upon the express terms'that he was to take the tables to his place of business in Pennsylvania, keep them, and not remove them without Sharp’s written .consent, and would surrender them at the end of nine months, or sooner, on Goff’s failure to pay the installments as they fell due; and a title or bill of sale was only to be made on full payment of the price. The transaction is clearly a bailment of the possession, with an agreement for a future sale conditioned on the payment of the price. According to the authorities this is a valid contract, and can be enforced even against creditors.”</p>
    <p id="b104-4" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[268,1089,1165,609]]]'>Here also the purpose of the parties was to effectuate a sale, in the future, directly to the bailee, who was to have actual possession in the meantime under a different arrangement, and we gave it our sanction as against creditors of the bailee because of the contract. In other words although the intent of the parties, and the effect of their agreement, was to vest the title at a future day in the purchaser, he having actual possession in the meantime, yet as the intervening arrangement was upon a valid contract of bailment as between the parties, the title of the bailor was preserved until terminated by compliance with the provision for a sale, at which time that portion of the agreement became operative..</p>

It was only in the event that the $4,250 should be realized by the sales of stock, that the remainder of the stock and other personal property were to become the property of Linn, the other property being delivered to him upon a contract of. bailment for use till that event happened. Now, clearly, this was not a mere conditional sale to Linn, but a bailment for legitimate purposes, recognized by repeated decisions as not falling- within the principle which subjects personal estate delivered upon a contract of sale, to the execution creditors of the purchaser. ... In reference to the peculiar features of this contract, to wit, the bailment to sell on commission, and to manufacture and sell, there are two cases directly in point. In McCullough v. Porter, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 177" data-case-ids="1856514" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0177-01">4 W. &amp; S. 177</a>, it was held that an agreement to furnish -goods to an insolvent to be sold at -invoice prices, he returning the invoice price after sale to the consignors, and retaining all above that sum. for the support of himself and famity, is a bailment, and the goods are not subject to the executions of the insolvent’s creditors.” The other case referred to is King v. Humphreys, <a href="/pa/10/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="10 Pa. 217" data-case-ids="962775" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0217-01">10 Pa. 217</a>. Proceeding, Agnew, J., further said: “ The delivery of the stock on hand for sale on commission, and of the metal to be converted into castings also to be sold on commission, and the proceeds of the sales deposited with a banker for the purpose of paying off the judgment, was clearly a bailment only; and the property thus bailed was not subject to the executions of Linn’s creditors.”</p>

The letters were sent directly to the parties in England, who shipped the goods, got the bills of lading and consular invoices, which were sent to the London house of the plaintiffs, accompanied by the draft and invoices, which were drawn at three months. The only witness in the case, Dawson, plaintiffs’ manager, testified: “These papers were accepted by our London house, and the goods were shipped to us here as our property, and we delivered them to Mr. Sweeting upon his signing the trust receipt as we call it.” The goods were shipped to the plaintiffs, the bills of lading made to them. This of course gave them the property in the goods which could only be obtained by the surrender of. the bills at the custom house. The plaintiffs paid the drafts drawn on them for the price of the goods at maturity. Before surrendering the bills of lading to Sweeting he signed the trust receipt in question, containing the following provision: “Received from Brown Brothers &amp; Co. the following goods and merchandise, their property, specified in the bill'of lading, per Lord Clive, dated Lpool.

He was not to become the owner-of them by purchase or in any other way. In this respect the case is far stronger than any of the reported cases in favor of the grantor or bailor. It must also be remembered that Sweeting had no title to the goods and no possession except as derived through and by operation of the trust receipt. He paid nothing for them, he had no right or title to them prior to the trust receipt, and that paper was the only source of-any right to the possession or control of them for any purpose whatever. What then was bis right under the receipt? Only this. He was to hold the goods in trust for Brown Bros. &amp; Co. as their property, with liberty to sell them for their account and pay ov'er to them the proceeds, to be applied to the payment of acceptances given for the price of the bicycles, and was entitled to credit upon any7 other-indebtedness of his to either of the plaintiffs’ firms.</p>
    <p id="b107-3" data-blocks='[["BL_107.4",107,[140,1274,1169,1060]]]'>In what conceivable aspect of this contract was Sweeting to become the owner of the goods? Plainly7 none. His duty7 was to sell the goods for the account of the plaintiffs, and while he was selling them he was' holding them in trust for the plaintiffs. Even his possession was not on his own account but on theirs. The service he was to render was not for himself but for them. Even the proceeds of the sales he made did not belong to him but to them. At the very utmost the contract was but a bailment for sale without any title or ownership of any7 kind in the bailee in any event. The case is too plain for extended argument. Not a case has been referred to us in which an ownership was held to arise in the bailee upon such a state of facts as this. On the contrary in the following cases the principles and authorities heretofore cited are recognized, affirmed and applied, and in all of them, although an interest as owner was to be acquired by the bailee for use or sale, or lessee or other party ultimately interested, the right of the bailor, lessor or vendor was sustained against the creditors of the other party: Enlow v.
