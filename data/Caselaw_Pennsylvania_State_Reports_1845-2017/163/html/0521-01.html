Klemmer, the plaintiff, on the 5th of November, 1891, while a passenger on the Mount Penn Gravity Railroad, near Reading, was very seriously and probably permanently injured. The train, consisting of two cars, was running down the incline by gravity, when, from some cause, the brakeman lost control of the brakes'; the consequence was the cars jumped the track and were wrecked. Klemmer, averring negligence on part of the company, brought suit for damages; the issue was tried before Judge Endbich, who, in a brief but very clear and impartial charge-, submitted the evidence, bearing on the questions of negligence and the measure of damages, to the jury. There was a verdict for plaintiff in the sum of $4,000. Although defendant submitted four written prayers to the court for instructions, three of which were denied, no exceptions were taken to the charge, and there is no assignment of error to any of the rulings of the court after the jury was sworn. Before the jury was sworn, however, defendant’s counsel challenged the array of jurors, and moved to quash the same, because of alleged gross irregularities in filling the wheel under the act of 1867 and its supplements.</p>

After the motion was overruled, Judge Endlich, first, filed an opinion giving his reasons why the motion ought to have prevailed, and in this he .states, as within his knowledge, facts on which his opinion is largely based. Then J udge Ermentrout filed an opinion, overruling the motion to quash, in which he makes a statement of facts within his knowledge, in direct conflict with those stated by .Judge Endlich.

For example, the first reason in the motion to quash, is, that under the act of 1874, a supplement to the act of 1867, no list containing the name, occupation and residence of each juror, etc.,was filed in the office of the prothonotary. Judge Endltch states no such list was filed as required by law. Judge Ermentrout states, this list, substantially, in all particulars, as required by the act, was made out and certified, and although not formally marked filed by the prothonotary, before the motion to quash, it had been deposited in and the seal of the court affixed in the prothonotary’s office; was used by the sheriff and the court as a document of the court, and as the list intended b3T the act for the prothonotary’s office.</p>

Judge Endlich states, this list referred to by Judge Ebmentuoht, was nothing but the sheriff’s book of names, which the act of 1834 required him to keep, and in no sense the list of names placed in the wheel, which the judge and jury commissioners were required to certify under the supplement to the act of 1867. Judge Ekmentbout states, as within his knowledge, it was made out and certified by himself and the jury commissioners ; the seal of the court attached in the prothonotary’s office, and repeatedly laid before the court, when required in conducting the business of the court. What purports to be a copy of this list, with heading and certificates, and 22 names of the 1200 put in the wheel for 1893, is printed in appellee’s paper-book. If such list as this was made out and deposited in the prothonotary’s office, that’ was a substantial compliance with the requirements of section 3 of act of 1874. And although it ought to have been marked filed of record, and ought to have been kept at all times thereafter as one of the records of the prothonotary’s office, still, as there is no intimation that it was ever tampered with or concealed, the irregularity is not of that gravity, as at this stage of the trial warrants this court in sustaining the motion to quash.</p>

The primary object of the act of 1867 in taking from the sheriff and county commissioners the duty of filling the jury wheel, and providing for the election of; jury .commissioners, who, with the President or Additional Law Judge, should <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>perform that duty, was to guard against unjust political prejudice in the selection of jurors. Before the adoption of the constitution of 1878, the board of county commissioners and sheriff in any one county, generally, all belonged to the same political party; complaints were made by the minority party, in many of ■ the counties-, of political partiality in filling the wheel. The legislature, on the assumption that this evil existed, created the office of jury commissioner, and provided for representation of the minority; and further, prescribed a method of filling the wheel,‘which was intended to remedy the evil complained of under the act of 1884. The importance of this office to the people of the commonwealth can scarcely be exaggerated <em>; </em>nor can there be. any difference of opinion as to the absolute necessity of requiring strict fidelity to duty in those who hold it.</p>
    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.4",552,[270,1139,1176,916]]]'>As to the manner in which the commissioners and President Judge performed this duty, Judge Endlich says: “When the board met, each member, had a list prepared in advance, partly from his own knowledge, but largely from suggestions received from others. Some of these suggestions were volun-' tarily offered by friends or acquaintances, persons who desired to do jury service,“or whose friends desired to do so. Many of them, however, were procured by a system of inviting persons of acknowledged prominence, politically or otherwise, in the various wards, boroughs and townships of the county, to hand in the names of a certain number of persons living in their districts for the purpose of filling the jury wheel. From the names thus handed in, the lists referred to were largely compiled. From these lists, the several members of the board alternated in calling off the names, which were placed in the wheel. The list of the ‘ whole qualified electors ’ of the county, though readily obtainable, was never before the board or before any member of it.”</p>

They could not have been admitted last Mayor June, because the reason was not filed until October 16,1893. These facts are neither admitted nor proven, nor capable of being proven. At no time did the jury commis<a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>sioners have a prepared list from which-.all the jurors were selected. Each jury commissioner for himself, without dictation or suggestion from his fellow commissioner or the President Judge, invariably made his own selection; no jurors were selected concurrently. Each of the three, acting independently of the other, made his own selection of each individual juror alternately, that is, one after another. None knew or permitted each other to know of the selection each one made, until publicly announced and placed, in the jury wheel. All were thus honestly selected in the interest of no one; in the interest of neither clique nor faction, political or social, but with the sole desire to place in the jury wheel sober, honest, intelligent jurors, who, in a community composed largely of German-speaking people and other mixed nationalities, could understand the English language.”</p>
    <p id="b553-4" data-blocks='[["BL_553.4",553,[142,1137,1182,1275]],["BL_554.1",554,[235,325,1165,761]]]'>The duty of the jury commissioners and President Judge was to “ select alternately from the whole qualified electors of the county ” the names of 1200 “ sober, intelligent and judicious persons,” and place these names in the jury wheel. At the last Presidential election, very nearly 29,000 qualified electors voted in Berks county. It is not improbable there' are in the county 80,000. As 1200 names were ordered to be put in the wheel, about one man was wanted out of every twenty-five, for jury service. Any one will readily understand, the duty of the board, in such a. populous county, was no light one. To eliminate the aged, decrepit, ignorant, intemperate, and those who did not understand the English language, and then select from the large number of competent persons remaining, 1200, could only be done by careful inquiry, thought and preparation beforehand. There is not probably, in the county, a single person qualified from his own knowledge to do this. His ability to select, must, in large degree, come from information derived from others. That the members of the board made private lists, prepared by themselves beforehand, of “sober, intelligent and judicious persons,” proves nothing more than that the3r sought, b3r inquiry, to qualify themselves for a proper performance of their duty. If they had taken up the lists of the voters in the different districts, and at once made selections from nearty 30,000 names thereon, unless they were men thoroughly acquainted with the voters of every pre<a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>cinct, and of phenomenal memory, they would have been wholly incapable of performing the duty as the law enjoined. If they filled the wheel from lists prepared by others, no matter by whom, it was a gross violation of duty. But if they made up lists of sober, intelligent and judicious persons themselves, on their own judgment, although on information obtained from others, this was the only way, in very many cases, that they could intelligently perform their duty. The act does not require that they shall take up the list of the whole qualified electors, and alternately select therefrom, but that the selection shall be made “ from the whole qualified electors.” That is, the selection shall not be made from a part, such as one political party, the members of one church or one faction, but from the whole, without distinction of party, creed, race, social or family relation.</p>

As the act of 1867 referred to the act of 183.4, and as the duties of the commissioners, as specified in that act, were in the form of an oath, it might fairly be implied, the commissioners were sworn to perform these duties, and so understood it.

After being filled, locked and sealed in every particular as the law directs, one of the commissioners, who lived some miles from the county seat, by an express agreement between them, took the wheel with him and kept it at his home. There is no intimation that it was tampered with; the possibility of tampering with it, under the circumstances, is all that is suggested. The act directs, that “ the jury wheel shall remain in the custody of the jury commissioners,” the keys to be kept by the sheriff. An expression of this Court in Holland v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/82/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="82 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="1047901" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0306-01">82 Pa. 306</a>, is wrested from its connection in the opinion, and urged as a declaration that such disposition of the wheel was illegal. In that case,'the wheel had been left in a chest of a vault in the county commissioner’s office, of which the clerk had the key. It was argued that this was not the custody the law required. Justice Paxson, in his opinion, says : “ We must give this section a reasonable interpretation. It does not designate where the wheel shall be kept, and provides no place where the jury commissioners shall deposit it. It was not intended that they should carry it to their private residences—in many instances they reside several miles from the county seat. Its removal from the seat of justice would be as inconvenient as unnecessary.” The meaning here, in connection with the facts of the case, is so manifest, that it ought not to require notice. The appellant in that case argued that the words “ the wheel shall remain in the custody of the said jury commissioners,” meant the physical control and possession of the wheel by the commissioners. This Court, in answer, said, no, the law did not require an unreasonable thing; did not impose an unnecessary and inconvenient burden upon the officers; it was in'their custody, if in one of the public offices of which their clerk had the key. If that wheel had been in the residence of one of the commissioners, by agreement of the <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>other, as here, the counsel in that case would, have raised no questions as to its legal custody. Here, the law imposed no such inconvenience and burden on the jury commissioner as he chose to assume in the custody of the wheel; he went further, in a literal compliance with the law, than a reasonable interpretation of it exacted. He subjected himself to this inconvenience, because the county commissioners had not, as it was their duty to do, provided a place in the public buildings where it could be kept, constructively, in the custody of the jury commissioners.</p>
