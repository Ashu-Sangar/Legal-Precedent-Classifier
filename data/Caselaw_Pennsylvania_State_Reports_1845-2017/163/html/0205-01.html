The notes were given to secure a part of the purchase money of certain oil property sold by U. C. Welton aud E. O. Emerson to the mortgagors Littlejohn and F. R. Gardner, wife of D. Gardner. The notes were negotiated before maturity for value, to G. H. &amp; R. N. Ford. The mortgage sued upon was assigned at the same time to said indorsees. A scire facias having been issued on the mortgage-and judgment having been entered thereon, the mortgagor Littlejohn now asks to have the judgment opened as to himself for the reason that tire consideration'for the notes received by the mortgagee had failed in part, and that it be stricken off as to F. R. Gardner for the reason that she was dead at the time the judgment was entered. The notes having been regularly negotiated before maturity, the indorsees took them free from any defence which the makers might have set up against them in thé hands of the payee. The mortgage being the security given for the payment of the notes, the holders thereof have the right to proceed on it to enforce payment of the notes, and as the makers of the notes could not make defence against the indorsees in a suit on the notes, they ought not to be permitted to do so indirectly by attacking the <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>security which gives value to thé notes. As between the petitioner and the plaintiffs there is no equity which entitles him to the relief sought. If he have any cause of complaint against the payee of the' Jiotes he can secure redress in an action. The' judgment was taken in conformity to the terms of the mortgage, and the plaintiffs are entitled to the benefits of the security which it affords. I make no comment on the evidence relating to the transaction out of which the mortgage and notes grow, as that question majr come up again. It is sufficient now to determine that as against the equitable plaintiffs the petitioner is not entitled to be heard on the defence set up.</p>
