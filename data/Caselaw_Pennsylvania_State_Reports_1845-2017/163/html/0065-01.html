The writ was returned nihil habet. A year after the cause of action had accrued she brought a second action. When the case was called for trial the court entered a nonsuit on the ground that the action was barred by the statute. She then issued an alias summons in the first action which was returned “ served.” Defendant filed a plea to the effect that the judgment in the second suit was conclusive upon plaintiff. Upon application of plaintiff the judgment of nonsuit in the second action was taken off, the costs paid, and the suit discontinued.
