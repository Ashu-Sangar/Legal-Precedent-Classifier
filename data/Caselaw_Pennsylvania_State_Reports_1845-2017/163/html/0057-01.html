    <p class="summary" id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[260,480,1167,1463]]]'>“ It is contended that the cost of printing and distributing the ballots, which is thus spoken of, includes compensation to the officers on whom this labor is imposed for the time necessarily spent by them in the performance of these duties. This, however, is not the natural construction of the terms used, and there is nothing which would justify the extension of them by implication. There is no ambiguity as to what is meant by [the ‘ cost of printing and distribution.’ It manifestly includes the bills for printing the ballots, the expenses of getting them into the hands of the proper election officers, such as cartage, expressage, etc., and any necessary traveling expenses by rail, carriage or otherwise, incurred by the auditors in connection therewith. But these words cannot be stretched so as to cover anything like a per diem compensation to the auditors themselves for the time employed in attending to these duties.] [1] To so hold would be to wander far beyond the plain meaning of the terms employed. The time of public officers, so far as required to perform the duties enjoined upon them by law, belongs to the public whom they have undertaken to. represent. This excludes the idea of compensation for their services, except as it is expressly provided for; we must see it clearly written in the law, or hold that it was not intended to be given; it is not to be introduced in any case by strained construction of what there appears. This effectually disposes of 'the question involved in the present controversy. The words, ‘ cost of distribution,’ are unambiguous, covering what I referred to above; they cannot, except by a strained and unnatural construction, be made to include the compensation which the plaintiff claims in this case.”</p>

Corr, the appellant, is a borough auditor of Dickson City in Lackawanna county. Section 13 of act of June 19, 1891, known as the “ Baker Ballot Law,” directs that: “The county commissioners of-each county shall cause all the ballots to be used therein to be printed, <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>except for election officers of townships and boroughs, and election officers and school directors in the same, the ballots for which shall be printed and distributed by the auditors, who shall certify the cost of such printing and distribution to the county commissioners for payment as part of a county election expenses. The said commissioners and auditors shall ascertain the offices to be filled, and shall be responsible for the accurate printing of the ballots, in accordance with this act, and for the safe keeping of the same while in their possession, or that of their subordinates or agents.”</p>
    <p id="b84-5" data-blocks='[["BL_84.4",84,[260,890,1163,552]]]'>Corr, in the performance of the duty thus imposed upon him: (1) Held meetings to receive nomination certificates, and hear objections to same; received notices of withdrawal, and filled out certificates for watchers, one day. (2) Arranged ballots, corrected proof, for that purpose going to and from printing office, one day. (3) Distributed ballots to the proper officers of the several districts of the borough, one day. For these three days, he rendered a bill to the county at $2.00 per day, making $6.00, and to this appended bill for cost of printing. The commissioners allowed the printing bill, but refused to pay the $6.00 per diem charges.</p>

The court, being of opinion that the plain meaning of the act did not embrace compensation for time taken by the auditors in performing the duty enjoined, gave judgment for the county. From that judgment, we have this appeal.</p>

If the time of the person thus designated must necessarily be taken in the proper performance of the work imposed upon him, that is an expenditure, the same as if money had necessarily been paid .out. It is conceded by appellee, that the time here charged for was necessary tó the distribution ; if so, it was part of the expense of distribution, although it was the time of a public 'officer. If this officer’s whole time had been paid for by an annual salary, there would have been some force in the argument that it was not intended to be computed in the expense of distribution, and thereby give him double pay. But, in the performance of his duties as a borough officer, he expended but a .few days in the year, and for these, by law, he was allowed a per diem compensation of |2.00. The legislature knew this, when- they imposed on him a most responsible duty, to perform which he must expend other days than those for which the borough paid him. The distribution of ballots, and their preparation for distribution, as required by the law, involved both manual and clerical labor. The language “ the cost of such .... distribution,” necessarily implies payment for the time expended by the auditor. Giving the words such meaning is not an enlargement of their scope; to say they meant less, would be a restriction on their obvious intent.</p>
