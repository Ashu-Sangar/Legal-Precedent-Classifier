In doing this the relative amount of coal which would pass through a screen with a five-eighths inch mesh was considerably increased over the amount which passed through the same sized screen at the Nottingham colliery. In other words, at the Reynolds colliery the amount of pea and buckwheat and refuse coal was increased, for the purpose of meeting the demands of the market for smaller sized coal, and of course the amount of coal which went over the screen of the size called for in the lease was diminished.</p>

He based this part of the claim upon the construction of the contract under which he insists that he is entitled to all the coal that goes through the screen provided for in the lease, and that therefore he is entitled to the value, at the , mine, of the pea and buckwheat coal sold.

This .case does not seem to go far enough to sustain the defence in the present case. The court say that the statements rendered b}' a coal company, of coal mined, to the lessor, are not like mutual settlements of accounts, and that if it be shown that the statements did not contain all that they should contain, they are not conclusive unless the party to whom they were rendered accepted them with a knowledge that they were not correct. I take it that this means that where the party to whom the accounts are rendered has knowledge that they are'not correct, and accepts them without objection, that then in such case he is bound by the settlement; but when he objects all the time, as the plaintiff did in the present case, to the failure to pay him for pea coal, I do not understand this case, nor any case, as deciding that he is estopped by receiving the accounts and accepting payment according to the accounts, and I am of the opinion that the plaintiff in the present case would not be concluded from setting up the claim which he has set up by the fact that he has accepted the accounts of the defendant, in view of the other fact that he has always objected to their right to exclude pea coal from the coal on which they were bound to pay a royalty.</p>

The evidence, so far as there is any evidence on the subject, is that he objected to the defendant taking the pea coal, and I think it is not material whether he objected or not. . If he had the right to the pea coal under the contract, nothing would deprive him of it unless he released the right, or did some act which would make it inequitable for him to assert the right against the defendant, or unless he is barred by the statute of limitation: De Bussche v. Alt, 8 Ch. D. 286-814. The so-called equitable estoppel upon which the defendant relies amounts to nothing more, according to its own allegation, than that the plaintiff saw that the pea coal was being sold find that he did not make any claim for it.

These piles were of no value,'and a source of annoyance and ■expense to the miner, but the belief existed then as now that in the future means might be devised to utilize the large quantities- of good coal which they contained. Negotiating on this basis of fact and belief, the lessee was relieved from payment for unmarketable coal, and the lessor giveh title to that which cost him nothing and had only a prospective value. The word culm was doubtless brought to the Pennsylvania coal fields by Welsh miners. With them the word has been used to describe an inferior grade of coal of but little value, and it readily •came into use'to define coal not inferior in quality but unmarketable and valueless because of its size.' It was the adaptation of a word to a use closely akin to its original meaning.
