        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Chief J ustioe Sterrett,\nThis record presents the single question whether the learned trial judge erred \u201c in directing the jury to render a verdict for the defendant.\u201d\nAn examination of the testimony, in support of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, cl\u00e9arly shows that it was not only proper for the consideration of the jury, but, if believed, would have warranted them in finding that the defendant, without apparent justification, practically deserted his wife and child, and neglected to make such provision for their support and maintenance as their necessities required and his own financial condition would have enabled him to furnish. It also shows that the goods for which suit was brought,\u2014consisting chiefly of toilet articles, drugs, medicines, infant\u2019s food, etc., ordered by and delivered to defendant\u2019s wife for the use of herself and their infant child,\u2014 were necessaries suitable to their condition and circumstances. Bills for similar articles, previously ordered by her, had been presented to and paid by defendant. There is no evidence that plaintiff was aware of any change in the domestic relations of the defendant and his wife until payment of the account in suit was demanded and refused by defendant.\nSpecial reference to or discussion of the testimony is unnecessary. It is sufficient to. say that it tended to prove facts which, if found by the jury, would have entitled the plaintiff to a verdict, and we are clearly-of opinion that it should have been submitted to them under proper instructions.\nJudgment reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded.",

    "head_matter": "W. H. Llewellyn, Appellant, v. S. W. Levy.\nHusband and wife\u2014Necessaries for support of wife.\nWhere a husband without justification deserts his wife and child, and neglects to make such provision for their support and maintenance as their necessities require, and his own financial, condition enables him to furnish it, he is liable for necessaries ordered by and delivered to his wife for the use of herself and child, suitable to their condition and circumstances, although the wife has repudiated the husband\u2019s offers of allowance.\nArgued April 5, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 329, Jan. T., 1894, by-plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 3, Pbila. Co., June T., 1891, No. 641, on verdict for defendant.\nBefore Sterrett, C..J., Green, Williams, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nReversed.\nAssumpsit for goods furnished to defendant\u2019s wife.\nAt the - trial, before Gordon, J., it appeared that, in Octo-her, 1887, defendant compelled his wife and child to leave his house. He engaged rooms and board for them at a hotel, where he paid their board. Defendant, offered to pay his wife $125 a month, but she refused the offer, claiming that it was insufficient. There was evidence that defendant\u2019s income from his banking business was $20,000 per year. The goods for which suit was brought were ordered by and delivered to defendant's wife after the separation. Bills for similar articles previously ordered by her had been paid by defendant. There was no evidence that plaintiff knew of the separation when the goods were delivered. The court gave binding instruction for defendant.\nVerdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was above instruction.\nBradbury Bedell, for appellant,-\ncited: Etherington v. Parrott, 1 Salk. 118; 2 Ld. Raym. 1006; Ayan v. Sans, 12 Q. B. 460; Munro v.
