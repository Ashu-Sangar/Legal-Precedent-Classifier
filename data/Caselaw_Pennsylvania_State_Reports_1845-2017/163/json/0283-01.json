        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Mitchell,\nThe act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 393, while it does not in express terms abolish the office of county auditors in counties having more than one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants, does so in effect by transferring their duties and powers to a county controller. This is the manifest intent of the act, as gathered from all its provisions, and as especially indicated in section one which directs the election of a controller \u201cin place of-county auditor,\u201d and section fifteen which expressly directs how the duties theretofore devolved on the county auditors shall thereafter be performed. Such moreover, even without an express legislative intent, would be the result of the act. The powers, authority and jurisdiction of an office are the essence of the office itself, and are inseparable from it. To take them away totally is to destroy the office: Com. v. Gamble, 62 Pa. 343; Reid v. Smoulter, 128 Pa. 324.\nThe title of the act under consideration is, \u201cAn act creating the office of county controller in counties of this commonwealth containing one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants and over, prescribing his duties.\u201d In this there is no indication of the purpose and effect of the act-to abolish the office of county auditors. So far as appears in the title, the act is merely cumulative, in providing an additional county officer. It is true that the constitution in enumerating county officers, art. 14, sect. 1, puts the two offices together in the disjunctive, \u201c auditors or controllers,\u201d and that those who are familiar with the duties of controllers as existing in Philadelphia and Allegheny, would know that they are mainly the same as those of auditors in other counties, and therefqre that the creation of the office of controller was likely to interfere with, if not to abolish, the other. But this is not the notice which the constitution requires the title of the act to give of its subject. The object of that requirement is that legislators, and others interested, shall receive direct notice in immediate connection with the act itself, of its subject, so that they may know or be put upon inquiry as to its provisions and their effect. Suggestions or inferences which may be drawn from knowledge dehors the language used, are not enough. The constitution requires that the notice shall be contained in the title itself: Ph\u0153nixville Road, 109 Pa. 44; Ridge Av. R. W. Co. v. Phila., 124 Pa. 219; Phila. v. Ridge Av. R. W. Co., 142 Pa. 484.\nAs this defect in the title is decisive of the unconstitutionality of the entire act, it is not necessary to discuss the other objections raised to it.\n\u25a0Judgment reversed.",

Samuels et al., Appellants.\nConstitution\u2014Title of act\u2014Act of June'8, 1893\u2014County auditors.\nThe object of \u00a7 3, article 3, of the constitution of 1874, relating to titles of acts, is that legislators, and others interested, shall receive direct notice in immediate connection with the act itself, of its subject, so that they may know or be put upon inquiry as to its provisions and their effect. Suggestions or inferences which may be drawn from knowledge dehors the language used, are not enough.\nThe act of June 8, 1898, P. L. 393, entitled \u201c An act creating the office ' of county controller in counties of this commonwealth containing one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants and over, prescribing his duties,\u201d is \u2022defective in its title and unconstitutional, as there is no indication in the title of the pui'pose and effect of the act to abolish the office of coxxnty auditors.\nThe fact that in article 14, \u00a7 1, of the constitution the two offices were placed together in the disjunctive, \u201c auditors or controllers,\u201d and that the \u25a0controllers of Philadelphia and Allegheny perform practically the same duties as auditors in other counties was not sufficient notice that the creation of the office of controller was likely to interfere with, if not to abolish, the office of county auditor.\nPublic officers\u2014Abolition of office.\nThe powers, authority and jurisdiction of an office are the essence of the office itself, and are inseparable from it. To take them away totally is to destroy the office.\nArgued May 22, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 40, July T., 1894, by \u2022defendants, from judgment of C. P. Schuylkill Co., May T., 1894, No. 13, on quo warranto.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nReversed.\nQuo warranto to oust respondents from office of county auditors. Before Weidman, J.\nFrom the record it appeared that Thomas E. Samuels, Emanuel Jenkyn and John E. Doyle were elected auditors of Schuylkill county on Nov. 7,1893, for a full term of three years. The census of 1890 shows Schuylkill county to have a population of 154,163. The act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 393, has for its title \u201c An act creating the office of county controller in counties containing 150,000 inhabitants and over, and prescribing his duties.\u201d The commissioners\u2019 clerk of Schuylkill county petitioned the attorney general to suggest a writ of quo warranto to oust the .auditors. The writ was suggested. The auditors filed their answer, and the case was heard on petition and answer. The court rendered judgment against the auditors and ousted them.\nError assigned was above order.\nWilliam Wilhelm, for appellant.\nThe office of the county auditor is a county office by express terms of the constitution. It cannot be abolished by an act of legislature: Act of May 1, 1861, P. L. 450; Taggart v. Com., 12 W. N. 466.\nThe act of June 8, 1893, is special legislation and is forbidden: Act of June 22, 1883, P. L. 139; McCarthy v. Com., 110 Pa. 243; Morrison v. Bachert, 112 Pa. 328; Ayres et. al. v. Wheatfield et al., 122 Pa. 266; Phila. v. Church, 115 Pa. 291; Weinman v. Ry., 118 Pa. 192.\nJ. 0. Ulrich, W. U. Sensei, attorney general, with him, for appellee.\nThe act of June 8, 1893, is constitutional: Wheeler v. Phila., 77 Pa. 338; Kilgore v. Magee, 85 Pa. 401; Ruan Street, 132 Pa. 257; Wyoming Street, 137 Pa. 494; Bell v. Allegheny Co., 149 Pa. 383; Com. v. Patton, 88 Pa. 258; Scowden\u2019s Ap., 96 Pa. 422; Com. v.

N. 419.\nThe general rule is that where two statutes contain repugnant provisions, the one last signed by the governor is a repeal of the one previously signed: Bank v. Com., 26 Pa. 446; Shinn v. Com., 3 Grant, 205; Com. v. Ry., 53 Pa. 62; Com. v. Grier, 152 Pa. 176; Endlich, Stats. 188; Luddy v. Long Island City, 104 N. Y. 218; Johnston\u2019s Est., 33 Pa. 511; Hickory Tree Road, 43 Pa. 139; Com. v. Ry., 53 Pa. 62.\nThe provisions of the acts of 1893, 1834 and 1881 are inconsistent and incapable of being so construed that all may stand together: Sifred v. Com., 104 Pa. 179: Homer v. Com., 106 Pa. 221.\nII. W. Palmer, for appellant, in reply.\nThe title of the act gives no intimation of an intention to disturb the office of county auditor in counties where a controller is provided.\nBy \u00a7 15 of the act, practically all the duties and powers of county auditors are conferred on the controller. To abolish the duties of an office is to destroy the office: Com. v. Gamble, 62 Pa. 843.\nIt is possible that a general act substituting controllers for auditors in all the counties of the state would be within the constitutional power of the general assembly, but such an act .should express the purpose in the title: McGee\u2019s Ap., 114 Pa. 470; Hatfield v. Com., 120 Pa. 395; Borough v. Sholes, 118 Pa. 165; Ph\u0153nixville Road, 109 Pa. 44; Rogers v. Im. Co., 109 Pa. 109.\nJuly 12, 1894:"
