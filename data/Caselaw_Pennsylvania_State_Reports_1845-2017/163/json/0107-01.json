Term, 1894, [reported above, page 76,] we have expressed at length the reasons why, upon the facts of the case, we regarded the transaction there in question as a bailment and not as a sale. In the present case the facts are substantially of the same character. Fisher never had any ownership of the cement, never paid anything for it, was not the consignee and did not have the bill of lading. The only right he did have to take the cement iii charge and to sell it was derived entirely from the contract with Monjo, who had paid the whole of the purchase- money. . By that contract he was to act merely as a selling agent for Monjo, and pay the proceeds of the sales to him. It was a bailment for sale only, and in no event was Fisher to become the owner of the cement. Upon these considerations, and for the reasons more fully expressed in the opinion in the case of Brown Bros. v. Billington we d\u00e9termine this contention in the same manner and reverse the judgment of the court below.\nJudgment reversed and new venire awarded.",

Plaintiffs paid the price of the goods to the bankers and directed them to be delivered to defendant in the execution, who gave plaintiffs a receipt acknowledging the goods to -be plaintiffs\u2019 property, and agreeing to sell the same and pay over the proceeds to plaintiffs. The defendant in the execution was to have a share of the profits. Held, that the transaction was a bailment and not a sale of the goods, and that the goods were not subject to be taken in execution as the property of the bailee.\nArgued April 5, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 324, Jan. T., 1894, by plaintiffs, from judgment of C. P. No. 3, Phila. Co., June T., 1892, No. 67, on verdict for defendants.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nReversed.\nSheriff\u2019s interpleader. Before Gordon, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that the goods in controversy were a number of barrels of Portland cement which had been consigned from Stettin,'German}', to H. Marquardt & Co., bankers.\nOn July 20, 1891, George De Mets suggested that plaintiffs should pay for the goods, and that Erskine W. Fisher should sell them. Plaintiffs agreed to this and sent a check to Marquardt' & Co. for the purchase money. . The goods were delivered to Fisher, who stored them in his own name. Fisher was to get forty per cent of the profits, plaintiffs forty per cent and De Mets twenty per cent. Fisher gave plaintiffs the following receipt:\n\u201cNew York, July 23d, 1891.\n\u201c Received from Messrs. Louis Monjo, Jr., & Co., 2,800 (say twenty-eight hundred) barrels Stettin (\u2018anchor brand\u2019) Portland cement ex bark \u2018Lucy and Paul,\u2019 at Philadelphia, which. I hereby acknowledge to be their property, Avith the privilege, on my part, to distribute the same among my customers according to bills rendered (by) Messrs. Louis Monjo, Jr., & Co. to that effect, and I hereby bind myself, my heirs', executors, or assigns to collect the amount of said bills and to baud over the respective amounts, as fast I receive them, to Messrs. Louis Monjo, Jr., & Co., to the full extinction of the amount of $6,310.25 (say six thousand three hundred and ten dollars and twenty-five cents).\n\u201c It is further understood that any excess of the justifiable amount due Messrs. Louis Monjo, Jr., & Co. will be credited to me to the extent of 40 per cent of such excess.\n\u201c E. W. Fisher.\u201d\nThe goods were subsequently levied upon as the property of Fisher.\nBinding instructions for defendants were given.\nVerdict and judgment for defendants. Plaintiffs appealed.\nError assigned was instruction, quoting it.\nHenry 0. Brown, for appellant.\nFisher was merely plaintiff\u2019s bailee for sale. If the sales resulted in a loss, plaintiff, and not Fisher, would have to bear the loss. If Fisher had been the owner the case would be different.\nII. B. Gill, John JR. Bead and Silas W.
