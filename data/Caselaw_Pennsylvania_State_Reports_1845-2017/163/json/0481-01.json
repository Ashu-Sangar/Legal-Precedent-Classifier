The jurisdiction vested in the judges of the quarter sessions to grant liquor licenses and, in certain circumstances, to authorize the licensee to transfer his license to his successor in the business, etc., is purely statutory. There \u2019appears to be nothing in the law. however that authorizes them to sanction the transfer of licenses from one locality to another. It therefore follows that in refusing to authorize the transfer of plaintiffs\u2019 license, as prayed for, the defendants acted strictly within the line of official duty, and there is nothing on which to sustain this proceeding.\nRule denied and petition dismissed with costs to be paid by the- plaintiffs.",

The court of quarter sessions has no jurisdiction to authorize the transfer of a wholesale liquor license from one place to another.\nArgued Feb. 15, 1894.\nPetition for mandamus by Henry Laib and Kate Laib, trading as Laib & Co., v. Honorable J. I. Clark Hare, and Honorable Craig Biddle, Judges of the Court of Quarter Sessions for the County of Philadelphia.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nThe petition averred that the petitioners were granted a license by the Court of Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia county to sell liquors at wholesale for a period of one year from June 1, 1893,. to June 1, 1894.\n\u201c That since the granting of said license, until the 31st day of January, 1894, your petitioners conducted the wholesale liquor business' at their premises at the northwest corner of Second a,nd Vine streets, in the city of Philadelphia, and upon said date the said premises were almost entirely consumed by fire, in consequence of which your petitioners were unable to further occupy or conduct their business therein, and having on hand a large stock of merchandise, consisting of liquors, they secured premises at 432 Market street, in the city of Philadelphia, intending there to conduct their said liquor business for the remaining portion of their license year.\n\u201c That the premises secured by your petitioners at 432 Market street, is but six squares distant from their old location, and is in a locality of the city of Philadelphia used and employed entirely'for business purposes. That application was made to the Honorable the Judges of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia county, to transfer the license held by your petitioners, so'that they might be permitted to conduct their said, business in premises No. 432 Market street, but the application for said transfer was refused.\u201d\nThe petitioners prayed for a mandamus to compel the respondents to transfer their license,\nClinton 0. Mayer and Joseph L. Grreemvald, for petitioners.\nUpon the question of the transfer of licenses, the act of May 13, 1887, P. L. 108, and the act of June 9, 1891, P. L. 257, are both silent, so that transfers must be regulated and allowed under the provisions of the act of April 20, 1858, \u00a7 7, P. L. 366: Blumenthal\u2019s Petition, 125 Pa. 414.\n. The petitioners contend that so far as wholesale licenses are concerned, a discretion is vested in the court of quarter sessions to grant transfers of licenses from place to place under the language of the act of 1858, which mentions three cases under which transfers can be made, and they are, (a) where\u2019 the party licensed shall die, (b~) where the party licensed shall remove; (c) where the party licensed shall cease to keep such house.\nAnd in all of these three cases the license may be transferred or license be granted to the successor of such party. Now it is respectfully contended that if the three cases for transr fer mentioned in said act were intended to apply to transfer-only from person to person, there would be' no need to make distinction, as is made in said act, between a renewal or ceasing to keep said house, because the said clauses are not in the conjunctive but in the disjunctive, and a removal, unless it is held to amount to the same as ceasing to keep such house, must necessarily give to the court a discretion to grant a,license, in the case of a removal to another place.\nIf the act of 1887 did not interfere with the exercise of a discretion in the court to transfer liquor license from place to place, the right of the court still exists, since the act of 1891 contains nothing to interfere with the right of the court to make such transfer. \u2022 It is respe'ctfully submitted that, the view-of the court below, namely, \u201c that the advertisement required-by the act of 1887 and 1891, is of .no avail if transfers were allowed,\u201d is without force, because, since. Blumenthal\u2019s Cas\u00e9, transfers are made without advertisement, though the act of 1887 especially requires full advertisement.\nOct. 1, 1894:"
