It is a subsisting chose in action representing the fund which it describes. Without inquiring whether it is true, as has been said, that Pennsylvania is the only state in which a certificate of deposit is held not to be negotiable, it is a fact that in Patterson v.

In the Patterson Case importance was attributed to the fact that the certificate was not a promissory note within the statute of Anne (Roberts’s Digest 375). In that connection, therefore, it should be noted that the statute did not specify or define what should constitute a promissory note.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

Poindexter and the cases following it, the legislature has specified what shall constitute a negotiable instrument: Act of May 16, 1901 P. L. 194. Many instruments which would not <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>have been negotiable in the sense in which we are considering the term, prior to the Negotiable Instruments Law, are negotiable according to its provisions. The question must, therefore, now be considered in the light of the statute, keeping in mind that we are dealing with a law, with slight variations, in force all over the country and enacted, in this and in other states, for the express purpose of obtaining uniformity in the law of negotiable instruments in the general interest of commerce. The certificate in this case is negotiable within the requirements of the first ten sections. It is a written instrument, signed on behalf of defendant, containing an unconditional promise to pay the amount of the deposit to the order of the named depositor at a fixed time with interest specified. Payment is not rendered contingent by the necessity of returning the certificate, because the law implies the duty to return the certificate, just as it implies the duty to return a note; the phrase ‘not subject to check’ is surplusage because the express terms of the certificate are inconsistent with a checking account.

But the point now presented, the negotiability of such certificate of deposit, was not determined by this court in any of the cases, though in one of them, Court of Common Pleas No. 1 squarely ruled that the certificate was negotiable. In the United States Circuit Court for this district, the late Judge McPherson considered the question in Forrest v. Safety Bank &amp; Trust Co., <a href="/f/174/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="174 F. 345" data-case-ids="6749573" data-case-paths="/f/174/0345-01">174 Fed. 345</a> (1909), and held the certificate negotiable.
