Plaintiff, as receiver of the company, caused to be issued a rule to show cause why the postponement of the lien of a mortgage held by the company upon property in Meadville given by the defendants, Perry D. Cook and Ruby Flower Cook, his wife, to that of another mortgage on the same property given to Mrs. Katherine McNamara (whose executrix is the other defendant), should not be stricken from the record. The postponement had been entered by the company’s attorney-in-fact. After hearing, the rule was discharged, and plaintiff appealed, assigning that action of the court as error.</p>

    <p id="b583-3" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[164,875,1154,1352]]]'>This power of attorney was duly recorded in the recorder’s office of Crawford County. In October, 1928, the company took a second mortgage for $3,500 upon a certain plot of land owned by the Cooks. The senior mortgage upon the property was in the amount of $4,500 and was held by the Meadville Building &amp; Loan Association. Both mortgages were recorded. Thereafter, in March, 1925, Smith solicited from one Dickson, who was acting for Mrs. McNamara, another mortgage for $5,000 upon the property in question. Smith agreed that if the loan were granted he would postpone the lien of the company’s mortgage to that of the new mortgage. This he could do, he said, because he was “really the whole company,” and had a power of attorney on record. After Dickson had examined the power of attorney the mortgage was executed, and the postponement in question was entered on March 21, 1925, on the margin of the record of the company’s mortgage. The proceeds of the new loan were used in the following manner: $4,500 to pay off the mortgage of the Meadville Building &amp; Loan Association, $150 as a fee to Dickson, $108 as interest on the mortgage held by the company, and the balance was given to Mr. and Mrs. Cook. The present action was instituted April 11, 1931, a little more than six years after this transaction was terminated.</p>

Accordingly he dismissed plaintiff’s petition. This we believe was error.</p>

The powers therein granted were specific, not general; he could (1) demand and receive moneys payable to the company, (2) institute and prosecute to judgment actions at law necessary for their collection, (3) upon payment give such acquittances and discharges as might be necessary and proper, and (4) compromise matters in dispute. None of these powers can possibly be interpreted to mean or include postponement of mortgages. It is a well known rule that letters of attorney are to be construed strictly, and when special powers are given they are not to be enlarged unless clearly so intended: Campbell v.

One difficulty with this argument is that the circumstances relating to the execution of the McNamara mortgage were not such as would warrant Dickson, or any one else, in assuming that Smith had authority to execute the postponement. It is a familiar rule that one dealing with an agent is bound to ascertain the extent of the agent’s authority (Long v. Lehigh C. &amp; N.

Superior Ct. 379</a>. Where, as here, the transaction which the agent proposed was clearly adverse to the interests of his principal, there could arise no implication that the agent was acting within the scope of his authority. “A general agency, however, does not import unqualified authority; and the implied power of any agent, however general, must be limited to such acts as are proper for an agent to do, and cannot extend to acts clearly adverse to the interest of the principal.” 2 C. J. 582. “In the absence of anything indicating a different meaning, a manifestation of consent that another may act as agent is, notwithstanding general terms, interpreted as meaning only acts on account of and for the benefit of the proposed principal.” Restatement of Agency, section 250. The situation here is analagous to that in Paper M. S. Co. v. Container Corporation, <a href="/pa/301/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="301 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1126498" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0062-01">supra,</a> where the general manager of defendant’s paper mill, who, by virtue of his position, had authority to buy waste paper at the market price, made a contract for an indefinite time, terminable upon notice, with the plaintiff, a dealer in waste paper, whereby defendant was to buy all the paper supplied to it by plaintiff, to be paid for at temporary rates, but if the temporary rates did not cover the cost to which plaintiff would be subjected, defendant, at the termination of the contract was to pay plaintiff whatever losses it might sustain. Concerning this contract, we said, “This is certainly a somewhat remarkable and out-of-the-ordinary business arrangement and before defendant could be held obligated to such an undertaking, it would have to appear very clearly that the manager of its mill had authority to enter into such a contract; the existence of such authority was denied <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>in the affidavit of defense......It is difficult to imagine a more jughandled contract than this would be, every advantage is on one side, defendant had all to lose and nothing to gain; if there was a loss, it must respond for the deficiency; if a gain, plaintiff! kept it......It may be stated as a cardinal principle of business dealings that the making of no such contract as this could be assumed to be within the powers of the manager of a mill, and before acting upon assumed power by such an official, it was the duty of the other party to the contemplated contract to trace his authority to its source to ascertain whether he possessed such power.” In the case at bar, Smith’s proposal to substitute a new mortgage as a prior lien to the mortgage of his company, particularly when that mortgage was in a larger amount than the existing prior lien, was so obviously an act contrary to the interests of his company that it was the duty of Dickson, representing Mrs. McNamara, to ascertain whether he possessed such power. If, after his examination of the power of attorney, he had any thought that Smith had authority not contained in that instrument, it was his imperative duty to trace it to its source. This he did not do. True, Dickson testified that Smith said that he had authority to postpone, but it is elementary that agency to do the act in question cannot be established by the declarations of the agent: First National Bank v. St. John’s Church, <a href="/pa/296/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="296 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1116665" data-case-paths="/pa/296/0467-01">supra;</a> Zavodnick v. A.

There is nothing in the record to show that, before the presenting of plaintiff’s petition, the company ever knew of the postponement, and it certainly cannot be held to have had constructive notice of the completely unauthorized entry on the margin of the record.</p>
    <p id="b587-3" data-blocks='[["BL_587.4",587,[187,787,1154,1461]]]'>Nor, as appellees argue, is the company estopped from now setting up Smith’s want of authority to postpone the lien of its mortgage. Estoppel is based upon misrepresentation, and cannot be claimed where, as here, both parties had equal knowledge of the facts. Dickson was in possession of all the facts relating to Smith’s agency, and if he mistakenly inferred from the letter of attorney that Smith was empowered to do this act, that was an error for which the company cannot be held responsible. As we said in Mott v. Kaldes, <a href="/pa/288/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="288 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1100799" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0264-01">supra,</a> “The primary ground of the doctrine of estoppel is that it Avould be a fraud to assert to the prejudice of another a state of facts to the contrary of that which he whom it is sought to estop had previously represented, and on the faith of which the other had acted; the doctrine assumes a lack of knowledge by the party claiming the estoppel. In Hill v. Epley, <a href="/pa/31/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="31 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="985079" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0331-01">31 Pa. 331</a>, 334, we said, ‘If, therefore, the truth be known to both parties or if they have equal means of knowledge, there can be no estoppel.’ See also Tustin v. Phila. etc. Co., <a href="/pa/250/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="250 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="1016927" data-case-paths="/pa/250/0425-01">250 Pa. 425</a>, 436, and Bittner, v.
