We have stated that: “At common law, subject to certain exceptions, the occupier [and not the landlord] as between himself and the public is prima facie liable for injuries occurring to third persons on or off the premises.” Wolk v.

The liability of a landlord to third persons, arises only when he has (1) contracted to repair, or (2) let the premises in a ruinous condition, or (3) expressly licensed the tenant to do acts amounting to a nuisance: Cunningham v.

Folkman v. Lauer, supra, and the similar case of Kane v. Lauer, supra, arose from the collapse of a grandstand at a ball park. Where the public have the right or are invited generally to use the premises, the owner must have this in contemplation and his liability will be measured by such use. The effect of these cases is not to establish the rule that a landlord is liable for all defects which may cause injury to those who may enter the premises as visitors or occasional invitees.</p>

Under such circumstances the duty of an owner as landlord to a third person would rise no higher.

But even so, “The duty to keep premises safe for invitees applies only to defects or conditions which are in the nature of hidden dangers, traps, snares, pitfalls, and the like, in that they are not known to the invitee, and would not be observed by him in the exercise of ordinary care. The invitee assumes all normal or ordinary risks attendant upon the use of the premises, and the owner or occupant is under no duty to reconstruct or alter the premises so as to obviate known and obvious dangers:” 45 C.

We held an owner was not liable for injuries caused by a depression in a step in a department store: Chapman v. Clothier, <a href="/pa/274/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="274 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1072861" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0394-01">274 Pa. 394</a>. As there stated: “To hold defendants liable for this unfortunate accident would practically be to render the storekeeper an insurer of the safety of his customers, which he is not......Of course, storekeepers are liable where they carelessly expose their customers to real dangers, like open elevator shafts, open hatchways, or obstructions in aisles, etc., but the decisions so holding are not parallel to the present case.” It was held that an owner was not liable to one slipping and falling on an oiled floor, “No liability attached to the defendant from the mere happening of the accident; it was necessary to prove some special default or negligence:” Dimarco v. Cupp Grocery Co., <a href="/pa-super/88/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="88 Pa. Super. 449" data-case-ids="667344" data-case-paths="/pa-super/88/0449-01">88 Pa. Superior Ct. 449</a>. The same rule applied where a fall was occa<a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>sioned by a difference of a few inches in floor levels; this was not sufficient to prove negligence: Haddon v. Snellenburg, <a href="/pa/293/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="293 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="1111127,1111188" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0333-01,/pa/293/0333-02">293 Pa. 333</a>, 336, 337. We said: “The landowner cannot be held liable unless there is proof that the plaintiff was injured through his negligence: Huey v.

It is not negligence per se or negligent construction in a store or other public place to have one floor at a lower level by a few inches than another......Unless we hold defendant was an insurer of the safety of its invitees, we must conclude plaintiff did not make out a case, as there is not a scintilla of evidence to establish negligence......The case is ruled by the principles set forth in Chapman v. Clothier, <a href="/pa/274/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="274 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1072861" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0394-01">supra.</a> It cannot be likened to those involving open elevator shafts, hatchways or obstructions in an aisle.” These cases clearly establish the rule that one in possession is not liable to persons entering for minor defects on his premises. Unless he is to be held an insurer, an owner with slightly uneven walks about his house in the depressions of which quantities of water collect and freeze would not ordinarily be liable to an invitee falling thereon. Under such circumstances the defense which an occupier might or could make would be available to the landlord.</p>

Therefore, the foregoing rules which apply to the liability of a tenant or owner in possession should apply with added force to an owner out of possession, as landlord, where it is claimed the premises have been leased in a defective condition or with an existing nuisance per se. As to a landlord’s liability to third parties see Harte v. Jones, <a href="/pa/287/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="287 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="1099661" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0037-01">287 Pa. 37</a>. In that case two buildings located close together, were separated by a narrow way closed on the street side by a door. The way was excavated below the street level so that there was a drop of several feet inside the door which was at the street level to guard against entrance. A third per<a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>son left the leased building to go to an adjoining building and by mistake, opening the door to the way, stepped inside and fell. We held that the landlord was not liable; the condition which existed was not a nuisance per se nor was it a defect of construction as regards third persons in or about the premises. We said: “The landlord is......liable if the premises <em>are dangerously constructed or a nuisance per </em>se......To cause him to be liable, the premises must be so constructed or be in such condition that in and of itself it amounts to a nuisance: Brown v. White, <a href="/pa/202/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="202 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="992333" data-case-paths="/pa/202/0297-01">202 Pa. 297</a>.” In Bornman v.

On opening the door, he fell to the ground below. We held that this was not negligent construction or a nuisance per se, and that the landlord could not thereby incur liability. In Richey v. Armour, <a href="/pa/293/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="293 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1111167" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0127-01">293 Pa. 127</a>, a business guest of a tenant fell on ice on steps under dripping eaves.
