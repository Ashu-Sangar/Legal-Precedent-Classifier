The auditing judge held on the authority of Hemphill’s Est., <a href="/pa/180/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="180 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="888348" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0095-01">180 Pa. 95</a>, 96, that the trust was active, since the trustees were invested with discretion to invest the principal and pay the net income to the beneficiary; this appellants contend is error in that it fails to distinguish between the duties of the trustees and the purpose of the trust as the test of its validity. But consideration of the question from the standpoint of the purpose of the trust will not alter the result. The terms of the will in Wolfinger v. Fell, <a href="/pa/195/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="195 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="914132" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0012-01">195 Pa. 12</a>, were almost identical with those in the David will. In denying the contention that' the trust failed in that case, we said, pages 15 and 17: “It may be conceded that if the trust created by the will was for coverture only there would be room for the contention that by the will of her mother Catharine acquired an estate in fee tail, which under the Act of April 27, 1855, ‘shall be taken and construed to be an estate in fee simple.’ The assumption that the trust is extinguished because there was no marriage in fact or in contemplation when the will was executed overlooks, and if sustained would defeat, the dominating purpose of the testatrix in the disposition of her property. In Kuntzleman’s Est., <a href="/pa/136/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="136 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="819999" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0142-01">136 Pa. 142</a>, so much of the trust as was for coverture only was inoperative, while that part of it which charged the trustees with the investment of the personalty and the control of the realty was held to constitute an active and continuing trust to pay to the testator’s daughter the rents and profits accruing on one-tenth part of his residuary. estate during her life, and to protect the corpus of the estate for the parties entitled in remainder....... The will of the testatrix discloses a clearly defined intention on her part that her estate shall be held in trust during the lifetime of her daughter Catharine, and at her decease the same shall be disposed of in conformity with her direction therein. Catharine’s interest in the estate is therefore nothing <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>more than a right to have from the trustee while she lives the net rents and income thereof. The trust established by the will is an active and continuing trust, during the life of the party entitled to the net rents and income of the estate, and the validity of it cannot be successfully assailed.” This language is appropriate to the present case and determines the issue. See also Towne’s Est., <a href="/pa/260/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="260 Pa. 443" data-case-ids="1040288" data-case-paths="/pa/260/0443-01">260 Pa. 443</a>.</p>
    <p id="b415-5" data-blocks='[["BL_415.4",415,[166,784,1152,425]]]'>Since we hold the trust to be active, it is unnecessary to discuss appellants’ argument as to the applicability of the rule in Shelley’s Case. However, the opinion of the court in banc correctly states that “The rule in Shelley’s Case has no place on the question of interpretation, because not only is the trust an active one, so that there is no coalescence, but the word children is used as a Avord of purchase and not of limitation.”</p>
    <p id="b415-6" data-blocks='[["BL_415.5",415,[162,1222,1155,855]]]'>Taking up the adjudication of the residuary clause, appellants raise the question of the invalidity of the trust created by item 12 of the will because of the provision to accumulate the income beyond the period permitted by the Act of 1853. It does not appear this point was pressed in the court beloAV, but it is stated in appellants’ brief that, “In recognition of the fact that the trust to accumulate was void, distribution of the accumulations was made in prior accountings among testator’s children including his daughter.” This arrangement, it was stated before us, was made by agreement between all parties in interest, so that only what testator left in his lifetime was before the court below on the distribution from which this appeal is taken; accordingly the argument that the trust is void on this score is unavailing.</p>
