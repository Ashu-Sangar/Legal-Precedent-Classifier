On October 29, 1929, while the policy was in force, Joseph was adjudged a bankrupt, and Maurice L. Praissman was appointed trustee. Joseph made claim in the bankruptcy proceedings for his exemption under the laws of New Jersey. The trustee set apart for the bankrupt as his exemption certain hats and fixtures valued at $200. The action of the trustee was confirmed by the referee. The articles so set aside were taken by Joseph as his exemption. Joseph failed to claim as exempt under the state statute the life insurance policy.</p>

The defendant paid the trustee the cash surrender value.

Joseph in the bankruptcy proceedings unconditionally delivered to the trustee the insurance policy in question. In the face of the averment in the eighth paragraph of the plaintiff’s statement, the truth of which was admitted by the affidavit of defense, that the cancellation or attempted cancellation of the policy was without the consent or approval apd against the express direction of both Leonard L. Joseph and Bessie Joseph, the beneficiary, we think the averment in the supplemental affidavit of defense as to the mere physical delivery of this <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>policy by the attorney to the trustee is entirely without legal effect. There is in defendant’s pleadings an entire absence of an averment of any formal assignment or surrender of this policy in writing by the insured to the trustee in bankruptcy or to the insurance company. Title never passed from the insured. His being adjudicated a bankrupt did not per se divest him of his title. Nothing short of a positive unequivocal act on his part could have worked a divestiture of title. The delivery of the policy to the trustee by the bankrupt’s lawyer did not constitute such a positive unequivocal act. Even if it had been authorized, it is doubtful if this physical delivery alone would have been sufficient to have passed title from the bankrupt to the trustee, but this question we do not need to and do not decide, for, as a step in the attempted cancellation or surrender of the policy, it was “without the consent or approval and against the express direction of both Leonard L. Joseph, the insured, and Bessie Joseph, the beneficiary.”</p>

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 43 Federal Reporter (2d series) 74, the insured was adjudged a voluntary bankrupt. He owned a policy of life insurance in the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in the sum of $5,000. It had a cash surrender value of $625.43. The beneficiary was his wife. Notice was given to the bankrupt of the cash surrender value and demand was made upon him to pay the surrender value to the trustee, if he wished to redeem the policy. He did not redeem. The trustee obtained an order on the bankrupt, his wife and the insurance company requiring them to show cause why the cash surrender value should not be paid to the trustee, and why the bankrupt should not be compelled to execute the documents and papers necessary to accomplish the payment of the surrender value to the trustee. The bankrupt and his wife appeared at the hearing. The report of the case does not show that they made any claim for exemption. The insurance company appeared and filed an answer setting <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>up that the cash surrender value was exempt under the Insurance Law of the state of New Jersey. The referee held that the surrender value of the policy was not exempt, and that the trustee was entitled to be paid it as part of the estate of the bankrupt. Neither the bankrupt nor the wife appealed from the referee’s order, but the insurance company did so, and the United States District Court of New Jersey reversed the decree and denied the petition of the trustee. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the district court, holding that the cash surrender value of the insurance policy on the life of the bankrupt, in which the right to change the beneficiary without the existing beneficiary’s consent is reserved, is exempt during the bankrupt’s lifetime, under sections 38 and 39 of the Insurance Law of the State of New Jersey (the same sections cited by plaintiff in this case) and under the provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Act.</p>

In that case, Judge Kirkpatrick said: “It is settled law that policies of life insurance which are exempt under the law of the state of the bankrupt’s residence are exempt under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, even though they may have a cash surrender value.
