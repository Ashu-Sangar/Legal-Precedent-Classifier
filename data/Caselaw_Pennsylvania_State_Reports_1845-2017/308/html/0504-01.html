To it was transferred the assets of the former defunct corporation in return for the thousand shares of stock and the company’s note for $11,400. R. L. Brumage who had been a factor in the old company became president of the new company. The bank retained 200 shares of the stock of the new company and the balance of 800 shares were issued to the officers and employees of the new company. The 800 shares so issued were pledged to the bank as collateral for the individual note of R. L. Brumage. C. M. Gerwig, then vice-president of the bank, and W. W. Hamilton, then cashier of the bank, became respectively vice-president and treasurer of the new company, as well as directors of it. During the three years of the company’s existence from 1923 to 1926, the bank loaned it $50,000 but the only annual dividends were disappointments. Deficits mounted and finally the company’s indebtedness to the bank was funded in the form of debenture bonds totalling $64,200 and held by the bank. The financial statement dated March 31,1926, exhibit No. 1, lists assets as $76,053.32 and liabilities <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>$7,965.41.

Plaintiff visited the plant several times and held several conferences with Brumage and the bookkeeper. Brumage later referred plaintiff to the bank officials. In May, 1926, plaintiff talked with W. W. Hamilton, cashier of the bank and treasurer of the coffee company, and Hamilton described the company as a prosperous, self-sustaining commercial enterprise, and declared that the company had $76,000 of assets, all collectible and good. Plaintiff testified also that a day or two later the president of the bank, W. M. Reed, in the presence of Hamilton, told him (the plaintiff) that the bank needed a man in the company to look after its interests, that it would sell plaintiff 500 shares of the company’s stock for $10,000, that if plaintiff invested in the company he could not lose a penny, that there were $76,-000 worth of assets in the company as good as gold, and offered as security for the invited investment of $10,000 to treat it as a debt of the company and give it priority over the $64,200 of the company’s debenture bonds held by the bank. Plaintiff then inspected the balance sheet, exhibit No. 1. On plaintiff’s third visit to the bank a few days later, he asked Reed the reason for the company’s prosperity and Reed replied that they had trademarks registered in Washington which gave them the exclusive right to sell goods of certain popular brands. On May 11, 1926, the bank’s officers drafted an agreement reciting that “Robert Emery......has agreed to loan and advance to the Highland Coffee Company the sum of- $10,000 in cash” and that the bank agreed “to <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>grant and give priority to said debt from the Highland Coffee Company to Robert Emery” over the debt from the company to the bank. This was executed by the bank alone and delivered to plaintiff. The latter informed Reed that he didn’t have $10,000 available. It was then agreed that plaintiff and his wife should sign a demand judgment note for that amount payable to the bank and thereby secure $10,000. with which bo purchase 500 shares of the coffee company’s stock. This was done on May 18th. Plaintiff has since paid $9,750 on this obligation, with interest. Plaintiff received 500 shares of stock and was elected treasurer of the company in place of Hamilton. The board of directors consisted of plaintiff, Brumage and Hamilton. Plaintiff worked in the business and received $100 a week. In July he told Reed and Hamilton that the assets were not as represented and that he wanted to return the stock and get his money back. They induced him to remain in the company and told him he would not lose a penny. In October plaintiff took Brumage’s place as president of the company. After many unavailing efforts to keep the concern afloat, the company was adjudged bankrupt about a year and a half later. On August 17,1927, plaintiff brought this suit.</p>

That the company had “been losing” money appeared in language so plain that he who runs could read and he who read should have run. This statement showed a net loss of $16,133.26 to March 1, 1926. It showed no cash on hand whatsoever. The proffered agreement, exhibit A, dated May 11, 1926, to grant and give priority to the company’s debt of $10,000 “for moneys to be advanced” by Emery distinctly set forth in its first “whereas” clause that the company “is short of working capital and is unable at the present time to pay its debts.” While under cross-examination, plaintiff defined a self-sustaining concern as one “that is taking care of itself,” that has cash on hand and does not have to borrow. These facts justify the view of the dissenting judge (MacFaelane) in the court below that the representation that the company was a prosperous and self-sustaining commercial enterprise was “mere seller’s talk” and was known by Emery to be false.</p>

The latter company was largely indebted to the bank and it was to the interest of the bank that the coffee company’s business be galvanized into life by some new money. The fact that the money received from plaintiff went to the coffee company and not to the bank, and that the bank sold not stock owned by it but held by it as collateral, is not decisive of this question.

The purchase of the stock and the payment therefor was one contract; the note transaction was another. Therefore, plaintiff, by paying the note, did not continue to perform the contract for the purchase of the stock. The contract had been executed on both sides as soon as plaintiff paid the money to the bank and received the stock.

The <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>reports for 1924 and 1925 were signed belatedly by the trustee in bankruptcy.

He says that he paid $10,000 for the stock. If from these returns you find that this stock had value at the time he purchased it, then his loss would be the difference between the $10,000 he paid for the stock and the value of it at that time. If it had no value at that time, then he suffered a loss of the full amount of the money he put into it. If it had value, if it was worth $10,000 at the time, then he suffered no loss; but, as I say, if it was worth less, if it had some value, he would suffer a loss of the difference between what its value was at that time and the $10,000 he paid for it.’ ” If the jury found — as the evidence indicates— that the transaction between plaintiff and the coffee company was not a loan, the measure of damages laid down by the trial judge as governing this case'is not <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>questioned by tbe appellant, but tbe lattér says in its argument that it “does except to the subject-matter as laid down by the trial judge to which said measure of damages was to be applied.” There is much merit in defendant’s contention that the stock had some value at the time Emery bought it, assuming that the jury found that he did buy it. The 1925 capital stock tax report offered in evidence by plaintiff showed that the company returned for tax purposes assets of an actual value of $55,256.38, as of December 31, 1925. It also showed liabilities exclusive of the postponed debenture bonds and of the capital stock, amounting only to $7,727.69. There is no evidence that these asset's had been substantially diminished by May 19, 1926, the date of plaintiff’s purchase. Futhermore, when the company received plaintiff’s $10,000, its assets were increased by that amount. It is obvious therefore that after the payment of current liabilities, and assuming that the stock of plaintiff was given priority over the $64,200 of the coffee company’s debenture bonds held by the bank, there were sufficient assets in the company to make plaintiff’s stock of considerable value had liquidation been resorted to at the time or shortly after the time plaintiff bought his stock. Plaintiff’s testimony as to his priority over the debenture bonds is in substance that the president of the bank promised to give him (the plaintiff) priority over the $64,200 debenture bonds and delivered to him an agreement embodying that promise, on the day prior to the signing of the $10,000 note and before he, Emery, paid the money to the coffee company, and it was some days after that that he received certificates for the 500 shares of stock of the Highland Coffee Company.</p>
