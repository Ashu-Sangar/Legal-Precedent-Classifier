By his will he left his residuary estate to trustees, who were to pay the income to his seven children and their descendants for 21 years after the death of his last surviving grandchild (alive at his death), and on the termination of the trust, the principal was to go to his descendants. Each child had power to appoint his share of the income after his death, and Ms share of the principal after the termination of the trust.</p>
    <p id="b437-9" data-blocks='[["BL_437.10",437,[170,1650,1153,642]]]'>A special trust was thereafter made for one of his children, John C. Bullitt, Jr. His share of the income was directed to be paid to three special trustees who were not the trustees of the residuary estate. The special trustees were to hold the income upon a drastic spendthrift trust, and to apply it, or so much thereof as they might think proper, for the support of John C. Bullitt, Jr. Discretionary power was given as to the amount they should expend for this purpose. Any accumulations not applied to his maintenance were to be paid to his children, or to any of the beneficiaries who, under the provisions of the testator’s will, might become entitled to them.</p>

He left no children to survive him.</p>

Bullitt, Sr., in 1902, as part of the residuary estate there were 1,150 shares of stock of the Virginia Coal &amp; Iron Company. These shares were delivered to the trustees. In 1918 a 33%% stock dividend was declared, and the trustees received 383 additional shares. There was an adjudication of the account in 1919, and this stock was awarded to the trustees, as we shall later discuss.</p>
    <p id="b438-6" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[290,939,1151,1453]],["BL_439.1",439,[163,334,1153,317]]]'>In 1928, a second stock dividend of 100% was declared and the trustees received 1,595 shares, representing 1,150 original shares, 383 from the 1918 dividend, and 62 shares purchased for the corpus from trust estate funds. Appellant, John C. Bullitt, Jr.’s widow, the income beneficiary, claimed part of this dividend as representing income. The court below, in its adjudication and final decree found that the stock dividend declared in 1918 having been awarded by the adjudication of 1919 to the trustees, it then became part of the principal, and should thereafter be regarded as such; and any stock dividend thereafter should be based upon such adjudication. Ordinarily that much of the finding should not be questioned. The remainder of the adjudication — that the book value of the stock as it existed in 1918 should be the intact value thereafter, and form the basis for apportioning future stock dividends, — presents the debatable ground. That is, the court below in effect found that from the audit of 1919, a presumption arose that the award of the stock dividend of 1918 to the corpus of the estate was to preserve the intact value of 1902 when testator died; that, as there was nothing of record to show what the intact value was at that time, or, if it was increased since that time, what caused the increase, the award of 1919 was in effect an adjudication of intact value as of that date. Oral testimony at the present hearing shows it to have been $218 a share. The adjudi<a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>cation of 1919 therefore was res judicata of the question now before the court; and in apportioning the 1928 stock dividend all must go to corpus to support intact value. The court thus found it could not go behind the award of 1919 even though a mistake had been made: Stetson’s Est., <a href="/pa/305/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="305 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1134595" data-case-paths="/pa/305/0062-01">305 Pa. 62</a>.</p>
    <p id="b439-5" data-blocks='[["BL_439.4",439,[165,663,1156,478]]]'>The force of appellee’s contention lies in its applicability to the adjudication of 1919 and the basic facts on which it was grounded. “Only such facts and issues ......as have been acted on, in the sense that they may be said to be ‘judicially ascertained’ or determined, can be held res judicata in a subsequent litigation between the same parties, over the samé subject-matter:” State Hospital v.

After the 1918 stock dividend the book value was $218 plus a share or $251,079.50 for 1,150 shares. The court below concedes the 383 shares (stock dividend of 1918) should have been given to the life tenants in 1919, but, because of that decree, awarded the entire 1928 dividend to the remaindermen. The effect of this decision would be to give them all the accumulated income since 1902 or the difference between $145+ a share and $218+ a share on the 1,150 original shares. Such conclusion furnishes a convenient method to strip a life tenant of all income through stock dividends. It is easily seen that appellee’s position has no standing on the merits.</p>

If we accept appellee’s theory that the adjudication of 1919 unquestionably determines intact value in the apportionment of the stock dividend of 383 shares awarded to it, then, taking the record as it is, on appellee’s theory the remaindermen would be badly misused; but this must <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>be the logic of the situation if res judicata and the presumption is applied. The court confirmed a value of $100 a share in 1919, and if this was the intact value, then the entire stock dividend of 1928 would go to life tenants, as the value of a share after that dividend was $121+. But if, on the other hand, evidence may be supplied in the present case to show the actual intact value in 1918, then all questions relating to that value at that time may properly be submitted. It nowhere appears in the record that $218 or any figure fixed the value except as shown by the account. Such evidence does not disturb a single line of Judge Lamorelle’s adjudication in 1919. He awarded the 383 shares to corpus — and they are not taken therefrom. If the adjudication decided nothing about value, then value as relating to the 1,150 shares may be shown.</p>

While the record as such contained no information as to why the stock dividend ‘of 383 shares was awarded to corpus, there was produced at the present audit an agreement under which the 1919 award was made. All interested life tenants executed it; the agreement read: “We the undersigned, being all of the beneficiaries under the will of John C. Bullitt, deceased, presently entitled to the income therefrom, do hereby request that the stock dividend of three hundred eighty-three (383) shares, which the trustees under the will of said John C. Bullitt, deceased, received from the Virginia Coal &amp; Iron Company in July, 1918, be awarded back to the said trustees as a part of the principal of the estate, to be held for future accounting, and we do hereby agree that such award be made.” This agreement was conceded at bar to be the foundation for the award of 1919. The life tenants nowhere assert in it that, in giving the shares to the principal it was done to preserve the intact value then or at any time. It may have been a donation, or it may have been to better secure the corpus, or there may have been many other rea<a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>sons that prompted such action; they simply said the shares should “be awarded back to the said trustees as a part of the principal of the estate, to be held for future accounting.” Why should it “be awarded back” if it had not been considered in the first place as belonging to (awarded to) the life tenants as income. They were entitled to it and they gave it back to the trustees to be added to the principal for future accounting. Under no construction of the agreement could an adjudication based thereon be considered such an adjudication as considered the questions necessary to an apportionment of stock dividend between life tenant and remaindermen where such apportionment was to preserve the intact value. An award based on such an agreement would indicate some other reason than that it was to sustain intact value as generally understood.</p>

All over this latter sum belonged to the life tenants as earnings. They were supposed to know this when they gave back the stock. The adjudication based on such an agreement could not prejudice the questions that must be considered in a final determination of the rights of the life tenants with respect to the future stock dividend. The court below, in determining the question of res judicata, should have considered the pleadings and facts before it necessary to support it.
