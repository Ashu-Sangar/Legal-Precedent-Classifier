When this is done, the words “at maturity” no .more stand out from the paper than do certain other of its provisions such as “loans- and advances are being <em>and are to be made </em>at our request,” “hereby guarantee the payment at maturity of <em>any and all sums </em>which the [bank] <em>may lend </em>or which the [company] may <em>in any way owe to </em>the [bank] by reason of indorsements, acceptances, overdrafts [to which the words ‘at maturity’ could not apply in the way appellants would use them], drafts, <em>or in any other way whatever. </em>This guarantee <em>is a continuing guarantee covering all sums borrowed.” </em>When all these clauses are taken into account, the words “payment at maturity” mean, not as appellants contend, <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>the guarantee of the payment of each individual note as it matures, with the implied interdiction of renewals, but the payment of the entire indebtedness due the bank by the corporation when the bank demanded its payment provided it was due, up to the limit set forth in the agreement. We think the argument of appellants as to their decedent’s rights and standing as a surety is pitched upon the principles which apply to sureties who are strangers in interest to the matter which they guarantee, and whose only relation to it is that of suretyship. Here, the decedent was not simply a surety, but he had a personal interest in the company whose obligations he was guaranteeing since he was one of its officers and stockholders. The law is not so tender to him as to one who was not being personally obliged by the loan of the bank’s money: Richardson v.

    <p id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[211,1721,1157,640]]]'>The guaranty is dated the blank day of August, 1926. Contemporaneously with or immediately subsequent to its execution, on August 18,1926, the bank took from the corporation two notes at ninety days, one for $25,000 and the other for $10,000. The bank did not require payment of these notes on their due date, but, without notice to or knowledge of the decedent, surrendered them to the corporation and accepted renewals of them maturing February 14, 1927. The decedent died January 14, 1927. Following his death the notes were twice again renewed by notes which came due on June 14, 1927. It is these last notes upon Avhich claim is made.</p>

      <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>Appellants call to our attention the familiar principle last invoked by us in Yubas v.

We do not intend to place limitations upon this rule where the circumstances call for its application, but here in our view the obligation of the surety is within the terms of the contract he executed when its complete text is brought into view. In Phoenix Brewing Co. v. Rumbarger, <a href="/pa/181/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="181 Pa. 251" data-case-ids="891412" data-case-paths="/pa/181/0251-01">181 Pa. 251</a>, the surety was held liable on a bond conditioned for payment by the principal of all accounts in a course of dealing between him and plaintiff “when and as often as the same <em>may fall due, </em>or when thereunto legally required,” after the principal had extended the time of payment by giving his creditor judgment notes for the amounts then due. See also 50 Corpus Juris, page 136, section 225 (“Principal and Surety”). Moreover even on appellants’ restricted construction, much could be said in favor of the proposition that “payment at maturity” means actual payment of the indebtedness due the bank, not conditional payment. “Payment in commercial paper constitutes only conditional payment, and since conditional payment does not discharge the original indebtedness, it does not discharge the surety for such indebtedness:” DeRoy’s Est., <a href="/pa/305/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="305 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1134660" data-case-paths="/pa/305/0541-01">305 Pa. 541</a>, 544, and authorities therein cited. Much reliance as sustaining their position is placed by appellants on American Trust Co. v. Louderback, <a href="/pa/220/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="220 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="1005927" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0197-01">220 Pa. 197</a>, where the language in the recital and condition of the ■bond was to protect the obligee “from all loss......by reason of the nonpayment at maturity of any commercial paper made or endorsed by Samuel K. Reichner” and where we held that the renewal notes were not covered. In the contract now being considered the language is much broader and more embracing.</p>
    <p id="b206-7" data-blocks='[["BL_206.4",206,[283,2265,1150,151]],["BL_207.1",207,[191,349,1155,1460]]]'>We now come to appellants’ second position, that the guaranty contains no specific provision covering preexisting debts and hence the surety was not liable for such <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>a debt evidenced by a note not yet matured, which note the bank, by arrangement with the principal debtor, and without the knowledge or consent of the surety, surrendered to the principal debtor, taking a new note so as to bring it within the guaranty. When account is taken of the fact that the note in question, together with the other note for $25,000 makes up the exact amount covered by the guaranty, the record would have to be clearer than it is in order to reach the conclusion that the $10,000 note was not covered by the contract. Again referring to its language, we see it says “loans <em>are being </em>and are to be made at our request.” Certainly “are being made” may refer to existing loans. Further it says that the signers “guarantee the payment of any and all sums which [the corporation] may <em>in any way </em>owe to [the bank] up to the sum of $35,000.00. [This guarantee] is a continuing guarantee covering <em>all sums borrowed prior to May 81, 1927, </em>[the note in question was given prior to that date] and is to guarantee the payment of <em>any </em>indebtedness which the company may owe to said bank” not exceeding the amount named. It cannot be convincingly argued that this language does not cover the obligation now in question. The auditing judge found that the $10,000 note was not a substituted one, but a new obligation for a new debt. We might well rest our conclusion on this finding, but have preferred to meet appellants’ position as they have advanced it.</p>

Appellants claim they are entitled to credit to the amount of this note. It was made by I. Cohen &amp; Sons, endorsed by the Growers Sales Company and delivered by it to the appellee as general collateral for the $35,000 loan. When delivered to appellee, it was overdue. The bank did not proceed at law for its col<a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>lection, because its information was that the makers were without resources and it was not willing to put up the money necessary for attorney fees and the expenses of suit. As we understand the situation, however, suit has now been begun by the appellants or some one acting in their behalf to collect it from the makers in Pittsburgh where they reside. There is no testimony upon which it can be found that any loss has resulted from the delay in bringing suit. Appellants took no action and requested none by the appellee for a considerable period after they knew of the note. Furthermore, it appears that the note was tendered by the bank to Edwards, another of the guarantors, for such action as he might desire to take. In addition to this, it is still unknown whether the note is barred by the statute of limitations, depending on whether it is an obligation covered by the law of Florida, where the limitation is five years, or of this State, where it is six.</p>
