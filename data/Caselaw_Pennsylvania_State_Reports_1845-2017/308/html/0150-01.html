The decree must be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b174-6" data-blocks='[["BL_174.4",174,[277,509,1151,535]]]'>Alleging that the act of assembly was unconstitutional for the reason stated, a taxpayer of the State filed a class bill in equity, praying that the auditor general and state treasurer be perpetually enjoined and restrained from drawing a warrant for, or paying any money by virtue of, the statute, and that the hospital be perpetually enjoined and restrained from receiving or accepting the intended appropriation, or any part thereof. Subsequently another taxpayer of the State was given leave to intervene as a party plaintiff.</p>

In view of this, the rule is settled that: “A finding of fact by a chancellor on sufficient evidence [when sustained by the court in banc] that a hospital is a sectarian institution, has the effect of a verdict of a jury, and will not be reversed on appeal, in the absence of manifest error:” Collins v.

Appellant’s principal legal contention, growing out of the additional findings that “patients are received and treated in the hospital without regard to their religious affiliations,” that “ministers and rabbis of other denominations are permitted to visit the sick and perform religious rites to them when required,” and that some, or even a majority, of the directors, the doctors and the employees do not belong to the sect which has the “domination, control and governing influence” in the hospital, while matters to be considered, are not necessarily controlling. They speak in trumpet tones regarding the charitable nature of appellant, and of the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis, who are the controlling influence in its management; but they cannot, in and of themselves, defeat the constitutional provision which “forbids state aid to institutions affiliated with a particular religious sect or denomination, or which are under the control, domination or governing influence of any religious sect or denomination Collins v.
