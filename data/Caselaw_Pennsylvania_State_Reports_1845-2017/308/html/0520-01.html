The corporation was to manufacture hosiery, and was to issue one thousand shares of common stock, each of one hundred dollars par value. Plaintiff was to have thirty shares, Gray two hundred, and the two Largmans the balance. Plaintiff was to be employed for one year to devote his full time and attention to the manufacturing branch of the business, at a stated salary of seventy dollars a week plus five per cent of the net profits. Gray was to manage the department of sales and distribution for one year at a salary plus ten per cent of the profits. Thereafter, their respective terms of employment were to be determined by a subsequent agreement, to be entered into between the parties. Plaintiff was given the option of purchasing, after incorporation, one hundred seventy additional shares from the Largmans; and Gray, sixty additional shares. The Largmans were to devote such time to the management of the business as their other interests permitted; they were each to receive salaries of fifty dollars a week and seventeen and one-half per cent of the profits. Neither Gray nor the plaintiff could alienate his stock, voluntarily or involuntarily ; and the Largmans received options to purchase the stock in the event that either Gray or the plaintiff wished to sell it, or if their employment should terminate for any reason.</p>

      <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>In April, 1920, after the corporation had been duly organized pursuant to this agreement, the plaintiff entered into two further written agreements with defendants; one of these was a contract of employment with the corporation alone, whereby the latter undertook to employ plaintiff for a term of three years beginning January 1, 1920, at a salary of eighty dollars a week and five per cent of the net profits per annum. The other was between plaintiff and all of the defendants. It makes specific reference to the agreement of employment entered into on the same day and declares that any breach of either agreement by plaintiff shall be deemed a breach of the other as well. It then repeats in detail the option granted to plaintiff in the pre-incorporation agreement to acquire one hundred seventy additional shares of common stock from the Largmans, and provides that payment for the first seventy shares shall be made out of the five per cent of the profits which plaintiff was to receive as salary and dividends on his original holdings. Plaintiff was therein prohibited from disposing of any of his stock, and the Largmans received an option to purchase his holdings in the event of his death or in the event of an attempted transfer of the stock by him, except to the Largmans. Such attempt, ipso facto, would terminate his employment. In case of any attempted transfer of this stock by plaintiff, the Largmans would thereby become entitled to purchase his stock at one-half of its book value. The term of the agreement was for three years from January 1, 1920. If the corporation did not earn net annual profits of at least ten per cent on all of the common shares, after payment of the dividend on the preferred stock, the Largmans were to have an option to purchase plaintiff’s stock as above. The agreement provided further: “If, however, there has been such a net profit (including also said amount sufficient to cover the preferred stock dividend) averaged for said period so ascertained, then, unless at least a majority of the common stockholders of <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>the company shall, by a writing addressed to the company, indicate their desire that the agreement shall not be renewed (in which case it shall not be renewed), this agreement (and the employment agreement of said Schuster) shall thereby be renewed for a further term of three years, beginning as of January 1, 1923, and so on from three year term to three year term. If not so renewed, all-the said shares of common stock then of the said Schuster shall be subject to an option of purchase by the said Harry Largman and (or) Joseph Largman ......and the price to be the book value plus twenty-five per cent of the book value additional, or if said aggregate would be less than the par value of said shares plus twenty-five per cent additional on said par, then the par value of said shares plus twenty-five per cent additional on said par value; if the last said option be not exercised, then the corporation shall be dissolved, unless the said Harry Largman and Joseph Largman and Schuster agree in writing on some other method of paying out the interest of said Schuster.” The complaint sets forth that on January 1, 1923, by resolution of the board of directors, assented to by all of the parties, Gray’s and plaintiff’s salaries under the specific agreements referred to were cancelled and annulled, and power was granted the corporation to change their compensations from time to time with the assent of the employee; that in November, 1929, the Largmans purchased Gray’s common stock, thereby so increasing their holdings that they owned all the outstanding stock except the two hundred shares held by plaintiff, the latter having increased his holdings under the option provision ; that the by-laws provided for four directors, but since Gray sold out and left the. company, there had been only three, to wit: plaintiff and the two Largmans; that from incorporation until March 6, 1931, plaintiff gave his whole time to his duties in handling the manufacturing work of the corporation; that the business of the corporation has prospered and increased, so that by <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>the end of 1930 the corporation possessed a plant worth upwards of one million dollars, with a surplus of three-quarters of that amount; that the Largmans by virtue of their majority control, have dominated the corporation’s activities and have refused to elect a fourth director; that they so “harassed and coerced Gray and interfered with the performance of his duties” that he finally sold his stock to them at less than one-half of its value.</p>

It is averred that the Largmans have “manifested a desire to oust plaintiff” from the corporation, and with that end in view interfered with his control of the work of manufacture, and deprived him of a voice in the management of the corporation in violation of the agreement set forth. They interfered with his handling of the company’s employees, reduced wages against his wishes, so that a strike ensued, with great loss to the corporation. They “assumed to dominate the manufacture of the product of the corporation,” ignored plaintiff, and deprived him of his control, with resulting losses to the company, which, it is alleged, will be augmented in the future. The Largmans are charged with “arbitrary and wilful” conduct in derogation of plaintiff’s rights, with increasing their salaries, with the commission of costly errors, with destruction of the company’s good will, and with visiting irreparable loss upon the corporation through their lack of practical knowledge and experience. On March 3, 1931, plaintiff received notice of a special meeting of the board of directors to be held to consider a resolution terminating plaintiff’s employment by the corporation because he was “not giving his best efforts to the welfare of the business.” This meeting was held on March 6th, and, over plaintiff’s protest, the motion was carried; plaintiff was duly informed by letter of his discharge. Plaintiff denies that he failed to perform his duties faithfully under the employment <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>agreement. Tlie final allegation is that the aforementioned conduct of the Largmans was in gross violation of the agreements between the parties, was unlawful, wrongful and fraudulent, and hence entitles plaintiff to demand a receivership of the corporation, with a view to the corporation’s final dissolution and the distribution of its assets, and to surcharge the Largmans for losses incurred through their wrongful conduct, and to secure the issuance of a restraining order against them.</p>

First, plaintiff invokes the jurisdiction of equity in his aid as the aggrieved member of a partnership excluded from his rightful participation in the partnership business. It is true that the bill of complaint referred to the agreements antedating and postdating the incorporation as partnership agreements, yet in none of them is mention made of a partnership. The ante-incorporation agreement, exhibit A, says nothing of any intention to form a partnership. On the contrary its preliminary recitals afford every indication that the sole purpose of the parties was to promote and organize a corporation. The words used are: “Whereas the parties desire to provide a general plan and scheme of organization of said corporation and business.” In determining whether a partnership is created, the entire set of agreements between the parties must be considered, together with all of the attending circumstances: Rowley v. Rowley, <a href="/pa/294/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="294 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="1113364" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0535-01">294 Pa. 535</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=144%20A.%20537" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="144 A. 537">144 A. 537</a>; Coens v.

The primary essentials of a partnership are defined in the Uniform Partnership Act of March 26, 1915, P. L. 18, part II, section 6 (53 Purdon’s Statutes, section 11), as “an association of two or more persons to carry on as coowners a business for profit.” The indispensable requisites of a partnership are coownership of a business and the sharing of its profits. In the case before us, when incorporation was achieved the business was carried on by the corporation <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>itself. No such business was previously carried on by the four stockholders acting as individuals or as partners. The four incorporators were not partners unless all coowners of stock in any corporation are partners. They did not own any business together. The business was owned by another legal entity, to wit: the corporation. The fundamental requisite of a partnership is co-ownership of a business. “Business” is defined in the Partnership Act, part I, section 2, as including “every trade, occupation or profession.” The fact that the defendant took five per cent of the profits as part of the compensation for his services affords no inference of a partnership: Uniform Partnership Act of 1915, P.

Plaintiff would have us strip the defendant corporation of its corporate habiliments and make it stand unmasked as a partnership. This will not be done except under such unusual circumstances as are not present in this case. See Macan v.

Hooper, supra, plaintiff and defendant acquired the entire stock of the corporation as a partnership, each to have equal voice and control in the management of the corporation as directors, together with other directors who were to have only nominal functions. The parties quarreled and defendant with the aid of the “dummy” directors ousted plaintiff from participation in control of the business. Plaintiff brought a bill in equity for a receiver and an injunction. The fourteen judges of the Court of Errors and Appeals were unanimous in denying relief, saying that if the parties “adopt the corporate form, with the corporate shield extended over them to protect them against personal liability, they cease to be partners and have only the rights, duties and obligations of stockholders. They cannot be partners inter se and a corporation as to the rest of the world”; and that such a legal paradox offends sound principles of public policy. See also Einstein v.

The sole business of these parties was that carried on by the corporation. We know of no principle of equity which will justify a minority stockholder, after the corporation had had many years’ success, to enlist the aid of a court of equity to have a receiver appointed and the corporation dissolved. A receivership and dissolution of the corporation is a radical remedy to be invoked only in case of legal necessity. Here no question of insolvency is involved. Here the complaining party’s interests are not imperiled by any alleged fraudulent manipulation of the assets (as in Schipper Bros. Coal Mining Co. v.

J. page 950. In the case before us the complaint charges fraud and mismanagement. The allegations are not of that specific nature which would call for the interposition of a court of equity. The complaint sets forth that the individual defendants have “undermined the confidence of the employees in plaintiff’s ability;” their “lack of tact” resulted in a strike which caused great loss and damage to the corporation. They “assumed to dominate” the corporation and “ignored” plaintiff. Other similar acts are recited, and these were characterized as being “unlawful, wrongful and fraudulent.” This characterization is merely a conclusion from the facts cited, and it appears to be unjustified. The chancellor aptly said: “The bill does not definitely set forth and describe a single dishonest or fraudulent act. It does show, inferentially, that the <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>plaintiff and two defendants as directors and stockholders had dissensions among themselves as to certain policies and plans in the management of the business...... and that in determining these dissensions the two Largmans, by reason of their holding a majority of the stock and being the majority of the directors, adopted their own views and plans and disregarded or overruled the views and contentions of the plaintiff.” Negative averments of fraud are insufficient to invoke the equitable interposition demanded.
