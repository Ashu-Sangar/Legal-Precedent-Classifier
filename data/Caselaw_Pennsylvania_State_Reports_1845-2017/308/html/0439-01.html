Co., <a href="/pa/301/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="301 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1126491" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0351-01">301 Pa. 351</a>, and they need not all be restated. The fire occurred on July 4th, and on the 17th the adjuster was given an inventory showing a loss of approximately $2,400; thereafter the goods, consisting of merchandise, were transferred to a warehouse, and sold on the 8th of August. The proof of loss showed the loss as over $5,000. The insurer contends that recovery should be limited to the loss shown by the inventory made July 17th, because it had not been given a sufficient opportunity to check the goods after the fire. The evidence, however, shows that when the first inventory was given it was only partial, as appellees had not been able to make a complete inventory up to that time. The insured was not required to hold his goods for an indefinite period waiting for the company to check them. Much of the stock had to be sold as promptly as possible to prevent further loss. The policy gives the insurer the right, as often as might be reasonably necessary, to inspect “the remains of any property,” but it must demand and make such inspection with reasonable promptness; it cannot unreasonably withhold its demand. Here there is no evidence of any demand except for the inventory. The court below properly submitted this question to the jury, giving appellant the benefit of every inference from the first inventory. The ease is not similar to Krogulski v. Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co., <a href="/pa-super/68/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="68 Pa. Super. 47" data-case-ids="630962" data-case-paths="/pa-super/68/0047-01">68 Pa. Superior Ct. 47</a>.</p>

In the latter case, an agency was established at Wilkes-Barre, with Miller as agent. Miller accepted the assistance of one Thomas, an itinerant solicitor of insurance in the vicinity. He looked up properties, took verbal applications and brought them to Miller. After they were accepted, Thomas delivered some of the policies and received the premium. The valuation of the property in that case was fixed by Thomas, who had solicited the insurance, after conversation with the insured. After the acceptance of the insurance, the policy was delivered to the insured, and payment was made to Thomas, and some of it to Miller, the agent. The contest was over the statement of value. The court there held the knowledge of the subagent was knowledge of the company. The rule has been restated, with respect to payments of premiums to subagents, in Penna. Co. v. Home Life Ins.

Unless such acts of subagents are upheld, innocent parties would be a prey to unscrupulous agents and possibly their companies. The cases cited by appellee are easily distinguishable, and we need not go into them in detail.

The agreement having contemplated an arbitration of the amount of the loss sustained on the building, merchandise, store fixtures and household furniture, it was not error for the court to exclude evidence tending to show why such arbitration was not in fact made. The oral evidence offered to show that only the building was to be appraised was not sufficient to set aside the agreement, nor could it be used to contradict or vary its terms. Arbitration proceedings are a quick and easy mode of obtaining justice, their purpose being to settle speedily the amount of loss occasioned by the fire. According to appellants, the agreement was intended to create additional litigation, part by arbitration and the remainder by suit generally. It was not denied there was a loss on the store fixtures, furniture and merchandise, but it was argued because they were not physically present there could be no arbitration award as to them. Why not? If a loss could be shown in court it could be proved before arbitrators. The arbitration agreement was made for the purpose of fixing the loss on all property destroyed. If there was none it should be so found, if there was it should be <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>stated. The mere fact that the property was not in existence will not relieve the arbitrators of the duty of determining the loss. Property may be entirely destroyed by fire but its value may be shown. This being so, since the award did not follow the agreement, it was not conclusive, and the court below properly so ruled.</p>
