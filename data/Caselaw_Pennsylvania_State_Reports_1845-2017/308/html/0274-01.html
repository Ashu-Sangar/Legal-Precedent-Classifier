The court below decided that to permit defendants so to do, would result in their violating article xvii, section 3, of the state Constitution, which, so far as relevant, provides that “Persons and property transported over any railroad shall be delivered at any station at charges not exceeding the charges for transportation of persons and property of the same class in the same direction to any more distant station.”</p>

Admittedly, it is a typical case. There are two railroads which carry freight from Harrisburg to Reading. One is the Reading Railroad, which travels in an easterly direction, the total distance being 54 miles. Under the ruling of the commission above referred to, only that distance would be allowed in computing the class rates for interstate freight, orig-<a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>mating outside of Pennsylvania and passing through Harrisburg to Beading, no matter by what route it traveled while in this State. The other railroad is the Pennsylvania, whose tracks run southeastwardly to Frazer, then northeastwardly to Phcenixville, and then northwestwardly through Boyersford, Pottstown and Birdsboro to Beading. The total mileage of this route is 123 miles. To meet the competition with the Beading, the Pennsylvania charges and proposes to continue charging the same intrastate freight class rates from Harrisburg to Beading, over its 123 miles of trackage, as the Beading does over its 54 miles of track, instead of sending it over the Beading road to that city. To recoup some of the resulting losses arising from this voluntary act, the Pennsylvania proposes, in violation of the constitutional provision, to charge a higher class rate to all the intermediate points on its route between Frazer and Beading than it does to Beading itself. It may not be amiss, though this also is immaterial in the view we take of the case, to specify in a footnote some of the decisions in which the interstate commerce commission has held that it will not grant relief to a carrier which uses a route of such great circuity, in order to permit it to meet competition with a direct line.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> This would seem <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>to be a wise, if not a necessary conclusion, when we consider the reason why railroads are organized and are given the great powers statutorily vested in them, and the purpose of the formation and the controlling power given to the federal and state regulatory commissions.</p>

It is not probable, however, that the statement had any reference to a case involving the long and short haul clause, since, by section 4 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U. S. Code section 4 (1), the commission is itself forbidden to allow “any greater compensation...... for a shorter than for a longer distance over the same line or route in the same direction, the shorter being included within the longer distance......[except] in special cases, <em>after investigation” </em>which, admittedly, has never been made, so far as concerns appellants’ contention that, unless our constitutional provision is ignored, an undue burden will be imposed on interstate traffic.

The question involved in this class of cases, like the interstate commerce provision itself, is not bounded by state lines, but is nationwide, and whether or not interstate commerce is unduly affected by any state constitution is to be determined from a broad consideration of the interstate commerce alleged to be injuriously affected. In its determination, as in all other rate cases, the shippers, interstate and intrastate, are both entitled to be heard as fully as are the railroads. No state judicial tribunal is clothed with the power of duly notifying all such interested parties. For this reason, it has always been held, even before the Transportation Act of 1920, that the matter was one for the commission and not for the courts, and that the latter’s only power in regard to the matter was to enforce or enjoin the definite orders of the commission.</p>

Parkersburg, <a href="/us/107/0691-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="107 U.S. 691" data-case-ids="3499520" data-case-paths="/us/107/0691-01">107 U. S. 691</a>, 701, it is said: “It is congress, and not the judicial department, to which the Constitution has given the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states. The courts can never take the initiative on this subject.” So, also, in The Minnesota Rate Cases, <a href="/us/230/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="230 U.S. 352" data-case-ids="3664215" data-case-paths="/us/230/0352-01">230 U. S. 352</a>, 419, we find that “the question whether the carrier, in such a case, was giving an undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to one locality as against another, or subjecting any locality to an undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage, would be primarily for the investigation and determination of the interstate commerce commission <em>and not for the courts. </em>The dominating purpose of the statute was to secure conformity to the prescribed standards through the examination and appreciation of the complex facts <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>of transportation by the body created for that purpose; and, as this court has repeatedly held, it would be destructive of the system of regulation defined by the statute, if the court, without the preliminary action of the commission, were to undertake to pass upon the administrative question which the statute has primarily confided to it [citing cases]. In the present case, there has been no finding by the Interstate Commerce Commission of unjust discrimination violative of the act; and' no action of that body is before us for review.” So also in Houston, East &amp; West Texas Ry. Co. v. United States, <a href="/us/234/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="234 U.S. 342" data-case-ids="675072" data-case-paths="/us/234/0342-01">234 U. S. 342</a>, 358, it was again held, quoting from the Minnesota Eate Cases, supra, that the matter there being considered, viz., the question of the regulation of intrastate rates, in order that no undue burden should rest on interstate commerce, was “primarily for the investigation and determination of the Interstate Commerce Commission, <em>and not for the courts.” </em>Again in Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. State Public Utilities Com. of Illinois, <a href="/us/245/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="245 U.S. 493" data-case-ids="3694584" data-case-paths="/us/245/0493-01">245 U. S. 493</a>, 510, it is said: “In construing federal statutes enacted under the power conferred by the commerce clause of the Constitution, the rule is that it should never be held that Congress intends to supersede or suspend the exercise of the reserved powers of a state, even where that may be done, unless, and except so far as its purpose to do so is clearly manifested [citing cases]. This' being true of an Act of Congress, it is obvious that an order of a subordinate agency, such as the commission, should not be given precedence over a state rate statute otherwise valid [a fortiori not over a state constitutional provision], unless, and except so far as, it conforms to a high standard of certainty.” That statement is quoted with approval in Wisconsin R. R. Commission v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R. R. Co. supra, at page 580, upon which appellants rely, and is adopted, but in somewhat different language, in American Express Co. v. South Dakota ex <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>rel.

First, because the restraining order tends to disrupt the uniformity of the class rates prescribed by the interstate commerce commission for this territory, and thereby unjustly and prejudicially burdens interstate class rate commerce.

Otherwise, the application of the first part of this same article and section, namely, “there shall be no discrimination,” forces a revision of tariffs under this injunction from Coatesville and Parksburg to Harrisburg, which <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>makes it absolutely unworkable and confiscatory to tbe railroad.
