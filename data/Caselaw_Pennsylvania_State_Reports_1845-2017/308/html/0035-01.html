The court below stated that, though none of the subjects designated by the governor “included an appropriation of money such as was made in the act of assembly before us,” as the entire proclamation stated one broad general subject, “unemployment relief,” any legislation germane to that subject might be considered. The governor, by his proclamation, indicated nineteen specific subjects of legislation, six of which related to unemployment relief. Unemployment is a broad and difficult subject and its relief more so. To be helpful as a designated subject for legislation at a special session, it would need some specification, in the absence of which almost every kind of legislation might be indulged in by the General Assembly, such as laAVS concerning taxation, appropriations, hours of labor, or, in general, the regulation of business affairs of individuals and corporations. Indeed, to construe the Constitution so as to permit this latitude would be subversive of its purpose, contrary to its letter and its spirit, and opposed to the principles outlined in the best considered authorities. Such construction Avould mean that the call would furnish no guide or chart for the leg<a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>islature, and would give no notice to the interested public.

The answer is obvious, unemployment, the subject the governor had been speaking about, and which was depriving one quarter of our workers of the opportunity to earn a living.

      <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>It is urged that the act does not give unemployment relief, but poor relief, and that, since the two are distinct, in this view the act is not within the call. What is meant when the governor’s call recommends a “commission......[to] cooperate with......poor districts in <em>affording relief to the unemployed” </em>and an act authorizing “poor districts to levy taxes and expend money for unemployment relief?” The governor’s call shows his intention to be that unemployment relief should be taken up as poor relief by poor districts, and that the State should aid them. The powers of poor districts under the laws are and always have been limited to furnishing, support, food, clothing, fuel, and shelter, to poor persons, persons without means of support, and to no others. Then the only possible way open to a poor district to furnish relief to the unemployed would be when the unemployed were poor persons within the law. The governor did not intend, nor did his call include an unlawful purpose or one prohibited by the <em>Constitution; </em>he did not intend to include the unemployed who had means of support, the unemployed who were not poor persons under the law. Such being the consequences of his deliberate acts he must have meant unemployment relief in the sense of poor relief, for that was the only relief the poor boards could give. When the governor used the term “unemployment relief” in connection with poor districts, he meant persons who were unemployed and without means of support, or poor persons, and the relief to be given was poor relief.</p>

The fact that the act included, in addition to the vast number of unemployed without means of support, or poor persons, a small number of poor persons who are such from other causes, should not <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>invalidate the act as being without the call, especially as the governor well knew, in suggesting that poor districts furnish unemployment relief, that such class must of necessity be included. The act does not introduce a new subject, as unemployment relief meant poor relief; such inclusion was not only within the legislative power but without it the act would have been seriously imperilled, as seen later in this opinion.

Turning again to section 4 of the supplemental proclamation, we find the legislature may make “new appropriations to......any department......of the state government......to enable additional projects [plans] to be undertaken which will give work to the unemployed.” Construe the word “work” as synonymous with the word “relief” in the light of the preamble and the subjects above mentioned in which unemployment relief was the dominant purpose, and it does not strain the imagination to say that “give work to the unemployed” may include provisions enabling the unemployed to secure work by taking care of their bodies. A man’s ability to work depends <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>upon his physical condition. A starved man is not able to work, and the first step to bring him into condition to work is to feed him. The word “work” may well be used in the sense of relief, and is so used; and since the word “unemployed” applies to those who have no sustenance on which to live, this subject would cover the act. The tenor of the call being unemployment relief, which is poor relief, this thought naturally follows.</p>

Instead of permitting that department to be the spending agency, as the legislature may well have done, it designated other governmental agencies which, under that department, spend the money. This is merely another detail of accomplishment of the designated purpose, and is purely a legislative matter, embracing the manner, method, or means by which the money may reach its ultimate destination and accomplish the purpose designated in the call. The act must be construed, if at all possible, as an efficient, workable system, and we so find it.

At the special session, prior to the Talbot bill, $716,000 was appropriated; with it the appropriations of that session totaled $10,716,000. Defendants contend that, since the appropriation made by this bill, with pri- or appropriations already made, exceeded the estimated revenues for the biennium, the excess appropriations were invalid.</p>

This conclusion is erroneous. Under article IX, section 4, the creation of a debt without the direct sanction of the people is not only limited, but absolutely prohibited, except to repel invasions, suppress insurrection, defend the State in war, supply deficiencies in revenue up to $1,000,000. Under the Constitution, neither the legislature, the officers or agents of the State, nor all combined, can create a debt or incur an obligation for or on behalf of the State, except to the amount and in the manner provided for in the fundamental law. This section was intended to restrict legislative acts which incurred obligations or permitted engagements on the credit of the State beyond revenue in hand or an<a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>tieipated through a biennium, and establishes the principle that we must keep within current revenue and $1,000,000. There can be no such thing as a floating debt created through appropriations in excess of revenues and $1,000,000. Such debt may not be directly incurred by statute, nor through an appropriation in excess of current revenue for a gratuity or any purpose. The determination of the question whether Act 7-E creates a debt necessitates a study of the Constitution as it relates to revenues and appropriations.</p>

Unless expressly prohibited or otherwise directed by that instrument, appropriations may be made for whatever purposes and in whatever amounts the law-making body finds desirable.

A survey of the Constitution would indicate that the ordinary current expenses of government would be the expenses of the executive, judicial and legislative departments of <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>government, and of public schools. It was the intention of the framers of the fundamental law to safeguard and protect these ordinary expenses, that the government might exist as such. Therefore, they have a preference or prior claim on all moneys of the Commonwealth over all other expenditures, expenses, debts, or appropriations. We have so held with regard to such expenses of municipalities. “Current expenses have first claim on ordinary revenues and contemplate operating expenses”: Georges Twp. v. Union Trust Co., <a href="/pa/293/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="293 Pa. 364" data-case-ids="1111164" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0364-01">293 Pa. 364</a>, 370.

If other appropriations are compelled to suffer because of this preference, the complete answer is that it is the legislative will, and, as the sovereign people have thus spoken through their designated agent, no one can complain. If appropriations for other charities and hospitals, equally meritorious and perhaps some more deserving, are made to suffer because of insufficient revenue, the fault lies with the legislature in not providing means when it had the opportunity.

This can be made only from revenue accruing during the biennium, and any other available cash assets on hand that may be used for that purpose. From this sum all appropriations, whether made at a general or special session, must be met. An appropriation does not speak from the date of approval of the measures, but from a consideration of that appropriation and other appropriations during the same biennium, and the estimated revenue; and, if there is a shortage of revenue beyond $1,000,000, it is not a given appropriation, the last one made, that is singled out for rejection by the fiscal officers, but all must suffer alike and abate proportionately.

We again hold that the support of the poor, — meaning such persons as have been understood as coming within that class ever since the organization of the government, persons who are without means of support, the same persons stated in the Talbot bill, Act 7-E, — is and has always been a direct charge on the body politic for its own preservation and protection; and that, as such, in the <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>light of an expense, it stands exactly in the same position as the preservation of law and order.

From this cause the ranks of the poor have increased so rapidly as to stagger the people of our State. The fact that their numbers are swollen through unemployment does not change the established concept of poor persons. To hold that the State may not under the Constitution now aid such people, even though it be a governmental duty, would be to deny to the State the right to perform not only an important, but, at this time, a most pressing governmental function. To hold that the State cannot or must not aid its poor would strip the State of a means of self preservation, and might conceive untold hardships and difficulties for the future. It is no answer to say that the people generally should take care of the situation; whether they are or are not able to do so, does not relieve the State of its duty. The framers of the Constitution never intended that the instrument should deprive the legislature of this power. We have so held in Collins v.

The poor authorities cannot furnish relief in any form to such persons. When work is offered such unemployed, they have the means of support, and neither the State nor the poor district would be permitted thereafter to keep, maintain, or support such persons in idleness or laziness, or further some other object equally as vicious. This would be true even if the families of such persons suffer because the one responsible for their maintenance refuses to work. It is the duty of every citizen, particularly public officials, to aid those entrusted with furnishing this relief, to see that it is not given to those not entitled to receive it. If the poor officers violate their duty by furnishing support to such unemployed persons, the State authorities may, through any agency, stop payments for such uses. The purpose of the State’s relief is to furnish maintenance to poor persons, including those who, through enforced unemployment, have no means of support, and not to those who have such means.</p>

As long as these channels are kept clear, constitutional inhibitions will not disturb such acts.</p>

It embraces all persons within the historical definition of the term. There is no discrimination. When the legislature directed the money to be given to the department of welfare, with certain duties to perform, and then in turn selected the poor districts as governmental agencies to secure proper distribution, the State has within its hands the right and power to compel its proper administration. The act has not raised subordinate municipal bodies over their creators. Moreover, the State frequently selects county officials as agents to perform governmental duties. The officers of the poor districts in counties were selected as the most efficient means of administering the fund, and the territorial lines of the counties, which ordinarily limit the jurisdiction of such officers, limit their administrative powers as state agents over the fund. But people who receive it in one county are the same type of people as those who receive it all over the State; that is, poor people without means of support. Therefore, the administrative officers, the poor directors of the county, in administering this fund, are not communities within the letter or spirit of the Constitution, and as the persons affected are poor persons, in every town, city, and hamlet in the Commonwealth, they are not within the constitutional limitation.</p>

Mandamus is a powerful remedy and the attorney general may compel a reimbursement to the state treasurer of moneys not properly spent and may force the officers of the poor districts to spend it in the way the sovereign dictates, — that is, for food, etc., in relief of poor persons. The State does not lose control over the money; if there should be any abuse of the powers granted, most likely an enraged public will compel obedience through the courts.

If the excess appropriation had been a debt, it was clearly within the constitutional power of the legislature to provide sufficient revenues, and, having failed to do that, it could not seize on the police power provision to sustain its unlawful act.

We doubt if this question will ever arise. As to the expenditure of any of these funds for persons other than those who are poor because of enforced unemployment, there is this to be said to the credit of our communities: At no time except possibly once or twice since the organization of the State have these districts ever been in a situation to require state aid. They have always been able to take care of the poor because their numbers were so very small, in proportion to the people in the county. Today this number has.been vastly increased by enforced unemployment compared with those who were poor in normal times. As a practical matter the state support will not reach any of those who were poor before the increase in their numbers; but the county’s money will be used to take care of these persons, and to relieve the increased number of poor through unemployment. We have discussed this matter at this point as it is specially dealt with by the attorney general, but it might well be read with the discussion of the same matter in connection with the call.

It is conceded that in the governor’s proclamation convening the legislature in special session he designated “unemployment relief” as the subject upon which legislation was invited. In response to this call, the legislature after setting forth in a preamble that “present conditions of unemployment aggravate the normal situation facing public authorities charged with the care of the poor” appropri<a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>ated' $10,000,000 to the department of welfare for payment to political subdivisions charged by law with the care of the poor. I cannot view this legislation as so transcending the subject of the governor’s call as to make it unconstitutional. Cooley in the 8th edition of his Constitutional Limitations, volume 1, page 325, says of the constitutional requirement that the legislature shall consider no subject except that for which they were especially called together or which may have been submitted to them by special message of the governor that it “limits the power of the legislature to the enactment of such laws as <em>relate to the object </em>stated in the governor’s proclamation or message.”</p>

If Pennsylvania had been devastated by earthquake or famine and the governor had called the legislature into special session for the purpose of considering the subject of “earthquake relief” or “famine relief” everyone would understand that he contemplated legislation extending pecuniary relief to those who had been impoverished by these destructive agencies. In the celebrated case of McCulloch v. Maryland, <em>é </em>Wheaton 316, the United States Supreme Court in an opinion by Chief Justice Marshall decided that though the Constitution itself did not specifically authorize congress to establish a bank, its power to do so was incidental to the express power “to lay and collect taxes, to borrow money, to regulate commerce, to declare and conduct a war and to raise and support armies and navies — that a government entrusted with such ample powers must also be entrusted with ample powers for their execution,” and in that opinion Chief Justice Marshall laid down this <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>canon of constitutional construction: “We think the sound construction of the Constitution must allow to the national legislature that discretion, with respect to the means by which the powers it confers are to be carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform the high duties assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people. Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.”</p>
    <p id="b109-4" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[174,941,1154,851]]]'>This same canon of construction applies to a governor’s proclamation calling a legislature into special session. Here the legislature was called to consider the subject of unemployment relief, i. e., relief for those suffering from involuntary unemployment. Clearly it was not intended by the governor that the legislature should enact a law to relieve the unemployed rich. The unemployed poor was the subject to which the governor directed the legislature to direct its attention. The legislature responded by enacting a bill directed to the pecuniary relief of the poor of Pennsylvania. Surely this bill came “within the scope” of the governor’s call, it was “appropriate” so far as it provided relief for those impoverished by unemployment and it was “consistent with the letter and spirit” of the governor’s call.</p>
    <p id="b109-5" data-blocks='[["BL_109.5",109,[176,1813,1151,312]]]'>But it is argued that the act under review extends relief not only to those who are poor because they can obtain no employment but to those who are poor because of laziness, old age, sickness or inability or unwillingness to work, that the act is a poor relief act as distinguished from an unemployment relief act.</p>
    <p id="b109-6" data-blocks='[["BL_109.6",109,[176,2138,1151,261]],["BL_110.1",110,[262,328,1152,1454]]]'>My answer to that argument is that while “poor relief” and “unemployment relief” may be technically different, as “secession” and “rebellion” were technically different, as Abraham Lincoln pointed out in his message of July <em>á, </em>1861, calling congress into special ses<a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>sion, yet under present conditions, unemployment relief and poor relief are practically the same thing as secession and rebellion were practically the same thing, as Lincoln held them to be in 1861. When poverty affects no greater number of people than it affects in normal times, the local poor districts and other subdivisions of government are able to take care of it, as they have done almost immemorially. When the present widespread poverty arising from unemployment affects such large numbers of people that local subdivisions are overwhelmed in attempting to cope with it, the sovereign Commonwealth has to come to the assistance of the local subdivisions as it did in the act now challenged. While it is theoretically correct to say that all the poverty now prevailing in Pennsylvania is not due to unemployment, it is obvious that such a large major share of it is due to that cause as to make the remainder of it a factor of negligible consequence in considering the question before us. As a matter of fact, the phrase “unemployment relief” is much more comprehensive than the phrase “poor relief,” for while there are many unemployed who are not poor there are practically no poor except those who are unemployed. When a person is “employed” in the usual sense it is a reasonable inference that he is self-supporting. Therefore the legislature in enacting a poor relief bill did not go outside the scope of the governor’s call but kept within it.</p>

While it may be true that some of the dollars appropriated by the Talbot Act will go to those who would be poor even if times were normal, it is equally true that vast sums of money have already been spent and will continue to be spent by poor districts to ameliorate the poverty which arises solely from unemployment. So these subdivisions are doing more than ameliorating nor<a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>mal poverty — they are attempting to ameliorate poverty which is not merely a local affliction but a menace to the entire body-politic. Under these circumstances the fact that some of the money expended by the Commonwealth may happen to ameliorate a little poverty not arising from involuntary unemployment is in my judgment no sufficient ground for declaring unconstitutional a poor relief bill which resulted from the governor’s call for a special session to consider unemployment relief. One rule of construction is that an act must be construed in the light of the evil it was designed to remedy. “Statutes are to be read in the light of attendant conditions”: 25 R. C. L., page 959, section 215. It is also an accepted principle of construction that “when the constitutionality of a statute is questioned it is the duty of the courts to adopt such construction as will make the statute constitutional if its language will permit”: 25 R. C. L., page 1000, section 243. In the case of McCulloch v. Maryland already cited, Chief Justice Makshall said: “Such is the character of human language that no word conveys to the mind in all situations, one single definite idea. Almost all compositions contain words which taken in their rigorous sense would convey a meaning different from that which is obviously intended. It is essential to just construction that many words which import something excessive should be understood in a more mitigated sense — in that sense which common usage justified.” I interpret “unemployment relief” as used by the governor in his call to mean relief for those who are involuntarily unemployed for a long period and therefore impoverished. I think that the legislature in appropriating $10,000,000 to help the poor districts and other governmental subdivisions to bear the unprecedentedly heavy burden placed upon them by the widespread unemployment now prevailing acted upon the subject of “unemployment relief.” I would not declare the act now before us unconstitutional because of a mere lexigraphic distinction between two words as closely re<a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>lated under present conditions as the words “unemployed” and “poor” now are in the public mind.

The subjects “designated in the proclamation of the governor,” cannot be broadened or narrowed by the legislature or the courts, in order to either approve or disapprove of a given statute. If they could, then the constitutional provision would not be mandatory, nor would its words “be construed in their popular and general sense, as the people who voted for it would understand them.” For instance, if the governor designated the subject of “taxation” as one of those to be considered, then any and every branch of that subject — taxation upon capital stock, taxation upon inheritances, taxation upon moneys at interest, etc., etc., — could be made the subject of legislation at the “special session;” and proof or even an admission of the fact that what moved him to make the call was only his belief that capital stock was not adequately taxed, would not result in the conclusion that no legislation was permissible except upon that particular subject. On the other hand, if the subject of the tax on capital stock was the only one designated in the procla<a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>mation, none of the other branches of the general subject of taxation could constitutionally be passed upon by the legislature at that session. Up to this point also the whole court agrees.</p>

Since no power is given the legislature to enlarge the subject designated in the proclamation, an improper limitation could only result in there being no subject constitutionally “designated,” and hence there could be no constitutional legislation relating to the subject either as designated or attempted to be enlarged. This is made clear in Denver v. Moss, 50 Colorado 282, 286. In that state, where the constitutional provision is substantially the same as ours, the governor called a special session, and designated as one of the subjects of legislation: “To enact any and all legislation relating to, or in any wise affecting corporations, both foreign and domestic, of a quasi public nature.” Under it, the legislature passed an act requiring railroads to fence their right-of-way. It was held to be unconstitutional. The court said that, by the matter above quoted, the governor “specifically pointed out the persons, the class, the interests to be affected, but not the special business or subject-matter of legislation. He left the legislature to determine this for itself, when, by a direct and positive constitutional provision, that particular function was and is for him to discharge, and for him alone...... No subject of special legislation having been named, under this provision of the proclamation, no legislation whatever was competent...... If it be competent for the governor, after the general manner attempted, to authorize the General Assembly to select for itself the subject-matter of legislation and enact laws accordingly, then it is equally permissible for him, in his proclamation, to say that the General Assembly is called in special session ‘To enact any and all legislation relating to <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>or in <em>any </em>wise affecting <em>the </em>qualified voters of the State, or the taxpayers of the State, or the citizens of the State/ and thus the door is opened wide for general legislation at a special session......[By this means] the constitutional provision [would be] utterly disregarded, and its main and most wholesome and salutary purpose, that of confining legislation to the specific subject-matter concerning which an emergency is believed to exist, completely nullified.” The United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reached the same conclusion: Nielsen v. C., B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., <a href="/f/187/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="156" data-cite="187 F. 393" data-case-ids="33198" data-case-paths="/f/187/0393-01">187 Fed. 393</a>.</p>

Neither the constitutional provision, nor our construction of it, lends the slightest aid to the imaginary power suggested. The legislature may pass as many bills as it pleases, and of as diverse a character, provided only their subject-matter is “designated in the proclamation,” and, if it does not like those that are designated, it may refuse to pass any bills. True, this is a limitation on the action of the legislature during the special session; but that is exactly what the Constitution says it shall be. Moreover, as pointed out by both the majority and the minority in Perkins v. Phila., <a href="/pa/156/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="157" data-cite="156 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="844956" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0554-01">156 Pa. 554</a>, 565, 569, the constitutional convention of 1873 was called for the express purpose of limiting the power of the legislature, and even a perfunctory study of the Constitution will show that its provisions, in large part, resulted from that purpose. Those who will take the trouble to read that instrument, especially article III, and will note the flood of legislation in the sessions from 1850 to 1873, probably will not conclude that such legislative limitation is seriously objectionable; but, at any rate, the courts must interpret the <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>Constitution, not emasculate it, whatever may be the effect on legislative power.

    <p id="b117-4" data-blocks='[["BL_117.4",117,[177,560,1152,1405]]]'>Bearing steadily in mind the principles to which we have adverted, let us see whether the statute is one for “unemployment relief.” The preamble recites that “Present conditions of unemployment aggravate the normal situation facing public authorities charged with the care of the <em>poor.” </em>Section 1 appropriates $10,000,000 “To the department of welfare for payment to political subdivisions charged by law with the care of the <em>poor.” </em>Section 2 directs that department to divide that sum “among the several counties of this Commonwealth on a ratio that the estimated number of unemployed persons in a county bears to the estimated total number of unemployed persons in the entire Commonwealth.” Section 3 specifies the political subdivisions in the several counties to which the allotted money should be payable. Section 4 authorizes each such “political subdivision to expend the moneys received from the appropriation made by this act for the purpose of providing food, clothing, fuel and shelter for residents within their districts who are <em>without means of support.” </em>Section 5 directs that the funds received “shall be audited by the auditors of the respective political subdivisions in the same manner and with like effect as other moneys expended by such subdivisions.” The sixth and final section provides that the “act shall be in force immediately upon its passage.”</p>
    <p id="b117-5" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[177,1977,1153,423]],["BL_118.1",118,[291,354,1153,2055]],["BL_119.1",119,[164,309,1154,1186]]]'>It will be noticed that in the expenditure of the fund appropriated by the act, there is not even an attempt to draw a distinction between those who are poor because they can obtain no employment, and those who are poor because of laziness, old age, sickness or inability or unwillingness to work from any other cause. The statute is, therefore, so far as expenditures under it are concerned, a poor relief act, as distinguished from an un<a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>employment relief act. Whoever is “without means of support” may get the relief, and the funds expended are to be audited, not by the State, but “by the auditors of the respective political subdivisions in the same manner and with like effect as other money expended by such subdivisions.” It is not, therefore, an “unemployment relief” act, but a poor relief statute. At this point comes the vital disagreement with the majority of the court. It says: “The fact that the act may include in addition to the vast numbers of unemployed without means of support,.or poor persons, a small number of poor persons who are such from other causes, should not invalidate the act as being without the call, especially as the governor well knew, in suggesting that poor districts furnish unemployment relief, that such class must of necessity be included.” This is an express admission that, by the statute, the legislature attempted to enlarge the subject-matter of the call which, as we have shown, necessarily resulted in unconstitutionality. That it did so attempt is clearly set forth by section <em>i </em>of the act which authorizes the poor districts “to expend the moneys received from the appropriation made by this act for the purpose of providing food, clothing, fuel and shelter within their districts who are without means of support,” without limiting the class to those who reached that condition by reason of unemployment, which is the only thing covered by the governor’s call. If it were true, as stated in the above quotation from the opinion, that there are only “a small number of poor persons who are, such from other causes” than unemployment, it would not aid the majority opinion, since there are no degrees of unconstitutionality, — if an act is unconstitutional it is forbidden, no matter how small or how great the unconstitutionality. Unhappily, however, the fact, so far as my experience goes, is not as stated, such other “poor persons” are far from being “a small number,” and that number, small or great, may, in some or all of the poor districts, get the bulk of the fund appropriated <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>by the act. Nor is it accurate to say that “the governor well knew, in suggesting that poor districts furnish unemployment relief that such class must of necessity be included.” He did not so suggest. The limit that he went was in clause 1 that the state commission on unemployment relief cooperate with poor districts in affording relief to the unemployed, and approve or disapprove plans for unemployment relief; in clause 2 that poor districts be authorized “to negotiate emergency loans for unemployment relief;” in clause 3 that a constitutional amendment be passed authorizing the state officers to pay back one-half of the amount borrowed for that purpose ; and in clause 5 authorizing poor districts to levy taxes for unemployment relief. This being so, it is not accurate to say, as the majority do, that the governor’s “deliberate acts [show] he must have meant unemployment relief in the sense of poor relief, as it was the only relief the poor boards could give.” All these subsidiary matters are of little moment, however; the point is the majority opinion establishes that the statute is unconstitutional, but by a pure petitio principii attempts to carry its point at the expense of the Constitution.</p>

Certainly the common people who adopted the Constitution would say that that section forbade either direct or indirect appropriations for charitable or benevolent purposes to any person or community, and so it has always been construed. The fact that, in the first instance, the appropriation is made to the department of welfare, is a matter of no moment; that body is but a conduit, for allotment purposes, to convey it to the poor districts of the State, who, in turn, distribute it among the poor, irrespective of the cause of their poverty.</p>

Snyder, at pages 451, 452: “Appellant further argues that the phrase To any per<a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>son or community’ has a restricted meaning, and it is on these words the Commonwealth chiefly relies to sustain the act. In effect, appellant would have ‘person’ used in an individual rather than a collective sense, — certainly not broad enough to include the government acting in an administrative capacity, functioning through an agency, to work out governmental policies. Appellant argues that direct appropriations, in terms, are not prohibited to such agency, therefore the act is valid, even though the ultimate object may be to give to persons prohibited from receiving the money thus appropriated. This contention is not sound; ‘person’ and ‘community’ are not limited to the idea of a single person or place where persons are located; they are used in an inclusive sense, relating to an individual or a group or class of persons, wherever situated, in any part or all of the Commonwealth. It applies to persons, kind, class and place, without qualification. The language of the Constitution is an absolute and general prohibition. Nor does the fact that the appropriation is made to an agency (the intermediate and practical step by which public money is distributed to citizens) aid appellant’s case. The gift is not to the commission, but to the particular persons selected by the legislature to receive it. The commission cannot use the money; it merely passes it on to the selected class. It is none the less a gift directly to the individual, even though it pauses for a moment on its way thither in the hands of the agency. Nor can the act be sustained because the appropriation is to an agency as an arm of the government, working out a governmental policy. What the Constitution prohibits is the establishment of any such policy which causes an appropriation of state moneys for benevolent purposes to a particular class of its citizens, whether under the guise of an agency, as an arm of the government through which a system is created, or directly to the individual. As said by the court below, this proposition ‘is tantamount to saying the legislature can pass a law to do the <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>thing indirectly which the Constitution prohibits it from doing directly.’ If this can be done, the Constitution imposes no restraint on the expenditure of money. But our present Chief Justice, in Collins v. State Treasurer, <a href="/pa/271/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="167" data-cite="271 Pa. 428" data-case-ids="295654" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0428-01">supra, 436, 439, 440</a>, answered this when he said, ‘But that which cannot be done directly the law will not permit to be accomplished by indirection, for such a course, when tolerated by the courts, only serves to bring the law into contempt...... The pruning knife of the law eliminates all such devices, and lays bare the realities of the situation, with which we must deal...... The state’s money cannot be permitted to go through the agency of the hospital association......since it falls within the class to which that character of recognition is forbidden by the Constitution.’ ” As already stated, the majority opinion here reasserts the conclusions overruled in that paragraph.</p>
