Tbe validity of a charitable bequest falls within this class, and is a matter properly determinable upon the distribution of the estate. This was decided in Carson’s Est., <a href="/pa/241/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="241 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="976092" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0117-01">241 Pa. 117</a>, where it was held that probate was not the proper time for an attack on a gift to charity, the court there saying: “though a religious or charitable bequest or devise forming part of a will may be void by reason of the failure of the testator to execute it in the manner required by the statute, the whole will must be admitted to probate upon proof of its execution, leaving all questions concerning the validity of the religious or charitable bequest to be determined on distribution of the estate.” In Slater’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=263%20Pa.%2088" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="263 Pa. 88">263 Pa. 88</a>, it is stated “our authorities are all in accord that the proper time for the determination of the question whether the testamentary charitable bequest is void is when the question of distribution of the estate arises.” See Gageby’s Est., <a href="/pa/293/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="293 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1111110" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0109-01">293 Pa. 109</a>.

This established, prima facie at least, the validity of the legacy; and certainly, in the absence of proof that the alteration was made after the last codicil, the legacy should have been admitted.” But the question now before us, the validity of a residuary bequest to charity, was not there involved, all the gifts in that case being to individuals. It may be that in Pennsylvania a will not involving charities may be altered as the testator wishes without disturbing its validity, provided it remain a will under the statute, but when it comes to charitable bequests the law must be fully observed, any alteration in the will which grants or enlarges a preexisting grant in the same will to a charity must be validated as the statute directs: Lightner’s App., <a href="/pa-super/57/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="57 Pa. Super. 469" data-case-ids="444681" data-case-paths="/pa-super/57/0469-01">57 Pa. Superior Ct. 469</a>.</p>

The presumption is that any alteration, interlineation, or change was made prior to the execution of the codicil or the final act necessary to make such will effective. See Linnard’s App., supra; Morrow’s Est., <a href="/pa/204/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="204 Pa. 479" data-case-ids="927494" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0479-01">204 Pa. 479</a>; Gongaware v.

This is but a presumption of fact, and it will give way when evidence to the contrary appears. Appellant endeavored to show that the alterations were in fact made after the codicil. We agree with the court below that he was successful as to only one alteration which we will now discuss.</p>
    <p id="b259-5" data-blocks='[["BL_259.4",259,[196,1223,1153,1128]]]'>What was the effect of the one change shown to have been made after the execution of the codicil? Originally the will contained a bequest to one Lizzie Parker, a housekeeper. She predeceased the testator and her legacy therefore lapsed, falling into the residue of the estate. When testator subsequently erased Lizzie Parker’s name and inserted another, it was not an obliteration but a substitution, and could have no legal effect on the due execution of the will as it related to the charitable bequest in question; the only one who could complain of that act would have been the charity, the residuary legatee. When the Lizzie Parker legacy was annulled it was by death and not by any act of the testator; when he later substituted the name of his then housekeeper for that of Lizzie Parker he took from rather than added to the residuary estate which was to go to charity, and the validity of the charitable bequest could not in any way be disturbed by this circumstance. It was complete in law, both before and after the alteration, and did not need further validation under the statute relating to charitable bequests.</p>
