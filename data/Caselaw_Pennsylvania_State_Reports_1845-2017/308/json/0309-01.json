    "head_matter": "Bailey v. Waters, Auditor General, et al., Appellants.\nArgued May 26, 1932.\nBefore Frazer, C. J., Simpson, Kephart, Schaffer, Maxey, Drew and Linn, JJ.\nHarris C. Arnold, Deputy Attorney General, with him Wm. A. Schnader, Attorney General, for appellant.\nThe change of salary is a necessary result of constitutional mandate.\nThe reassignment of judicial districts was required.\nThe salary readjustment was necessary: Com. v. Mathues, 210 Pa. 372.\nNothing in the Constitution forbids a downward change of plaintiff\u2019s salary under the present circumstances.\nThe power of the legislature to reduce judicial salaries is not here involved.\n' Our cases agree that there may be implied as well as express limitations on the legislature, in a constitution. But such an implication must be very clear in order to overcome the general legislative power of state legislatures: Lewis & Nelson\u2019s App., 67 Pa. 153, 165; Page v. Allen, 58 Pa. 338; Sharpless v. Mayor of Philadelphia, 21 Pa. 147.\nGeo. Ross Hull, of Snyder, Miller, Hull & Hull, for appellee.\nThe legislature has no power under the Constitution to diminish the salary of a judge learned in the law during his continuance in office: Lewis and Nelson\u2019s App., 67 Pa. 153; Sharpless v. Mayor, 21 Pa. 147; Page v. Allen, 58 Pa. 338.\nThe legislature cannot reduce the salaries of judges while in office: Com. v. Mann, 5 W. & S. 403; Com. v. Mathues, 210 Pa. 372.\nIf the legislature has no Constitutional power specifically and directly to diminish the salary of a judge learned in the law, during his continuance in office, it can not do so by the indirect method of reapportioning judicial districts and applying thereto a salary schedule based on population: Com. v. Comrey, 149 Pa. 216; Com. v. Woodring, 274 Pa. 553.\nJune 30, 1932 :"
