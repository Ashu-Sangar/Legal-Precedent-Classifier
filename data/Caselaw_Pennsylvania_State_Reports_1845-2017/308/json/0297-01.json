Bosler, deceased, Hannah Elizabeth Bosler, executrix of the latter estate and the present owner of real estate formerly belonging to her decedent, being joined as individual defendant.\nThe record shows that both parties experienced difficulty in presenting their claims and answers with conciseness, brevity and accuracy, and that the court below displayed great patience with their failure to do so, refusing, since both were at fault, to allow advantages to one over the other because of technical defects. We will not discuss the facts presented in the confused record. Obviously, the case is not \u201cclear and free from doubt\u201d and the court below correctly refused to give judgment on the pleadings: Colonial Securities Co. v. Levy, 302 Pa. 329.\nThe appeal is dismissed.",
