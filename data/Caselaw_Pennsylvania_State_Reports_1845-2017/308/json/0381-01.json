        "text": "Per Curiam,\nDefendant appeals from the refusal of a new trial in an action for damages for land taken in connection with the relocation of a state highway in Salisbury Township, Lancaster County.\nThe jury returned a verdict in writing as follows: \u201cAnd now, to wit, November 24, 1931, we, the jurors empaneled in the above case, find in favor of Levi K. Mast $2,300.00 twenty-three hundred dollars and against with interest from July 22, 1929, $323.72,\u201d using a printed form sent out with them by the court. The trial judge, who had in his charge instructed that, if a verdict was found for plaintiff, damages for detention of the money due should be added, upon return of this verdict again instructed the jury, in the presence of counsel for both sides, that the verdict was not in proper form, \u201cthat they should not find an amount of money with interest, but should find the amount due the plaintiff together with a certain amount for the detention of the said sum from the time it was due,\u201d and he inquired whether they wished to retire to the jury room or could find a correct verdict from their seats. They informed the court that they had agreed upon $2,623.72 as the amount of damages due from defendant to plaintiff. The court thereupon recorded the verdict as follows: \u201cAnd now Nov. 23,1931, a jury being called......who being duly sworn or affirmed according to law, do say upon their said oaths or affirmations respectively that they find in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $2,623.72,\u201d and this is the verdict that appears upon the record before us.\nThe verdict, as orally amended, was none the less valid (Rottmund v. Penna. R. R. Co., 225 Pa. 410, 416); nor can we see any point in appellant\u2019s intimation that there was error in lumping the items of damage (see discussion on this subject in Lackawanna T. & S. Co. v. Lackawanna & W. V. R. R., 299 Pa. 503, 506 et seq.). Moreover, if the amendment had not been made by the jury, the error in the written verdict in referring to the amount due for delay in payment of damages as \u201cinterest\u201d was a technical defect which the court, under the Act of March 14, 1872, P. L. 25, 12 P. S. 536, could have remedied: Thompson v. Emerald Oil Co., 279 Pa. 321, 326; Parks v. Bishop, 296 Pa. 91. This however was unnecessary when the jury itself did so.\nThe refusal of a new trial under the circumstances was proper.\nJudgment is affirmed.",
