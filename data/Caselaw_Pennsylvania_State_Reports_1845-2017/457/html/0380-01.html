In that case, we held that Avhere the defense was alibi, Avhich traditionally had been classified as an affirmative defense in Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth must yet prove beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant’s presence at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed. The Court reasoned as folloAvs: “It is because of [the] never-shifting burden upon the Commonwealth to prove every essential element of the charge it malms against the defendant that it cannot logically be said that the Commonwealth has the burden to prove the presence of such element while the defendant, at the same time, <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>has the burden of proving its absenee. Hence, whenever the prosecution relies upon proof that the defendant is present at the commission of the crime, it cannot be said with any show of reason that the defendant, who asserts he was absent, has any burden of proving it. . . . The Commonwealth has the burden of proving every essential element necessary for conviction. If the defendant traverses one of those essential elements by evidence of alibi, his evidence will be considered by the jury along with all the other evidence. It may, either standing alone or together with other evidence, be sufficient to leave in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt which, without it, might not otherwise exist.” Id. at 230-1, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20A.2d%20441" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="151 A.2d 441">151 A.2d at 445-6</a>.</p>

As noted by one respected text writer: “As to all these claims for exoneration [self-defense, duress, insanity, intoxication], their truth goes in final analysis to the guilt, to the rightness of punishing, the accused. Thus it seems inconsistent to demand as to some elements of guilt, such as an act of killing, that the jury be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, and as to others, such as duress or capacity to know right from wrong, the jury may convict though they have such doubt. Accordingly, the recent trend is to treat these so-called matters of defense as situations wherein the accused will usually have the first burden of producing evidence in order that the issue be raised and submitted to the jury, but at the close of the evidence the jury must be told that if they have a reasonable doubt of the element thus raised they must acquit.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code (Prop. Official Draft, 1962) takes a similar stance. See Sections 1.12 (1), 1.13 (9) (c). The drafters of the Code, in their commentary to Section 1.12,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> state that they do not favor a shifting of the burden of proof to the defendant for affirmative defenses “in the absence of <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>the most exceptional circumstances”. Such a course, it is said, “involves too serious an inroad on the principle that guilt should be established beyond a reasonable doubt as to be seriously entertained”. See also J. Wigmore, Evidence §2514 (3d. ed. 1940).</p>
    <p id="b419-3" data-blocks='[["BL_419.4",419,[186,595,1155,1357]]]'>Our conclusion on the issues presented by this appeal is in accord with the trend indicated by the above authorities, and may be formulated as follows: In any criminal prosecution, the Commonwealth has an unshifting burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all elements of the crime. One of such elements in first degree murder is, of course, a specific intent to kill. This burden is neither increased nor diminished by an attempt by a defendant to disprove the element of intent by a showing of lack of capacity, due to intoxication, to form such an intent. Whether the Commonwealth will, in a particular case, elect to carry that burden without introducing evidence to negate the existence of a disabling condition of intoxication, or whether it will seek to introduce such evidence, will be for it to decide; as in every case, the risk of non-persuasion remains with the Commonwealth. Whatever the district attorney’s decision may be in that regard, it is error for the trial judge to instruct the jury that there is a burden upon the defendant to establish his intoxication by a preponderance of the evidence. Such evidence is offered by the defense solely to cast doubt upon the existence of the specific intent to kill and, as with all elements of the crime, the defendant has no burden of persuasion.</p>

Such evidence may be adduced by the defendant as part of his case, or, conceivably, may be found in the Commonwealth’s own case in chief or be elicited through cross-examination.

If this defendant was drunk to the extent that he could not form a willful, deliberate and premeditated design to kill, or if he was incapable of judging his acts or their consequences, you would not be warranted in finding him guilty of murder in the first degree.

The most astute juror would find such an instruction incomprehensible. The confusion was compounded by the Court’s alleged clarification of the subject in <em>Commonwealth v. Winebrenner, </em><a href="/pa/439/0073-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="439 Pa. 73" data-case-ids="1930962" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0073-01">439 Pa. 73</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=265%20A.2d%20108" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="265 A.2d 108">265 A.2d 108</a> (1970). In <em>Winebrenner, </em>the Court created a classification of “true” affirmative defenses which it was argued were in the nature of confession and avoidance. Thus it was reasoned that, since the accused admitted the crime charged, the burden could properly be placed upon him to establish the justification or excuse. Without commenting upon the merits of such a formulation in general, it should have been immediately apparent that such a rationale was hopelessly inappropriate where the challenge was intoxication.</p>
