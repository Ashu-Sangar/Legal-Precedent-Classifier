This point was aptly stated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Engel v.

The Establishment Clause, unlike the Free Exercise Clause, does not depend upon any showing of direct governmental compulsion and is violated by the enactment of laws which establish an official religion whether those laws operate directly to coerce nonobserving individuals or not.” In determining whether governmental activity, including school board resolutions, runs afoul of the establishment clause, the pertinent inquiry <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>is into the purpose and primary effect of the resolution. If either the purpose or primary effect is the advancement or prohibition of religion, then the resolution or enactment exceeds the scope of legislative power as circumscribed by the first amendment. In other words, in order to withstand the strictures of the establishment clause there must be a secular legislative purpose <em>and </em>a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion. <em>McGowan v.

The United States Supreme Court has never been faced with a case in the factual posture of that now before this Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> However, in dictum, that Court has indicated that every technical infringement upon the first amendment need not be enjoined. Otherwise, in the words of Mr. Justice Douglas: “Prayers in our legislative halls; the appeals to the Almighty in the messages of the Chief Executive; the proclamations making Thanksgiving Day a holiday; ‘so help me Cod’ in our courtroom oaths— these and all other references to the Almighty that run through our laws, our public rituals, our ceremonies would be flouting the First Amendment.

Provisions identical to the above section were contained in the Constitutions of 1790 and 1838 and a similar provision was contained in the Constitution of 1776. On the authority of this provision, this Court has prohibited the use of a public schoolroom for Catholic religious instruction after hours, <em>Hysong v.

The protection of rights and freedoms secured by this section of our Constitution, however, does not transcend the protection of the first amendment of the United States Constitution.

An invocation is an invocatory prayer or plea, addressed to a divine being, or, more specifically, “a prayer, often a prescribed prayer, offered at the beginning of a service, a part of such, or a sermon”. Webster’s New International Dictionary, 2d Ed. (1942). Another dictionary states that an invocation is “a form of prayer invoking God’s presence, said especially at the beginning of a public ceremony”. Random House Dictionary of the English Language (1966). A benediction also is another word for prayer, specifically, “The short prayer or blessing, pronounced by a minister or priest, with which public worship is closed”. Webster, <em>supra. </em>While it is true that the precise words to be used could not be known at the time this litigation was commenced, it cannot be assumed that they would be other than religious in nature, especially since a clergyman would deliver them. As Dr. Buttrick has concisely put it, “prayer is the heart of religion”;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> in the words of William James, it is “the very soul and essence of religion”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> It is the act of prayer, not the words themselves, that is the basis of the present complaint.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a> The problem, therefore, is to determine whether these prayers, mandated by the School District to be said at an important school function conducted on <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>school property, are in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits any “law respecting an establishment of religion”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a>

Any child shall be excused from such Bible reading, or attending such Bible reading, upon the written request of his parent or guardian.”. In the consolidated companion case from Maryland decided at the same time <em>(Murray v. </em>Curlett), the Court held invalid a “rule”, authorized by Maryland law, which provided for “reading, without comment, of a chapter in the Holy Bible and/or the use of The Lord’s Prayer”. In so doing, the Court in <em>Schempp </em>relied, <em>inter alia, </em>on the only other major holding of the Court, either then or now, dealing directly with school prayers, <em>Engel v. Vitale, </em><a href="/us/370/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="370 U.S. 421" data-case-ids="6168500" data-case-paths="/us/370/0421-01">370 U.S. 421</a>, <a href="/us/370/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="370 U.S. 421" data-case-ids="6168500" data-case-paths="/us/370/0421-01">8 L.Ed.2d 601</a> (1962).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_6" id="ref_footnote_3_6">6</a> In that case, the Court held that the prayer ordained by the New York State Board of Regents violated the Establishment Clause. The prayer <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>was as follows: “Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country”. It is difficult to say that the invocation and benediction here involved would be any less prayers because they do not rise to the nobility or sanctity of The Lord’s Prayer, or, on the other hand, because they might be, like the New York Regents’ Prayer, “a pathetically vacuous assertion of piety”. L. Pollak, Public Prayers in Public Schools, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%2062" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="77 Harv. L. Rev. 62">77 Harv. L. Rev. 62</a>, 63 (1963). If the prayers here are to be distinguished from those in <em>Schempp </em>and <em>Vitale, </em>I think the difference must lie in the settings involved.</p>

They were held in the school building under the supervision and with the participation of teachers employed in those schools. The Court found (as had the trial court also in the Pennsylvania case), that the opening exercise was “a religious ceremony”. In <em>Vi-tale, </em>the Regents’ prayer was ordered to be said aloud by each class in the presence of a teacher at the beginning of each school day. If Mt. Lebanon had ordained that each school day, or a particular convocation each day, were to be opened with an invocation and closed with a benediction, the conclusion would be inescapable that they were constitutionally proscribed. In contrast, however, the graduation exercises at Mt. Lebanon take place but once a year, are attended primarily by senior class members, their families and friends, and are not part of the school curriculum or normal routine of the school. While School Boards are legally required to issue diplomas to qualifying students, the commencement session is not a required method for so doing; all required sessions and studies have been previously com<a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>pleted, and diplomas can be otherwise obtained. The prayers, moreover, are not to be spoken by the audience, as they were by the students in <em>Schempp </em>and <em>Vitale. </em>If what occurred in <em>Vitale </em>and <em>Schempp </em>were “random tidbits of religious activity”, <em>see </em>Pollack, op. cit., <em>supra, </em>at 75, the relatively isolated and abbreviated Mt. Lebanon activity shrinks almost to a <em>de rrmdmis </em>stature.</p>

As Mr. Justice Frankfurter has well stated, “It is the Court’s duty to enforce this principle [separation of Church <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>and State] in its full integrity”, but it is also true, as Justice Frankfurter acknowledged in the same opinion, that we are not here dealing with a principle “having the definiteness of a surveyor’s metes and bounds”. <em>Illinois ex rel. McCollum, </em><a href="/us/333/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="333 U.S. 203" data-case-ids="6157820" data-case-paths="/us/333/0203-01">333 U.S. 203</a>, at 231 and 217, <a href="/citations/?q=92%20L.%20Ed.%20649" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="92 L.

Until we are presented with a clearer demonstration of non-secular purpose or of an effect which advances religion, or until the Supreme Court has occasion to delineate further the sweep of <em>Engel </em>and <em>Schempp, </em>I am satisfied that this Court would not be warranted in enjoining the activity here involved. This is not because that activity may not be religious in nature, and not because it may be a vapid ritualistic exercise to promote “dignity” and solemnity, but because even though religious and perhaps intended so to be, it is too remote from the classroom or any required educational program to be constitutionally impermissible ; in its total setting, the activity does not do violence to the principle of neutrality by the government in church-state relationships.</p>
