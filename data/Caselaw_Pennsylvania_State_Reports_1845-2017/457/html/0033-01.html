That conviction, however, was obtained after a complicated trial lasting eight weeks in which the jury had initially reported itself “hopelessly deadlocked” as to petitioner. Only after being sent back for further deliberation was the jury able to return a verdict slip on which petitioner had initially been found not guilty on all counts, and later found guilty as to Count I (the conspiracy count) and not guilty as to the remaining twenty counts which comprised the substantive charges. The mark which the jury had originally placed in the “not guilty” column for Count I was crossed out and placed in the “guilty” column.</p>

These facts, together with the testimony at petitioner’s hearing before the Disciplinary Court of all the attorneys involved with the trial and subsequent appeals, convince us of the likelihood that petitioner was convicted solely due to his client’s misdeeds.</p>

Every segment of the Bar was represented by those who spoke of petitioner’s integrity and ability with the highest possible encomiums.

Representatives of both the plaintiffs’ and defendants’ civil bar also concurred as did private practitioners in the criminal bar. In addition to those already mentioned, testimonial support came from Elwood S. Levy, Robert M. Sebastian, Austin Norris, Bernard A. Smolens, Edward C. German, Donald J. Goldberg and Richard G.

During this period, petitioner received absolutely no compensation for his services. On September 20, 1972, President Judge Jamieson appointed petitioner as Court Administrator for the Courts of Philadelphia County, a non-judicial office, and petitioner also served without pay in this position until July 2, 1973, at which time he commenced receiving remuneration for his services. Petitioner’s exemplary conduct of these offices as well as his earlier handling of motion court and the civil calendar list were fully attested to by the Honorable Edward J. Blake, petitioner’s predecessor as Court Administrator. It was under petitioner’s guidance that the Philadelphia compulsory arbitration system was nurtured and made successful; the motion court system was revamped and revitalized, and an individual judge calendar for the civil side of the court was instituted and supervised. According to Judge Blake, petitioner held conferences and effected settlements in at least 1,000 cases between the date of his suspension (March <em>24, </em>1971) and the date of the disciplinary hearing (June 19, 1972). Because of his suspension as a judge, these settlements could only be effectuated where counsel for all parties requested petitioner’s assistance.

In an opinion in support of tbe order representing tbe views of four members of tbe Court it was suggested: “What we seek to do is to maintain tbe integrity of tbe office of judge to tbe end that that office, and through it tbe administration of justice, will deserve and receive tbe support not only of litigants and lawyers but of tbe public as well.” <em>In re Greenberg, supra </em>at 418, <a href="/citations/?q=280%20A.2d%20370" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="280 A.2d 370">280 A.2d at 373</a>. While I unhesitatingly accept the above statement as an expression of a part of that which we seek to achieve, equally as important is that it must be remembered that we are also considering tbe sanction to be imposed upon petitioner for errant behavior. To argue that “we do not sit in judgment of <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>Judge Greenberg nor mete out punishment to him”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> is to ignore reality and embrace a distinction without meaning. To deprive a man of an office of high esteem which has been obtained after years of preparation, effort and sacrifice because of conduct on his part deemed incompatible with the position held is in fact the imposition of a sanction for that conduct. As in all other instances in our law where the issue is a sanction to be imposed we must also consider the basic and fundamental fairness of the judgment to the one subject to the sanction. It is for this reason that I cannot accept the view that our only consideration in this inquiry is public opinion. Justice must be given to this petitioner and the respect for the integrity of our courts must flow from a recognition of the fairness of our judgment.</p>

A Presidential pardon is the exercise of a constitutional authority delegated to the President who is, in effect, the court of last resort in the federal system superseding, except in cases of impeachment, even the decisions of the United States Supreme Court. The effect of the unconditional pardon is the nullification of the petitioner’s conviction in the same manner and with the same effect as though the petitioner’s conviction had been reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States. The Presidential pardon is binding upon this Court just as decisions of the United States Supreme Court are binding upon us. Because of the Presidential pardon, which reverses petitioner’s conviction, this Court may not arbitrarily remove the petitioner from an office to which he has been elected.

The drawing of three of these checks is alleged as an overt act in the conspiracy count. After Greenberg resigned as a director of the Life-Aid and Magnum corporations, he continued his close business relationship with Alper. He continued to receive and accept weekly payments from Alper’s corporations and attempted to help Alper obtain investors and financing. Furthermore, during the time that Alper’s corporations were experiencing difficulties with various banks because of overdrafts, Greenberg contacted officials of these banks and interceded on Al-per’s behalf. From Greenberg’s continued close association with Alper, his direct participation in a check kite in the early stages of Alper’s manipulations, and his efforts in the later stages to reassure several bankers worried about overdrafts, the jury could reasonably conclude that he was and continued to be a conspirator with Alper in a scheme to defraud. The evidence against him, though not as overwhelming as that against Alper, who played the leading role in this drama of high finance, was clearly sufficient to withstand a motion for a judgment of acquittal and to sustain the jury’s verdict against Greenberg.”</p>

The opinion further observes that when the client refused on constitutional grounds to testify, “petitioner lost the only witness who could definitely establish his innocence”. This argument was also made in the court of appeals; petitioner there asserted that, in a new trial, the client, Alper, and co-defendant Feiner (the first having been convicted on all counts and the other acquitted) would be available to testify favorably to Greenberg, and that a new trial should be had for this reason. The Court of Appeals, in denying this relief, said, in part, as follows: “Assuming, however, that the limited and cumulative testimony which Alper would give would likely be helpful, Green-berg’s difficulty is that in the district court he made a tactical decision not to pursue the steps which might have made Alper’s testimony available. He made, but later abandoned, a motion for a severance. Had that motion been pursued Alper could have been tried first, and thus have been available to testify. There is no question that the choice to abandon the severance motion was a reasoned tactical decision. Where it is clear that the defendant knew of the existence of evidence and willfully failed to take steps to secure its availability he cannot urge that evidence as a ground for a new trial [citations omitted].” <a href="/f2d/449/1223-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="449 F.2d 1223" data-case-ids="799354" data-case-paths="/f2d/449/1223-01">449 F.2d at 1234</a>.</p>

This anomaly has since been rectified and the reverse is now true. We recognize that petitioner’s removal from office is required more by the high standards of judicial office than by his personal failings. Much evidence was adduced before ■ the Commission of petitioner’s diligence in the work of the law, and his unjudicial conduct cannot be said to amount to moral turpitude, dishonesty or corruption. (Cf. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, §6106.) We therefore further order that despite his removal from judicial office Leland W. Geiler shall if otherwise qualified be permitted to practice law in the State of California. (See Cal. Const., art. VI, §18, subd. (d).)” <a href="/citations/?q=110%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20201" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="110 Cal. Rptr. 201">110 Cal.

D. Donald Jamieson, President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, which speaks in complimentary terms of Judge Greenberg, particularly with regard to his performance of administrative functions, expresses belief in his innocence, and makes the recommendation that “nothing be done which would prevent our utilizing his services [in an administrative capacity in the civil side of the court]”. This letter, and several similar letters from members of the bar, were before us and were fully considered prior to our order of March, 1971. <a href="/pa/442/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="442 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="1935370" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0411-01">442 Pa. at 419, 420</a>.
