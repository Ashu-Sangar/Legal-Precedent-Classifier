Once appellant, under compulsion of rule 312, disclosed his alibi witnesses to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth was constitutionally bound to afford appellant reciprocal discovery by furnishing him the names and addresses of any witnesses whose testimony would refute his alibi.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The Supreme Court held in <em>Wardius </em>“that in the absence of a strong showing of state interests to the contrary, discovery must be a two-way street. The State may not insist that trials be run as a ‘search for truth’ so far as defense witnesses are concerned, while maintaining ‘poker game’ secrecy for its own witnesses. It is fundamentally unfair to require a defendant to divulge the details of his own case while at the same time subjecting him to the hazard of surprise concerning refutation of the very pieces of evidence which he disclosed to the State.” <a href="/us/412/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="412 U.S. 470" data-case-ids="6173453" data-case-paths="/us/412/0470-01">Id. at 475</a>, <a href="/us/412/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="412 U.S. 470" data-case-ids="6173453" data-case-paths="/us/412/0470-01">93 S.

Appellant’s alibi witnesses testified that appellant was at their home at the time the robbery was committed, and that they saw no gun in his possession. Two witnesses, whose names appellant sought to discover pretrial, directly contradicted the testimony of appellant’s alibi witnesses. One identified appellant as a person who fled from the scene of the crime; the other testified <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>that shortly after the robbery he saw appellant handle a revolver.</p>

Since the thrust of a defendant’s alibi defense is always that he could not have committed the crime charged because he was not at the scene at the time of the offense, any evidence which tended to prove that the defendant was the perpetrator of the crime or to establish his presence at the scene would be discoverable under the majority’s approach.</p>
      <p id="b116-6" data-blocks='[["BL_116.6",116,[184,1589,1155,719]]]'>Discovery so broad exceeds even the pre-trial request of the defense in the instant case, which was that the Commonwealth reveal the names and addresses of <em>those witnesses who would place him at the scene of the crime. </em>The taxi driver, a Commonwealth witness, testified only that he picked up the defendant and his companions at the Reverend Evans’ home at about 8:00 p.m. and that, while driving them to their destination, he saw a gun change hands. Such evidence hardly places the defendant at the scene of a liquor store robbery at 6:45 p.m., and yet the majority would require discovery of this witness because his testimony allegedly refutes the testimony of the Reverend Evans and his daughter that they did not see a gun while appellant was in their home. Since the Commonwealth is in no position to know pre-trial what an alibi witness will testify he <em>did not see, </em>it would seem that the only safe way for the Commonwealth to avoid reversible error is to reveal its entire ease to the defense.</p>

To be sure, the state court might have construed the Oregon statutes so as to save the constitutionality of the notice requirement and granted reciprocal discovery rights. But the state court would also have had the option of reading state law as precluding reciprocal discovery. If the Court had adopted this latter alternative, it would have had to strike down the notice of alibi requirement. But petitioner’s victory would have been a Pyrrhic one, since once having given the State his alibi information, he could not retract it. Thus under this scenario, even though the notice of alibi rule would be invalidated, <em>the State tvould still have the benefit of non-reciprocal discovery rights </em>in petitioner’s case . . . .” <a href="/us/412/0947-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="412 U.S. 947" data-case-ids="6270377,6270662,6270913,6271200,6271501,6271800" data-case-paths="/us/412/0947-01,/us/412/0947-02,/us/412/0947-03,/us/412/0947-04,/us/412/0947-05,/us/412/0947-06">412 U.S. at 477-78</a>.
