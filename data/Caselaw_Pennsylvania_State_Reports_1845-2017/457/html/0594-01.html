After making her purchases, while en route home, she was set upon by a man, identified as appellant, and stabbed three times resulting in her death shortly thereafter. After appellant’s arrest he was tried before a jury and convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. Post-trial motions were filed, argued and subsequently denied by the Court en banc. This is a direct appeal from the judgment of sentence pursuant to the Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art.

Pa. R. Crim. P. 1119. During the conference with counsel a specific exception was taken to this statement and thus the issue was properly preserved for appellate review. Pa. R. Crim. P. 1119(b). At this point the court expressed an intention of emphasizing that the opinion was intended to be directed to the degree of guilt and not to the question of guilt or innocence. This suggestion was vigorously opposed by defense counsel who argued that such a course of action would further compound what in his judgment was an error incapable of being cured by additional instructions. When the jury returned for final instructions before retiring to begin their deliberations no further mention was made to the opinion that had previously been given but the court did again remind the <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>jury of all of the possible verdicts that could be returned under the indictment they were considering.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

We need not today decide, however, whether there should also be a blanket prohibition against an expression of opinion as to the degree of guilt since the comment under these facts was clearly inappropriate.</p>

The only issue to be resolved by the jury was the state of mind of the accused at the time of the incident. The defense offered evidence to establish a heavy consumption of alcohol preceding the incident and expert evidence to establish legal insanity at the time of the act. As stated by the Commonwealth in their brief “his sole defense, though termed ‘legal insanity’, was nothing more than an obvious attempt to <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>persuade the jury to reduce its verdict to second degree on the theory that appellant was so intoxicated that he' lacked mental capacity to form a specific intent to kill.” Thus the effect of the comment was to decimate the defense’s position as to the only real issue left in controversy. The factual situation was simple and the issues clear-cut, thus comment was not required for clarification. While we may agree with the Commonwealth that the evidence of intoxication was unimpressive the fact remains that this was basically the only defense offered.</p>
