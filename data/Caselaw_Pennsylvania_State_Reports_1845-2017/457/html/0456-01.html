The <em>sine qua non </em>to the applicability of Act 195 is that the employer be a “public employer.” Section 301(1) of the Act defines “public employer” as follows: “Public employer means the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, its political subdivisions including school districts, <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>and any officer, board, commission, agency, authority, or other instrumentality thereof and any nonprofit organization or institution and any charitable, religious, scientific, literary, recreational, health, educational or welfare institution receiving grants or appropriations from local, State or Federal governments but shall not include employers covered or presently subject to coverage under the act of June 1, 1937 (P. L. 1168), as amended, known as the ‘Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act/ the act of July 5,1935, Public Law 198, 74th Congress, as amended, known as the ‘National Labor Relations Act.’ ” 43 P.S. §1101.301(1). The determination of <em>who </em>is the employer or employers of a group of employes is <em>not governed </em>by Act 195, however, even though the Act may have raised certain considerations in this regard which were not envisioned prior to its passage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

    <p id="b494-4" data-blocks='[["BL_494.5",494,[184,397,1155,486]]]'>I agree that the orders of the Commonwealth Court and the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board should be reversed. In my view, Act 195 does not include within its scope those persons appointed, directed, or under the supervision of the judges of the various courts of this Commonwealth. If it did, that Act would impermissibly intrude upon the functioning of our independent Judiciary. I am unwilling to attribute such an unconstitutional purpose to Act 195.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b494-5" data-blocks='[["BL_494.6",494,[254,892,1016,44]]]'>Mr. Justice Nix joins in this concurring opinion.</p>
