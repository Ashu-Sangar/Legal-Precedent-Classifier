The testimony at the suppression hearing indicates that, in the early afternoon hours of March 22, 1971, appellee shot and killed one Daryl Coleman in the basement of Temple University Hospital, Philadelphia. On his way out of that institution, Cunningham turned to a group of individuals seated in a hallway and stated, “Your friend’s dead. I just killed your friend.” Approximately two hours later, Cunningham surrendered himself to a guard in the Raymond Rosen Housing Project. At this time, he handed the guard a gun and stated that he had shot several people. After the shooting at Temple, but prior to his surrender to the project guard, Cunningham allegedly shot and wounded three other people. At approximately 3:00 p.m. on March 22, 1971, appellee was taken into custody by members of the Philadelphia Police Depart<a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>ment.

Following an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Rule 323, the court entered an order suppressing the in-custody statements on the ground that the defendant was incompetent to make a valid waiver of his Miranda<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> rights; it held under advisement the motion to suppress the physical evidence and the volunteered out-of-custody statements. Upon further consideration, the court ruled the physical evidence admissible but suppressed the statements on the ground that they were made at a time when the defendant’s state of mind was such as to render him incompetent to make such admissions. The Commonwealth does not dispute the rulings as to the statements made while in police custody, but contends that the pre-trial suppression of the out-of-custody declaration was improper.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> We agree.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

While a motion to quash the appeal was filed, it was not on the ground of untimeliness, but on the ground that the appeal was from an interlocutory order. We can, however, notice the defect of untimeliness nevertheless, since it goes to the appellate jurisdiction of the Court. Having reviewed the record, we have concluded that the appeal should not be quashed. Due to an error in the office of the District Attorney, the order of the suppression judge, made by her on September 7, 1972, and delivered to the file room of the District Attorney’s office on October 4, 1972, was not brought to the attention of any lawyer in that office until five weeks after it was made. The Commonwealth then promptly, but mistakenly, applied to the lower court for leave to appeal, nunc pro tunc, to this Court The motion was at first granted, but later, and correctly, refused since the lower court has no cognizance over allowance of appeals to this Court This latter order was filed on March 15, 1973 and was accompanied by an opinion both on the question of <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>right to appeal and also in support of the suppression order of September 7th.

Paragraph A of Rule 19 of this Court provides that “No judgment, sentence, order or decree shall be appealable until it has been entered upon the appropriate docket in 'the court below”. It is this act of docketing which constitutes the “entry” of an order under the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, 17 P.S. 1211.502(a) (“. . . an appeal under this act from any order shall be filed within thirty days of its entry”). See <em>Slotsky v.

For reasons that are not explained on this record, the original order of suppression has not <em>yet </em>been docketed, although the opinion of the court in support of it has been. Rather than remand to allow the order to be physically entered on the docket and thus cause further delay, we will consider that done which should have been done, and direct the prothonotary of the court of common pleas, when this record is remanded, to docket the order of September 7, 1972 as of March 15, 1973, that being the date when the court of common pleas filed its opinion relative to that order, and also its order refusing an appeal nunc pro tunc. We believe that the selection of this date is fair and just to all concerned under all the circumstances of this case, but, by this disposition, we do not mean to establish any precedent for the future. The docketing of the order of September 7th could and should have been done promptly, and could have been attended to by either party or the court.</p>
