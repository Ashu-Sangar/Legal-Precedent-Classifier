There appellant sought to suppress evidence seized from a house in which he slept occasionally, never remaining more than a single night.

    <p id="b666-4" data-blocks='[["BL_666.4",666,[179,828,1161,425]]]'>Here, appellant alleges that his grandmother’s house was more than a place at which he occasionally spent the night. In contrast to the facts in <em>Raymond, </em>appellant claims he lived at the searched residence five nights a week, every week.
