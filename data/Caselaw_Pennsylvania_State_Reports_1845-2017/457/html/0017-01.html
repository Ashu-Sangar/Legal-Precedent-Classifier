    <p id="b48-7" data-blocks='[["BL_48.9",48,[171,895,1156,1026]]]'>On August 2, 1968, the Redevelopment Authority of the City of Philadelphia [The Authority] filed a declaration of talcing in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, for the area described as Callowhill East Urban Redevelopment Area. Included in this condemnation was a property located at 434-436 North Third Street, Philadelphia, which King Athletic Goods Company and Pro Sporting Goods Company both occupied and used in the manufacture and sale of athletic goods and equipment. [For convenience these businesses will be referred to herein as one, and the two companies will be referred to as King]. However, in its business King also occupied and used a property at 412-416 North Third Street, Philadelphia, which premises were not included in the condemnation. King filed preliminary objections to the declaration of talcing alleging it was void because, inter alia, it excluded the premises at 412-416 North Third Street which was a necessary part of its business operation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

On April 22, 1969, after extensive correspondence between the attorney representing King and The Authority, King submitted to The Authority three bids for the moving of its “personal property” to the new location. The lowest bid was submitted by Louderback-North American, Inc. [Louderback]. On May 12th, King’s attorney wrote The Authority asking its approval for King to move to the new location without first obtaining the required bids for moving its equipment, machinery and fixtures. The letter stated that King was in the process of obtaining these bids “from general contractors” and the bids should be received “within the next few days”; <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>that it “was necessary to immediately vacate the premises 416 North Third Street”; that King was willing to pay Louderback directly and after this payment and “approval of the general contracting work, they would look for reimbursement from The Authority for that which they paid to Louderback.” On May 15th, The Authority wrote directly to Louderback saying it “had received its estimate” and Louderback was authorized “to perform the moving.” Louderback commenced the moving on May 24, 1969, which continued until June 4th, when it was terminated by King. As of June 4th, a substantial part of the moving had been accomplished, but part of King’s inventory, machinery, equipment and fixtures still remained at the old location.</p>
    <p id="b50-4" data-blocks='[["BL_50.4",50,[180,1090,1157,1020]]]'>On June 23, 1969, King finally submitted three bids to The Authority for the moving of its machinery, equipment and fixtures. However, The Authority found certain problems with the bids and notified King of these general questions, but not of the specifics. On June 27th, King’s attorney wrote to The Authority and demanded a resolution of the controversy, and suggested that if one was not immediately forthcoming, King would be forced to finance the relocation costs and seek reimbursement from The Authority. In a letter dated July 3rd, King’s attorney notified The Authority that any further delay was intolerable, and he was instructing his clients to contract on its own for the moving and reinstallation of its machinery, equipment and fixtures. Despite this notification, King on July 29, 1969, through its attorney, submitted three revised bids to The Authority for the moving and relocation of the machinery, equipment and fixtures to the new business address.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

In this complaint, King requested the court to order The Authority to comply with the agreement of the parties entered into on December 2, 1968, more specifically to order The Authority to authorize and pay for the moving of King’s machinery, equipment and fixtures to its new business location. Damages were also requested from The Authority for the loss incurred by King as a result of the delay in the moving.</p>

This included the money King had expended in the relocation and reinstallation of its machinery, equipment and fixtures, plus the amount allegedly lost in its business operation from June 4, 1969, to January 1970, due to the delay in the moving and re-establishment of its facilities at the new location. Subsequently, the chancellor entered an adjudication and decree nisi awarding King damages in the amount of $67,359.47, covering the money it had expended for the relocation and reinstallation of its machinery, equipment and fixtures. The chancellor refused to award King any damages for the losses allegedly suffered in its business operation between June 4, 1969, and January 1970, because he concluded The Authority was not “solely responsible for the delay” in the moving to the new business location. Both sides filed exceptions to the adjudication and decree nisi. A court en banc later dismissed these exceptions and <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>made the decree nisi final.
