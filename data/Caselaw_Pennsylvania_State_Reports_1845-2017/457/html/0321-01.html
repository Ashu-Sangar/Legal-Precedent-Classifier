If in negligence actions “we have defined ‘cause of action’ as ‘the negligent act or acts which occasioned the injury’ ”, <em>Saracina v.

By the same token, the allegation that there was no substantial change in the defective condition of the crane between the time of sale and the accident merely amplifies appellant’s initial claim that a defect in design or manufacture was the proximate cause of his injuries. Kuisis has never deviated from his assertion that his injuries were caused by an unreasonably dangerous condition in the crane, for which the manufacturer-seller was responsible. The allegations of his original complaint comprise “the material facts” on which his claim under §402A is based. <em>See </em>12 P.S. App. R. C. P. 1019(a). The amended complaint suggests no new theory of causality or breach of duty by the defendant. We are satisfied that it worked no prejudice to Baldwin by stating a new cause of action.</p>

That Kuisis was a “user” of the crane within the meaning of §402A appears to be conceded by appellee. The factual issues thus narrow down to three: was there a defect in the brake locking mechanism which constituted an unreasonable danger to users of the crane; if so, was the defect a substantial cause of the injuries sustained by Kuisis; and if so, was the defect present at the time the crane was delivered by Baldwin to North Star?

Instead, he attempted to prove the existence of a defect indirectly, through the circumstances immediately surrounding Kuisis’ mishap, and the occurrence of five earlier malfunctions of the lock. The circumstances of the accident were as follows: A minute or two before the load of pipe fell, the crane operator set the locking device to hold the load about four feet off the ground. After checking in the normal manner to see that the lock was engaged,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> he left the cab. It was while the operator <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>was absent from the controls that the pipe fell, injuring Kuisis, who was standing by the load.

This rule reflects the fact that liability under §402A turns on a lack of fitness in the defendant’s product, as in the case of an action for breach of warranty, rather than on the breach of a particular duty of care by the defendant, as in the case of an action for negligence. While a plaintiff’s hand in a strict liability case will obviously be strengthened by evidence of a specific defect in the defendant’s product, such evidence is not necessary to take this part of the plaintiff’s case to a jury. We agree with the court en banc below that, on the evidence here presented, a jury could find that a defect existed in the brake locking mechanism, and that this defect was unreasonably dangerous to users of the crane.</p>

Granting, without so deciding, that violation of the departmental regulation was negligence per se, we do not think this affects the applicability of <em>MacDougall. </em>When a malfunction occurs, a concurrent abnormal use of the machine forecloses an inference of a defective condition only if the abnormal use itself contributed to the malfunction. Here, while the operator’s absence from the cab might be found to be <em>a </em>cause of the accident, it certainly did not cause the release of the brake locking device.

In the following two decades, the machine saw extensive use for a variety of purposes. After functioning for several years as a shovel, it was converted first into a dragline and later into a crane. There was conflicting evidence as to the amount of maintenance the machine received. At least two motors wore out in succession and had to be replaced. The brake bands were changed several times, and the brake pedals and the brake lock release chain were each replaced at least once. A succession of operators used the crane, each one making his own adjustments to the brakes as required. In light of this evidence, the court below was of the opinion that the <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>crane had undergone changes so substantial as to render speculative any conclusion that the alleged defective condition was present at the time of delivery.</p>

Only two items of circumstantial evidence arguably support appellant’s contention that a defect was present in the crane prior to its sale: a safety engineer who examined the crane two years after the accident found no sign of wear in the brake locking mechanism, and a malfunction of the locking device had occurred about four years after the purchase of the crane, under different conditions from the accident which resulted in Kuisis’ injuries.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> Viewed against the record as a whole, these <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>slender evidentiary threads are not enough to lift this contention out of the realm of speculation.</p>

The age of an allegedly defective product must be considered in light of its expected useful life and the stress to which it has been subjected. In most cases, the weighing of these factors should be left to the finder of fact. But in certain situations the prolonged use factor may loom so large as to obscure all others in a case. Professer Prosser has summarized the position generally taken by the courts on this question: “[Lapse of time and long continued use] in itself is not enough, even when it has extended over a good many years, to defeat the recovery where there is satisfactory proof of an original defect; but when there is no definite evidence, and it is only a matter of inference from the fact that something broke or gave way, the continued use usually prevents the inference that the thing was more probably than not defective when it was sold”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a> Were there any direct evidence of a specific defect in the brake locking mechanism at the time of delivery, the age of the crane would not, as a matter of law, defeat liability, but in <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>the absence of such evidence in the record before us, we do not think appellant has made out a case for the jury.</p>

Appellant offered only one expert witness, a safety engineer named Louis Barbe, who was prepared to testify both to the cause of the accident and the specific nature of the alleged defect in the brake mechanism. Barbe was no more qualified than the jury to conclude from the immediate circumstances surrounding the fall of the pipe that some defect in the locking mechanism was the cause of the accident. Allowing an “expert” to draw this inference solely on the basis of the testimony of appellant’s other witnesses would have been a misuse of expert testimony; thus, a hypothetical question as to the cause of the accident, based solely on this testimony, was properly excluded. But there was other evidence available which was a proper subject for opinion evidence by one having technical expertise in product safety. Barbe had reviewed the blueprints of the brake locking device, which were admitted into evidence, and he had also personally inspected the crane on two occasions after the accident. These observations, together with the testimony of the other witnesses at trial, provided an adequate evidentiary foundation for the opinion of a qualified expert as to whether the accident was caused by a defect in the design of the brake locking mechanism. The question is: was Barbe so qualified? The lower court thought not.</p>

It may mean one thing when the question is whether it is good upon demurrer, and something different when there is a question of the amendment of a pleading or of the application of the principle of res judieata. ... At times and in certain contexts, it is identified with the infringement of a right or the violation of a duty. At other times and in other contexts, it is a concept of the law of remedies, the identity of the cause being then dependent on that of the form of action or the <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>writ. Another aspect reveals it as something separate from writs and remedies, the group of operative facts out of which a grievance has developed. This court has not committed itself to the view that the phrase is susceptible of any single definition that will be independent of the context or of the relation to be governed. Nonetheless, it has fixed the limits of amendment [to a prior pleading after the expiration of the statute of limitations] with increasing liberality. . . .” For a more recent attempt to grapple with this slippery juridical concept, see <em>Emert v.

The particular question to which objection was taken required the witness to compare his observations of the locking device after the accident with the original blueprints and pictures of the device from a Baldwin parts book.

Similarly in <em>Thompson v. Wyeth Laboratories, </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/46/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="46 Pa.
