The first and third of these allegations solely raise questions of fact to be initially determined by the suppression court. Where that court finds that the accused was informed of the nature of the charges about which he was to be questioned and that the statement of the accused was voluntarily given, appellate review is limited to a consideration of the testimony of the Commonwealth’s witnesses and that portion of the testimony offered by the defendant which is uncontradicted. <em>Commonwealth v.

Article I, section 9, of the Pennsylvania Constitution guarantees an accused the right “to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor. ...” A similar provision is contained in the United States Constitution. U. S. Const. amend. VI. <em>See also </em>Act of May 31, 1718, 1 Sm. L. 105, §4, 19 P.S. §783. The right to compulsory process encompasses the right to meet the prosecution’s case with the aid of witnesses, and the right to elicit the aid of the Commonwealth in securing those witnesses at trial, both of which are fundamental to a fair trial. This constitutional right, though fundamental, is not, however, absolute. Evidentiary rules based on legitimate state interests which exclude certain witnesses or certain testimony are not inconsistent nor incompatible with the right to compulsory process.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Accordingly, where certain witnesses’ testimony would not be admissible at trial, the Constitution does not require that a defendant be given the right to secure the attendance of witnesses which he has no right to use. <em>Washington v. Texas, </em><a href="/us/388/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="388 U.S. 14" data-case-ids="6167274" data-case-paths="/us/388/0014-01">388 U.S. 14</a> (1967). Our inquiry is thus directed to the question of the admissibility of <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>the testimony which would have been given by the two witnesses whom appellant requested to be subpoenaed.</p>

At the time appellant was interrogated on the charge herein concerned, he was being detained at this same facility, on an unrelated charge. Appellant wished to establish through these witnesses that he was on medication at the time he signed the waiver and gave his statement to the police. In determining both the voluntariness of a confession and whether the waiver of a constitutional right was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, an accused’s physical and mental condition is the proper subject of judicial inquiry. <em>Commonwealth v. Holton, </em><a href="/pa/432/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="432 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1919687" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0011-01">432 Pa. 11</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=247%20A.2d%20228" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="247 A.2d 228">247 A.2d 228</a> (1968); <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

The testimony of no doctor, however, was ever offered. Had such testimony been offered along with the nature and properties of the medication, the testimony of Charles Coon, the administering agent, would have been a necessary link in the chain of establishing that this medication not only caused certain effects when taken, but that <em>appellant </em>had in fact taken the medicine. Charles Coon’s testimony standing alone, however, had no probative value without the testimony of another witness competent to identify the medication.

This argument is singularly without merit. Our cases are so legion as not to require citation in holding that a defendant may be convicted on circumstantial evidence alone and that the specific intent to kill which is necessary in a non-felony murder to constitute murder in the first degree may be found from the attendant circumstances and may be inferred from the intentional use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body of another human being. In view of the circumstantial evidence in this case and the voluntary confession of appellant, there is without the slightest doubt evi<a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>dence sufficient to prove murder in the first degree. A motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence is addressed to the trial court’s sound discretion, and the trial court’s action is subject to reversal on appeal only for an abuse of that discretion. <em>Commonwealth v.

The majority, in effect, holds that a trial judge is to consider the value of a witness to the defendant before the witness can be subpoenaed for trial. There has never been such an unfair restriction on the right to call witnesses. On many occasions, the prosecution, without question, subpoenas witnesses who come to court and never testify. Under the test established by the majority, a trial court may conduct a minitrial as to each <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>and every subpoena requested by the defense (or the prosecution).

    <p id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[166,1246,1150,316]]]'>Prior to trial, the appellant requested subpoenas for two persons whom the appellant wanted to call as witnesses during his trial. The request was denied and that denial is one of the assignments of error. The appellant’s request for the subpoenas should have been granted.</p>
    <p id="b277-6" data-blocks='[["BL_277.6",277,[164,1575,1150,746]],["BL_278.1",278,[184,321,1153,373]]]'>When the subpoenas were requested, the trial court properly inquired about the reasonableness of the appellant’s request in order to prevent the arbitrary use of the trial court’s subpoena power. The appellant informed the trial court that the proposed witnesses were competent to testify about the appellant’s condition at the time the appellant allegedly waived his constitutional rights and gave a statement to the police. The appellant, at that time, was being detained in the state correctional institution in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, on an unrelated charge for which he was later acquitted. The proposed witnesses were incarcerated with the appellant. The appellant informed the trial court that while he was incarcerated he was on medication and <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>was constantly taking pills. He said that once he passed out in his cell. One of the proposed witnesses, according to the appellant, was giving the appellant medication under doctor’s orders and was in the appellant’s cell at all times. The other proposed witness, according to the appellant, was also aware of the appellant’s condition.</p>
    <p id="b278-4" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[182,703,1156,1410]]]'>There was no proper basis for the trial court’s denial of the appellant’s request. The prosecution argues that the subpoenas were properly denied because the proposed testimony was immaterial and the proposed witnesses were incompetent. I cannot agree. The proposed testimony was obviously material since the appellant claimed that his condition prevented a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his constitutional rights, and also affected the voluntariness of his statement. The witnesses were incompetent, it is argued, because they were lay witnesses and had no training and experience as medical experts. The record, first of all, is silent concerning the training and experience of the witnesses, but even if we assume the proposed witnesses were not medical experts, they would have been competent as witnesses on relevant and material matters. The witnesses were certainly competent to testify about their observations of the appellant and their conduct, if any, in administering medication under a doctor’s order. <em>See </em>G. M. Henry, Pennsylvania Evidence §537 (1953). An inquiry concerning the reasonableness of a request for a subpoena is not the trial of the case. All that the appellant was required to establish was that his request was reasonable and not arbitrary. Under the circumstances, the subpoenas should have been granted.</p>

    <p id="b279-3" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[164,582,1149,746]]]'>The error was not harmless. The statement which the appellant gave to the police admitted the stabbing of the victim. During the trial, the appellant denied the stabbing and presented a witness who corroborated the appellant’s testimony that the victim, who was a friend of the appellant, was dead when the appellant entered the victim’s home. The appellant vigorously contested the truthfulness of the statement he gave to the police, claiming that it was false and coerced by threats to his wife and child. Credibility is for the trier of facts, but we cannot say that the jury might not have resolved the conflicting testimony in the appellant’s favor had the proposed witnesses testified. The judgment of sentence should be reversed.</p>
