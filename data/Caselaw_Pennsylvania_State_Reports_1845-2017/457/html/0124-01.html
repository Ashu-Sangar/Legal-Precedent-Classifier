That the use of the term abandonment in the Adoption Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> was not intended to describe the same conduct in the section here under consideration is readily apparent when we consider the difference in the purposes sought to be achieved by the two pieces of legislation. In the case of adoptions, we are attempting to describe that type of conduct that should justify the legal involuntary <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>termination of a relationship created by nature. Under this section of the penal code we are simply attempting to define that type of parental neglect that would justify criminal sanction. Wherein, it is understandable that the involuntary termination of parental rights should not turn upon a single incident regardless how heinous,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> our criminal law is designed to punish single episodes that are repugnant to our concept of an orderly society.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b159-3" data-blocks='[["BL_159.4",159,[155,814,1153,482]]]'>An accepted meaning of the word abandon is “to forsake or desert especially in spite of an allegiance, duty, or responsibility.” <em>Webster’s Third New International Dictionary. </em>It is difficult to conceive of a more graphic example of the term abandon than that which is presented here, where mere infants were rendered pitifully vulnerable to the dangers of the night as a result of the preoccupation of a mother with her personal pleasures.</p>

Section 727 clearly evidences a legislative intention to provide alternative conduct to supply the third element of the offense. The section proscribes <em>either </em>“abandons the child in destitute circumstances, or willfully omits to furnish necessary and proper food, clothing, or shelter for such child.” (Em<a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>phasis added.) To interpret the first of the two clauses cited as requiring proof of conduct on the part of the accused which exhibits a purpose to forego parental duties and relinquish parental claims would reduce the second clause from an alternative type of conduct also justifying criminal sanction to a mere illustration of conduct that would be embraced within the purview of the first clause. It is clear that the second clause was not intended as merely an obvious illustration of the conduct prohibited in the first clause but rather an attempt to proscribe distinctly different conduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> May 28, 1937, P.

      <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>We also find to be without merit appellant’s claim that Section 727 is void for vagueness. The United States Supreme Court has recently announced a two-pronged test to be used in assessing a claim of vagueness. <em>Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, </em><a href="/us/405/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="405 U.S. 156" data-case-ids="11721589" data-case-paths="/us/405/0156-01">405 U.S. 156</a> (1972). The issue must be considered by determining whether the statute or ordinance (1) “fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden. . . .” and (2) whether “it encourages arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions.” <a href="/us/405/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="405 U.S. 156" data-case-ids="11721589" data-case-paths="/us/405/0156-01">405 U.S. at 162</a>. See also, <em>City of Chester v.

Applying this analysis to the statute in question and its application to the instant factual situation, it is obvious that the due process clause of the United States Constitution has not been violated. The abandoning of a minor child in destitute circumstances in violation of a parental duty of protection defines a type of conduct with sufficient clarity that it can be easily comprehended by one of ordinary intelligance and possesses a degree of preciseness which prevents arbitrary and erratic arrests. Clearly this is not an instance where the conduct prohibited is so intangible or vague that would require men of common intelligence to guess at its meaning and differ as to its application but rather adequately describes conduct which parents of modest sensibilities and possessing only a meager sense of responsibility would find in complete disregard of their obligation.</p>

The possibility of a fire in the building was not a re<a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>mote contingency that might have been reasonably overlooked in appellant’s haste to join her friends for a night of pleasure in view of an earlier fire which had occurred just a short time before the incident in question.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Here, the Commonwealth proceeded under a misdemeanor-manslaughter theory; the misdemeanor in this instance being a violation of Section 727. The use of this theory, however, does not obviate the requirement that the Commonwealth must establish that conduct of the accused was a legal cause of the death. The conduct which constitutes the misdemeanor must also be the legal cause of the death. <em>Commonwealth v. Root, </em><a href="/pa/403/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="403 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1299467" data-case-paths="/pa/403/0571-01">403 Pa. 571</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=170%20A.2d%20310" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="170 A.2d 310">170 A.2d 310</a> (1961). The appellant relying on the <em>Root </em>decision would have us find that the only legal cause of the death of these small children was the fire and not an act or failure to act on her part. We cannot agree. While it is unquestioned that the direct cause of death was smoke inhalation resulting from the fire it does not follow that other acts which contributed in producing the ultimate result cannot provide a basis for criminal responsibility for the deaths.</p>

Criminal responsibility is properly assessed against one whose conduct was a direct and substantial factor in producing the death even though other factors combined with that conduct to achieve the result. <em>Commonwealth v.

Although suffocation due Lo the fire was the immediate medical cause of the children’s death, appellant’s unlawful conduct in leaving them locked in the room, without supervision, for several hours, susceptible to numerous foreseeable dangers, was the legal cause of their death.

As to the evidence of the prior fire an objection to its relevancy is clearly without merit. We have on other occasions stated that the introduction of testimony pertaining to a prior event is permissible when it is offered to establish knowledge possessed by the accused. <em>Muller v.

In any case where death is allegedly criminally caused by fire, the origin of that fire is obviously germane to the inquiry. Interestingly appellant, in her brief, attempts to use this testimony to bolster her argument that she was not responsible for the death. It is thus difficult at best to understand her argument that this evidence, upon which at one point she seeks to rely should be considered irrelevant and justify reversal. For the same reason we find little merit in her objection based upon a lack of a sufficient foundation for the opinion.</p>

The transcript of the sentencing hearing reflects that no reference was made to either bill. The record does contain a copy of an order, which is unsigned and apparently prepared by a clerk, which would indicate that the two-year sentence was imposed on the involuntary manslaughter indictment. However, the parties appear to accept the sentence as having been imposed on each bill to run concurrently and since no objection has been raised and the sentence would be a legal one under either bill we will treat it in the same manner.</p>
