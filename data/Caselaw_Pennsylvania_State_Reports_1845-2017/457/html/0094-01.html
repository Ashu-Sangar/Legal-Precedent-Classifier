They instituted this suit as a class action on behalf of all shareholders alleging that the company directors had wrongfully withheld some $10,000,000.00 in corporate reserves and seeking distribution of that sum to the shareholders. Appellants filed preliminary objections asserting: (1) that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the individual defendants due to a defect in service of process; and (2) that the individual plaintiffs did not adequately represent the class and therefore, that indispensable parties were not joined in the suit. The trial judge overruled these preliminary objections and this appeal followed.

It alleges further that the named plaintiffs “fairly and adequately represent the interests of all other policyholders who number . . . more than two thousand.” Appellants contend that the vast majority of policyholders do not desire the distribution of corporate funds sought by Mr. and Ms. Pincus. As evidence of this fact, they note that at a shareholders meeting on March 27, 1973, a resolution to effectuate that distribution was introduced and defeated by a vote of 3,082 to 3 with 2 voters abstaining.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Based upon the above facts, appellants contend that the suit cannot qualify as a class action under Pa.

Independent Federal Savings, supra, </em>we reasoned that an order permitting a suit to proceed as a class action did not “put the defendant out of court” because he could still demur to the complaint and, if necessary, defend on the merits at trial. “Whether a suit should proceed as a class action is independent of the question whether plaintiffs have stated a cause of action or whether they can prevail on the merits.” <em>Piltzer, supra, </em><a href="/pa/456/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="456 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="584387" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0402-01">456 Pa. at 405</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20677" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="319 A.2d 677">319 A.2d at 678</a>.</p>
    <p id="b127-4" data-blocks='[["BL_127.5",127,[167,984,1154,537]]]'>Appellants’ complaint, that the named plaintiffs do not adequately represent all of the shareholders, is independent of any challenge to the merits of plaintiffs’ cause of action. Its resolution does not in any way alter the presentation of evidence or legal arguments. Appellants can still challenge the sufficiency of the complaint and, if necessary, defend on the merits at trial. Thus, their objection to the class action would seem to fit within the rule of <em>Piltzer, supra, </em>and would not properly be heard in an interlocutory appeal.</p>
    <p id="b127-5" data-blocks='[["BL_127.6",127,[169,1533,1153,639]]]'>Appellants have attempted to distinguish their case by asserting that the trial court’s order rejecting their objections to the class action effectively permits the suit to proceed without indispensable parties. They assert that the absence of indispensable parties goes to the jurisdiction of the court. <em>See, e.g., Reifsnyder v. Pittsburgh Outdoor Advertising Co., </em><a href="/pa/396/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="396 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1284916" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0320-01">396 Pa. 320</a>, 326, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.2d%20894" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="152 A.2d 894">152 A.2d 894</a> (1959). Therefore, they rely upon the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, 12 P.S. §672 which permits appeals whenever the question of jurisdiction has been raised in and decided by the court of first instance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

      <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>We accept the above as general statement of the rule on indispensable parties. In our view, however, there are no indispensable parties to the instant case that have not been properly joined. There are only two conceivable positions in this lawsuit that the shareholders could reasonably embrace: distribution of the funds or perpetuation of management’s policy of withholding distribution. The former group is, of course, covered by the class represented by the named plaintiffs. The latter group is joined insofar as it is represented by the corporation.</p>
    <p id="b128-4" data-blocks='[["BL_128.5",128,[171,934,1160,593]]]'>Management and corporate counsel ordinarily represent the shareholders in suits against the corporation. To argue that shareholders who agree with management are indispensable parties to a suit against the corporation (or even that they have a right to join in the suit) is to ignore the legal doctrine of the corporate entity. We are therefore convinced that each and every shareholder is properly represented in this lawsuit. It merely remains to be determined which ones are on which side.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The claim of failure to join indispensable parties is without merit.</p>
    <p id="b128-5" data-blocks='[["BL_128.6",128,[172,1536,1158,317]]]'>Since the appellants’ claim is, in reality, an objection to the propriety of the class action, it can properly be resolved on appeal after final judgment below.

In our view, however, a trustee of a corporation possesses the requisite proprietary interest. For purpose of the rule, the corporation is his business. Appellants do not quarrel with the proposition that a trustee may be served by serving an agent or person in charge at the <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>corporate office location where the trustee conducts his daily affairs. Rather, appellants object because they did not conduct their affairs at the actual site of service, the main corporate headquarters. We cannot agree. Having concluded that appellants, as trustees, possess the requisite proprietary interest for service under Rule 1009(b) (2) (iii) at one site, we must conclude that the main corporate headquarters is also an office of the trustees. The Rule permits service at <em>any </em>office of the defendant. We therefore conclude that appellants first objection to service in this case is without merit.</p>
