We believe this reliance to be misplaced. In <em>Koch, </em>the posted return had shown that the candidate who received the majority of the votes cast had been duly elected. Thereafter, the County Board of Elections negligently computed the returns and returned a majority of the votes for the opposing candidate and, although recognizing their error, failed to correct it. There it was clear that the Board had lulled Koch, into a false sense of security and this Court properly observed : “. . . the only appropriate remedy by which, the negligence of the election board could be corrected was <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>by an appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>for a recount under Section 1407, 25 P.S. section 3157.” <em>Koch, </em>supra at 550, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20657" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="41 A.2d 657">41 A.2d at 660</a>. In this case, even though the original returns may have led Walko to believe that he was a winner, it has not been shown that it was a result of a deliberate intention to mislead or of negligence on the part of the County Board. Further, both parties realized their precarious position and did in fact request and were granted the right to open those boxes that they requested to be opened. Had Walko so chose, he could, at that time, have expanded his request to include the 34 districts now involved. He elected not to do so and cannot now offer his disappointment with the result of the recanvass as a basis to modify his original request.</p>

However, while it is most appropriate for the state to legislate to achieve these ends those regulatory measures must not ever be permitted to unduly infringe upon the exercise of the right to vote. Clearly, the invalidation of a ballot where the voter has complied with all instructions communicated to him and in the absence of any evidence of improper influence having been exerted, invalidation would necessarily amount to an unreasonable encroachment upon the franchise and the legislative enactment should not be interpreted to require such a result.

The first ballot, identified in the court below as Exhibit B-Walko, Economy Borough, First District, was not counted by the Recount Board for Walko. That decision was sustained by the court below. Here the voter did comply with the direction that he use either a checkmark or a cross. In this instance, a checkmark was used. The alleged complaint arises from what we believe is an irregularity in the formation of the checkmark which was made to signify the vote for candidate Walko. The Recount Board concluded that, there were three checkmarks in the office block, although a voter was required to vote only for two candidates. An inspection of the ballot shows that this voter in several instances retraced the checkmarks and in some instances the retraced lines did not coincide with the original checkmark. After careful inspection we are satisfied that this was not an attempt to cast votes for each of the three candidates but rather only an attempt to emphasize his mark as was done in several other places on the ballot. Under the expressed provisions of this section an irregularity in the formation of <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>the check will not provide a basis for invalidating the vote.</p>
    <p id="b323-5" data-blocks='[["BL_323.4",323,[183,433,1152,1252]]]'>The other ballot in this category was identified below as Exhibit A-Walko, Beaver Falls, First Ward. There the only mark on the ballot is the word <em>yes </em>in the party column in the space provided for those who wish to cast a straight party vote for the Democratic candidates. In <em>Reading Election Recount Case, supra, </em>we held that the word <em>yes </em>appearing on a ballot did not render it so unique as to demonstrate a willful intention to make the ballot capable of identification. While that case differs from the instant situation, in that there was also an appropriate mark in the designated block and the word <em>yes </em>was treated as surplusage, we do not believe that that difference is material. Just as the proscription against adding unauthorized marks is to preserve the anonymity of the voter, so too is the requirement that a specific type mark be employed to express the voter’s intent. To allow additional markings where there is also an appropriate mark and yet not to permit the same additional marking where the intention of the voter is clear by the use of that marking would present an anomaly which would escape rational explanation. Thus, in these two instances we conclude the vote should have been permitted to count for candidate Walko.</p>

We cannot infer from these ballots that there <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>was a willful attempt to render them identifiable.

Further, none of these questioned marks was sufficiently significant to have set the ballot apart from all others cast in that district and make it capable of later identification. Additionally, there is no question as to the intention of the voter in each of these instances. To deny the vote under these circumstances particularly where the inadequacies of the instructions appearing on the face of the ballot coincide with the reasons for the challenged votes<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> would be without justification.</p>

The court below based its ruling solely on the effect that should be given to the fact that the word “void” appeared on the face of the ballot. We do not believe that this issue can be resolved without also considering the most important fact that the ballots had also been put, apparently by an election official, into the envelope for spoiled ballots.
