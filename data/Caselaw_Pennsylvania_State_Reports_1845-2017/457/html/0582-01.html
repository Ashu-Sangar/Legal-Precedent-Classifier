This sentence was stayed pending the filing and disposition of post-trial motions which were then filed by appellant and dismissed by the lower court on February 14, 1972.

One of these witnesses, Mrs. Emma Paul, conveyed what she had seen to one Angus B. Hopson, a retired policeman. By coincidence, Hopson had personally witnessed an argument between appellant and the victim which had transpired in a nearby bar just prior to the stabbing. When the police arrived on the scene, Hop-son conveyed the information which he had accumulat<a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>ed to them. On this basis, a broadcast went out over police radio to the effect that a stabbing had occurred in the vicinity of Hazlett Way and Penn Avenue in Pittsburgh and that one Ronald Lassiter (with a description) was being sought in connection therewith. Being in the vicinity of the crime, Officer James Hintemeyer responded to the broadcast and began looking for the suspect. He was told by an unknown individual that Ronald Lassiter was in a house at 3519 Mulberry Way. Upon arriving at that address, Hintemeyer noticed several people through an open door. One of the women in the house asked Hintemeyer what he wanted, to which he said that he was looking for Ronald Lassiter. The woman, Mrs. Boston, then invited the officer into the house, stating that Lassiter was present. Upon Hintemeyer’s entrance into the house, appellant identified himself. At this time, Hintemeyer noticed a knife in a leather scabbard on the coffee table in front of appellant. He then asked appellant to come outside with him where he informed him that he was under arrest. As a result of these occurrences, certain items of appellant’s clothing as well as the knife were seized as evidence.</p>

    <p id="b616-4" data-blocks='[["BL_616.4",616,[195,671,1158,854]]]'>There are admittedly some similarities between the <em>Garvin </em>and <em>Smith </em>cases and the instant case such as the use of hearsay information as part of the basis for probable cause to arrest. However, there are also some important, and we think controlling, points of distinction. Unlike the <em>Garvin </em>and <em>Smith </em>situations, the direct source of police information in the instant case was not an anonymous informer. Rather, he was a named private citizen who, incidentally, was a former policeman. Moreover, while Hopson had not witnessed the stabbing itself, he had personally observed the argument in the bar which immediately preceded the stabbing. Finally, both the “informer,” Mr. Hopson, and one of his “sources,” Mrs. Paul, were known by name to the police at the time the order to pick up appellant was issued.</p>

Those circumstances, basically known as the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, were explained by this Court in <em>Betrand Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/451/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="451 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="1948584" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0381-01">451 Pa. 381</a>, 385, <a href="/citations/?q=303%20A.2d%20486" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="303 A.2d 486">303 A.2d 486</a>, 488-89 (1973): “It is also well settled that even hearsay information is sometimes sufficient to establish probable cause. See Draper v.

First, in order to assure that the tip is not merely an unsupported rumor, the officer must know <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>the underlying circumstances from which the informer concluded that the suspect participated in the robbery. Second, in order to reduce the possibility that a tip meeting the first standard is merely a well-constructed fabrication, the officer must have some reasonable basis for concluding that the source of the tip was reliable. Spinelli v. United States, <a href="/us/393/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="393 U.S. 410" data-case-ids="11317375" data-case-paths="/us/393/0410-01">393 U.S. 410</a>, <a href="/us/393/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="393 U.S. 410" data-case-ids="11317375" data-case-paths="/us/393/0410-01">89 S.

The “underlying circumstances” aspect is satisfied by the facts (1) that Hopson had personally observed an argument between appellant and the victim just prior to the stabbing, (2) that the rest of Hopson’s information was based on named eyewitness accounts of the crime itself, and (3) that this “tip” was subsequently corroborated to some extent just prior to the arrest when Officer Hintemeyer observed the knife on the coffee table in front of appellant. As to the reliability of the source of the information, there is no question that Hopson’s status as a retired policeman provided a “reasonable basis” for concluding that he was a reliable source. Having concluded that there was probable cause to arrest appellant, we now confront appellant’s argument relating to an alleged illegal search.</p>

Once Officer Hintemeyer was inside, appellant, the knife, and certain items of appellant’s clothing which were subsequently seized were in plain view. Since his entry into the house was legitimized by the owner’s invitation, and thus by her consent, his subsequent seizure of the evidence in question was also proper. As stated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Coolidge v. New </em>Hampshire, <a href="/us/403/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="403 U.S. 443" data-case-ids="12027286" data-case-paths="/us/403/0443-01">403 U.S. 443</a>, 465 (1971) : “Where the initial intrusion that brings the police within plain view of such an article is supported, not by a warrant, but by one of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement, the seizure is also legitimate. Thus the police may inadvertently come across evidence while in ‘hot pursuit’ of a fleeing suspect. Warden v. Hayden, supra; cf. Hester v. United States, <a href="/us/265/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="265 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="6137218" data-case-paths="/us/265/0057-01">265 U.S. 57</a>. And an object that comes into view during a search incident to arrest that is appropriately limited in scope under existing law may be seized without a warrant. Chimel v. California, 395 U.S., at 762-763. Finally, the ‘plain view’ doctrine has been applied where a police officer is not searching for evidence against the accused, but nonetheless inadvertently comes across an incriminating object. Harris v. United States, <a href="/us/390/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="390 U.S. 234" data-case-ids="6169464" data-case-paths="/us/390/0234-01">390 U.S. 234</a>; Frazier v.

Jennings, </em><a href="/pa/442/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="442 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="1935341" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0018-01">442 Pa. 18</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=274%20A.2d%20767" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="274 A.2d 767">274 A.2d 767</a> (1971), and <em>Commonwealth v.

We find this doctrine wholly inapplicable to the present situation. The doctrine of basic and fundamental error has been held to apply only in those limited situations where the alleged error in the charge “affects the merits or justice of the case or . . . offends against the fundamentals of a fair and impartial trial.” <em>Commonwealth v. Jennings, </em><a href="/pa/442/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="442 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="1935341" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0018-01">442 Pa. at 25</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=274%20A.2d%20767" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="274 A.2d 767">274 A. 2d at 770</a> (1971). In the present case, the only evidence even remotely supporting a theory of voluntary manslaughter is that appellant and the victim were engaged in an argument over three dollars which the victim owed appellant. This disagreement ultimately led to the stabbing of the deceased. There was no evidence that the victim pro-voiced appellant’s wrath in any way except by his failure or inability to repay the loan. We cannot perceive any factual basis in this situation for a finding of legally adequate provocation. <em>See Commonwealth v. Pavillard, </em><a href="/pa/421/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="421 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1900334" data-case-paths="/pa/421/0571-01">421 Pa. 571</a>, 575, <a href="/citations/?q=220%20A.2d%20807" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="220 A.2d 807">220 A.2d 807</a>, 810 (1966). Even under the new Crimes Code definition of “serious provocation,” which is required as an element of voluntary manslaughter,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the circumstances of the instant slaying would not qualify. “Serious provocation” is “[cjonduct sufficient to excite an intense passion in a reasonable person.” Act of December 6,1972, P. L. 1482, No. 334, §1, 18 Pa.C.S. §2301. The refusal to pay a small debt could hardly be viewed as such conduct. Thus, under either standard, there was insufficient evidence of legally sufficient provocation. In any event, we certainly cannot view the trial court’s failure to <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>give an instruction, ou voluntary manslaughter as basic and fundamental error, if indeed it was error at all.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
