There, a barrel of flour fell from a window of defendant’s warehouse, striking a passing pedestrian. Despite his inability to show how or why the barrel rolled out the window, the pedestrian-plaintiff was permitted to recover upon a showing that the defendant was in possession of the warehouse. In effect, the case held merely that both negligence and causation may be established by circumstantial evidence. If the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care, and if the circumstances indicated that the defendant breached that duty causing injuries, the plaintiff, according to Chief Baron Pollock, could recover.

The majority, however, has discarded the cognate doctrines recognized in this Commonwealth of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>and exclusive control without offering any compelling reason for doing so. Additionally, the majority’s resolution of the case is not responsive to the only question properly before the Court, <em>i.e., </em>whether a company which manufactures and services an escalator may be held liable under the theory of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>to a plaintiff who is a passenger on the escalator in the store of the owner-operator.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Furthermore, such a <em>d/rastio </em>departure from long-standing rules of law should only <em>come </em>about following oral argument and the submission of briefs on the advisability of such action.

      <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>Contrary to the assertions of the majority, I believe that the Pennsylvania doctrines of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>and exclusive control are based on appropriate evidentiary concerns and the distinctions between the two are related to the functional question of the probative value of the circumstantial evidence under the conditions in which the application of each doctrine is appropriate. In order for the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>to become applicable in Pennsylvania three conditions must co-exist: (1) the defendant must owe to the plaintiff a duty of the highest degree of care; (2) the instrumentality which caused the accident must be within the exclusive control of the defendant; and (3) the occurrence must be something which ordinarily would not happen if the defendant had exercised the high degree of care which the law imposed upon him. <em>See generally </em>2 G. Henry, Pennsylvania Evidence §675 (1953). The effect of the application of this doctrine is to create a rebuttable <em>presumption </em>of liability on the defendant and to shift the <em>burden of proof </em>to the defendant to establish that the accident occurred notwithstanding his exercise of due care. <em>Norris v.

The procedural effect of this doctrine is to raise an <em>inference </em>of negligence and to shift to the defendant the burden of going forward with the evidence, thus taking all such cases to the jury. Aside from the fact that the doctrine of exclusive control is not limited in application to those cases in which the defendant owes a duty of the highest degree of care, the practical distinction between the two doctrines applied in Pennsylvania is that <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>gives rise to a factual <em>presumption </em>of negligence from the mere occurrence of an accident, whereas the exclusive control rule gives rise to an <em>inference </em>of negligence, not from the accident itself, but from the circumstances <em>under </em>which the injury occurred.

The distinctions which have given rise to two separate doctrines in Pennsylvania developed not as a result of confusion by the courts, but from the recognition that the probative force of the circumstantial evidence is stronger in cases involving common carriers where the issue is slight negligence than in <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>cases where ordinary negligence is the controlling substantive standard.</p>

Philadelphia Electric Co., </em><a href="/pa/334/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="140" data-cite="334 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="1190750" data-case-paths="/pa/334/0161-01">334 Pa. 161</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20114" class="citation" data-index="141" data-cite="5 A.2d 114">5 A.2d 114</a> (1939). I am in complete accord with this salutary policy. Whether we speak in terms of degrees of negligence or not, human experience supports different treatment where a different duty is owed. Nor is a plaintiff prejudiced by such different treatment, but rather he is benefited. The doctrine of exclusive control remains available against tortfeasors not owing a duty of the highest degree of care, and in the majority of jurisdictions which do not distinguish in the application of their res ipsa loquitur doctrines an <em>inference </em>of negligence is permitted against all, but a <em>presumption </em>is permitted against none. Clearly a plaintiff in Pennsylvania is already in a favored position. Additionally, in the instant case, the plaintiff did have the benefit of the application of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>against one defendant.</p>

The purpose of the requirement of exclusive control in both the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>and exclusive control doctrines is that for either doctrine to be operative against a defendant, the plaintiff must affirmatively eliminate all other likely causes of the accident and other likely responsible persons. Proof that a defendant was in exclusive control of the instrumentality causing injury is thus sufficient to allow the doctrine to apply against that defendant, <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>assuming the other conditions are met. Although it is by no means clear, I agree with the Superior Court that our law permits a charge on joint exclusive control in the case of two or more defendants. Such a charge is limited in Pennsylvania, however, to those situations where the control of one defendant is attributable to the other.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Thus, in the present situation, assuming a proper charge, the jury could have found both Otis Elevator and Korvette’s liable <em>only </em>if they found that Otis Elevator was in exclusive control.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

In addition, the cases cited in support of the statement are not really pertinent In <em>Bollin v.

This case involved an action against a store owner and a manufacturer in an exploding bottle case. <em>Res ipsa loquitur </em>was not applicable to the case and to the extent that there was loose language to the contrary, it should be disregarded. In regard to the doctrine of exclusive control, the Court found that its application would allow the ease <em>to go to the jury </em>against <em>both </em>defendants. With this ruling I fully agree. Only by inference, however, can it be said that the Court, by dicta, indicated that a <em>verdict </em>returned against <em>both defendants </em>would be sanctioned where the only negligence was that inferred from the application of the doctrine. Such an inference cannot be abided. A showing that one of two defendants was in exclusive control is insufficient. <em>E.g., Fix v. Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Co., </em><a href="/pa/346/0598-01" class="citation" data-index="146" data-cite="346 Pa. 598" data-case-ids="1216449" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0598-01">346 Pa. 598</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20A.2d%20114" class="citation" data-index="147" data-cite="31 A.2d 114">31 A.2d 114</a> (1943). A verdict against defendants based on either exclusive control or <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>where the control of one is not attributable to the other indicates that <em>neither </em>is in exclusive control and is under those circumstances an unacceptable verdict.</p>
