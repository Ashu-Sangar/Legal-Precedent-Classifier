However, these forms reported no new tax liability<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> for the appellee because Albacore asserts it did not increase, in any of these years, the capital it employed in this Commonwealth beyond the $860,-614.57 figure it reported in 1959. None of these returns considered the existing unassumed mortgage on the Packard Building to be part of the appellee’s capital employed wholly within this Commonwealth.</p>

Once again, this report stated: that the appellee did not increase the capital it utilized in the Commonwealth during the taxing years; and, that it did not consider the unassumed mortgage to be part of its employed capital. However, the Commonwealth, in its settlement, found that the appellee did increase its capital by the amount of $1,226,603 during this final taxing period.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

However, this petition for resettlement was rejected. Albacore filed a timely Petition for Review with the Pennsylvania Board of Finance &amp; Revenue, which was denied after a hearing on the matter.</p>

Therefore, it was unnecessary to resolve the question of whether or not the unassumed mortgage should have properly been considered as part of Albacore’s capital employed wholly within Pennsylvania.

We are not here dealing with a case of estoppel; we are dealing with a Statute of Limitations which can and does bar the Commonwealth from pursuing prior tax obligations.</p>

It is trying to resettle the appellee’s 1959 tax return six years after the return had been filed and five years after it had been settled, which action is clearly prevented by Section 1105 of the Fiscal Code, supra. The mortgage to Equitable, if indeed it constituted “capital actually employed wholly within this Commonwealth”, is not something which was first employed in 1965, but was utilized in the initial 1959 purchase.</p>
