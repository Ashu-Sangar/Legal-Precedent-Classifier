This present class action was commenced on December 7, 1971, with a complaint filed by eighteen named plaintiffs against seven banking institutions and the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA). All defendants except FNMA filed a preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer. On April 4, 1972, an amended complaint adding eleven plaintiffs was filed against the original and twenty-four additional defendants and all other similarly-situated banking institutions and savings and loan associations in the Pittsburgh area. To this complaint all but six of the thirty-two defendants demurred. A second amended complaint alleging an additional cause of action was filed on May 11, 1972. Again, most of the named defendants filed a single preliminary objection demurring to appellants’ complaints.</p>

Each mortgage and personal bond, it is alleged, contains a provision which requires the mortgagor to pay all taxes and assessments levied on the mortgagor’s real estate, and all fire and casualty insurance premiums on the property. Further, appellants assert they are required to pay each month to appellees one-twelfth of the annual taxes, assessments, and fire and casualty insurance premiums due on their property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Appellants aver that they have made these <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>monthly payments according to the provisions in the mortgage and bond agreements. Appellants further allege that the monthly tax payments were paid to appellees to hold as “trustees or other fiduciary” for appellants.

Appellants finally assert that appellees have failed, and continue to fail, (1) to segregate the monthly tax payments from the general funds in their possession, (2) to apply the monthly tax payments against appellants’ mortgages, and (3) to account to appellants for the interest earned on the monthly payments.</p>

Payments are either held in what are known as real estate and insurance escrow accounts or they are capitalized. The escrow system envisions that the bank establish individual records, credit an account upon receipt of the monthly payment, and debit it when the bank pays taxes to the appropriate authority. The outstanding balance is carried as a liability on the bank’s balance sheet under the caption “Advance Payment by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance.” The funds deposited by mortgagors are freely commingled with the mortgagee’s general funds and used to earn income.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The mortgage agreement expressly granted the mortgagee the right to choose from three options how it would hold the monthly tax payments. The mortgagee chose to use the second option. Mortgagors alleged that the parties’ agreement intended that the tax payments held by the mortgagees under the second option were held in trust. However, the first option specifically provided that the monthly payments were to be held in trust without earnings. The <em>Sears </em>court reasoned that the second option could not reasonably restrict the mortgagee to any greater extent than the first option. Therefore, if the second option was considered a trust, it would be identical in effect to the first, and accordingly deprive the mortgagee of any meaningful contractual choice.

One reason which the majority opinion gives for reversal is “because this Court cannot say with assurance that the trial court considered each mortgage and bond agreement individually when it concluded that appellants could not establish in any circumstance the existence of a trust relationship”. (Opinion of the Court, <em>supra, </em>p. 148; <em>see also </em>notes 12 and 13, and note 10, second paragraph.) The opinion then states that there are substantial differences in the language of the instruments (which the Court apparently considers as properly part of the record),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> and that “these variations may be crucial to the correct assessment of what relationship the parties contemplated”. (Opinion, p. 149.)

The plaintiffs have alleged the payment of so-called escrow funds to defendants, calculated in terms of amounts necessary to pay taxes, assessments and fire insurance premiums applicable to their respective real estate holdings; a commingling of these escrow payments with general funds of the defendants; the receipt by defendants of earnings on those funds; a failure to pay or account to plaintiffs for those earnings; and an appropriation by the defendants of the earnings to their own use, as a result of which they have been unjustly enriched. While the propriety or impropriety of this conduct, like the existence of express trusts, may be in large measure dependent on the terms of the agreements, oral or written, between the parties, the complaint as it stands states a cause of action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_6" id="ref_footnote_3_6">6</a>

I do not express any opinion as to whether, if the agreements were properly made part of the complaint, a cause of action based on breach ot a constructive trust would or would not be stated. As we noted in <em>Schott v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em><a href="/pa/436/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="157" data-cite="436 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="1926076" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0279-01">436 Pa. 279</a>, 290, <a href="/citations/?q=259%20A.2d%20443" class="citation" data-index="158" data-cite="259 A.2d 443">259 A.2d 443</a> (1969), the Court has previously “found the quasieontractual doctrine of unjust enrichment inapplicable when the relationship between the parties is founded on a written agreement or express contract [citations omitted]”. The view expressed in the main text is based on the allegations of the complaint as it now stands.</p>

      <p id="b196-4" data-blocks='[["BL_196.4",196,[174,1041,1155,588]]]'>I also agree that, on remand, the trial court should at an early stage address itself to the class action aspects of this case, and concur in the observations contained in part IV of the Court’s opinion in this regard. I agree with Judge Silvestei of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, in the thorough discussion of class actions in Pennsylvania contained in his opinion in <em>McMonagle v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>122 P. L. J. 107 (1973), that “there should be a determination as early in the proceedings as may be practicable whether an action brought as a class action is to be so maintained”. 122 P. L. J. at 112. Indeed, from the vantage point of hindsight, it would have been helpful in the case at bar had the trial court addressed the class action problems raised by the preliminary objections prior to consideration of the demurrer.</p>
