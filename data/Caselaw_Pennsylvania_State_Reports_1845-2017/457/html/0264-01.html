Pollock, did employ a Warren Kletzien to perform the administration of inhalation, intravenous anesthetics, removal [of] teeth, and suturing of oral tissue on patients in his office, said Warren Kletzien not being duly licensed as a dentist. . . .” Testimony at the hearing came primarily from appellant and from Dr. Theodore Paladino, a dentist who had been in appellant’s employ at the time of the alleged breach of professional conduct. Both men gave testimony which would support the Board’s finding although the number of times Kletzien performed such tasks and the amount of supervision he received during their performance was disputed.</p>

    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.4",298,[158,1106,1163,638]]]'>The doctrine springs from an understandable fear of the chaos that would result from multiple and repetitious suits challenging every action taken by every official whose claim to office could be open to question. “If the question [of right to office] may be raised by one private suitor it may be raised by all, and the administration of justice would under such circumstances prove a failure.” <em>Coyle v.

Such a challenge falls squarely within the <em>de facto </em>doctrine.</p>

There is nothing in the record to support appellant’s claim that Board members had any contact whatsoever with the prosecutor’s file.

Board members are likely to be untrained in the law and, for that reason, the legislature has required the State Department of Justice to review their legal actions. “Before notice of any hearing leading to an adjudication is given, the agency shall submit the matter to its representative in the Department of Justice who shall pass upon the legality of the proposed action or defense. Failure of the agency to submit the matter to the Department of Justice shall not invalidate any adjudication.” Administrative Agency Law, Act of June 4, 1945, P.

While the delay in this case is sufficient to trigger an inquiry into the potential for prejudice to appellant, it appears that appellant has cited no specific examples of prejudice (e.g., dead or missing witnesses or stale recollection by witnesses). While we do not condone a delay of this magnitude, we cannot say that appellant was denied due process because he has alleged no harm that resulted therefrom.</p>
