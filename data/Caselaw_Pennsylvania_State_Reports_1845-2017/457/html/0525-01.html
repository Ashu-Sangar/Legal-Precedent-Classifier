The principal question presented herein involves an interpretation of Section 311(1) of the Adoption Act of 1970: <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>to perform parental duties alone, without evidence of a settled purpose to relinquish parental claim, was insufficient to support an involuntary termination of rights. In so doing, however, we believe the court erred. The facts underlying this action are as follows:</p>

Mr. Cassen accepted the child, but the development of certain emotional problems in his household soon caused him to turn the child over to the appellant agency. Meanwhile, Mrs. Cassen had departed to England in order to pursue a course of study in scientology.</p>

However, in the present statute these former “elements” stand as separate, independent bases for the termination of parental rights and this Court has previously construed them as such.

While we noted in <em>Wolfe Adoption Case, supra, </em>that a parent need not always personally care for a child if the parent makes “reasonable arrangements” for the “temporary” care of the child, the present situation would not constitute the making of such reasonable temporary arrangements. Mrs. Cassen could hardly be credited with the arrangements which were in fact made for Lumiere. Moreover, there is serious question whether the placing of a child with a public welfare agency should be considered as the type of arrangement which would preserve a parent’s claim to the child. It is necessary for us to remand this case to the court <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>below for consideration of several questions which were not specifically reached in its determination, namely: (1) whether the appellee failed or refused to perform parental duties; and (2) if so, whether her parental rights in the child should be terminated.</p>
