Several weeks prior to the October 23 public sale, Robert F. Keener, an employee of the Lancaster Redevelopment Authority, went to the tax claim bureau. Evidently, there had been some discussion between the Authority and First Federal concerning the purchase of the property in question. At the tax bureau, Keener “asked for the list of the tax sale that was coming up,” without specifying the list for any particular date. The clerk handed Keener the sale list for October 30, 1971. Keener examined the list and discovered that this particular property was not there listed for sale.</p>

But the maxim invoked is narrow indeed. As the eminent authority on equity jurisprudence relied on in the Court’s opinion states, “[t]he maxim is, in truth, operative only within a very narrow range; to raise it to the position of a general principle would be a palpable error. Throughout the great mass of its jurisprudence, equity, instead of following the law, either ignores or openly disregards and opposes the law.” 2 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence 194, §427 (5th ed. Symons, 1941).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> Had <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>the chancellor in this case merely been defining the rights of the parties under the Real Estate Tax Sale Law, he would perforce be confined to the provisions of that statute. But it is equally clear that a chancellor is free to provide traditional equitable remedies with respect to matters not covered by a statute. <em>See </em>2 J. Pomeroy, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>§426a at 193. Here the statute treats of challenges to the regularity and legality of the actions of the Tax Claim Bureau (72 P.S. §5860.-607g), but those matters are not in dispute. What is in dispute, as mentioned at the outset, is the validity of the sale in light of the gross disparity between purchase price and value. With that matter the statute does not purport to deal in any way. I, thus, cannot agree that the Real Estate Tax Sale Law operates to oust equity of jurisdiction which traditionally has been within its cognizance. <em>See Capozzi v.
