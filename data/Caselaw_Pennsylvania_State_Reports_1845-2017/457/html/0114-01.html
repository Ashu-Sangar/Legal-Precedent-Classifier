Greenfield insofar as it involves disposition of a substantial portion of a valuable collection of art, assembled by Mr. Greenfield during his lifetime. The collection, formed with the <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>assistance of Mrs. Greenfield, consists of sixty-six paintings and other art objects, including works by Chagall, Corot, deKooning, Giacometti, Ingres, Klee, Matisse, Miro, Picasso, Pollock, and Degas. At the time of Mr. Greenfield’s death, the collection was appraised at $447,420.

The greater number of pieces, but the lesser portion in terms of aggregate appraised value ($108,470), were owned directly by the testator; the remainder, lesser in number but greater in terms of appraised value ($338,950), were owned by a corporation named the Elizabeth <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>Realty Company, a personal holding company controlled by Mr. Greenfield.</p>

    <p id="b147-5" data-blocks='[["BL_147.5",147,[157,878,1154,965]]]'>The company was incorporated in 1929, and was engaged in the real estate and insurance brokerage business under the name of Albert M. Greenfield and Company until 1956. In that year, the company sold its brokerage business and changed its name to the Elizabeth Realty Company. From that time on, it served as a repository for Mr. Greenfield’s personal investments. Aside from the art objects in question, the assets of the company consisted of various parcels of real estate and securities, principally municipal bonds and stocks. Mr. Greenfield had given 100 shares of the company’s common stock to his wife; he retained the remaining 2,589 shares in his own name.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> These shares were valued at 111,360,314.68 in the inventory filed by his executors.

    <p id="b149-4" data-blocks='[["BL_149.4",149,[159,442,1152,967]]]'>The word “my” is frequently used to denote dominion and control as well as legal title. People normally speak of “my car,” even though title to the automobile resides in a finance company or rental agency; “my chair” or “my seat” when the furniture in question belongs to their host, their employer, or a common carrier; “my house” when the property is leased. The court en banc recognized this fact of every-day usage, but, reading the will as a whole, it concluded that when the testator spoke of “my prints, etchings, drawings, painting and sculpture, and any other works of art, as were acquired during our marriage,” he meant to refer to only those parts of his collection which were titled in his own name. We agree that the testator’s intent must be gathered from the whole will, but our reading of that document points us to the opposite conclusion from that reached by the court below.</p>

The will, covering forty-two typewritten pages and augmented by codicils, makes a number of bequests, both outright and in trust, including a series of residuary trusts for the benefit of the testator’s children. The only mention of the art collection occurs in paragraph six, which provides for specific bequests of various items of tangible personal property, including the art collection. Thirteen pages of the will are devoted to the powers vested in the testator’s executors and trustees. These detailed instructions contain no hint that the trustees were expected to hold or dispose of part of Mr. Greenfield’s art collection.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Considering the testamentary scheme as a whole, we think it unlikely in the extreme that Mr. Greenfield, who was manifestly proud of his collection and aware of its cultural value, would have made no mention whatever of the most valuable part of it. We deem it far more probable that the testator considered that he had disposed <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>of the entire collection by tbe life estate and gift in remainder provided for in paragraph six of the will.</p>

Our review of this evidence confirms us in our belief that Mr. Greenfield intended that the entire art collection pass under paragraph six of his will to The Philadelphia Museum of Art, or some other similar institution designated by his wife.</p>

No plaques or other markings distinguished the company’s art works from the rest of the collection.

Greenfield.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Among family and friends, Mr. Greenfield commonly referred to the paintings and other art objects as his own.

    <p id="b152-4" data-blocks='[["BL_152.4",152,[181,1027,1161,973]],["BL_153.1",153,[148,320,1152,308]]]'>Elizabeth Realty was little more than an alter ego for handling the testator’s personal financial affairs. Each morning Mr. Greenfield was presented with a statement of the cash balances in his personal bank accounts and in the accounts of his various companies. Whether a painting bought on a given day was acquired in his own name or that of the Elizabeth Realty Company depended upon the fortuitous circumstance of which account had the largest current balance. The will specifically authorizes the executors to liquidate any business concern in which the testator was interested. It was natural for Mr. Greenfield to assume that the assets of the Elizabeth Realty Company would pass into the hands of his executors, and that they would treat these paintings and other art objects in the same manner that he had treated them throughout his life: as his own personal property. His scrivener, who did not know that part of the art collection belonged to <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>the company rather than to Mr. Greenfield personally, had no reason to caution him otherwise.

The question appears to be one of first impression in this Commonwealth; however, as appellee concedes, courts in other jurisdictions which have confronted this question have generally concluded that, if no rights of creditors or other persons interested in the corporations are jeopardized, the testator’s intent should be honored.

By the time Mr. and Mrs. Greenfield began to assemble their art collection, the company had ceased to be actively engaged in business.
