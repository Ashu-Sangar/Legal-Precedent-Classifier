If he does not survive me I give such property to his then living issue in equal shares, per stirpes.” Under Paragraph Ninth of the will the residue of the estate is given to decedent’s other nephew, C.

Section 711 of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code of July 1, 1972, 20 Pa.C.S. §711, provides in Subsection (17), entitled “Mandatory exercise of jurisdiction through orphans’ court division in general,” that Orphans’ Courts <em>must </em>entertain and resolve questions concerning: “The adjudication of the title to personal property in the possession of the personal representative, or registered in the name of the decedent or his nominee, or alleged by the personal representative to have been in the possession of the decedent at the time of his death.” In construing essentially identical provisions of the now repealed Orphans’ Court Act of August 10, 1951, P. L. 1163 (repealed 1972), this Court has consistently held that an Orphans’ Court is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate the ownership of personalty registered in the name of a decedent at the time of his death, whether in his name alone or in the name of other persons and/or the decedent. <em>Stevenson v.
