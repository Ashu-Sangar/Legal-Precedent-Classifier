Takiff, a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, on his own motion, charged the regularly summoned grand jury for the January, 1974 session of the Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Trial Division, of Philadelphia, to investigate official corruption in the City of Philadelphia, specifically within the city government, as well as state and local enforcement agencies. Subsequently, the Honorable Israel Packel, Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, filed a petition in this Court requesting that we enter a declaratory judgment pursuant to the provisions of the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, Act of June 18, 1923, P. L. 840, as amended, 12 P.S. §831 et seq., “determining the validity or invalidity of the grand jury.” Contemporaneously, the Attorney General filed a second petition in this Court asking that we assume original jurisdiction of the petition seeking declaratory judgment under the authority given in Sections 2 and 10(a) <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>of Article Y of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and Section (1) of the Schedule to Judiciary Article, Sched. Art. V, §1, of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and by the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, P. L. 673, No. 223, art. II, §205, 17 P.S. §211.205 (Supp. 1974).</p>
    <p id="b46-5" data-blocks='[["BL_46.4",46,[163,650,1156,919]]]'>In the petition seeking a declaratory judgment, the Attorney General calls our attention to the action of Judge Takiff in charging the grand jury, as before related, and asserts: (1) that the District Attorney of Philadelphia has failed and refused to comply with an order of Judge Takiff “to attend the grand jury and to forthwith perform all duties and responsibilities in connection therewith;” (2) that as Attorney General he has been requested by the Honorable D. Donald Jamieson, President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, “to supply a special attorney or attorneys to act in lieu of the district attorney” in attending the grand jury, and that in “the interests of justice and of conservation of money and energies” he is reluctant to honor Judge Jamieson’s request until the validity or invalidity of the grand jury is determined by this Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
