Motions for a new trial were argued and denied. This direct appeal followed. The evidence presented at trial indicated that the victim was shot approximately nineteen times by a .22 caliber rifle apparently while he was sleeping in a locked motor vehicle. The Commonwealth established that the rifle <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>which fired the shots causing death had been in the possession of the appellant on the morning of the day of the murder. In addition, the appellant admitted to a witness, Ms. Carolyn Hendrickson, that he in fact had shot and killed the deceased.

And it is a familiar application of the doctrine that under an indictment charging murder in the common law form the defendant may be convicted of any of the grades of culpable homicide. . . . That the crime under the law and facts ought to be fixed at a higher grade or degree does not affect the application of the rule. It is deemed to be wholly within the province of the jury to fix the punishment; and even though the evidence may fully disclose that the defendant was guilty of a higher degree than that found against him still the verdict cannot be disturbed for that reason. The courts recognize that it is not an uncommon thing for a jury, out of sympathy, or what they conceive to be extenuating circumstances, to find a defendant guilty of a lower degree or grade of offense than that of which the evidence clearly convicts him; but the fact that they do so is not a ground of reversal of the verdict and judgment. Accordingly, the jury under <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>an indictment of murder may find a verdict for [voluntary] manslaughter.” 13 Ruling Case Law §65.

Not only was the jury empowered to return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter under a murder indictment where the evidence suggested the presence of provocation and passion but also the power existed where these elements are absent. If we were to confine our analysis to the application of the doctrine of lesser included offenses it could be argued, in keeping with the common law concept, that the essence of the crime of voluntary manslaughter is the killing and the passion and provocation the manner of it. Under this concept voluntary manslaughter in all cases would be properly considered a lesser included offense. If in the alternative it is to be considered a lesser included offense only where the testimony suggests the presence of provocation and passion, such a construction would ignore the power of the jury to return the manslaughter verdict in the absence of those elements. To accept the latter paradigm is to ignore the historically recognized mercy dispensing power without reason or justification. Thus, the use of the doctrine of lesser included offenses fails to supply an answer to the ultimate question: whether the jury should be advised of a power it is recognized to possess.</p>

Osborne, supra, Commonwealth v. Coyle, supra. </em>Clearly it was never intended that the question turn upon the knowledge of the officers but rather the reasons which motivated the flight. It is sufficient under this doctrine that the circumstances justify an inference that the accused actions were motivated as a result of his belief that the officers were aware of his wrongdoing and were seeking him for that purpose.</p>

While the officers attempted to arrest him only for assault and battery and disorderly conduct, in view of appellant’s effort to avoid the service which included a twenty mile chase and firing at the officers in pursuit, a reasonable inference could be drawn that appellant was under the belief that he was being pur<a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>sued for the more serious charge of murder. This is further corroborated by the fact that appellant (1) had previously admitted the murder to his girl friend, and (2) responded “is that all” when told by the police, upon apprehension after the flight, that they had a warrant against him for assault and battery.

To establish appellant’s guilt, the Commonwealth proved that the victim was shot nineteen times with the rifle which appellant had in his possession on the day of the murder and which was found in appellant’s automobile after his flight from the police. Moreover, appellant admitted to the witness, Carolyn Hendrickson, that he had shot the victim.
