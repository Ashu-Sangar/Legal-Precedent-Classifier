It sought to restrain appellants from congregating in the public streets of the City of Philadelphia at the points where Bath Street and Richmond Street intersect with Orthodox Street. It was alleged in the complaint that the congregating at this location prevented the use of Orthodox Street, and thus deprived plaintiffs of the only means of ingress and egress to their property. Affidavits attached to the complaint established that a complete shut-down of plaintiff’s plant was threatened as a result of defendants’ actions. On the same day the complaint was filed, the lower court entered the following <em>ecu pa/rte </em>decree:</p>

R. C. P. 1531(a) in that appellants received no notice of appellees’ complaint, nor was there any allegation in the complaint or supporting affidavits, nor any finding by the court that irreparable injury would be sustained before notice could be given. Rule 1531(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure specifically provides: “A court shall issue a preliminary or special injunction <em>only after written notice </em>

Both the United States Supreme Court and this Court have repeatedly condemned the <em>ex parte </em>issuance, without notice, of preliminary injunctions “where no showing is made that it is impossible to serve or to notify the opposing parties and to give them an opportunity to participate”. <em>Carroll v.

    <p id="b214-5" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[174,1634,1158,581]]]'>To invalidate the <em>ex parte </em>decree, however, does not dispose of this case, for it is the decree of September 25, 1972, entered after a hearing at which all parties were present, which now restrains appellants. The validity of that decree, which continued in effect the decree of September 20th, is challenged on two grounds: first, that appellants were denied due process at the September 25th hearing when the court refused to hear evidence from the defense, and, second, that the scope of the decree was unconstitutionally vague and over-broad.</p>
    <p id="b214-6" data-blocks='[["BL_214.6",214,[176,2233,1153,100]],["BL_215.1",215,[157,329,1149,581]]]'>At the hearing, appellants sought to offer evidence in support of a proposed counterclaim to the complaint, <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>which they had not yet filed, in which they would seek to enjoin plaintiffs’ allegedly unlawful and unreasonable use of the streets which appellants had blockaded in protest of such use. The issue of the illegality of appellees’ use of the streets was not then before the court. The proffered evidence was irrelevant to the issues which were properly before the court, and we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s refusal to allow the evidence to be introduced, nor in its refusal to continue the hearing until the counterclaim could be filed.</p>
    <p id="b215-3" data-blocks='[["BL_215.4",215,[157,931,1149,744]]]'>We must agree with appellants, however, that the injunction is unconstitutionally overbroad, insofar as it restrains advocacy by appellants of what they believe to be their cause. There was no evidence that immediate or irreparable harm would result to the appellees from appellants’ advocacy of anything, nor any evidence that the appellants had advocated or intended to advocate the doing of any act prohibited by the injunction. Under these circumstances, no interference with the appellants’ freedom of speech was necessary or proper. It follows that the terms of the injunction as continued by the decree of September 25, 1972 must be modified by deletion of the words “or advocating any act”.</p>
