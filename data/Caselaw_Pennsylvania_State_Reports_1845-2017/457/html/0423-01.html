In this case, the officer had a description of the assailants, albeit an extremely general one. He knew the direction of their flight, and the fact that they were on foot.

In that case, the Commonwealth had conceded the absence of probable cause and attempted to justify the stop and subsequent search on the basis of <em>Terry v.

In <em>Berrios </em>there was a time lapse of 20 minutes from the time of the receipt of the information to the time that the officers came upon the suspects. Further, there was nothing about the action of those two individuals when seen by the officers that would suggest that they were two of the men who were being sought other than the fact of their race. <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>In this case, moments after the incident and the chase that ensued, this appellant was seen approximately two blocks from the point where he eluded his original pursuers, acting as if he were being chased and having a physical appearance of one who had been running. These facts, coupled with his physical appearance which conformed to the original description, provided adequate basis for the officer to reasonably believe that appellant was one of the perpetrators of the crime. We therefore conclude that the arrest was legal and that the ammunition clip seized incident thereto was admissible at trial. Since we find that appellant’s arrest was legal, appellant’s complaint that the confession should have been suppressed as a product of an illegal arrest necessarily must fail.</p>

From 10:40 P.M. to 1:05 A.M., appellant was again warned, and his formal statement was transcribed, typed and signed. In that statement, he again waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and admitted his involvement in the crime.</p>

He testified that he was seventeen and that he had only completed the seventh grade after being expelled from a parochial school. While this fact alone would not invalidate the confession of one who has reached the age of seventeen, it is a factor to be considered. <em>Commonwealth v. Fogan, </em><a href="/pa/449/0552-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="449 Pa. 552" data-case-ids="1945680" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0552-01">449 Pa. 552</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20755" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="296 A.2d 755">296 A.2d 755</a> (1972). Appellant also stated that he had been drinking heavily the morning of his arrest. Again, intoxication is a factor to be considered, but it is not sufficient, in and of itself to render the confession involun<a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>tary. <em>Commonwealth v.

Other facts cited by appellant are: (1) That he was sleepy; (2) that he appeared sloppy and disheveled and (3) that he was hungry. The Commonwealth countered such evidence with testimony of Officer Thompson that although appellant had a faint odor of alcohol, he did not appear intoxicated. Two other officers testified that appellant appeared alert and responsive. He told Detective McCauley that he had slept eight hours the night before his arrest and he did not complain of being tired. He admitted eating doughnuts shortly before the incident and his meal was ordered around 7:00 P.M. Although there was a mistake that delayed the meal until 11:00 P.M., there was no indication that the police deliberately withheld the meal as a device to induce the confession nor is there any suggestion that the absence of food weakened his will.</p>
    <p id="b463-4" data-blocks='[["BL_463.4",463,[194,1255,1151,920]]]'>Appellant also points to the fact that his relatives were not notified of his arrest. There was testimony that police officers visited appellant’s home to speak with his family and found his grandfather who was crippled and his sister who was intoxicated. Neither relative was in a position to give appellant assistance. Appellant complains that officers did not comply with his request to notify his aunt of his arrest, however the officers denied that any such request was made. Appellant suggests that he was promised that he could go home if he confessed and that he was threatened with physical harm if he did not. The Commonwealth’s evidence categorically denied that any threats or promises were made nor can we accept that the accused could have been misled by the alleged ruse of telling him that if he confessed to participation in a robbery-murder they would release him.</p>

We agree with appellant that there is substantial basis on this record justifying the conclusion that the interrogating officers may have deceived appellant into believing that a co-defendant had implicated him where such was not the case. In judging whether the use of artifice, deception or fraud will invalidate a confession, we must look to the basic rationale behind the exclusion of coerced confessions. Courts will, of course, invalidate confessions resulting from a subterfuge that is likely to produce an untrustworthy confession. <em>United States ex rel. Caminito v.

However, in the case at bar, we are dealing not with a misrepresentation of rights, but with a misrepresentation concerning the amount of evidence against the accused. While we emphasize that we do not condone deliberate misrepresentation of facts supplied to an accused at a time when he must elect to waive a Constitutional right, we do not believe that a misrepresentation, even though intentional, as to the evidence available against him is the type of information that would so distort the factual situation confronting him as to render his waiver unknowing and unintelligent.</p>
