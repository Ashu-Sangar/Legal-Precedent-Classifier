Clark, </em><a href="/pa/411/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="411 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="1885972" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0142-01">411 Pa. 142</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.2d%20441" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="190 A.2d 441">190 A.2d 441</a> (1963). I conclude that the declaration by the Legislature that the Board may be guilty of permitting the sale of liquor to “habitual drunkards” is a mani<a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>festation of its consent to be sued for violations. “What possible reason could tbe Legislature have bad in specifically (in Section 493(1)) making it unlawful for tbe Board to sell liquor to minors, if it wasn’t indicating its legislative intent that tbis was sucb an important matter of public policy that it (The Board) could be held Bable for sucb an unlawful act? How can it be said that tbis provision is intended to be solely related to criminal law? How does the Commonwealth fine or put itself (its board) in jail for a violation? If tbe sovereign can do&lt; no wrong, bow can it violate Section 493(1) of the Code, even criminally? Why mention tbe Board at all, if more than a crime wasn’t intended? By tbe manner in which tbis prohibition is set forth in tbe Code, I can find authorization to sue tbe Board if as a result of doing sucb an unlawful act [a statutorily protected person is injured].” <em>Biello v.

It operates a vast wholesale and retail operation that in most states is performed by private enterprise. It seems particularly outrageous to me that people lose their right to be compensated for injuries done them because tbe Commonwealth has appropriated to itself a segment of tbe economy. Surely if tbe Commonwealth wishes to enjoy tbe profits of enterprise it must suffer tbe liabiBties as well. See <em>Thomas v.
