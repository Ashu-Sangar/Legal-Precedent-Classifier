The warning requirement, which appellees urged for the first time on appeal, would be an unprecedented and illogical procedural burden to impose upon an investigating grand jury.

Counsel then asked that appellees be allowed to leave the grand jury room during the course of examination if they required advice whether they should answer a particular question or claim the privilege against self-incrimination. Although this motion was also denied, Judge Sloane then did advise appellees: “Each one of you has a right to have a lawyer, you have a right to consult with him, advise with him, be guided by him. Every aspect of the relationship between lawyer and client must be respected by everybody. And you have a right to confide in your lawyer after you come out of the grand jury room. After you come out of the grand jury room, you have a right to place full confidence in your lawyer — but in no one else. During the time that you are in the grand jury room, you do not have a lawyer with you.

Neither does a witness have the right to have his attorney present during his grand jury appearance.” In rejecting appellees’ attack on their indictment, the majority implicitly holds that a witness before an investigating grand jury need not be given the right to leave the grand jury room during the course of questioning to obtain counsel’s advice in deciding to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination. I believe the majority’s position is violative of the protection intended to be afforded under the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

In Ms instructions to the appellees immediately before their appearance, Judge Sloan assured them: “Each one of you has a right to have a lawyer, you have a right to consult with him, advise with Mm, be guided by him.” In my view, however, after recognizing the right of counsel, the court proceeded to proscribe such limitations on the right to confer with that counsel, that the protection was rendered illusory.

I must assume that under the above rule both the witness and his counsel are entitled to a transcript of at least the witness’s own testimony before the grand jury. In light of that rule, it would be totally unjustified to withhold counsel from the grand jury room on a pretext of secrecy.
