        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Manderino,\nThe appellant, Harold S. Baker, brought an action under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, Act of May 21,1921, P. L. 1045, No. 379, \u00a7\u00a71-13, 39 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7351-63, seeking to set aside certain conveyances made by the appellee Minnie E. Geist, to her niece, appellee Hannah M. Tussey. The trial court refused to set aside the conveyances and this appeal followed.\nThe appellant and appellee Geist were involved in an automobile collision on September 21, 1968. Between September 4, 1969, and October 16, 1969, tbe appellant\u2019s attorney sent two letters to appellee Geist and two letters to her attorney. In those letters tbe appellant\u2019s attorney notified appellee Geist of tbe appellant\u2019s claim for damages for tbe injuries wbicb were sustained by tbe appellant as a result of tbe negligent conduct of appellee Geist on September 21, 1968. In tbe letters, appellee Geist was notified that ber personal assets would be necessary to \u201ccover tbe gap between [ber] insurance coverage [$10,000] and tbe amount necessary to settle [tbe] claim.\u201d Appellee Geist was informed that tbe appellant\u2019s damages were already close to $17,000 since appellant bad lost approximately $7,800 in earnings and incurred hospital and doctor bills of about $9,000. Appellant\u2019s attorney suggested a settlement whereby appellee Geist, who was a widow without children, would convey her home to appellant with a life estate reserved to appellee Geist. Appellant\u2019s attorney wrote in one letter \u201cThis would insure that your client [appellee Geist] would have a roof over ber bead for tbe balance of ber life and would have no further expenses [than] ber usual household expenses and taxes.\u201d Appellant\u2019s attorney said further that if the plan was not acceptable, suit would be instituted. Tbe last letter requested an answer no later than October 24, 1969. On that date, appellee Geist, who bad not accepted tbe appellant\u2019s offer, conveyed to ber niece, appellee Tussey, ber home wbicb was worth between $16,500 (appellant\u2019s estimate) and $20,000 (appellee\u2019s estimate). She also conveyed to ber niece approximately $7,000 worth of stock in two savings and loan associations. After these conveyances, appellee Geist\u2019s assets consisted of approximately $2,500 in checking and savings accounts.\nOn November 26, 1969, tbe appellant filed an action in tort against appellee Geist. On April 8, 1970, a jury returned a verdict of $49,200 in favor of tbe appellant against appellee Geist. Appellee Geist did not have sufficient assets to pay the verdict. Appellant then filed an action under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. He alleged that the conveyances made by appellee Geist to her niece on October 24,1969, five months prior to the verdict, were fraudulent as to him as a creditor and should be set aside.\nThe Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act permits a creditor to set aside conveyances if the conveyances are fraudulent as to creditors. Act of May 21, 1921, P. U. 1045, No. 379, \u00a7\u00a79-10, 39 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7359-60. The appellant claims that the conveyances of October 24, 1969, were fraudulent under section 4 of the Act which provides: \u201cEvery conveyance made and every obligation incurred by a person who is or will be thereby rendered insolvent, is fraudulent as to creditors, without regard to his actual intent, if the conveyance is made or the obligation is incurred without a fair consideration.\u201d Act of May 21, 1921, P. L. 1045, No. 379, \u00a74, 39 P.S. \u00a7354.\nThe trial court concluded that the appellant at the time of the conveyances was a creditor of appellee Geist and also found that the conveyances were made without a fair consideration. The trial court concluded, however, that section 4 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act did not apply because appellee Geist was not rendered insolvent by the conveyances on October 24, 1969. The trial court concluded that the appellee Geist was not insolvent on the date of the conveyances because \u201cher liability to [the appellant] was potential at best. . . .\u201d Moreover, according to the trial court, she had assets of approximately $2,500 and a $10,000 liability policy. We cannot agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellee Geist was not insolvent on October 24, 1969.\nInsolvency is defined in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act as follows: \u201cA person is insolvent when the present, fair, salable value of his assets is less than the amount that will be required to pay his probable liability on Ms existing debts as they become absolute and matured.'\u2019'\u2019 Act of May 21, 1921, P. L. 1045, No. 379, \u00a72, 39 P.S. \u00a7352 (emphasis added). The definition refers to debts that will become absolute and matured, not debts that are absolute and matured. Moreover, the word debt is defined in the Act as \u201cany legal liability, whether matured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, absolute, fixed, or contingent.'\u201d Act of May 21, 1921, P. L. 1045, No. 379, \u00a71, 39 P.S. \u00a7351 (emphasis added). An existing debt, therefore, need not be a debt which is matured, liquidated, absolute, or fixed. An existing debt is an existing legal liability, whether matured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, absolute, fixed, or contingent.\nAppellees argue that the words legal liability in the definition of debt mean a liability which exists only after a verdict following a trial. We disagree. The meaning of the words legal liability in the definition of debt becomes clear when we examine the definition of creditor which immediately precedes the definition of debt in the Act. See Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa. S. \u00a71932. The Act defines creditor as \u201ca person having a claim, whether matured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, absolute, fixed, or contingent. Act of May 21, 1921, P. L. 1045, No. 379, \u00a71, 39 P.S. \u00a7351 (emphasis added). A claim precedes a jury verdict. The words legal liability, when read together with the word claim, therefore, cannot mean only liability which exists after a verdict following a trial. In this case, appellant\u2019s claim, and thus appellee Geist\u2019s legal liability, existed on the date of the conveyances, even though a verdict was necessary to enforce that existing legal liability. Appellant was a creditor when the conveyances were made. Appellees\u2019 suggested interpretation of the words legal liability would allow a person to dispute any claim presented, then convey assets and be immune from any action under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. The legislature could not have intended such an unreasonable result. See Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa. S. \u00a71922.\nThe appellees have cited First National Bank v. Hoffines, 429 Pa. 109, 239 A.2d 458 (1968). Hoff mes, however, refused to set aside a conveyance as fraudulent because the plaintiff was not a creditor at the time of the conveyance. Defendant\u2019s liability to the plaintiff arose from defendant\u2019s conduct (execution of a note) which occurred after the conveyance was made. In this case, appellee Geist\u2019s liability was based on her conduct (negligence in the motor vehicle collision) which occurred before the conveyances were made. Appellant, therefore, in this case, was a creditor at the time of the conveyances.\nThe only remaining question is whether appellee Geist\u2019s assets were \u201cless than the amount that would be required to pay [her] probable liability on [her] existing debts as they [become] absolute and matured.\u201d On this issue, appellees had the burden of proof. Farmers Trust Co. v. Bevis, 331 Pa. 89, 200 A. 54 (1938). In considering whether a person is insolvent, the assets to be considered under the Act are those which have a \u201cpresent, fair, salable value.\u201d On October 24, 1964, the \u201cpresent, fair, salable value\u201d of appellee Geist\u2019s assets was approximately $2,500. Even if we assume that the $10,000 liability insurance policy had a \u201cpresent, fair, salable value,\u201d appellee Geist\u2019s assets only totaled approximately $12,500. She did not sustain her burden of proof that these assets were sufficient to pay her probable liability on her existing debt to the appellant. Appellee Geist was therefore rendered insolvent by the conveyances on October 24, 1969.\nUnder section 4 of the Act, appellee Geist\u2019s conveyances of her home and her stocks in two savings and loan associations were fraudulent as to creditors because they rendered her insolvent and were made without a fair consideration. The conveyances must he set aside.\nDecree reversed and the matter remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each party to pay own costs.",
