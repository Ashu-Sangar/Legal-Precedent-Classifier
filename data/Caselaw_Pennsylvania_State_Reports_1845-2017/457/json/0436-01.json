        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Manderino,\nThe appellants, Angelo Weeden and Major Reed, were convicted of murder in the first degree in a joint trial by jury. Post-verdict motions were denied and the appellants were sentenced to life imprisonment. This appeal followed. Four issues which are raised by both appellants will be discussed in the first part of this opinion followed by a consideration of three other issues raised only by the appellant Weeden.\nThe prosecution\u2019s evidence established that the two appellants and a third man, Ronald Williams, shot and killed one James Montgomery, during a robbery of the victim\u2019s apartment in the City of Pittsburgh on August 21, 1971. The third man, Ronald Williams, was tried separately. See Commonwealth v. Williams, 454 Pa. 261, 311 A.2d 920 (1973).\nThe victim\u2019s wife, who resided at the apartment with the victim and their two children, testified that during the afternoon of August 21, 1971, two men, the appellants, came to the apartment to see her husband, but departed when told that he was not at home. Later that evening, the victim\u2019s wife, while resting in the bedroom, heard voices in the apartment. She went from the bedroom into the kitchen and saw the appellants in the company of a third man, Ronald Williams, standing in front of her husband who was bent over the kitchen table with his hands stretched out. Ronald Williams was holding a shotgun. She heard one of the appellants say \u201cIf he moves, blow his brains out.\u201d She testified that \u201call of a sudden the blast went off\u201d and she immediately ran to the phone to call the police. She did not see what happened after the shooting and did not see the men leave the apartment. The police arrived shortly thereafter. The victim\u2019s body was found with his right pants pocket pulled out and loose change, mingled with blood, was found near the pocket. Marijuana was found in the victim\u2019s dresser in the apartment.\nThe victim\u2019s wife knew the appellant Weeden, since she had gone to high school with Weeden\u2019s sister and had previously seen him in the area. She identified the appellant Reed from photographs, although she did not know his name. The next day, the appellant Weeden learned that he was wanted by the police and voluntarily turned himself in. One day later, the appellant Reed was arrested at the home of his fiancee. Pursuant to a search warrant, the fiancee\u2019s home was searched and a brown bag containing marijuana was found. This marijuana was later identified during the trial as belonging to the same lot as that found in the victim\u2019s apartment.\nThe appellants gave separate statements to the police in which they said that both their afternoon and evening trips to the victim\u2019s apartment were for the purpose of purchasing marijuana. They denied any robbery plan. They claimed that the shooting of the victim by Ronald Williams during the evening visit was unexpected. During the trial, appellant Reed testified but appellant Weeden did not. Reed again said that no robbery was planned and the shooting by the third man, Ronald Williams, was a suprise to him. Prior to trial, applications by both appellants to suppress evidence were denied. The trial court refused to suppress the statements given to the police by the appellants. Appellant Reed was permitted to challenge the use of the marijuana found in his fiancee\u2019s home as evidence, but relief was denied. Appellant Weeden, however, was denied the right to challenge the use of the marijuana as evidence. The trial court held that appellant Weeden had no standing to challenge that evidence.\nThe appellants first claim that they \u201cdid not knowingly and intelligently waive their rights when they gave a statement to the police, because they didn\u2019t understand the consequences of their act.\u201d The appellants admit that the Miranda warnings were read to them and understood by them. They contend, however, that the waiver of their constitutional rights was ineffective because they did not realize, and the police did not explain, that a participant in a robbery, during which a killing occurs, may be guilty of murder, even though that participant did not personally kill the victim. The appellants contend that Miranda v. Arizona, 348 U.S. 436, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966), entitled the appellants to an explanation of the felony murder rule. We do not agree.\nBefore the appellants made any inculpatory statements to the police, they were told that they were being charged with the murder and the robbery of James Montgomery. Commonwealth v. McIntyre, 451 Pa. 42, 301 A.2d 832 (1973), also involved a defendant who had participated in a robbery during which one of the defendant\u2019s accomplices shot and killed a police officer. The claim was made that the police did not specifically refer to a murder during their interrogation and, thus, the defendant\u2019s confession was invalid. McIntyre rejected that claim and held that the defendant was adequately informed because the defendant knew that the police were investigating the death of a policeman in connection with a robbery. Commonwealth v. Boykin, 450 Pa. 25, 298 A.2d 258 (1972), held that a defendant who was told that a death was being investigated had been sufficiently informed about the crime and there was no need for more specificity concerning the legal charges of murder or manslaughter. \u201c[A] defendant is sufficiently alerted to the possibility of involvement in a criminal homicide case if the defendant knows that the victim\u2019s death is under investigation.\u201d Commonwealth v. McIntyre, 451 Pa. 42, 48, 301 A.2d 832, 835 (1973). Appellant Weeden was 20 years old and had completed, with a \u201cC\u201d average, his junior year of high school. Appellant Reed was 19 years old and had finished one and a half years of college. They were both given the opportunity and did speak with their parents before statements were obtained from them; they had been informed of their constitutional right to silence, their constitutional right to have their attorney present, and they were given the other warnings required by Miranda. They had been informed that they were charged with murder and robbery. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the appellants knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived their rights before they gave their statements to the police.\nThe second argument raised is that the trial court erred in allowing only twenty peremptory challenges to the defense, rather than twenty peremptory challenges to each appellant. The appellants rely on the Act of March 6, 1901, P. L. 16, \u00a71, as amended, 19 P.S. \u00a7811, which states: \u201c[I]n the trial of misdemeanors and felonies, . . . the Commonwealth and defendant shall each be entitled to twenty peremptory challenges . . . The above section, however, is limited by the Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 427, \u00a740, 19 P.S. \u00a7785, which states: \u201cIn all cases in which two or more persons are jointly indicted for any offense, it shall be in the discretion of the court to try them jointly or severally, except that in cases of felonious homicide, the parties charged shall have the right to demand separate trials; and in all cases of joint trials, the accused shall have the right to the same number of peremptory challenges to which either would be entitled if separately tried> and no more.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The appellants argue that section 40 of the Act of March 31, 1860, is not controlling because defendants charged with felonious homicide \u201chave the right to demand separate trials.\u201d Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 427, \u00a740, 19 P.S. \u00a7785. Since they had the right to be tried separately, appellants argue that they should not lose the twenty peremptory challenges each would have had in separate trials. Their agreement to be tried jointly should not, according to the appellants, affect the number of peremptory challenges. We cannot agree. Section 40 of the Act of March 31, 1860, specifically covers \u201call cases of joint trials.\u201d Moreover, that part of section 40 which states that \u201cin cases of felonious homicide, the parties shall have the right to demand separate trials\u201d is immediately followed by the language \u201cand in all cases of joint trials, the accused shall have the right to the same number of peremptory challenges to which either would be entitled if separately tried, and no more.\u201d The only reasonable interpretation is that if defendants agree to be tried jointly, even in cases of felonious homicide, they are entitled only to that number of peremptory challenges which either would have had in separate trials. We conclude that the trial court did not err in restricting the defense to twenty peremptory challenges.\nThe third argument raised by the appellants is that the trial court erred in granting the prosecution\u2019s challenge for cause of a juror. The excused juror voiced \u201cconscientious scruples against the imposition of life imprisonment . . .\u201d and stated that she could not impose a sentence of life imprisonment no matter what the evidence or the law. The prosecution ashed the juror \u201cIs it your position that no matter what the law in the case would be as the judge instructs you, no matter what the evidence would be, that you could not follow that law in that evidence and return a finding which would result in life imprisonment?\u201d The juror answered \u201cI couldn\u2019t because it would worry me.\u201d The appellants rely on Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 20 L. Ed. 2d 776, 88 S. Ct. 1770 (1968), which held \u201cthat a sentence of death cannot be carried out if the jury that imposed or recommended it was chosen by excluding the venireman for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction.\u201d Id. at 522, 20 L. Ed. 2d at 784-85, 88 S. Ct. at 1777. Wither-spoon, however, noted that it was not error to exclude for cause \u201cthose who made unmistakably clear (1) that they would automatically vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of the case before them, or (2) that their attitude towards the death penalty would prevent them from making an impartial decision as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d Id. at 522 n.21, 20 L. Ed. 2d at 785 n.21, 88 S. Ct. at 1777 n.21. Even accepting the appellants\u2019 argument that the Witherspoon rationale should apply to jurors who express conscientious or religious scruples or general objections to the penalty of life imprisonment, we find that the juror excluded for cause in this case was excluded properly. The juror did not voice only general objections or religious or conscientious scruples against the imposition of life imprisonment. The juror said she could not return a finding that would result in life imprisonment. She made it clear that she would automatically vote against any such finding. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not err in granting the prosecution\u2019s challenge for cause of this juror.\nThe fourth argument raised by the appellants is that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the statements of the appellants since the necessary proof of the corpus delicti was not established. Commonwealth v. Palmer, 448 Pa. 282, 292 A.2d 921 (1972). The appellants argue that when the crime involved is felony murder, proof of the corpus delicti requires not only proof of a homicide but also proof of the felony involved. Appellants contend that there was no proof of the corpus delicti of a robbery. In Commonwealth v. Leamer, 449 Pa. 76, 295 A.2d 272 (1972), we rejected the contention made by the appellants. In Learner, we held that the corpus delicti of a felony murder is established in the same way that a corpus delicti for any homicide case is established. It is not necessary to prove, independent of the confession, that the death occurred during a felony. In Learner, we said: \u201cWe think that [appellant\u2019s] argument misconceives the underlying reason for requiring proof of the corpus delicti in the first place. 'The grounds on which the rule [requiring proof of the corpus delicti] rests are the hasty and unguarded character which is often attached to confessions and admissions and the consequent danger of a conviction where no crime has in fact been committed\u2019 .... Where . . . proof of the commission of the crime is independently established, the danger of innocent convictions is obviated and a confession is admissible to show the degree of the crime as well as the identity of its perpetrator.\u201d Id. at 83-84, 295 A.2d at 275 (citation omitted). Additionally, here, as in Learner, there was evidence introduced that a robbery took place before the admission of the statements of the appellants. The victim was found with his pocket pulled out and loose change lying near the pocket. Also, the marijuana found in the victim\u2019s apartment was identified as belonging to the same lot of marijuana as that found in the appellant Reed\u2019s fiancee\u2019s home.\nThe three remaining issues are raised only by the appellant Weeden. He first claims that he was improperly restricted in his cross-examination of a police officer. Before the police officer testified, the prosecution had called a witness who testified ''[w]e noted that the victim\u2019s pockets were turned inside out; and lying in and around the body in a blood substance we noted some change.\u201d The prosecution showed several photographs to this earlier witness who said that the photographs showed that the victim\u2019s right-hand pants pocket was pulled out. The prosecution then moved for the admission of these photographs. Appellant Reed\u2019s counsel objected to their admission saying that they were ''unduly prejudicial\u201d and \u201crather gory.\u201d The prosecution argued that the photographs should be admitted to help establish a robbery. \u201c[I]t is important to show every element of robbery or attempted robbery including excursion into [the victim\u2019s] pockets.\u201d Appellant Reed\u2019s counsel answered back \u201cthis has already been testified to, Your Honor, by this witness that money was lying in the blood.\u201d Appellant Reed\u2019s counsel then agreed to stipulate \u201cthat the pictures if introduced, would show that the right-hand pocket of the victim, at the time the photographs were taken was turned inside out; that the victim was lying on the floor; and that a quantity of coins was lying in what appears to be blood near his body.\u201d Appellant Weeden\u2019s counsel refused to stipulate to the above facts since he said that appellant Weeden had no objection to the admission of the photographs. The trial court ruled that the photographs were inadmissible. Subsequently, the victim\u2019s wife testified that her husband did not carry a wallet with him but rather kept his money in his pockets. On the evening of the murder, she knew that he had money in his pockets because while shopping they had stopped for gas and he had paid for the gas with money from his pockets. She also testified that after she called the police she noticed that her husband\u2019s right-hand pocket had been turned inside out. The prosecution then called the police officer who also testified that he observed that the right-hand pocket of the victim\u2019s pants was pulled out and that coins in blood were located near the victim\u2019s body. During cross-examination of this police officer, appellant Weeden\u2019s counsel wanted to show the police officer one of the photographs which earlier had been ruled inadmissible. The prosecution objected, saying \u201ceither that photograph is ruled into evidence or it is ruled out of evidence.\u201d The appellant Weeden\u2019s counsel said that he did not want to show the photograph to the jury but that, if necessary, he would introduce it in his case in chief. Appellant Reed\u2019s counsel again objected to the admission into evidence of the photograph even if appellant Weeden\u2019s counsel were to offer it in his case in chief. The trial court ruled that since he had ruled that photograph inadmissible it could not be shown to the police officer by appellant Weeden\u2019s counsel. Appellant Weeden\u2019s counsel continued to cross-examine the police officer about the appearance of the pants pocket without using the photograph.\nAppellant Weeden does not challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling that the photograph was inadmissible. He argues, however, that even though the photograph could not be shown to the jury he should have been permitted to use the photograph to impeach the police officer\u2019s testimony about the condition of the victim\u2019s pocket and the location of the coins. We cannot agree. If a photograph cannot be shown to the jury, it is useless for impeachment purposes. Any photograph offered to destroy the credibility of the police officer had to be admissible as evidence. The jury could not possibly have determined whether the police officer\u2019s testimony had been impeached by a photograph if the jury never saw that photograph. The use of a photograph, or other document, which is inadmissible may be shown to a witness for the limited purpose of reviving the witness\u2019s present memory. See Commonwealth v. Canales, 454 Pa. 422, 311 A.2d 572 (1973). Appellant Weeden\u2019s attempts to use the photograph, however, were not for that limited purpose. His purpose was to impeach the police officer\u2019s testimony. An inadmissible photograph, however, cannot be used for that purpose.\nThe second issue raised by appellant Weeden is whether the trial court committed reversible error when it refused to allow Weeden\u2019s defense counsel to present his opening statement to the jury immediately after the prosecution\u2019s opening statement. Under rule 1116(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, a defendant may choose to present an opening statement immediately after the prosecution\u2019s opening statement or wait until the close of the prosecution\u2019s case. Rule 1116(a) provides that \u201cAfter the jury has been sworn, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall make an opening statement to the jury. The defendant or his attorney may then make an opening statement or reserve it until after the Commonwealth has presented its case.\u201d In this case, a problem arose because the trial court was faced with different requests by the appellants. The appellant Weeden\u2019s counsel wanted to open Immediately after the prosecution\u2019s opening statement, but appellant Reed\u2019s counsel wanted to reserve his opening statement until after the prosecution had presented its case. Since the appellants did not agree, the trial court refused to permit the appellant Weeden\u2019s counsel to open after the prosecution\u2019s opening statement. The trial court said its decision \u201cwas based on the thought that this would afford a more orderly and balanced approach in the case and avoid the sandwiching effect of a defense opening at the beginning and again at the end of the Commonwealth\u2019s case.\u201d Under the circumstances, we find no basis for concluding that the trial court\u2019s ruling constituted reversible error.\nThe last argument raised by appellant Weeden is that the trial court erred when it decided during the suppression hearing that appellant Weeden lacked the requisite standing to challenge the search of appellant Reed\u2019s fiancee\u2019s home and the admissibility of the fruits of that search \u2014 the marijuana. Appellant Reed was permitted to challenge the search and seizure although relief was denied. We find that the trial court improperly found that appellant Weeden did not have standing.\n\u201cThe restrictions upon searches and seizures were obviously designed for protection against official invasion of privacy and the security of property.\u201d Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 261, 4 L. Ed. 2d 697, 702, 80 S. Ct. 725, 731 (1960). In Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 390, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1247, 1256-57, 88 S. Ct. 967, 974 (1968), the United States Supreme Court reviewed the standing requirements as follows: \u201cAt one time, a defendant who wished to assert a Fourth Amendment objection was required to show that he was the owner or possessor of the seized property or that he had a possessory interest in the searched premises. . . . [W]e relaxed those standing requirements in two alternative ways in Jones v. United States, supra. First we held that when, as in Jones, possession of the seised evidence is itself an essential element of the offense with which the defendant is charged, the Government is precluded from denying that the defendant has the requisite possessory interest to challenge the admission of the evidence. Second, we alternatively held that the defendant need have no possessory interest in the searched premises in order to have standing; it is sufficient that he be legitimately on those premises when the search occurs.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nIn Jones, the Court described the dilemma of a defendant who is charged with a crime which involves possession but is denied standing to assert his fourth amendment rights if he does not claim that he possessed the property \u2014 \u201c[A] defendant seeking to comply with what has been the conventional standing requirement has been forced to allege facts the proof of which would tend, if indeed not be sufficient, to convict him .... He has been faced . . . with the encouragement that he perjure himself if he seeks to establish \u2018standing\u2019 while maintaining a defense to the charge of possession.\u201d 362 U.S. at 261-62, 4 L. Ed. 2d at 703, 80 S. Ct. at 731. The Court precluded in such instances the prosecution\u2014 which sought to establish at trial that the defendant had a possessory interest \u2014 from denying at the suppression hearing that the defendant lacked the requisite possessory interest for standing. \u201c[T]o hold to the contrary . . . would be to permit the Government to have the advantage of contradictory positions as a basis for conviction .... The prosecution [would subject] the defendant to the penalties meted out to one in lawless possession while refusing him the remedies designed for one in that situation. It is not consonant with the amenities, to put it mildly, of the administration of criminal justice to sanction such squarely contradictory assertions of power by the Government.\u201d 362 U.S. at 263-64, 4 L. Ed. 2d at 703-04, 80 S. Ct. at 732; see United States v. Allsenberrie, 424 F.2d 1209 (7th Cir. 1970).\nThe prosecution in this case did not contend that the appellant was the man who actually shot the victim. Rather, the prosecution proceeded on the theory that the appellant was guilty of murder because the death resulted from the act of an accomplice, Ronald Williams, during the commission of a robbery. To convict, therefore, it was necessary to establish that a robbery occurred. The marijuana which was obtained in the search and seizure was from the same lot as that found in the victim\u2019s apartment and was introduced as the fruit of the robbery. An essential element of robbery is the taking of goods from another. In order to have a taking, the robber must have taken possession of the goods of another. Cf. Commonwealth v. Simpson, 436 Pa. 459, 260 A.2d 751 (1970). The prosecution here was contending that the marijuana found in the presence of the appellant\u2019s co-defendant at the time of the search was stolen from the victim\u2019s apartment. The jury could have inferred from this fact that the appellant Weeden had constructive possession of the marijuana at the time of the search. From this constructive possession by appellant Weeden at the time of the search, the jury might have inferred that the appellant Weeden had either possession or constructive possession at the time of the robbery. Thus, the prosecution would have established that appellant Weeden was a participant in the robbery. Compare United States v. Price, 447 F.2d 23 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 912, 30 L. Ed. 2d 186, 92 S. Ct. 232 (1971).\nThe prosecution by challenging the appellant Weed-en\u2019s standing at the suppression hearing was asserting a position contrary to its position at trial. Appellant Weeden could have expressly claimed an interest in the marijuana during the suppression hearing and been protected from use of his admission at trial. See Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1247, 88 S. Ct. 967 (1968). But if no robbery took place, as he contended, and he had no possessory interest in the marijuana, he would have had to perjure himself to obtain standing. Under these circumstances, the prosecution cannot challenge appellant Weeden\u2019s standing by claiming he had no interest in the marijuana. See Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 4 L. Ed. 2d 697, 80 S. Ct. 725 (1960). We note that there was no evidence in this case that appellant Weeden had surrendered his interest in the allegedly stolen marijuana, by sale or otherwise, prior to the search. See Brown v. United States, 411 U.S. 223, 36 L. Ed. 2d 208, 93 S. Ct. 1565 (1973); United States v. Cowan, 396 F.2d 83 (2d Cir. 1968).\nBecause appellant Weeden was improperly denied standing to challenge the search and seizure, the matter must be remanded. Appellant Weeden is entitled to a new suppression hearing limited to a determination of whether the search of appellant Eeed\u2019s fiancee\u2019s home and the seizure of the marijuana were legal. As to appellant Beed, there has already been a final determination that the search and seizure were valid and no issue has been raised by appellant Beed in this appeal concerning that determination. We cannot, however, assume that appellant Weeden would not develop other facts, by presenting witnesses or cross-examining prosecution witnesses, which might invalidate the search and seizure and, therefore, the use of the marijuana during the trial of appellant Weeden. The error, in denying appellant Weeden the opportunity to challenge the use of the marijuana during his trial cannot be considered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705, 87 S. Ct. 824 (1967). The thrust of the prosecution\u2019s case was that the purpose of the robbery was to obtain marijuana and that the marijuana found in the home of appellant Eeed\u2019s fiancee was the fruit of that robbery. Without the marijuana evidence, the prosecution\u2019s case would have been significantly weaker and the appellant Weed-en might not have been convicted of murder in the first degree. We note that in a separate trial, Eonald Williams, who fired the fatal shot during the robbery, was convicted of only voluntary manslaughter.\nWe remand for a new suppression hearing to permit appellant Weeden to challenge the search and seizure. If it is concluded that the search and seizure were improper, a new trial shall be awarded. If, however, the finding is to the contrary, the judgment of sentence shall be affirmed. A further appeal may be filed to this Court from the order of the trial court following the suppression hearing.\nThe judgment of sentence of appellant Major Eeed at No. 6649 is affirmed.

        "text": "Concurring and Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen :\nI disagree with Mr. Justice Manderino\u2019s conclusion in the Weeden appeal. In my view, the trial court was correct in ruling Weeden lacked standing to challenge the search of the apartment of his co-defendant\u2019s fiancee. In concluding Weeden had standing, Mr. Justice Manderino relies on Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 80 S. Ct. 725 (1960). I am in full agreement with the holding of Jones as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 88 S. Ct. 967 (1968). Therein, the Supreme Court stated: \u201c[W]hen, as in Jones, possession of the seized evidence is itself an essential element of the offense with which the defendant is charged, the Government is precluded from denying that the defendant has the requisite possessory interest to challenge the admission of the evidence [at the suppression hearing]. Id. at 390, 88 S. Ct. at 974. The Supreme Court in Jones held that if the accused were charged with possession, an assertion by the government that he lacked standing to contest the admissibility of the unlawful goods he allegedly possessed would amount to \u201csquarely contradictory assertions of power by the Government.\u201d Jones, supra, 362 U.S. at 264, 80 S. Ct. at 732.\nHowever, the instant case differs from Jones in that Weeden was not charged with an offense in which possession of the seized goods was an element. In Jones the defendant was charged with having (1) \u201c \u2018purchased, sold, dispensed and distributed\u2019 narcotics,\u201d and with having (2) \u201c\u2018facilitated the concealment and sale of\u2019 the same narcotics . . . .\u201d Id. at 258, 80 S. Ct. at 729. \u201cPossession was the basis of the Government\u2019s case against petitioner.\u201d 362 U.S. at 258, 80 S. Ct. at 730. The Supreme Court\u2019s later Simmons decision interpreted Jones as applying to situations in which \u201cthe seized evidence is itself an essential element of the offense with which the defendant is charged . . . .\u201d Simmons, supra, 390 U.S. at 390, 88 S. Ct. at 974. (Emphasis added.)\nInstantly, Angelo Weeden was indicted for murder and voluntary manslaughter. Weeden asserted standing to suppress the admission of marijuana into evidence which the Commonwealth alleged was stolen from the deceased, James Montgomery, at the time of his murder. There is no doubt that murder and voluntary manslaughter do not inherently require possession of any goods, including marijuana. However, instantly, the Commonwealth tried Weeden and his co-defendant, Major Heed, on the basis of felony-murder arising during the perpetration of robbery. Mr. Justice Manderino posits that the marijuana was an \u201cessential element\u201d of the robbery in that \u201c[a]n essential element of robbery is the taking of goods from another. In order to have a taking, the robber must have taken possession of the goods of another.\u201d [Emphasis in original.]\nI disagree with this reasoning for I am convinced robbery is not a possessory offense in the same sense as the narcotics indictments before the United States Supreme Court in tTones. Therefore, I believe that Jones cannot be used as a vehicle to the result Mr. Justice Manderino reaches. In fact, in the decision of Simmons v. United States, supra, the United States Supreme Court clearly labelled robbery as a non-possessory crime. In the Simmons case, one Garrett and one Simmons were indicted and tried for robbery of a savings and loan institution. The home of a Mrs. Mahon was searched and a suitcase was found containing incriminating paraphernalia used in the robbery. Garrett moved to suppress the admission of the suitcase asserting that \u201calthough he could not identify the suitcase with certainty, it was similar to one he had owned .. ..\u201d Simmons, supra, 390 U.S. at 381, 88 S. Ct. at 969. The Government used the testimony given by Garrett at the suppression hearing against him during his robbery trial. The United States Supreme Court in deciding for Garrett on grounds not apposite to this issue, made it emphatically clear that robbery was a non-possessory offense. The Court stated: \u201cThe dilemma faced by defendants like Garrett is most extreme in prosecutions for possessory crimes, for then the testimony required for standing itself proves an element of the offense. We eliminated that Hobson\u2019s choice in Jones v. United States, supra, by relaxing the standing requirements. This Court has never considered squarely the question whether defendants charged with non-possessory crimes, like Garrett, are entitled to be relieved entirely.\u201d Id. at 391-392, 88 S. Ct. at 975. Hence, the United States Supreme Court has deemed rohhery to be a non-possessory crime.\nThis statement by the United States Supreme Court, alone, should be conclusive in defeating the position taken in Mr. Justice Manderino\u2019s opinion. However, Mr. Justice Manderino cites United States v. Price, 447 F.2d 23 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 912, 92 S. Ct. 232 (1971) in support of his position. Upon a review of Price, I find that it rejects Mr. Justice Manderino's position, rather than supports it. Therein, John Thomas Price was charged with conspiracy to steal magnetic copper wire while said wire was moving in interstate commerce. Price was further charged with the substantive crime of theft, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7659. In deciding that Price lacked standing to suppress wire seized from the premises of the co-defendant, the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit held: \u201cHe was not charged with possession and the search was not directed against him. Nor has he shown any proprietary interest in the premises, and there is no indication that he was on the New Milford property at the time of the search. As held in Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 171-172, 89 S. Ct. 961, 22 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1969), a person whose rights were not violated by the search is given no special standing as a co-defendant or co-conspirator. Accord, United States ex rel. Cardaio v. Cassacles, 446 F.2d 632, at 635 (2 Cir. 1971).\u201d Price, supra, 447 F.2d at 30. See also United States ex rel. Cardaio v. Cassacles, 446 F.2d 632 (2d Cir. 1971), and United States v. Durkin, 335 F. Supp. 922 (S.D. N.Y. 1971).\nMr. Justice Manderino\u2019s assertion that robbery involves a \u201ctaking\u201d, and, a taking necessarily involves possession, must similarly apply to the crime of theft charged against the defendant in Price. Nonetheless, this position was rejected in Price, and, I feel we should likewise reject it. As decided in Simmons robbery is not a possessory crime. The holding in Jones concerns only those possessory crimes in which \u201cpossession\u201d both convicts and confers \u201cstanding.\u201d Jones, supra, 362 U.S. at 263, 80 S. Ct. at 732. Mr. Justice Manderino has cited not one case which would extend the holding of J ones to non-possessory crimes.\nI dissent.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones and Mr. Justice Pomeroy join in this opinion.",
