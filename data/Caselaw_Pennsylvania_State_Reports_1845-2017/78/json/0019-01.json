        "text": "Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court, January 18th 1875,\nPer Curiam.\nThis case is ruled by that of Sloat v. Royal Insurance Co., 13 Wright 14. The loss, in this instance, exceeds the entire insurance in all the policies, general and special. The loss in the first and second stories of the building, which was not covered by the special policy in the subject in the third and fourth stories, largely exceeded the entire amount of the general policies. So the loss in the third and fourth stories exceeded the amount of the special policy, which was confined to the subject in those upper stories. It is clear, therefore, that the general and special policies covered in fact different subjects, and that the loss under each was more than sufficient to exhaust its entire amount. A rule of average which would exempt the general policies from a portion of their peculiar loss below, in order to carry it to the relief of the special policy above, and thus to exonerate each from a portion of a total loss of different subjects, would directly contradict the very spirit and intent of the contract of insurance; the subjects being different, and the loss upon each being greater than the insurance on each specially applicable to it, it is evident that the average would effectuate no equity it was intended to cover. We do not think Merrick v. Ins. Co., 4 P. F. Smith 277, is sufficiently clear on this point to overrule Sloat v. Ins. Co., 13 Wright 14. Judgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Royal Insurance Co. versus Roedel et al.\n1. Three companies insured goods in every part of a building; one of the companies took a second insurance on goods in the third and fourth stories only. There was a loss by fire, which, in the first and second stories, exceeded the amount of the first insurance. The loss in the third and fourth stories exceeded the amount of the second insurance. Held, that the second insurance was payable in full, without averaging the loss in the third and fourth stories with the first policies.\n2. Merrick v. Germania Insurance Oo., 4 P. F.

If the three general policies on the stock, to wit, the Royal Insurance Company $10,000, London, Liverpool and Globe $5000, Franklin Fire Insurance Company $5000, do not, under the circumstances, contribute to the loss on stock on the third and fourth floors, then the whole amount of insurance of policy No. 754,553 of The Royal Insurance Company upon that specific stock, to wit, $8000, was due and payable to plaintiffs.\nIf the court shall be of the opinion that the adjustment, on the principle of contribution, under which the above payment was made by The Royal Insurance Company is correct, and that the lawful claim of the plaintiffs only amounted to the sum paid, then judgment shall be entered for the defendants; otherwise, in favor of the plaintiffs for the sum of $5474.07, with interest-from April 1st 1872, or for any other sum not exceeding that amount which, upon a correct adjustment of the loss, the court is of opinion the plaintiffs are entitled to receive.\nThe contributing clause of The Franklin Fire Insurance Company was:\u2014\n\u201c All persons having property insured by this company must, with reasonable diligence, give notice of all additional insurances made in their behalf on the same, whether by this company or by other insurers, and of all changes that may be made in such additional insurances, and cause such notice to be endorsed on their policies \u2014 and each company shall be liable to the payment only of a ratable proportion of any loss or damage which may be sustained \u2014 and, unless such notice is given, the insured will not be entitled to recover in case of loss.\u201d\nThe contributing clause of The London, Liverpool and Globe Insurance Company, was :\u2014\n\u201c That in all cases of insurance, this company shall be liable for such rateable proportion only of the loss or damage happening to the subject insured as the amount insured by this company shall bear the whole amount insured thereon, without reference to the dates of the different policies, or their invalidity, from want of notice of this or other insurance, or from the violation of any of their conditions, or the insolvency of any or all the other insurance companies.\u201d '\nThe judgment was for the plaintiffs on the case stated for $5474.07.\nThe defendants took a writ and assigned the entry of judgment for the plaintiffs.\nJ.
