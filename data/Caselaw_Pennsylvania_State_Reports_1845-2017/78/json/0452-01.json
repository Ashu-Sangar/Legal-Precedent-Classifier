The assignor reserved his exemption of $300 under the Act of 1849. The appellant\u2019s claim on the ground of a special waiver of exemption must be asserted in the usual way by exemption or attachment against the reservation \u2014 that is, the goods or money set apart under the assignment, and not passing into the fund. By the assignment the property of the assignor passed to the assignee for the purposes of the trust, and of course was not subject to exemption. The assignee must administer his trust according to the deed creating it; leaving creditors who claim special privileges against the debtor to assert their claims in a way to reach that only which the debtor reserved to himself.\nDecree afSrmed with costs and appeal dismissed.",

In the distribution of the estate of William Nell and wife under deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors to Michael B. Blauser, dated April 14th 1878. The assignment was of all their real estate, being a house and lot in Meehanicsville, and all their personal property, &c., \u201c reserving out of said assigned property so much property as the law of this Commonwealth exempts from levy and sale on execution to the value of $300, in property personal and real, which is hereby reserved, and to be set apart and appraised in a manner provided by law, * * * and if said property cannot be so set apart, then said amount, or the residue thereof, is claimed and reserved out of the proceeds of said house and lot when sold,\u201d &c.\nThe inventory, &c., of the property assigned, &c., made by the appraisers appointed by the court was:\u2014\n\u201c House and lot in Meehanicsville, subject to lien of judgment, &c. . . . . . .

On this note judgment had been recovered April 22d 1873 for $281.02.\nThe exceptions were dismissed by the court for the reason that there was no application for confirmation.\nThe assignee filed an account April 21st 1874, charging himself with the personal property appraised $12.87, proceeds of the real estate $405, and some other items; in all $576.69.
