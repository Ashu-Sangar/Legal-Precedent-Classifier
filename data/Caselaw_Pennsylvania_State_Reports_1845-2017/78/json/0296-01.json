Smith 119, and Ashhurst\u2019s Appeal, 27 Id. 464. The corpus or legal title is in the trustee: \u201c I appoint my brother, Reuben Deibert, as trustee over my goods, and he shall hold all moneys in hand and take care-of the same and the interest.\u201d What is given to the two children is merely the interest; \u201c they shall yearly draw the interest.\u201d Some doubt might arise if the case rested there; for as the estate of the beneficiaries is not expressed to be for life, and there is ho bequest over, it might be said that the absolute bequest of the interest would carry the principal, as a devise of the rents and profits does the land. But here this consequence is precluded by the direct provision of the will; an expression of the intention of the testator which, as it is perfectly lawful, cannot be disregarded. He says : \u201cIf my appointed trustee shall see proper he shall give them (the children) part of the principal sum.\u201d It is evidently implied that they are not to have the whole, but only such part as the trustee saw fit. That is submitted to his discretion. The trust must be upheld as an active one to effectuate this intention.\nDecree reversed, and record remitted that a decree may be entered below conformably to this opinion. The costs of this appeal to be borne by the estate.",

In the distribution of the estate of Daniel Deibert, deceased.\nThe deceased, by his will, provided as follows :\u2014\n\u201c And concerning my worldly goods or property, my land, situate in Lowhill township, shall not be sold in six years, except my executor can get $70 per acre, then he shall sell it. * * * Immediately after my decease, each of my two children shall have $100, and of the remainder they shall yearly draw the interest\u2014 or if my appointed trustee shall see proper, he shall give them part of the principal sum. * * * I appoint my brother, Reuben Deibert, as trustee over my goods, and he shall hold all moneys in hand, and take care of the same and the interest.

Woolever, Esq., was appointed auditor to make distribution.\nThe auditor being of opinion that the testator died intestate as to the personal property, distributed it between the testator\u2019s two children.\nExceptions were filed to his report, and, after argument, the Orphans\u2019 Court (Longaker, P. J.) holding that the bequest was a dry trust, confirmed the auditor\u2019s report.\nThe trustee appealed to the Supreme Court, and assigned the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court for error.\nR. E.
