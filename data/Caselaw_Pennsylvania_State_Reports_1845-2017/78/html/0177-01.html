The defendants have actually constructed another road satisfactory to the township authorities in place of the part thus occupied by the railroad track. This road so supplied has never been formally vacated, but is practically and in fact abandoned as a township road, because of the impossibility of safely using it, and we treat it as vacated, in this suit. The plaintiff claims that having thus actually been vacated as a township road, his right of possession, as an adjoining owner, at once revived and extended to the centre of the old highway. This would be so, if the old road had been vacated for public use, but such is not the fact. [When it was abandoned for use as a township road it was only that it might be at once occupied as another public highway, that by law had a right so to occupy it upon complying with certain duties to the public, which it is conceded it has done. The plaintiff never recovered his right to occupy this road as against the public, or in other words, to reduce it to private possession, and not having the right of possession as against the defendant he can not recover in this case. We cannot think that the defendant was bound to provide the public with a new road at its own expense, and then pay adjoining landowners damages for the use of land the landowner had then no right to occupy, as against the public and their last easement, and which they had supplied by another equally passable.]”</p>
