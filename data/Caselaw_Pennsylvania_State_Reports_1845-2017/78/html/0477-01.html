On the 3d of March 1871, on the petition of James McNeal, the Orphans’ Court awarded an inquest for the partition of the real estate of the decedent.

The defence set up to the payment of this recognisance is by the party to whom the land was decreed. He alleges a parol agreement between certain of the heirs, of whom Mrs. Roddy was one, and himself, by which he was to take the land in right of Rachel Kreager and hold it in trust for the five sisters, of whom Mrs. Roddy was one. If such a bargain was entered into by Mrs. Roddy, and the land was taken by Kreager at the appraisement in pursuance of it, and if Mrs. Roddy ratified and approved it afterwards, such contract may be established by parol evidence, and Mrs. Roddy can be held to her bargain, although it was not reduced to writing.

To support this position the declarations of Anne Roddy made, not to or in Kreager’s presence, but to strangers, about the time of and after the partition, were introduced, and tended to prove that she expressed a desire that Kreager should accept the farm at the appraisement for herself and sisters, that she was willing to execute an agreement in order to carry out that desire, and that she subsequently said that Kreager had so accepted.</p>
    <p id="b479-6" data-blocks='[["BL_479.5",479,[172,907,1167,780]]]'>The first difficulty that occurs in this proposition as an available defence, saying nothing about the Act of 1856, is that it contains nothing tending to show that either her sisters or Kreager ever agreed to become parties to such an arrangement. Hence it never assumed the form of a contract and could therefore bind no one. The second trouble is, that Kreager having no interest in the estate of Sarah McNeal, had no power to accept for any one except his daughter-in-law, Rachel Kreager, who had executed a power of attorney to him for that purpose. So, if we suppose such a contract as that alleged, it came to naught through the want of power in Kreager to execute it. Finally, the property was accepted for and solemnly awarded to Rachel Kreager, in whom the title then and there vested, if there is any virtue in the decree and records of a Pennsylvania orphans’ court. Kreager, on this showing, holds nothing in the premises either for himself or any one else, and it follows, that were we to permit this judgment to stand, Anne Roddy’s estate would get neither money nor land. A result hardly warranted by strict justice.</p>
