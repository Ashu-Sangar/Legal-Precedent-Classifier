It is an action <em>ex delicto </em>for the breach of a duty which the defendants owe to every man, to receive the messages which he may wish to send, and transmit them to their destination. This obligation was anterior to the contract, and is not necessarily susceptible of being modified by it. Having its foundation in a rule of law, it cannot be varied or restricted, except in subordination to the principles on which the rule depends.

The defendants are public agents, and as such bound to the exact diligence which is the condition precedent of all faithful service. Their charter was not conferred upon them merely as a means whereby gain might accrue without the risk incident to individual responsibility. It is a great and beneficial franchise confided to their hands for the better attainment of an object in which the community at large are interested. They are, therefore, not less than a railway .company or a corporation organized to supply gas or water, under an obligation to exercise their peculiar function in away to obtain the end proposed, and must respond in damages to every one who is injured by a want of due care on their part, or on that of the agents whom they employ. This, as the case of The Telegraph Co. <em>v. </em>Dryburg, 35 Penna. 298, indicates, is true, not only as it regards those who contract with them, but of third persons, who having entered into no relation of contract, are yet injured by their negligence.</p>

By no device can a body corporate avoid liability for fraud, for wilful wrong, or for the gross negligence which, if it does not intend to occasion injury, is reckless of consequences, and transcends the bounds of right with full knowledge that mischief may ensue. Nor, as I am inclined to think, will any stipulation against liability be valid, which has the pecuniary interest of the corporation as its sole object, and takes a safeguard from the public without giving anything in return. But a rule, which, in marking out a path plain and easily accessible, as that in which the company guarantees that every one shall be secure, declares that if any man prefers to walk outside of it, they will accompany him, will do their best to secure and protect him, but will hot be insurei’s, will not consent to be responsible for accidents arising from fortuitous and unexpected causes, or even from a want of care and watchfulness on the part of their agents, may be a reasonable rule, and as such upheld by the courts.</p>

Telegraphy, like the other powerful instruments -which science has placed at the disposal of man, is capable of being a source of injury instead of benefit. That the intelligence which it conveys is prompt, will serve no good purpose if mistakes occur during the process of transmission. The difficulty of avoiding them is, notwithstanding, greater than might at first appear. The function of the telegraph differs from that of the post-office in this, that while the latter is not concerned with the contents of the missive, and merely agrees to forward it to its address, the former undertakes the much more difficult task of <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>transcribing a message written according to one method of notation, in characters which are entirely different, with all the liability to error necessarily incident to such a process. Nor is this all. The telegraph operator is separated by a distance of many miles from the paper on which he writes, so that his.eye cannot discern and correct the mistakes committed by his hand. It was also contended during the argument, that the electric fluid which is used as the medium of communicatipn, is liable to perturbations arising from thunder-storms, and other natural causes. It is, therefore, obvious that entire accuracy cannot always be obtained by the greatest care, and that the only method of avoiding error is to compare the copy with the original, or in other words, that the operator to whom the message is sent should telegraph it back to the station whence it came.</p>

      <em>“ </em>So far the inquiry is plain; but here a question of some difficulty presents itself. Should every message be repeated, or only those which are of sufficient importance to make such a precaution requisite? In answering this question it must be remembered that the repetition of a message necessarily involves delay and expense. The mail may transmit any number of letters simultaneously, but a telegram has exclusive possession of the wires during its passage over the line. While one message is repeated, others are delayed, which may at times be of serious consequence. There is, moreover, an increase of cost, which, though trivial in each instance, would be formidable in the aggregate, *&gt;and necessarily augment the rate of charging in a ratio which has been roughly calculated at one-half. . Such must be the result, if every one who wishes to engage rooms at an hotel, or put a question of friendly interest, must submit to the expense and possible delay of repetition.</p>

Instead of passing every message twice over the line, those only are to be repeated which from their importance, demand peculiar care. And as the company cannot know what telegrams fall within this category, the question is referred to the person chiefly interested. Obviously he who sends a communication is best qualified to judge whether it should be returned for correction. If he asks the company to repeat the message, and they fail to comply, they will clearly be answerable for any injury that may result from the omission. If he does not make such a request, he may well be taken to have acquiesced in the conditions which they prescribe, and at all events cannot object to the want of a precaution he has virtually waived. It is not a just ground of complaint that the power to choose is coupled with an obligation to pay an additional sum to cover the cost of repetición. If it were not, the company would in all probability be called on to repeat every message, with the inevitable result of putting the public to an increased expense, without any corresponding gain.</p>

But it is satisfactory to know that the principles set forth above are sustained by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in Ellis <em>v. </em>The Telegraph Co., <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Allen%20226" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="18 Allen 226">18 Allen 226</a>; and also by that rendered in Camp <em>v. </em>The Telegraph Co., 2 Mete. (Ky.) 164.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b245-7" data-blocks='[["BL_245.6",245,[192,1065,1158,772]]]'>“ We do not think it requisite to notice the second point, beyond saying that it presents a nice question, about which the books do not agree: see Parris’s Case, Law Rep. 7 Chan. App. 587; and the British and American Telegraph Co. <em>v. </em>Colson, Law Rep. 6 Exch. 108. The fair deduction from the authorities seems to be, that although an offer made through the post office becomes binding as soon as the assent of the person to whom it is addressed is signified by mailing a reply, the contract is still subject to this condition, that the letter of acceptance shall reach its destination; and will fail if the opposite party does not receive notice within a reasonable time in that or some other way. The principle is the same, when a telegram is altered in passing over the line, and misleads a purchaser. We do not, however, express any opinion on this head, and leave it for the consideration of the court above. In deciding that the company is not answerable for unrepeated messages, we have in effect disposed of the whole controversy, and judgment is consequently entered for the defendants on the points reserved.</p>
