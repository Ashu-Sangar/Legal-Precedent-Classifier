    <p class="summary" id="b376-6" data-blocks='[["BL_376.5",376,[260,586,1152,1795]]]'>At a meeting of the directors they resolved that the shares of stock to be issued should be equal to the number of acres, and then should not exceed 108,000 shares, each share to represent one acre, and to be estimated at $50 till otherwise ordered; the shares reserved were 12,000, and were to abide the future action of the company. The directors acted with great promptitude to carry on the primary objects of the corporation. The lands were of great value for timber, coal and iron, and also for agricultural purposes, but it was an almost unbroken wilderness, and away from public highways, so that their resources could not be made available. The Sunbury and Erie Railroad and the Allegheny Valley Railroad were looked to as soon to furnish outlets to market. The leading object of the company was to sell the lands and divide the proceeds amongst the stockholders. All the directors labored earnestly to interest capitalists and make sales of the lands. In May 1858 a committee of the directors was appointed to endeavor to effect sales of the lands and stock, and ascertain if any thing could be done to aid in procuring an outlet to market. In September the committee reported, that obtaining a fair price for their lands could not be accomplished until there was an outlet for their mineral product, and that which seemed likely to benefit them first was the western portion of the Sunbury and Erie Railroad ; this railroad (afterwards the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad) was not opened till seven years after the report; its first train went through in October 1865. This delay prevented sales of lands and there were no dividends; but the accumulation of taxes and the necessary expenses were large and to be provided for. In 1859 the company subscribed for $162,500 of the stock of the railroad company, in order to secure a railroad through their lands ; the subscription was paid in 1863, by $91,000 of the mortgage bonds mentioned in the bill, 4800 of the reserved 12,000 shares of stock, and 200 acres of land. The first mortgage was issued February 1st 1863, to Samuel Mason and Edward F. Gay, as trustees ; the bonds secured by it amounted to $200,000, and were to meet the subscription to the railroad stock and other liabilities. During the oil excitement in 1864, 1865, a lease was made to an oil company of some of the company’s lands supposed to contain oil. This enterprise failed; while the excitement continued, the stock of the Land and Improvement Company was sought after and sold at increased prices; some was sold at $20 per share, but upon the failure of the efforts for oil its value decreased; Lewis Seal, one of the plaintiffs, bought 800 shares for $1 per share.</p>

The attention of the board of directors was called to the subject by Mr. Fraley, in August 1857. The directors’ minutes, under date of December 14th 1857, show that the president laid before the board a programme for a basis of land operations between the McKean and Elk Company and the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company, which was referred to a committee of three stockholders — John C. Cresson, John K. Kane and Henry M. Watts — to report at a future meeting. On December 26th 1857, that committee presented a communication to the board, which was considered ; and it was agreed that the company would negotiate with the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company for 15,000 acres of land, at six dollars per acre, to be paid for in the <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>stock of the railroad company at par. That transaction does not appear to have been consummated as proposed. But at a meeting of directors, held on the 5th day of May 1859, called for the purpose of considering the subject of subscribing to the stock of the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company, a committee of three— Henry M. Watts,-Frederick Fraley and James R. Greeves — was appointed, with authority to make a subscription of $1-00,000, conditioned on the adoption of the route by the West Clarion and Two-mile run, the subscription not to be payable until the road was completed. The subscription appears to have been made'on the 14th day of June 1859, payable in 5000 acres of land at $12.50 per acre, and $100,000 in cash, upon completion of the road. It appears also to have been made by the directors for and in the name of the McKean and Elli Company. The directors at that time were Henry M. Watts — who was also president of the company — John 0. Cresson, Samuel Mason, MordeeaiL. Dawson, Frederick Fraley, James R. Greeves and Robert P. Kane. Mr. Watts resigned as president and director on the 12th day of November 1859. The subscription thus made by the directors for the company was ratified by the stockholders. The answer of the McKean and Elk Company in this case, supported by the minutes of a stockholders’ meeting held May 16th 1862, shows that the act of the directors was adopted, and that they were authorized by the stockholders to borrow $200,000, to pay, among other things, the subscription to the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company, and to issue bonds of the McKean and Elk Company, secured by a mortgage of its lands, for repayment of the money so borrowed.</p>

The company was also under obligation to meet the subscription to the stock of the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company. The efforts to raise money by sales of lands had proved abortive, as had also an attempt to obtain a loan by assessing the sum rateably upon the stockholders. In this condition of affairs, a stockholders’ meeting was held on the 16th of May 1862, to consider and take action upon the financial condition of the company, at which meeting it was unanimously ‘ resolved that the directors be and they are hereby authorized to borrow the sum of $200,000 for the purpose of paying off the present indebtedness of the company; for the payment of the subscription to the stock of the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad Company, and for such other purposes as the interests of the company may, in their judgment, require, * * * and the repayment of the money so borrowed shall be secured by mortgage of the real estate of the company.’</p>

On the 10th of February 1868, the directors submitted to them a report, advocating a conversion of the stock and bonds into the land itself by such stockholders as might desire to do so ; this was unanimously adopted. The land was immediately divided into suitable parcels, having regard to their character and value; and maps, &amp;c., prepared, showing the location of each parcel and its position relatively to mineral, timber and other advantages; this preparation showed great labor and care. At a special meeting of the stockholders May 12th 1868, the plan was recommended by a committee of the directors, who made an elaborate report on the subject.

The report con<a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>tained a valuation of the land which after deducting an amount sufficient to pay the bonds, other liabilities and leaving a cash balance, showed that “ the value of each share of stock or its purchasing power ” would be $20.44.

At an adjourned meeting of the stockholders, May 29th 1868, the plan was approved and they resolved that the directors be authorized to sell the lands to the stockholders, or any other persons who would buy on the conditions of the plan before the next July 15th ; that the bondholders be requested to agree to release the lien of the mortgages on any lands sold on the terms mentioned in the resolution ; that if the bondholders would not agree to release or the whole of the lands should not be taken, the directors were authorized to sell the lands at public sale in Philadelphia on the third Tuesday of the next October, after notice by publications specified in the resolution, and in such manner in addition as should be calculated to give full information. All the shareholders did not agree to the plan and the sale was held at the Philadelphia exchange on the 20th of October 1868. The terms were cash, or 36 per cent, of the purchase might remain secured on the premises sold, payable in five annual instalments; 62 per cent, in the company’s stock at $6 per share, and 2 per cent, cash to be paid when the land was struck off; any of the payments might be made in cash. Purchases were made by stockholders only and amounted to 28,000 acres for $342,617, of which 2 per cent, was paid in cash and the remainder in the mortgage bonds of the company.

Tracts of land were sold at various prices, the average of which wras about $11.25 per acre.

It is considered by the master that neither of the plaintiffs, except Mr. Watts, has shown that he has a status to contest the subscription to the Sunbury and Erie Railroad, nor the first issue of bonds and the mortgage made to secure them; nor the erection of the hotel. They did not become stockholders until after the subscription had been made and settled for, and the bonds had been issued, and the hotel had been authorized and was in course of erection. The same may be said in regard to the sales of land to the Erie and to the New York and Erie Mining Companies, which appear to have been authorized at a directors’ meeting held on the 11th day of May, and the terms of sale concluded on the 5th day of November 1865. Hence, the master considers that Mr. Watts is the only one of the plaintiffs who has shown a status to inquire into or contest either of those transactions. It may be important, then, as bearing upon the questions of laches and limitations — urged for the defendants — to know what was Mr. Watts’s course of dealing with the several matters complained of prior to the commencement of this suit. The following facts are deduced from the evidence, as bearing upon this branch of the case.”</p>

      <em>“ </em>The master is of opinion that it was the duty of Mr. Watts— if he meant to contest the subscription to the Sunbury and Erie Railroad, or either of the issues of bonds, or the mortgage made to secure them, or either of the sales of lands, or the erection of the hotel or of the saw-mill — to make his application to a court of equity without unnecessary delay. And further, that the delay which preceded the commencement of this suit — regarded in connection with the large sums of money invested by directors and stockholders of the company, as well as by third persons in the intervening time, and upon the faith that the proceedings of the company were legal — has been sufficient to warrant a denial of relief to the plaintiffs in a court of equity. The plaintiffs’ duty to proceed at an earlier day was, in the view of the master, no less to the directors and other stockholders of the company — who contemplated investing their own money in large sums, incurring heavy expenses, and assuming new relations to the property, in the belief that they were acting by due authority and for the general good— than to third persons who were to enter into contracts and invest their money also, upon the faith of the legality of the company’s acts. The various periods of delay between ten years as the longest, and eighteen months as the shortest, were surely long enough, under the circumstances of this case, to raise a counter equity against the plaintiffs. And it will be remembered that the rule, that a party guilty of unreasonable delay in the enforcement of his rights, thereby forfeits his claim to equitable relief, is more especially applicable to cases in which he lies by until other parties have incurred expenses, invested money, or entered into relations or engagements of a responsible or burdensome character.”</p>

The very power to contract necessarily involves the cognate power to create debt; and a corporation, without such power would be a body without life, utterly effete and worthless. If, however, it be objected, that one may have the power to contract debts binding upon his principal, and yet not have the power to bind him by deed, it is answered, these directors have such power under the charter. They have the power to dispose of the whole of the company’s lands, by deed or lease, and as they possess this superior power, the minor one of the mortgaging those lands upon a proper occasion, and for a proper debt, may be inferred : Lancaster <em>v. </em>Dolan, <a href="/rawle/1/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="1 Rawle 231" data-case-ids="1819262" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0231-01">1 Rawle 231</a>: Gordon <em>v. </em>Preston, <a href="/watts/1/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="1 Watts 385" data-case-ids="1838074" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0385-01">1 Watts 385</a>.</p>

Furthermore, it is not alleged that the hotel, the building concerning which the greatest complaint is made, has not accomplished its purpose; that the company did not derive all the advantages which were expected, or that the building is not worth all it cost.

Even the common roads were few and almost impassable. Under such circumstances these lands were, so far as a present market value was concerned, not worth the taxes annually assessed on them; yet they contained within them valuable minerals and were clothed with forests of excellent timber. But these were use-1 less without the means to transport them to market. When, therefore, the directors of the Sunbury and Erie Railroad proposed, upon a subscription to their stock of one hundred and sixty-two ^ thousand dollars, to adopt a route for their road which would carry it through the heart of the McKean and Elk Land and Improvement Company’s land, it is not surprising that not only the directors but also the stockholders thereof should .have agreed to the proposition. That they had the power to build both common roads and $ railroads, or to aid others to a reasonable extent in so doing, is | beyond doubt. Under such circumstances, their subscription, j though larger than was warranted, looks to me more like a mistake ' in judgment than a wilful perversion of power. But passing this we come to another phase of this case, which we regard as definitive. This subscription, as before observed, was made for the honest purpose of benefiting the company; it was not made in haste, but was some four years in process of consummation. In the meantime it met the approval of the stockholders at their meeting May 16th 1862. There was, therefore, ample notice to all <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>concerned, and ample time for protest and the intervention of the preventive process of the law. Without any precedent authority we might well come to the following conclusions: first, that when an act done by directors is in excess of their authority, yet has | been done with the bon&amp; fide intent of benefiting the corporation which they represent, and a shareholder knowing thereof does not l dissent within a reasonable time, his assent to the act will be presumed, and he will be estopped from gainsaying it..

    <p id="b394-6" data-blocks='[["BL_394.5",394,[255,882,1169,518]]]'>Second. That when the act complained of is to be followed by a large expenditure of money, the shareholder should not only file his protest within a reasonable time, but should follow up the same by active preventive means. Eor it is obviously against good conscience, that one having the power to prevent it should stand by and see his associates expend money, that may result to his benefit, land afterwards charge them therewith. He may not thus pocket /the gain resulting from his delay or thus wait in order to observe the result of the experiment, and when it fails to produce the ■ result expected, fall back upon his protest as a saving of his legal remedies, giajieglect to act at the proper time bars his right of action as effectually as his neglect to protest.</p>

Yet, during all this time, he contented himself with a mere dissent. A dissent, clear enough, indeed, as to the doubts and legal propositions therein raised, but nothing but a dissent. Under the circumstances, we think he did not do all that was required of him.

Instead of this, he refrains from this obvious course of action, until the matter is fully consummated, and until he has derived every possible benefit therefrom.

Under such circumstances, we could not have helped him had he commenced his proceedings immediately after the payment of the subscription to the railroad company.
