Insolvency under the Bankrupt Act is not a total inability by Knerr to pay his liabilities for want of assets, but it is that condition financially when he is unable to pay his notes and other liabilities generally as they fall due. A failure to meet a note or two, or other indebtedness when due or demanded, is not enough if payment be made within a reasonable time thereafter, but if there be a general failure to pay, then the condition, of the law is satisfied, and insolvency has occurred, or the debtor may be said to be acting in contemplation of insolvency. A man being a trader may have property sufficient to pay all his debts, and yet, if there be a general failure to pay when due, he will, by the provisions of the Bankrupt Act, be insolvent, or acting in contemplation of insolvency. Insolvency is a question of fact and is not founded upon the actual knowledge of the debtor and creditor, a reasonable cause to induce belief is all that is required.</p>

You will, if found in the affirmative, have established the first requisite, and you will next inquire for the second condition, viz.: was the revival given with a view to prefer the defendant over the other creditors? This condition is satisfied if the object of the revival was to extend the lien of the judgment upon after-acquired property ; by operation of law the effect of the revival was to extend the lien on the after-acquired property, and there being after-acquired real estate proven, it may safely be found as a fact that the'revival was given with a view to prefer the defendant over the other creditors.</p>

[Reasonable cause to believe, is that condition of mind produced from facts and circumstances which would put a prudent and careful man upon inquiry, as to the solvency or insolvency of Knerr; it is a well-founded suspicion, based upon facts from which such suspicion will reasonably flow, it is a state of mind produced from facts less than actual knowledge, or less than a full conviction of the actual <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>fact. Reasonable cause will also be presumed under a certain condition of facts. It is a fact that the debt sought to be secured by the revival was not created at that time, but was subsisting since January 1868, and whenever the debt is thus subsisting and a revival is taken merely to extend the lien thereof, it is an act done out of the usual course of business, and being so done, it was the duty of the defendant to make an inquiry as to the solvency or insolvency of Knerr, and on failure so to make the inquiry, the presumption follows that the defendant would have found reasonable cause to induce the belief that Knerr was insolvent or was contemplating insolvency.

We have no doubt of the jurisdiction of a state court to entertain such an action, and although in an ordinary case it may be doubted whether a bond fide creditor who has received from a sheriff the amount of his claim and may in good conscience retain it, though the payment to him was by mistake, can be compelled by an action to refund, yet in this particular class of cases that question is precluded by the express provision of the thirty-fifth section of the Bankrupt Act that “ the assignee may recover the property, or the value of it, from the person so receiving it or so to be benefited,” in contravention of the enactment as to fraudulent preferences.</p>
    <p id="b151-8" data-blocks='[["BL_151.12",151,[177,1347,1155,549]]]'>We think, however, that there was error in so much of the charge excepted to as instructed the jury that when a subsisting debt is secured by judgment, and “ a revival is taken merely to extend the lien thereof, it is an act done out of the usual course of business, and being so done, it was the duty of the defendant to make an inquiry as to the solvency or insolvency of ICnerr, and on failure to make the inquiry, the presumption follows, that the defendant would have found reasonable cause to induce the belief that ICnerr was insolvent or was contemplating insolvency. There being no evidence that such inquiry was made, you are instructed that this requisite has been established,” namely, that the defendant, Kemmerer, had reasonable cause to believe that ICnerr was insolvent.</p>

But the Supreme Court in that case gave a more liberal and reasonable construction of the Bankrupt Act in support of the rights of bonfi fide creditors. It was held, that something more than passive non-resistance of an insolvent debtor to regular judicial proceedings, in which a judgment and levy on his property are obtained, when the debt is due, and he is without just defence to the action, is necessary to show a preference of a creditor, or a purpose to defeat or delay the operation of the Bankrupt Act; that though the judgment-<a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>creditor in such case may know the insolvent condition of the debtor, his levy and seizure are not void under the circumstances, nor any violation of the Bankrupt Law; and that a lien thus obtained by him, though within four months of the filing of the petition, will not be displaced by subsequent proceedings in bankruptcy against the debtor.</p>
    <p id="b152-6" data-blocks='[["BL_152.5",152,[259,660,1152,644]]]'>We must assume in this argument that Kemmerer had no knowledge of Knerr’s insolvency, and no reasonable cause to believe it, unless in the bare fact that Knerr, on his, Kemmerer’s, application, was willing to consent to a revival of his judgment, so that it might be a lien on real estate acquired by Knerr subsequent to its date. What was there in this to excite Kemmerer’s suspicion, or put him on inquiry ? Is it out of the usual course of business for a judgment-creditor, the lien of whose judgment is about to expire, to say to his debtor, “I do not wish to put you to any unnecessary costs by adverse process; give me an amicable revival ?” It may be said to be almost an everyday thing. The advantage is all on the side of the debtor, not of the creditor. Kemmerer might at once have sued out an execution, made a levy on the after-acquired real estate, and then secured the lien which he was desirous of obtaining.</p>
