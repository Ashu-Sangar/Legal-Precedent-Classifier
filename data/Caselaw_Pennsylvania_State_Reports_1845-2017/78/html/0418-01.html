Nissley died intestate in 1834. leaving a widow and children: an inquisition in partition valuing, &amp;c., his real estate, was confirmed November 5th 1838; a daughter, one of his heirs, was married November 29th. Two of his sons, March 1839, accepted the land at the valuation, subject to the widow’s interest, payable to his heirs at her death. The daughter died in 1862, leaving a husband, and having made a will disposing of her interest in her father’s real estate accruing after the death of the widow, who died in March 1872. In December 1872 the husband of the daughter notified her executors that he claimed the whole of his wife’s share in her mother’s dower, refused to recognise her will, and claimed all his rights to her real estate to which by law he was entitled. The court below decided that the daughter’s interest was her separate property and would pass by her will, subject to her husband’s rights under the Act of May 4th 1855 ; and that the husband gave sufficient notice of his election. This was affirmed by the Supreme Court.</p>

Heisey, and was so held by them until after her marriage. After she married, by reason of its acceptance by Joseph W. Nissley and Martin Nissley, and of their entering into a recognisance, with security approved by the Orphans’ Court of Lancaster county, for the payment to the other heirs of their respective portions of the valuations of the money, the title to said real estate became wholly vested in them, and the title of the other heirs thereto wholly divested. One-third of the valuation money was charged on each purpart during the life of the widow of Martin Nissley, deceased, and not payable to the heirs until after her decease. That these thirds, this money now in dispute, after the acceptance of the property and its being made a charge thereupon by the court, was personal property, is not disputed. It was a portion of her share, of her intestate father’s estate, secured by a recognisance in the Orphans’ Court. At the <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>time this money vested in Mrs. Heisey, the 48th sect, of Act of the 29th of March 1882, had been enacted and was in force. * * * This may be termed the first act securing the rights of married women in Pennsylvania, and under it the Supreme Court held that the declaration and separate examination of a married woman, required by this act, to entitle her husband to the share of her intestate father’s estate, secured by recognisance in the Orphans’ Court, must be filed during the lifetime of the wife, otherwise at her death it will go to her heirs at law. No such certificate having ever been procured or filed, this continued to be the property of the wife, and never was reduced to the possession of the husband. As her property she might have disposed of it by will under the Act of 1883, with the assent of her husband, but not otherwise. It continued to be her property therefore at the time of the passage of the Act of April 11th 1848, securing the rights of married women; and sect. 7th of this act declares ‘that any married woman may dispose by her last will and testament, of her separate property, &amp;c., W'hether the same accrues to her before or during coverture, provided her will be executed in presence of two witnesses, neither of whom shall be her husband.’ It also provides, sect. 9th, that in cases of intestacy the husband shall be entitled to letters of administration, and if she leave no child or children, nor the descendants of children living, the husband is entitled to her personal estate absolutely. Under the provisions of this act a married woman was permitted to dispose of her whole separate estate to the entire exclusion of her husband, and thus the law remained until 1855, May 4th, when the legislature passed an act which declares “ that the power of any married woman to bequeath or devise her property by will shall be restricted, as regards the husband, to the same extent as the husband’s power, so to dispose of his property, is restricted as regards the wife, namely: so that any surviving husband may, against her will, elect to take such share and interest in her real and personal estate, as she can, Avhen surviving, elect to take against his will, in his estates, or otherwise, to take only her real estate as tenant by the curtesy.</p>

After the expiration of twelve months from the death of the testator the1 Orphans’ Court may, on application of any one interested in the estate, issue a citation to such widow to appear at a certain time, not less than one month thereafter, in said court, to make her election, and if <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>she neglect or refuse to appear upon such citation, upon due proof of service to the court, such neglect or refusal shall be deemed an acceptance of the bequest, &amp;c. And, as the widow and surviving husband are placed upon an equality in regard to the quantity of interest they are to have or may take in the estates of each other, it appears to us but fair that such should he held in the same time and mode of election, and that the husband should be allowed twelve months after the death of his wife within which to make up his mind, and that before doing so he should have a right to compel the exhibition of a true inventory and fair account of the estate by the executors, and if, at the expiration of that time, he fail to elect he should be cited to do so by some one interested in the estate, &amp;c. In the case before us, although Barbara Heisey died in 1862, on the 12th of September, her will was not proved until February 23d 1864, and the executors, for aught that appears in the case stated, have exhibited no inventory in the register’s office, nor have they, nor any one interested in the estate, ever even requested, much less cited, the husband to elect whether or not he would take under the will or the law; but on the contrary he gave them written notice that he would not recognise the will, and that independent and outside of her will he -claimed all his rights in and to her estate to which he was by law entitled. This notice was given soon after the death of the widow of Martin Nissley, at whose decease said money became payable, and before its payment to the executors, and before any inventory was filed by them.</p>
