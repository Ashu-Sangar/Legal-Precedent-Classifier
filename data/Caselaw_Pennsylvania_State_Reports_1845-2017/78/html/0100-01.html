Mr. Power says that the subjects discussed were in relation to the lines of the ground-rents, their apportionment, and the best manner of obtaining a good title to the property in the event of a sale; that no conclusion was arrived at and no definite plan agreed upon, but that it was thought best to sell under the ground-rents, as in that way a title would be obtained to both the Bar.stow and Drayton interests for the ultimate purpose of vesting them in one person, and thus facilitating a sale of the whole; that it was agreed, however, to postpone the sheriff’s sale, as Mr. Eosdick, who was proposed as trustee for the purpose of private sale, was not present, and also in order to settle the manner in which the proceeds of such sales should be distributed.

In another part of his testimony, when asked whether it was not in consequence of instructions or requests received from Caleb Barstow rather than from any agreement or understanding with Mr. Power, that he suffered the sheriff’s sale to proceed, he answers by referring to a letter from Barstow of September 14th 1866, and states that this letter will better answer the question than he can do from mere memory. He states further, that at this lapse of time, and in a case in which there were so many complications and alterations of plans, it is with reluctance that he testifies positively as to more than a few salient points.

Nor is there any evidence to show that he received any valuable consideration from any person whatever. The testimony shows that it was proposed by him, and executed voluntarily by him, without Consideration and without request from any one. It appears also not to have been sealed. The subscribing witnesses only attest the signing, not a sealing or delivery. It was not acknowledged for the purpose of recording, and the evidence is, that when Mr. Power left it with Mr. Grummey, it was with the understanding that it should not be recorded. The subsequent proof and recording of the paper by Mr. Grummey, under direction from Mr. Fosdick, was a clear violation of this understanding, and without any authorization from Mr. Power. It is also evident that Mr. Power was not, at the time of its execution, .the owner of the subject-matter of the trust.' It states an intention to purchase certain real estate, which, if purchased by him, is to be held in trust. It was not, therefore, strictly speaking, a perfect trust,' for something was to be done by him to give it effect, namely, the purchase of the property. Further, he does not, in the instrument, specify himself as the trustee. * * * The proper construction of this paper appears to me to be, that Mr. Power did not by it intend to declare a present trust in himself with respect to the property about to be purchased by him, but that the property, if purchased by him, should afterwards, as soon as the Drayton moiety thereof could be controlled, be conveyed to some trustee to be selected, who should hold both interests, being the entire property, in trust for the purposes mentioned in the instrument. * * * It seems to me, therefore, from the paper itself, and from the circumstances attending its execution, the condition of the property and the relation of the parties, that the purpose in view by Mr. Power was not so much the application of the Barstow moiety in the lands in question to the payment of the debts mentioned, as to secure the application of the Drayton moiety also for this purpose, and the consolidation of both moieties in order that the whole property might be made available for the payment of the indebtedness of Barstow. * * * After an attentive consideration of all the evidence on this subject, I have come to the conclusion that Mr. <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>Power did not intend to create a distinct and independent trust in bimself as to the moiety of Caleb Barstow in the land in question, but that the trust proposed by him was one that should embrace both moieties, and was dependent for its existence upon the securing of the title to the Drayton moiety in said land by some one who would bring it within the trust, and agree upon a trustee to whom the entire property could be conveyed. * * *</p>

The whole history of the efforts of the creditors to collect their debts, and of the legal proceedings employed for that purpose, from the time of Mr. Barstow’s failure, was disclosed. But the general evidence was of a character to corroborate and strengthen direct testimony of the essential fact, rather than to afford independent proof of its existence. At the last, the disposition of the questions in dispute must depend upon the statement of Mr. Rawle. From the multiplied details that are grouped in the record around the main point of dispute, it is believed that if he had been able to say, from a distinct recollection, that the agreement of the 17th of September was the execution of the agreement of the 3d of June, the duty of the master would have consisted in finding the allegations of the bill sustained.

Besides, the fact that the property was held in common with John Egerton, who was not only supposed to be affected in his mind, but had made a peculiar conveyance to his brother-in-law, there were complications as to the Barstow moiety which it was thought this sale would correct, and all parties were acting'in harmony and for the benefit of the Barstows, for whom much sympathy was felt. All considered that if properly managed and nursed, the property would not only pay its debts, but leave a <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>handsome balance to the Barstows. It was therefore agreed by all, that instead of my bidding up the property so as to protect the $75,000 judgment, after the payment of Mr. Power’s judgment and the arrears of the ground-rent, which I think were due, Mr. Power should become the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale, and should hold the property after its purchase in trust, 1st, to pay his judgment; 2d, to pay my $75,000 judgment; and 3d, to pay the Barstow creditors. Such an agreement was reduced to writing, signed by Mr. Power, and witnessed by Mr. Gummey and Mr. Warriner, on the day of the sale. * * * The paper to which I have referred, as executed by Mr. Power, is Exhibit B. of the bill. I cannot swear that I was present at its execution; or, indeed, that I ever saw it, but I think it very probable. Until the night before last, when, for the first time, I carefully read the answer in this case, and when, for the first time, I saw all the evidence, I had never known that the effect and validity of that instrument depended on any contingency whatsoever, or that it meant anything other than -what was expressed on its face. Had it been so, my course of action would have been very different. * * * I have already said that the averment in the answer that Exhibit B. was not intended by either party as a declaration of trust; that it was not intended to be recorded ; that it was recorded through a mistake; and that it was dependent for its validity upon the purchase of Mr. Eosdick, or any one else, of other property, there or elsewhere, or upon any contingency whatsoever, struck me with the greatest surprise. In all the numerous interviews with all these parties and their counsel, no such suggestion was ever made or intimated. I never heard of it before.”</p>

But it is clear from his answers on the cross-examination, that his impressions were derived from his participation in isolated transactions, and that he had not kept himself familiar with the current details of the proceedings in the interval between the meeting in June and the sale in September. In answer to the question whether his interviews and conversations with Mr. Warriner were not confined to the subjects of the American Car Company’s property, and the ground-rents binding this and other property, Mr. Rawle said: “It is impossible for me to say. The interests were very numerous, and more than proportionally complicated, and I cannot discriminate.” He was unable to say positively whether he had ever met Mr. Power before the meeting of the 3d of June 1866; he could not say whether that meeting referred to in his note to Mr. Gummey, was <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>in reference to the Car Company’s property; he could not say who were present on that occasion; and he stated that he should have utterly forgotten that. interview if his memory had not been refreshed by that note. He added: “ The first line of the note is, ‘ we are all sorry,’ &amp;c. Who the ‘ all’ were I cannot now say. Possibly, Mr. Aaron Thompson, who represented a judgment, and probably one of the Barstows. I think it unlikely that there were only Mr. Power and our two selves,” (Mr. Warriner and the witness). In answer to a subsequent question, whether he could now state from recollection that the conversation was on any subject other than the ground-rents, he said: “I cannot answer more particularly than I have already done. I have no recollection of any precise word or sentence, nor even the subject of conversation at that interview. Referring to my note, I see that it says, ‘Mr. Eosdick will be here to-morrow,’ so that, of course, he was not at that interview.” He could not remember when he next saw Mr. Power, nor whether he met him until after the sheriff’s sale in September 1866. He said that to the best of his recollection he saw him on the day when Exhibit B. was executed, but was not certain, and could mention no circumstance other than the general facts he had stated, which induced him to believe he saw Mr. Power that day. He could not remember whether Mr. Power and Mr. Eosdick had called on him together at any time on business, and thought they might have called often, and might never have called at all. In answer to the question, whether he had anything to do with the ground-rent suit brought by Mr. Outerbridge, he said his answer would be a mere matter of inference, connecting the agreement or plan referred to in the postscript of his note with the commencement of the suit ten days afterwards. His recollection, he said, was that of a professional man who remembers results, and sometimes that which led to them, without being able to identify those antecedents. So far as his recollection was distinct, however, he stated that his knowledge of Exhibit B. was not derived purely from hearsay, but from the paper itself. No steps were taken by him to enforce the trust, as he felt that Mr. G-ummey had the matter primarily under his charge. In a later stage of the cross-examination, in answer to the question, “ Can you say that you saw Mr. Power or Mr. Warriner in September 1866, in relation to these matters,” he said, “I can neither affirm nor deny your question, I have no memory whatever on the subject, except a general professional one, which is made up more from inference than direct recollection.”</p>

Power, Fosdick, Grummey and "VVarriner; that the consideration of the agreement for the creation of the contemplated trust was to move from Mr. Fosdick, and that the consideration subsequently failed. If this evidence exhibits the true state of the facts, and the master has found it to be entitled to full credit, it is clear that the plaintiffs cannot hold the defendants liable to account to them by reason of the existence of any such trust as the bill asserts. The plan of action, whatever it may have been, which was settled on the 3d of June, must have been materially modified before the 17th of September 1866. No sales were made on any ground-rent judgments until the autumn of 1868, when the property (embracing both the Barstow and Drayton moieties) was purchased by Mr. Morrill. The sheriff’s sale of 1866 was made on a judgment against Mr. Barstow, which Mr. Power had obtained in the June Term of that year in the District Court.</p>

This appears from the whole tenor of his correspondence, and especially from the terms of his letter to Mr. Rawle, of the 14th of September 1866. But the facts found by the master show that he was not a party to the agreement made on the day of sale, and the evidence indicates that he had no personal knowledge of it. There were obvious reasons why his general creditors in New York would not have been likely to inter: fere. His interest in the property was an undivided moiety, and was encumbered to the extent of'$235,000. Its value, at the time of these proceedings, was purely conjectural. In December 1867, after the partition had been completed, Mr. Rawle wrote to Messrs. Spalding and Richardson, that the whole property had then been recently estimated at $300,000, making the value of the Barstow moiety $150,000. “But,” Mr. Rawle added, “ this estimate is based upon the careful management of the property for probably several years to come. It might be doubtful whether, at a forced sale, it would bring one-sixth of this estimated value. The property has always been unlucky, though it is valuable, and directly opposite the heart of the city, near the Schuylkill.” In this connection, as showing the probable relation of the New York creditors to the transactions by which the title was vested in Mr. Power, a passage in the letter from Messrs. Yose and McDaniel, to Mr. Rawle, dated the 21st of April 1871, is significant. They wrote as follows: “ If this property has really become valuable, <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>and you, after investigation, think money would result from resisting Power and the other people, we might get the parties interested to arouse themselves for a fee.”' The letter from Messrs. Barstow &amp; Pope to Caleb Barstow, written on the 6th of December 1866, affords ground for a legitimate inference that both they and he were in ignorance of the actual arrangement under which the sale had been made in September. It said: “We infer from what you have confidentially communicated to us, that some sort of reciprocal understanding exists between Mr. George E. Power and Mr. W. E. Eosdick. * * * We infer from what you have said as to those two gentlemen being checks on each other, that Mr. Eosdick’s purchase of the American Car Company, was to cover payments he has made, including the satisfying of certain judgments then hanging over the company; also, to pay certain obligations secured by hypothecation of the certificates of the stock of the car company, and then any remaining balance to go towards the payment of the debts of yourself and John Egerton, in such manner as Mr. E. may find advisable. Now, this is probably all very well, but in view of the uncertainties of life, these matters had better be thrown into a safer form. We should, for instance, like to have Mr. Power execute a deed of trust in favor of Mr. Eosdick, as was originally contemplated, declaring the nature of his purchase, and authorizing Mr. Eosdick to act as trustee, and follow out the payment in the order that -was originally contemplated, commencing with Mr. Power’s judgment of $19,000 to $20,000, and so on to the end, and have such writing put on record in Philadelphia, according to law.” It is scarcely credible that such a letter would have been written, if Caleb Barstow, or Barstow &amp; Pope, for whom Mr. Rawle had acted as counsel, had been aware of the existence of the agreement which Mr. Power had executed less than three months before.</p>

The view of the plaintiff as to the effect of the agreement then made, could be supported only by affirmative proof that, in pursuance of that agreement, the paper of the 17th of September, was executed by Mr. Power. Such proof has not been made, and the evidence of the defendants, direct and circumstantial, supports the conclusion which the master reached, that the transaction was exclusive of any participation by the general creditors of Mr. Barstow, and independent of any action they had taken.</p>

As to them, the instrument was voluntary. It stipulated that, on the happening of certain contingencies, a trust should be declared, and the contingencies did not happen. “ A trust will be executed wherever there is a valuable consideration; but where the settlement is merely voluntary, it is commonly supposed that to attract the jurisdiction of the court, there must be what is called a transmutation of the possession — that is, the legal estate must be put out of the settlor; but, perhaps, upon examination of the authorities, the validity of the trust will be found to resolve itself into the question whether or not the trust was at first perfectly created:” Lewin on Trusts 110. In Ellison <em>v. </em>Ellison, 6 Vesey 662, Lord Eldon said: “ If you want the assistance of the court to constitute you <em>cestui que </em>trust, and the instrument be voluntary, you shall not have that assistance; as, upon a covenant to transfer stock, if it rest in covenant and be purely voluntary, the court will not execute it; but if the party have completely .transferred stock, though it be voluntary, yet the legal conveyance being effectually made, the equitable interest will be enforced in this court.” The same rule is applied to imperfect gifts, not testamentary, <em>inter vivos, </em>to imperfect volunteer assignments of debts and other property; to voluntary executory trusts; and to voluntary conveyances: 1 Story’s Eq., sect. 793-6. “Unless the contract has been founded on a valuable or other meritorious consideration, or what is so considered in a court of equity, as the payment of debts, a specific performance will not be decreed. In general, a court of equity will not interfere to carry into effect unexecuted voluntary contracts <em>inter vivos, </em>but will leave the parties to their remedies of law:” Brightly’s Eq., sect. 244; Yard <em>v. </em>Patton, 1 Harris 285; Read <em>v. </em>Robinson, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20331" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 331">6 W. &amp; S. 331</a>. An executory contract must have a consideration to support it, without which equity will no more execute it than the law would make the breach of it the subject of compensation: Brightly’s Eq., sect. 244,. citing Kennedy <em>v. </em>Ware, 1 Barr 450; Campbell’s Estate, 7 Barr 100, and Greenlee <em>v. </em>Greenlee, 10 Harris 235.</p>

The master has found, as a fact, that no fraud was practised by Mr. Power in the purchase of the property. He made no promise by which any creditor was deceived, misled, or induced either to act or to forbear action. A simple avowal of acquisition for the use of another, whether made cotemporaneously with or subsequently to the fact, will not of itself support an allegation of a trust: Robertson <em>v. </em>Robertson, <a href="/watts/9/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Watts 32" data-case-ids="1849959" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0032-01">9 Watts 32</a>. The later propositions and negotiations between the parties cannot stand in the place of proof of some distinct fact requisite to fix on Mr. Power the responsibilities of a trustee. “An attempt to create and enforce a specific trust,” it was said by Mr. Justice Washington, in <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>Slocum <em>et ux. v. </em>Marshall, <a href="/f-cas/22/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Wash.

C. 397</a>, “from the loose expressions of parties made at different times and on different occasion^, would be inconsistent not only with the spirit and policy of the Statute of Frauds, but with the general rules of evidence.” Owing no duty to Mr. Barstow’s creditors, and, so far as they were concerned, dealing with the property as his own, Mr. Power was subject to no imputation of bad’ faith, and the case before the master was not one requiring that he should be held accountable as a trustee <em>ex maleficio, </em>at the instance and for the benefit of the present plaintiffs.</p>
