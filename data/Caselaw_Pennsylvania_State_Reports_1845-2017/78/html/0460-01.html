It is a charge easily made and difficult to defend against; and so sensible is the law of this that evidence is received on behalf of the defence, uniformly disallowed in all other cases. For instance it is permitted the defendant to show, where he can, that the character of the person ravished is bad for chastity — and in order to guard against false charges in cases of this kind — it has been deemed an important test of the sincerity of the woman, that while the commission of the offence was in progress she cried aloud, struggled and complained on the first opportunity, and prosecuted the offender without delay.

[She gives details with minuteness, and if believed, makes out the full charge of rape against the prisoner.] She is supported by Mr. Ramp; the gentleman whose, appearance interrupted the movements of the prisoner; in some of the details, such as his coming into view when he did ; her hurrying up after him, and overtaking, and keeping up with him for one and one-half miles, although he was on horseback, and telling him that there was a man back at the grave-yard that she was afraid of. And Mr. Ramp says that he told her that he had seen the bushes. shake, but he had seen no one. Thus she learned that they were not seen by Ramp, and that he had nothing to disclose, yet nevertheless, she tells her aunt about it next morning, and seemed troubled. Now these circumstances are important in determining whether, as is alleged by defendant, she consented to sexual inter-' course. If she had done so she was deeply interested in concealing it, yet she tells her aunt about it next morning, and at that time, as she had ascertained from Ramp, no one knew it but herself and the young man. Then it is pertinent to inquire why should she reveal the occurrence to her aunt ? and if she consented why was she in trouble ? and if she consented why her hurry to keep up with Ramp. Then it appears that, she had no acquaintance with this defendant; they were strangers to each other; never spoke with each other before; lived four miles apart, and he followed her from his home in Newburg on her way to her home, and is it likely that parties who had no previous knowledge or acquaintance should thus consent to sexual intercourse on the highway ? All these things are to be considered by you.</p>

To convict of rape, it is necessary that the person of the girl should have been penetrated; but any entry, however slight, is sufficient, and there need be no emission of seed. This girl, being over thirteen years of age (she is going on fourteen), was in law capable of consenting to sexual intercourse. Where the consent of the female is obtained, though by fraud and deception, there is no rape; but connection with a woman when insensible or unconscious, from whatever cause, is rape. Absence of assent will constitute rape, except where the female is under ten years’ of age, because children of such tender years are incapable of consenting to connection. But where the consent is obtained by threats of inflicting great bodily injury, that is not the kind of assent which relieves the act from the grade of rape. But even assent after the act is committed is no defence, and if consent is given, but afterwards withdrawn before the act, and the party instead of desisting goes on to consummation, that would be forcible and against consent, and the offence of rape is complete. When there is nothing to deter the woman from resisting, and she is conscious, and able to show dissent and does not, it will be taken as her assent. A doubtful or mixed case, that is, where the evidence renders it uncertain whether the female consented or not, the offence of the rape is not established.</p>

      <em>“ </em>Then did this girl consent ? If she did not, and the prisoner forced her, and prevented her struggles and cries by threatening violence to her person — great bodily harm — and thus he succeeded in penetrating her person but a little, he is guilty of rape, and you should convict. On the question of the consent of Clara, you should consider the probabilities of one so young as thirteen years only being exposed to the promptings of desire, passion and lust. Ordinarily concupiscence does not develop in one so youthful, but sometimes it does, and cases are not infrequent establishing this fact. Yet nature ordinarily gives warning of the age of puberty. * * * Do you discover any such indications about this slender and child-like form ? We see none.</p>

In such a case, the advantage of the Act of the 3d of April 1872, can probably only be secured by asking that the several charges may be separately tried. The decision in Harman <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 12 S. &amp; R. 69, seems to indicate the propriety of some such course. It was said there that “ where two offences are charged, if the defendant can make it appear that this mode of proceeding will subject him to unreasonable difficulty or embarrassment on his trial, the court have it in their power to protect him by quashing the indictment or compelling the prosecutor to elect on which count he will proceed and discharge the defendant from the other.”</p>

But the charge is to be considered not in disjointed fragments, but as a whole. The elements of the crime of rape were stated, the evidence was submitted with adequate accuracy, and the jury were left to say whether, under that evidence, the charge against the prisoner was made out. That it was not the intention of the court to lay down a legal rule for the decision of the cause by saying that “ a girl of tender years could be excused” for failing to make outcry, is manifest from the instructions subsequently given. <em>“ </em>Then,” the court said, <em>“ </em>did this girl consent ? If she did not, and the prisoner forced her, and prevented her struggles and cries by threatening violence to her person — great bodily harm — and thus he succeeded in penetrating her person, he is guilty of rape, and you should convict.” In the same way, the statement that the evidence of the prosecutrix, if believed, made out the full charge of rape, is to be taken in connection with the language of the court in later portions of the charge, by which the facts were submitted to the uncontrolled discretion of the jury. The remaining assignments, except the last, relate to questions that were legitimate subjects for discussion on a motion for a new trial in the court below, but are not open for review on a writ of error.</p>
