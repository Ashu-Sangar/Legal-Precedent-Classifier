By the terms of the will all of the land embraced in the certificate and in the lease was devised, and has been held accordingly by. the complainants.

      <em>“ </em>In the lease the words ‘ to farm let and demise,’ imply a covenant against any title paramount to the lessor: 1 Wash. Real Prop. 427. The effect of w'hich, also, is that he. has a good title, and can give a free, unencumbered lease for the time demised: Id. 428. For the purpose of this part of the case, Alexander Jame-son must be presumed to have known what his title was. He would not have been heard in a court of equity, asserting that he had made a lease for a greater interest than he possessed, and <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>praying for relief by cancellation of his contract. The complainants represent his title, and, therefore, stand upon no higher ground than he did. If the lease is a cloud upon their title, it was created by their testator; and although their acceptance under the will might not prevent their claiming rights descending to them from their maternal ancestor, yet the lease should have . existence to enable the lessee to recover damages for the breach of covenant, if any such breach has occurred. I cannot concur in the conclusion that .the lease is void for want of power on the part of the lessor. The objection to its validity on the ground of uncertainty as to the commencement of the term, is fully answered in the reasons given and authorities cited by the master. It was to begin “ when coal was taken” by the lessee. It is a mistaken construction of this contract to hold that it gave to the lessees an unlimited time in which to commence taking coal. •As no time was specified, the law presumes that the parties intended and agreed that it should be done in a reasonable time : Ellis <em>v. </em>Thompson, 3 M. &amp; W. 445; 2 Pars. Con. 47. * ■* *</p>

Even if it were well founded there would be no occasion for equitable interferences. But the agreement to pay eight cents per ton for all coal mined, is a sufficient consideration to support even an unsealed instrument. Under this lease the lessees were bound, by at least an implied obligation, not only to <em>commence </em>mining coal within a reasonable time, but also to carry on and prosecute mining to a reasonable extent, all of the circumstances considered; and this they were bound to do, under the penalty of either damages or forfeiture, or both. * * *</p>

It would seem that he was familiar with coal leases, having before executed them to other parties. In addition to the testimony of the persons present at the execution of the lease, it appears that in January 1852, he executed a will under which the complainants divided his estate, and still hold title. * * * I am not satisfied that Alexander Jameson, on the 21st December 1852, was wholly incapacitated to transact business. If the lease had been in law subject to the construction contended for by the complainants, I would have no hesitancy in holding that advantage had been taken of the mental weakness ,of the old man, and would presume fraud. If the lessees might begin to mine when they pleased, at any remote, indefinite period, and thereafter might limit their mining to one ton a year, the contract would be so one-sided and unfair as to justify the interference of equity. But, construed according to the rule before stated, considering the probable amount of money necessary to be expended before profit could be received, the lease was a fair contract, and the consideration not so inadequate as to suggest fraud in obtaining it. * * *</p>

Ager assigned to Stephen Pierce in July 1856. Sometime in 1856 Ager se'nt a person upon the premises to take possession. This person began to dig, and having made a hole about ten feet square, and perhaps the same depth, he quit work, upon the service of a summons in trespass upon him at the suit of Jameson.

If they desired the aid of a court of equity they ought to have applied for it and pursued their remedy at an earlier day, instead of waiting thirteen years after the date of the lease, eleven years after they had knowledge of its existence, and six years after the death of the lessor. They abandoned their bill, filed in 1860, and when they filed the present bill in 1865 had no occasion to, ask for protection at the hands of the court. From the time of obtaining the lease to filing of this bill, neither the lessee nor his assigns have made any substantial attempt at performance. The entry that was made in 1856 or 1857 was too late to entitle the lessee to assert rights under the lease. And, besides, the abandonment of possession, because an action of trespass was brought, and the continued omission to commence operations according to the implied requirements of the contract, amounted at the time of the filing of this bill to an abandonment of all claims under it. The complainants, therefore, had no grounds, or at least no occasion to institute these proceedings, and their bill must, therefore, be dismissed.

    <p id="b95-6" data-blocks='[["BL_95.7",95,[167,483,1161,949]]]'>Upon every point on which the mining lease of December 21st 1852, by Alexander Jameson to Charles A. Lane, was .attacked in the bill, the decision of the learned judge below was adverse to the appellants. Want of power in the lessor, incompetency by reason of mental weakness, fraud and undue influence, alteration in the instrument, uncertainty as to the commencement of the term, and want of consideration, are all considered and disposed of, And we think rightly disposed of. There is a clear distinction, well established as a rule in equity, between cases of specific performance and of rescission or cancellation. In many instances, the chancellor will refuse specific performance where he will also refuse to order the instrument to be delivered up to be cancelled, but leave the parties to their legal remedies: Graham ». Pancoast, 6 Casey 89. This case would certainly present itself in a different light, were it a hill by the appellee, praying specific performance and to he put into possession, under the lease. The learned judge below expressed the opinion, not only from the unusual stipulations of the lease, and the great age and mental weakness of the lessor, but also from the lapse of time without any possession taken or operations commenced under the lease, the appellant had no ground to apprehend any successful assertion of the rights of the lessee or his assignees.</p>

Mr. Justice Strong said, very truly, in Kennedy <em>v. </em>Kennedy, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wright%20417" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="7 Wright 417">7 Wright 417</a>, “ there are very many cases analogous to bills of peace in which a chancellor has interfered to quiet the enjoyment of a right, or to establish it by a decree, or to remove a cloud from the title. Indeed, this is one of the well recognised branches of equitable jurisdiction, though its extent is not clearly defined.” It has been maintained, that an instrument wholly void upon its face, would carry its own condemnation with it, and would not be in a proper and legal sense, a cloud upon the title: Hotchkiss <em>v. </em>Etting, 36 Barbour S. C. Rep. 45, and cases there cited. Mr. Justice Story considers it to be now fully established, that in such cases, courts of equity will not interpose their authority to order a cancellation or delivery up of such instruments: 2 Story Eq. Jur. 700. Chancellor Kent, however, in Hamilton <em>v. </em>Cummings, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Johns.%20Ch.%20522" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Johns. Ch. 522">1 Johns. Ch. Rep. 522</a>, after an exhaustive examination of the English precedents says, <em>“ </em>I am inclined to think that the weight of authority and the reason of the thing are equally in favor of the jurisdiction of the court, whether the instrument is or is not void at law, and whether it be void from matter <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>appearing on its face or from proof taken in the cause, and that these assumed distinctions are not well founded.” He adds: “ Perhaps the cases may all be reconciled on the general principle, that the exercise of this power is to be regulated by sound discretion, as the circumstances of the individual case may dictate; and that the resort to equity to be sustained, must be expedient, either because the instrument is liable to abuse from its negotiable nature, or because the defence, not arising on its face, may be difficult or uncertain at law or from some other special circumstances peculiar to the case, and rendering a resort here highly proper and clear of all suspicion of any design to promote expense and litigation.” The best expression of the rule, as it seems to me, is to be found in an opinion of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in Martin <em>v. </em>Graves, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Allen%20661" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="5 Allen 661">5 Allen 661</a>, by Merrick, J. “ Whenever a deed or ■other instrument exists, which may be vexatiously or injuriously used against a party, after the evidence to impeach or invalidate it is lost, or which may throw a cloud or suspicion over his title or interest, and he cannot immediately protect or maintain his right by any course of proceedings at law, a court of equity will afford relief by directing the instrument to be delivered up and cancelled, or by making any other decree which justice or the rights of the parties may require.” It is certainly a matter in the sound discretion of the court, in view of all the circumstances of the case, and the power ought not to be exercised, except in a very clear case.. We think this is not such a case. To exercise it here, would be in effect to overrule the well-settled principle of chancery, which has already been adverted to, an'd say, that whenever a chancellor, on account of the laches of the adverse claimant, or the unreasonableness of the contract, or the mental weakness of the. party, would decline to enforce the contract by a specific performance, he will order it to be delivered up to be cancelled, when it may operate to cloud the title. The lessees or their assignees ought not to be deprived of their legal remedies, and their constitutional right of trial by jury, as they would be by such a decree.</p>
