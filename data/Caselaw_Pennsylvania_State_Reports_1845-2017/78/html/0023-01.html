    <p class="summary" id="b23-10" data-blocks='[["BL_23.11",23,[188,1111,1161,731]]]'>The case of the plaintiffs was, that on the 5th of May 1870, the schooner was lying at Cramp’s wharf, on the river Delaware, in Philadelphia; the vessel had her cargo aboard. Cramp’s wharf was a short wharf not extending out to the port warden’s line; immediately below it was the Kensington Waterworks wharf, belonging to the city; this wharf extended to the port warden’s line, and was 99 feet further out than Cramp’s wharf. About four o’clock P. M. it was attempted to haul the vessel into the stream; to accomplish this a line was run from her bow to the outer end of the long wharf, and another line from her stern to the end of the short wharf; she was then hauled safely until her bow was a few feet beyond the long wharf, where she went aground; after making efforts unsuccessfully to get her off, about two o’clock in the next morning it was discovered that she had “broken her back ” — as was afterwards ascertained — from having grounded on a rock on which she rested “amidship,” and as the tide fell she settled “fore and aft,” and broke into two pieces.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b23-11" data-blocks='[["BL_23.12",23,[192,1843,1159,303]]]'>The evidence on the trial was substantially as above stated. It also appeared by the plaintiffs’ evidence, that the rock was a natural formation and part of the bed of the river ; before the wharf was built it had been exposed, so that a person might stand on it at low water; the wharf had been partially built on it; since the building of the wharf, the tide does not fall sufficiently to expose it to view.</p>

That it was uneven in surface is evident from the fact that as the tide ebbed and the schooner pressed her bottom upon it, she dipped her bow and stern, while the middle remained stationary, thus causing her to “break her hack.” Whether the rock was embedded in mud, which gave way under the bow and stern, or whether it rose in projection from the general surface of its adjacent parts, is not disclosed by the evidence. It would be dangerous to carry the defi<a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>nition of an obstruction, as the term is used in the Act of May 2d 185.4, sect. 28, to a natural bottom of the river such as this. Without holding that no natural formation lying in the way of safe navigation is an obstacle, or that the ■ city is not compellable to remove any obstacle to navigation of the most dangerous sort, we may safely say, that the alleged obstruction in this case is not shown to be within the act, especially where no notice has been given to the city authorities of its existence. The case of Winpenny <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 15 P. F. Smith 140, decided that the navigable waters within the city were not confined to the waters within the port wardens’ line, but did not. hold the converse, that the waters within that line were not navigable waters within the meaning of the act. That question remains untouched.</p>
    <p id="b25-6" data-blocks='[["BL_25.5",25,[172,964,1165,74]]]'>We discover no error to be corrected, and the judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>
