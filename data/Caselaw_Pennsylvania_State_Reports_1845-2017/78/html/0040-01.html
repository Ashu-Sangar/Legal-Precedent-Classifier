At the time of the distribution of the corpus of his estate, he ordered it to be divided into six parts ; one part he eave.to his son Guy, and in case of his death without issue before the distribution, he gave it over, with the proviso that if he died before the time of distribution without issue, $5000 in Allegheny bonds should be paid to Guy’s wife.

In the event that ‘ his wife Marian shall then be living’ would indicate ‘ then’ as pointing to the time of her husband’s death. The rule, however, by which a will is to be construed, requires us to examine the whole instrument. Every sentence and word in a will must be considered in forming a judicial opinion upon it: Turbett <em>v. </em>Turbett,. <a href="/yeates/3/0186-02" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Yeates 187" data-case-ids="6772688" data-case-paths="/yeates/3/0186-02">3 Yeates 187</a>. The intention of the testator drawn from the words of a will, taken altogether, must govern in its construction: Lynn <em>v. </em>Downes, <a href="/yeates/1/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Yeates 518" data-case-ids="6777071" data-case-paths="/yeates/1/0518-01">1 Yeates 518</a>. The intention of the testator, said Yeates, Justice, in Eindlay <em>v. </em>Riddle,. <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Binn.%20149" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Binn. 149">3 Binn. 149</a>, has always been deemed the first great leading fundamental rule in the construction of wills. It is true, the intention of the testator shall not govern in the construction of a will where the rule of law overrules the intention. This is said to be reduceable to four' instances: 1. Where the devise would make a perpetuity; 2. Where it would put the freehold in abeyance; 3. Where chattels are limited in inheritances; and, 4. Where a fee is limited on a <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>fee: <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Dallas%20244" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Dallas 244">2 Dallas 244</a>. To this list may be added the case where the Act of Assembly of 27th April 1855, makes that a fee-simple estate which the testator intended should be a fee-tail only. None of these exceptional cases, however, interpose in this case to prevent full effect being given to the testator’s intention. It is the general intent of a will which controls in its construction. Hence, the general intent being first ascertained, a court will, in order to give effect to such intent, overlook a particular intent inconsistent therewith : Findlay <em>v. </em>Riddle, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Binn.%20150" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Binn. 150">3 Binn. 150</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b43-6" data-blocks='[["BL_43.5",43,[161,792,1166,1637]],["BL_44.1",44,[310,408,1163,941]]]'>“ Tested by these rules, and examining the whole will, we discover the great controlling idea and intention of the testator to be as expressed in the third item, ‘ that no division or distribution of my estate shall be made until after the expiration of five years from the day of my death.’ Within those five years certain legacies are made payable out of the income from his estate; but no portion of the principal shall be disturbed. After having made a disposition of the income to his several descendants, and persons intermarried therewith, in each case referring to the subsequent distribution of his estate, he says : ‘ After the expiration of five years, and when the time shall arrive for the division and distribution of my estate, it is my will that the whole of my estate, real, personal, and mixed, shall be disposed of as follows.’ Then, after making some provision for several of his grandchildren, he again recurs to a general distribution in these words: ‘ After the expiration of five years, and when the time shall arrive for the division and distribution of my estate, as hereinbefore provided for, it is my will that the whole of my estate that shall remain after the aforesaid legacies are paid and provided for shall be disposed of as follows.’ Then follow other legacies to several other of his grandchildren, after which the testator says : <em>e </em>It is my will that the whole of the remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, shall be divided into four equal parts.’ The income from one part thereof is given to each of his three several daughters during life, with power to dispose of the said part by will. The other fourth part thereof is given ‘ to my son Gruy Bryan Schott; and in case of his death, before the distribution of my estate to his lawful issue, if he shall have any; and in default of lawful issue his interest shall cease and his share shall be equally divided between his sisters. * * * But if my son shall be living when the time arrives for the distribution of my estate, his share shall be paid to him and at his own disposal.’ Then immediately follows the clause first quoted, under which the plaintiff rests her right to recover upon the death of her husband. It appears from the portions of the will recited that no general distribution of the property, no division of the principal, was to be made until five years after the death of the testator. Neither son, nor daughter, nor grandchild, was entitled to receive one dollar of the principal within the five years. Within that time <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>the legacies given to all of them were to be paid out of the income only. If the construction claimed by the plaintiff be correct she stands upon higher ground than either of the legatees in whose veins the blood of the testator flows. Within the five years she can withdraw a portion of the principal of the estate: none of his descendants can. The general intent of the will leads to an entirely different conclusion. To give effect to that general intent, we say the true reading of the will is, ‘ in the event of the death of my son G. Bryan before the distribution of my estate, leaving no lawful issue, and his wife Marian shall be living at the time of said distribution.’ May we so change the language to effectuate the general intent? Words maybe added, altered, or rejected, for that purpose: Duffield <em>v. </em>Morris, 4 P. L. J. 79. The construction claimed by the plaintiff destroys the symmetry of the will, and would produce results inconsistent with the whole spirit of the distribution of the property proposed.by the testator; while the other view, that the plaintiff is not entitled to the bonds until the general distribution of the property shall be made at the expiration of five years after the death of the testator, harmonizes all his dispositions, an.d accomplishes all his intentions. We may, therefore, safely conclude that the latter is the true will of the testator : Earp’s Will, 1 Pars. 457.</p>
