The law presumes every man to be sane; that is the presumption of law. It also presumes that every man possesses a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, and that presumption continues until the contrary be proven. To establish a defence upon the ground of insanity it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing the act, the prisoner was laboring under such a defect of reason as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong. This is the general rule, but we will more particularly say that ‘ when the reason is dethroned, when a man has not power to distinguish right from wrong, or lacks power to adhere to the right and abstain from the wrong, he is not accountable to criminal law.’ Or if the prisoner was actuated by an irresistable inclination to kill, ‘had murder in his heart,’ and was utterly unable to control his will or subjugate his intellect, and was <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>not actuated by a wicked purpose, or intent to indulge in this depraved propensity to have sexual connection with the deceased, was not actuated by anger or revenge or kindred passions, he is entitled to be acquitted; provided the jury believe that the state of mind, now referred to, has been proven to have existed by satisfactory evidence, at least by preponderating evidence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b124-6" data-blocks='[["BL_124.5",124,[274,659,1166,516]]]'>“ The presumption of law is that he is sane; that he is responsible for any act he may do. The burden then is upon him to show that he was not responsible, by reason of inability to commit crime, and in connection with this, we cannot say, as a test, that because a man is of w'eak mind, that therefore he is excused from the commission of crime; such is not the law. If he has sufficient strength of mind to form a purpose and intent, to know and distinguish between right and wrong, to know the act is wrong, and power to abstain from it, if he had that power, although his mind was as weak as testified to by Dr. Shultz, and was not compelled, as it were, by some power outside of himself to commit the act, then he is responsible.</p>

Is it satisfactory and preponderating evidence to establish the fact that at the time he committed this act, it was not his act but the act of some power controlling him, an irresistible power ? If so, then you should acquit him. It would be monstrous to convict a man of any crime he is not capable of committing, and who does not know right from wrong, and has no moral sense or convictions about it. But, on the other hand, if this evidence does not preponderate and satisfy you that at the time he committed this act he was insane and unable himself to do it, it is clearly your duty to convict him of such crime as in your judgment, under the law, he has committed. The presumption of law is that every person charged with a crime is innocent until he is proven guilty. In this case, the prisoner admits the fact that he committed the crime, and the only question, therefore, for the jury to determine is, was the prisoner capable of committing a crime ? Did he know the act was wrong ? Did he know the nature and character of it ? Was he conscious of what he did at the time?

The prisoner, miserable in severable senses, has been convicted, on a full and fair trial, of a most revolting crime; yet, owing to the mixed system of criminal proceedings in this state, and the want of skill, or of care, in the double office filled by a single clerk, we are perplexed with errors of procedure which under a single system of criminal jurisdiction, and more skill in the office, would not occur. We are relieved partially in the consideration of the assignments of error, by the full and complete record of the trial in the Oyer and Terminer, made out probably under the superintendence of the presiding judge. The rule of this court being to confine itself strictly to the record proper, and to affirm, if no error affecting the rights or-interests of the prisoner appear therein, we are saved from considering the formal errors assigned, excepting two; Cathcart <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/wright/1/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="1 Wright 108" data-case-ids="625928,626070" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0108-01,/wright/1/0108-02">1 Wright 108</a>; Girts <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 10 Harris 351.</p>

It would be a shame if this were not amendable, and we think there was sufficient before the court to amend by. No venire for grand jurors had issued out of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, and the indictment was, in fact, found in the Court of Quarter Sessions, from which the venire had ■issued, so that the mistake in the caption was obvious, and its amendment affected no real interest or right of the prisoner. The Court of Quarter Sessions having jurisdiction to find the indictment and send it into the Court of Oyer and Terminer for trial, the error in the caption was purely technical, and the amendment did the prisoner no harm.</p>
    <p id="b127-6" data-blocks='[["BL_127.5",127,[175,867,1164,1550]]]'>The next assignment of error is more formidable, yet we think it fell within the power of amendment. The indictment found in the Quarter Sessions had not been formally certified into the Court of Oyer and Terminer at the time of trial. Afterwards, under a <em>mine pro tune </em>order, it was regularly certified in due form into the Court of Oyer and Terminer, and so appears on the record of that court. We think, under the authority of Dougherty <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 19 P. F. Smith 293,-the amendment <em>mine pro tune </em>was properly allowed. The prisoner was tried before judges having jurisdiction of his crime, by a jury duly selected and empannelled, on an indictment found by a grand jury having power to inquire of the offence, in a court having jurisdiction of the inquiry ; and the indictment being, in fact, sent into and in possession of the Oyer and Terminer, and sufficient and regular in charging the offence. Both courts are held by the same judges, and a single clerk fills the office of clerk in each. Why, then, should it be deemed a stretch of power to make the amendment, even after error brought ? Every substantial right of the prisoner was observed, and nothing but the formality of the certificate was wanting. The lodging of a writ of error is no test in such a case, but it is the power of the court, and the propriety of making the amendment. Where the court has the power, and exercises it properly, this court will not inquire into the state of the record before the return of the writ, but will look only at its condition, when returned in obedience to the writ. If, then, it appears to be regular, its previous condition will be disregarded. Our province is not to look for errors merely to reverse, but to look for merits in the cause of reversal; and when we find the court below has done no more than it could rightly do, and when what it did infringes no right or substantial interest of the prisoner, we ought not to send back for a re-trial a cause fully, fairly and justly determined. We think this assignment of error, when examined, is found to be without substantial merit. The day of mere technicality is past, and courts should look more at substantial justice than artificial nicety ; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Keenan, 17 P. F.

The case of Ortwein <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 26 P. F. Smith 414, decided in January last by this court, was not known to the counsel at the time of trial. That case decides the question, and we shall only refer to it.</p>

But the charge has a plain English meaning, referring to the nature of the act, and when taken in connection with other parts of the charge, this portion is not susceptible of misconstruction. All the judge said referred plainly, not to the mere act, but to the prisoner’s consciousness of what he did as a crime. The phrase, <em>“ </em>conscious of what he was doing,” is idiomatic, and is understood to mean the real nature and true character of the act as 'a crime, and not to the mere act itself. As used by the judge in connection with what else he said, it was not contradictory or misleading. A memorable instance of this idiomatic use of the word <em>what </em>is found in the language of our Saviour on the cross, when he said, <em>“ </em>Father, forgive them; for they <em>know not what they </em>do !” Clearly,. the Jews knew well that they were crucifying Jesus, but their darkened minds were unconscious of the great crime they were committing.</p>
