A suit was brought in that county against the administrator by John Reck, No. 53, to the April Term of the Court of Common Pleas, for the support, funeral expenses, &amp;c., of the widow — she having made no claim for any portion of the fund in her lifetime — and judgment was recovered by Reck against the administrator for $509.50. The petitioner settled his account in Huntingdon county as administrator, charging himself with $50, the interest on $1000, which had accrued at the widow’s death. Reck filed exceptions to'the account, asking that the accountant should be surcharged with so much of the principal of the $1000 in the hands of the executors of Joseph Blocher, deceased, as would pay the judgment and costs; the auditor, to whom the exceptions were referred, made a report, which being under consideration on exceptions, the Orphans’ Court of Huntingdon county held the matter under advisement until the Orphans’ Court of Adams county should make a decree ordering or refusing to order the executors of Joseph Blocher to pay to the administrator, &amp;c., of Elizabeth Blocher, deceased, so much of the principal sum of $1000 as should be sufiicient to satisfy the judgment, &amp;c., recovered by Reck.</p>

It is a rule of common sense as well as law not to attempt to construe that which needs no construction. The testator in the will before us has said, in plain unmistakable English, that his widow should receive during her life the interest of one thousand dollars, to be put at interest by his executors, “ and should the interest of the same be insufficient to provide for her, then as much of the principal as may be required.” After her death “the balance of the thousand dollars to be disposed of ” the same as the balance of his other property. Nothing but this balance was given over, whatever that balance might be. The children entitled to this balance undoubtedly took a vested interest in it, that is, in case of their death before the widow, their respective shares would have passed to their personal representatives. But what that interest would be, would depend upon what the balance was. It is contended, however, that as the widow made no demand for any of the <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>principal during her lifetime, the whole fund went over. But where is that condition written in the will? The words are, “as much of the principal as may be required to provide for her.” The testator may have well anticipated that a state of things might occur when others must provide for her. He did not mean that as long as the one thousand dollars lasted, she should be thrown upon public or private charity for support. Can it be doubted, then, that a person who has supplied her with necessaries, with nursing, and medical attendance during her last sickness, and a decent Christian burial on her decease, has an equitable claim upon this fund for reimbursement ? It would be to make her sin in her grave to suppose that, with a right to call upon any part of the whole of this fund, she did not intend so to do in order to pay this honest and meritorious creditor. Her administrator then had a right to call for the amount necessary for this purpose. The judgment of John Reck against the administrator, in an action in which he alleged a special contract with the widow for her support, in the absence of any allegations of fraud or collusion with the administrator, was at least primá, facie, if not conclusive, evidence of the justice of the claim. We think, therefore, that the court below erred in refusing to grant the prayer of the petition of the appellant.</p>
