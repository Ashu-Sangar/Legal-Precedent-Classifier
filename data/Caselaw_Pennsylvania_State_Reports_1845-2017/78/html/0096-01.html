Kiff gave Moore ten notes, one payable each consecutive year without interest; judgment was entered on them ; at the same time ten plain notes were given for the interest, payable yearly. Kiff made payments to Moore from time to time; neither party made any appropriation of these payments to either debt. More than six years after the interest notes were due, in a scire facias on the judgment, the court charged “ as the interest notes are now barred by the statute, these payments must be applied to the debt in controversy.” <em>Held </em>to be error.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b98-8" data-blocks='[["BL_98.7",98,[272,615,1164,1120]]]'>“ The defendants insist that this credit (for the Columbia farm) should be $910 instead of $570.16; it is for you to determine under the evidence which is the true amount. * * * We understood from the evidence that the price of the 350 acres resold to plaintiff, as well as the amount paid by Samuel Kiff, was to apply upon the .debt in judgment now sought to be revived; but the counsel for the plaintiff insist that these payments must be applied to the interest notes first, and the balance to the judgment. They argue that the agreement of 3d May 1850, shows this to be true. The amount of those interest notes has not been stated, though the notes were to be considered in evidence. No money or sums were ever applied by Moore to either debt, and as the interest notes are now barred by the statute, it seems to us that these payments must be applied to the debt in controversy. You have then 350 acres at $5.50 per acre, making $1925. The amount of endorsements and costs made by sheriff, $336.67. The sum paid by Samuel Kiff, according to Mr. Moore, $570.16; making in all $2831.83. The debt was $3150, and the balance due the plaintiff by this calculation would be $319, and the interest on that sum from the 24th June 1856, the time when the last note became due. But the defendants claim that the amount paid by Samuel Kiff was $910. If you adopt that view of the evidence, it makes the payment $339.84 more, and that would fully pay the judgment. The defendants also claim that they should be allowed for 2000 pounds of sugar at 10 cents per pound, but we have already said all that is necessary upon that item.” * * *</p>

It amounts substantially to an allegation, that the court below erred , in submitting a question of fact to the jury. What other disposition the court could have made of it does not appear.</p>
    <p id="b99-10" data-blocks='[["BL_99.13",99,[168,1103,1161,513]]]'>We think the learned judge erred in instructing the jury that the payment made by the defendants, must be applied to the principal of the debt in controversy, to the exclusion of the interest notes. He places this upon the ground, that the latter were barred by the statute, as will be seen from the following extract from his charge : “ No money or sums were ever applied by Moore to either debt, and as the interest notes are now barred by the statute, it seems to us, that these payments must be applied to the debt in controversy.” The error of this reasoning consists in the fact, that at the time of the agreement of November 28th 1849, the interest notes, referred to, were not barred. It is not pretended that any payments have been made since that date.</p>
    <p id="b99-11" data-blocks='[["BL_99.14",99,[162,1616,1165,816]],["BL_100.1",100,[284,424,1157,385]]]'>It does not appear that Moore ever applied the payments made prior to said agreement, or the price át which the land was resold, to either class of notes. Nor was any such application made by the defendants. It remains, therefore, for the law to apply them. Where money is paid generally upon a debt, the obvious rule is, to apply it first, to the interest, if any, in arrears, and then the ex-tinguishment of the principal. Is there any valid reason why such rule should not be applied in this case ? This transaction, as it stood originally, was a sale of a farm, with the stock, for the sum of $3150. Notes were to be given for this sum, <em>with interest, </em>to be secured by a judgment. When the parties came to close it up, for some reason, separate notes were given for the interest, and they were made payable in pork and sugar. By the subsequent agreement of November 28th 1849, Moore was to take the land back at $5.50 per acr , and this price, as well as former payments, was to be credited upon the original indebtedness. In the precise language of the agreement, it was to be admitted as payment of “said several notes.” What notes? The notes for the principal only ? There is not a word in the agreement to in<a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>dicate this. The parties evidently contemplated the payment of the debt due Moore, not merely the principal of that debt. Nor is the fact that the interest notes were payable in pork and sugar material, unless there had been an offer to show payment in those particular commodities. The defendants had a right to pay in pork and sugar. An offer to do so would have been a sufficient answer to a demand for payment. But a failure to show either payment, or an offer of payment, in these articles, fixes the liability of the defendants to pay in money.</p>
