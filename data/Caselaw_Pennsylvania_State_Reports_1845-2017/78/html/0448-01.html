The will, when presented for probate, showed an erasure of the valuations and other valuations interlined. One of the witnesses having died, his writing was proved and the will admitted to probate by the register. In an issue on appeal, the will was admitted as primfi, facie under the probate. The surviving witness testified that the alteration was made after the execution by direction of the testator, afterwards re-acknowledged before the same two witnesses; the handwriting of the deceased witness was proved on the issue. <em>Held, </em>that the paper as offered was not proved as a will.</p>

I think there were two words in each case, where there are erasures, and ink lines drawn over them. Although uncertain as to the amounts that they were, I am certain that they were higher than they now are, in those two devises, at the time the will was signed than they now appear upon the face of the paper. These alterations were made before the death of my son Albert, which occurred in December, 1871; I think these alterations were made in the summer of 1871, in my office, by me, while he was sitting by my side; I do not think that any other person was in my office at the time. After the alterations were made Mr. Charles acknowledged the will in the presence of my son Albert and myself; at the time Mr. Charles signed his will my son Albert and I signed it as witnesses; my son Albert is dead, and this is his signature to the will; after the date of the will, during the lifetime of my son, Mr. Charles came to my office and requested me to make these alterations. After the alterations were made, as he wished them, he acknowledged the will in my presence and in the presence of my son Albert; he preferred these alterations in the place of making a codicil.”</p>
