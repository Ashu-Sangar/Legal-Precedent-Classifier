When the eighteen years were up they complained that I had given the boys homes and they had nothing. I proposed to give it to them as I had given the land to the boys, that is, at what it was assessed at by the assessor. All Weaver said was, he’d like to have it for his own, but he could not take it. I had no conversation with him about it after that. After the eighteen years I said he must now pay me rent, either the third bushel or $&gt;50 ; he said not a word. I demanded rent several times; he never said a word.

    <p id="APy6" data-blocks='[["BL_448.5",448,[264,599,1156,1242]]]'>Even the testimony of Weaver and his wife did not come up to the requirement of the rule that the evidence of the contract must be direct, positive, express and unambiguous: Ackerman <em>v. </em>Fisher, 7 P. F. Smith 457. A chancellor must look at the whole evidence, and in this case the uncontradicted fact that during Weaver’s possession Sower sold and conveyed a part of the land with Weaver’s knowledge and assent, for a school-house, would, of itself, contradict the inference of a parol gift. But how stands the case since the Act of 1869, and supposing that the testimony of Weaver and his wife made out the gift ? The defence was a purely equitable one. Had the defendant gone into a court of equity for a specific performance, or for an injunction to restrain the plaintiff from pursuing his legal title to turn him out of possession, the denial of the plaintiff on oath of the equity of the bill would have compelled the complainant in the bill to sustain it by two witnesses, or what would be equivalent thereto. Here George Sower, under oath, fairly and squarely denied all the equity which Weaver set up. Admitting Weaver and his wife to amount together to one sufficient witness, where is the remaining witness, or that which is equivalent thereto ? It is not to be found in the case. It is clear that this well established rule of equity must be applied in cases of this character, or the rule must be abolished on the equity side of the court. As long as equitable ejectments may be maintained and equitable defences set up at law to legal titles, we must see to it that the same rule and measure of justice be applied, whether the proceeding be at law or in equity. We adopted and announced this principle in the opinion in the Dollar Savings Fund <em>v. </em>Bennett, 26 P. F. Smith 402, decided at Pittsburg, November 1874, and it is our purpose to adhere to it.</p>
