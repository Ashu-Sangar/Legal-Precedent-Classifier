Of this sum $22,229 were due to Coates Brothers; $15,893.45 to Bullock’s Sons, and $13,877.07 to Seth B. Stitt. On the 30th of May 1864, the firm of Paul Klotz entered into an agreement with their above-named creditors, reciting their indebtedness to them and that the firm was unable then to pay them, but-desired to secure them; and by the agreement assigned, &amp;c., to those creditors all their stock of wool and materials used in the manufactory, their tools and implements, machinery, &amp;c., with all their personal property, as collateral security for the debts due to the assignees, the assignees to have an inventory of this property made, and have the stock worked up and sold, the proceeds to be appropriated first to the payment of expenses, thén to pay the debts due the assignees, and the balance to be paid to the firm of Paul Klotz ; the assignees to have the use of Grlen Bank Mills for the purpose of manufacturing for four months, they to pay out of the sales the interest on mortgages on the premises and the taxes. On the 4th of June 1864, Klotz and Armstrong executed to the same three creditors two mortgages on their real estate, machinery, &amp;c., each for $100,000 ; one to secure the before-mentioned indebtedness, and the other to secure future advances, &amp;c. On the same day another agreement was entered into between the same parties; it recited the agreement of May 30th 1864, to which it was to be a supplement, the mortgage to secure the indebtedness ; the understanding was that the mortgagees should take possession of the real estate under the mortgage, and continue the business until the indebtedness should be paid; it recited also the second mortgage for advances, this mortgage to be recorded immediately after the first mortgage, so as to constitute a second lien; it was then agreed that the agreement of May 30th should remain in full force until its object was accomplished; that the assignees should have the additional right to continue the business, to make advances on account of the business, to purchase and sell machinery, wool and other materials, to employ operatives, sell goods, and out of the proceeds reimburse themselves for their expenses, to replace stock and machinery, and apply the proceeds to the extinguishment of the debts due the same creditors, and to reimburse them any sums they might expend in purchasing the debts of the firm, until the money advanced and expended and the amounts owing should be discharged, and the balance, if any, then to be paid over to the firm ; also that Klotz and Armstrong <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>had transferred in mortgage all their personal property, &amp;c., belonging to and in and about Glen Bank Mills, and any property which might thereafter be purchased by the mortgagees in the course of the business, to hold as collateral security for existing indebtedness to 'the mortgagees, then for the sums they might pay out ‘in the purchase of debts of the firm or advances or liabilities incurred in carrying on the business; also, that nothing in the agreement was to compel the mortgagees to continue the business longer than they deemed advisable, nor to deprive them of their right to sell under the mortgages all the real and personal property whenever they should deem it expedient.

The 58th section of the Act of 13th June 1836 makes it the duty of the jury to find what goods or effects, if any, were in the hands of the garnishee, and also the value thereof. A liability to render an account is a very different thing from a liability for the payment of money. On the settlement of the account it may turn out that nothing is due or coming to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b315-12" data-blocks='[["BL_315.19",315,[217,2315,1161,128]],["BL_316.1",316,[246,418,1160,643]]]'>The case before us exhibited only a liability to render an account.

It is true that a large amount of property was shown to have gone into their hands, much greater than sufficient to pay the plaintiff’s claim. But the evidence also shows that this property went rightfully into their hands upon certain terms of agreement which gave the garnishees a right to retain the property and its avails until their claims and those of others were paid. In the performance of the duties enjoined by these agreements large expenses and outlays were to be necessarily incurred, and therefore the value of the property and the amounts of the claims it was taken to pay could not alone solve the question of balance. A settlement of an account was essential to determine the question whether any balance remained in the hands of the garnishees. Clearly it was the duty of the plaintiff to make out a case of indebtedness at least sufficient to enable him to recover in an action of assumpsit. Judgment affirmed.</p>
