Lyon, residing in Fulton county in 1873, and being the owners of a number of mules, with their harness, &amp;c., used them in their business in Bedford county. In July 1873, they removed their mules, &amp;c., from Bedford county to their residence in Fulton county, which was with Chestnut, on premises belonging to him. At that time, they were indebted to Harbaugh and Cessna, the defendants. After the mules came to their residence, on the premises of the plaintiff, he selected two mules; they sold them and their gears to him for $300, and on Sunday, July 27th 1873, Chestnut gave his note to John W. Lyon for that sum, payable in twelve months. On the same day Lyon removed the rest of the mules from plaintiff’s premises and sold them to one of his creditors. On the 30th of July 1873, the defendants, alleging that the sales by the Lyons wore fraudulent, issued' an attachment out of the Common Pleas of Fulton county, under the Act of March 17th 1869, Pamph. L. 8, 1 Br. Purd, 53, pi. 71, <em>et seq., </em>and attached the mules and gears, which had been bought by the plaintiff from Lyons. This issue was then framed. The questions raised upon the trial, were whether the sale to plaintiff was fraudulent and void as against the creditors of the Lyons, and whether it was void as having been made on Sunday. The latter question only is considered in the decision of the Supreme Court.</p>

There is no positive evidence that they were delivered on Sunday, nor is it clear when they were delivered; the jury must ascertain.

    <p id="b476-7" data-blocks='[["BL_476.8",476,[274,799,1167,1156]]]'>We think the court erred in instructing the jury that if the contract of sale between Lyon and Chestnut was consummated on Sunday it was void, and no property in the mules passed to Chestnut, and there was none in him at the time of the service of attachment. We have many authorities, among others, Baker <em>v. </em>Lukens, 11 Casey 146, and Shuman <em>v. </em>Shuman, 3 Id. 90, which rule that an executed contract is not void because made on Sunday. The Sunday law does not pronounce such contracts void, but because they are <em>contra bonos mores </em>the law will not lend its aid to execute such as are executory. Where, however, as in the present case, they have been executed by the parties, the law leaves them as it finds them. From this it follows, that Chestnut having obtained the possession of the property in dispute, by a voluntary delivery from Lyon; as against him and all claiming through him, the title passed to and vested in Chestnut; for the contract, though immoral, is irrevocable, inasmuch as the courts will not aid either party in its revocation, but will leave him to reap the fruits of his own wrong. Such then being the situation of affairs, it follows that Chestnut’s possession was primá facie title, and if the transaction between him and the Lyons was not in fraud of, or designed to hinder or delay, creditors in the collection of their just dues, there is no reason why he should not recover in this suit. We may say, in passing, that this Sunday contract may be given in evidence as part of the history of the transactions between the parties, and may in this way bear upon the question of fraud. All other questions in the case were rightly ruled.</p>
