The assessment book for the same township, in the year 1819, exhibits a return also of the same land, with a like content, and a valuation of $372. The assessment of a tax amounting to $1.86, by the proper officers, followed as a matter of course. No payment of this tax was made within the period prescribed by the statute; and, therefore, it became the duty of the treasurer on the second Monday of June 1820, having first given the requisite notice, to make a public sale of the whole tract for the unpaid tax, together with all costs necessarily accrued. [While, under the law, all sales of this character were to be commenced on the second Monday of June, still, authority was given to the treasurer to adjourn from day to day, if it should be found necessary so to do. The late George M. Hollenback was then treasurer of Luzerne county; and, if we are to judge from the official entries and from the documents themselves, the presumption is legitimate, indeed, irresistible, that the necessity for that sort of adjournment contemplated by the statute, then really existed. True, no note of adjournment from day to day was made by the officer either in the sale book, or elsewhere; true, also, the fact appears as well from the treasurer’s deed, as from an entry in the sale book, that he sold this tract of land on the 8th of November 1820. But, upwards of fifty-three years have elapsed since this official act was consummated. That all things were done in due form to warrant it, is a presumption now not to be resisted.]</p>

Such a contingency seems to have happened at that sale. At all events, George M. Hollenback, treasurer, on the 2d of December 1820, executed and delivered to Cyrus Avery, Joel Rogers and Samuel Tost, commissioners of Luzerne county, a deed containing the ordinary recitals, for the Samuel Rope tract.

Their right to recover here must depend upon the strength of their own title, not upon the weakness of that of their adversaries. The sale by the commissioners, and the deed under it, constitute the very foundation of their title. But the validity of that sale is challenged, on the ground that there has been no affirmative showing of a compliance by the commissioners with the provisions of the Act of Maroh 29th 1824, giving them authority to sell, but requiring that notice of such authority, accompanied by a designation of the tracts to be sold, should be published, and that written or printed advertisements should also be put up. The commissioners’ land book shows nothing further in connection with the sale, than that it was made to Henry Deringer on the 8th of July 1826; the deed in pursuance of it is dated on the 5th of June 1827, and contains no more than the ordinary recitals in a deed of that character.

The notices, designations of tracts to be sold, and the written or printed advertisements referred to in the statute, have rarely, if ever, been made matters of record, either here or elsewhere. And as the law stands now, however necessary it may be to produce proper evidence of them, to support a commissioners’ sale, made within a very short period, comparatively, it is very difficult, indeed, almost impossible to do so. But when upwards of forty-seven years have rolled by, the production of such proof must be recognised as an actual impossibility. * * * Again, it <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>is a rule of law that an instrument in the nature of a deed, unblemished by any alterations, coming from a proper source, correct in form and execution, and more than thirty years old, is ancient; that it, therefore, proves itself, and the bare production of it is sufficient. Of course every thing about such a deed must be in favor of its genuineness ; it must be free from every just ground of suspicion. But are commissioners’ deeds to be outside of the pale of presumption altogether, no matter what their age or features may be ? Whenever such becomes the recognised rule, the flood-gates of litigation will be opened all around us. * * *</p>

The assessment of a tax upon it by the proper officers, and the neglect of the owner to pay it for one whole year, rendered the land again liable to sale. The assessment book of Sugarloaf township for the year 1826, shows a return of the Samuel Rope tract as unseated, with a content of 872 acres, and a valuation of $372. The assessment book of the same township for the year 1827, exhibits a similar showing. The book of commissioners’ rates and levies for the year 1826 and 1827, shows a like content of acres in the tract, a valuation of it for the latter year of $372, and the assessment of a tax upon it, amounting to $1.86. Under the head of reputed owners, a brief entry occurs which would seem to indicate that the tract had been sold to the commissioners in 1820, and to Henry Deringer in 1826. However, on the 15th of December 1828, pursuant to this assessment, and the alleged non-payment of the tax within the statutory limit, Zurah Smith, then treasurer, sold the land to John Bittenbender, Isaac Harding and William Swetland, commissioners of the county of Luzerne. The treasurer’s deed of that date, containing the usual recitals, has been given in evidence.</p>

The Samuel Rope tract is among them. The number of acres, and the assessment of a tax corresponding with the assessment-book of Sugarloaf township for 1827, and with the book of commissioners’ rates and levies for the years 1826 and 1827, are set out in the usual form. The entry on the left-hand page of that book is as follows: ‘Acres 372 — Rope, Samuel — year 1827 — county tax $1.86 — costs $2.62| — amount $4.48^.’ On the same page, and directly under this entry, are the words, ‘ Paid before sale.’ And on the opposite page, in a column set apart for the name .of any purchaser, is also entered the words, ‘Paid before sale.’ But nowhere in the book is there an entry, showing that the tract was sold that year, by the treasurer to the commissioners. The treasurer’s deed-book, however, does show that such a sale was made, namely, on the 15th of December 1828.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b283-6" data-blocks='[["BL_283.5",283,[235,1044,1162,1379]]]'>“ Now, if the tax of 1827 was ‘ paid before sale,’ as the treasurer’s sale book indicates, Zurah Smith, the then treasurer, had no authority whatever to sell the land to the commissioners, or to anybody else; and, no matter though he did so, and executed and delivered a deed accordingly, it was a harmless proceeding altogether and did not affect the title of Mr. Deringer at all. But another book has been put in evidence, called the commissioners’ transcript-book. This seems to be a book which might properly be denominated an account-book. It contains the account of unpaid taxes for every two preceding years on unseated land, charged up against the respective owners. For the years 1827 and 1828, Henry Deringer is charged with the taxes assessed upon the several tracts of land owned by him in this county. Among them is the Samuel Rope; and, for the year 1827, a tax of $1.86 is marked as having been assessed against it, and is charged up against My. Deringer. This is the same tax for which Zurah Smith, the treasurer, made the sale to tbe commissioners on the 15th of December 1828. The credit side of Mr. Deringer on this book, contains an entry as follows: ‘ 1829 January 10th, by cash, pr. J. Bittenbender, Escp, $29.58,’ being the sum of the taxes for 1827 and 1828, assessed upon all the unseated lands of Mr. Deringer in the county, and charged up against him. The aggregate, $29.58, includes the^tax of $1.86, assessed against the Samuel Rope tract in 1827. If this tax was not paid until the ‘ 10th of January 1829,’ as shown by the commissioners’ transcript-book, the treasurer’s sale to the commissioners was good, and the title of Mr. Deringer to the Samuel-Rope tract was divested by it. Payment of a tax, for which a treasurer’s sale is about to be made, prior to the sale, saves the title of the owner, no matter what the treasurer may do after-wards ; but payment of the same tax, after the treasurer has made the sale, accomplishes no such result, neither does it work a revocation of the title conveyed.</p>

Such books ordinarily import verity in respect to all matters legitimately made the subject of entry in them. The construction of such entries is usually for the court, not for the jury; but here the entry in one book is at variance with the entry in the other ; here the matter of record in one, continues the existence of a title, while the matter of record in the other extinguishes it, and gives validity to another. Under such circumstances, the question arises, which of the two records is correct? The disposition of the question is for the jury, under all the evidence bearing upon the point. <em>* * *</em>

    <p class="summary" id="b284-6" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[232,884,1165,1068]]]'>“ The character of the Samuel Rope tract continued unchanged long after the year 1828. It was unseated land, and, therefore, liable to taxation and its incidents, as it had been previously. It is not material how the proper officers for assessing taxes may have regarded the title. The commissioners seem, however, to have regarded it as vested in the county of Luzerne, by virtue of the treasurer’s sale in 1828. Their record containing a list of the unseated lands purchased for the county, from 1816 to 1836, indicates that fact. Taxes were assessed upon it, however, for the years 1828 and 1829, and were charged up against Mr. Deringer in the commissioners’ transcript-book. Similar taxes for the years 1830 and 1831 were assessed, which were likewise charged in the same book against Mr. Deringer. The former he paid on the 5th of January 1830; the latter on the 4th of January 1832. This fact is shown by the proper record, The assessment-books of Sugarloaf township for the years 1832 and 1833, respectively, show a return of the Samuel Rope tract as unseated land, having a content of 372 acres, and a valuation of $372. For the year 1832, a state tax of 37t2¡j cents, and a county tax of $1.86, were assessed upon it. For the year 1833, a tax similar in character and amount was also assessed upon it. And so far as any <em>record </em>evidence to the contrary is concerned, the sum of these taxes remained unpaid for more than one year after -the time of their assessment. Whereupon, B. A. Bidlack, treasurer of the county, on the 9th of June 1834, sold the tract to Charles S. Coxe.</p>

And being purely a question of fact, the disposition of it, under all the testimony bearing upon it, will be for you. If you shall find, precedent to its consideration, that the treasurer’s sale of the Samuel Rope tract to the commissioners in 1828, vested in them, for the use of the county, a good title, although under the law, the land should have remained the property of the county'for a period of five years, subject to redemption by the owner, but exempt from sale- by the treasurer for taxes assessed and unpaid in the meantime ; yet, if Mr. Deringer, from any cause, neglected to pay the taxes of 1832 and 1833, based as they were, upon a return and <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>valuation, the sale by Mr. Bidlack, the treasurer, in 1834, though irregular, passed the title to Charles S. Coxe. Payment by Mr. Deringer, within five years from the date of the treasurer’s sale in 1828, of the taxes on which that sale was based, together with the interest and costs, and payment by him also of all the taxes assessed upon the tract, together with interest, during that period, would have entitled him to a reconveyance by the commissioners. If this was not done, his title was irrevocably gone. Payment of a part of the taxes assessed in the meantime, such as those of 1828, 1829, 1830 and 1831, was not sufficient.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b285-7" data-blocks='[["BL_285.5",285,[218,830,1164,1164]]]'>“ It is claimed on the part of the plaintiffs, however, not only that the treasurer’s sale in 1828 was invalid, because the taxes on w'hich it was based had been <em>‘ </em>paid before sale,’ but that the treasurer’s sale in 1834 was invalid also, and for the same reason. As has been seen, the commissioners’ transcript-book shows the payment of the taxes by Mr. Deringer for the years 1828, 1829, 1830 and 1831; but there is no showing in that book, or, indeed, in any other book or record in the commissioners’ or treasurer’s office, that the taxes of 1832 and 1833 were paid by Mr. Deringer, or by anybody else. George M. Nagle,- the present clerk of the commissioners, testifies that he has made a thorough search of the office, and that the commissioners’ transcript-book, now before us, is the only one of the kind remaining there,-in which an account similar to that with Mr. Deringer and others, already referred to, appears to have been kept of the unpaid taxes on unseated land, from the year 1831 to the year 1838. Since that time, however, similar accounts have been continued. It has been admitted that the treasurer’s sale book for 1834 disappeared from the proper office as long ago as January 1841, and that no trace of it has been discovered since that time. Along with that admission, came a general recognition by counsel on both sides, that there had been official misdoing with the records of the commissioners’ and the treasurer’s office, covering a period intervening between 1834 and 1840 ; that incumbents of the latter, .during that period, had been charged-as defaulters; and further,-that one of them had been prosecuted in the criminal court for the more serious offence of-stealing the missing books or records.</p>

      <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>The cases of Cuttle <em>v. </em>Brockway, 12 Harris 145, Iron Co. <em>v. </em>Fales, 5 P. F. Smith 90, and Heft <em>v. </em>Gephart, 15 P. F. Smith 510, have closed against all debate the question of the application of the maxim <em>omnia prcesumuntur esse rite acta </em>to tax sales under the Act of 1815. The ground of the objection made by the defendants below to the deed to the Luzerne commissioners of the 2d of December 1820, was that the sale had not been made on the second Monday of June, nor on any other day to which it was shown to have been adjourned. The fourth section of the Act of 13th of March 1815, declares that “ no alleged irregularity in the assessment or in the process shall be taken or construed to affect the title of the purchaser” of unseated land for taxes, “but the same shall be declared to be good and legal.” The sale in this instance was made on the 8th of November 1820. The deed was delivered in pursuance of it. No action of ejectment was brought by the owner within the statutory period of five years. The subsequent records in the offices of the commissioners and treasurer were made up on the assumption of the regularity of the proceedings. The deed recited the offer of the land “ for sale agreeably to law.” The absence of entries of adjournment from day to day was a defect of form and detail. It was “irregularity in the process,” and not the omission of any essential requisite to support the title the commissioners acquired. The facts made out a case to warrant at least such a binding direction to the jury as was given in Huzzard <em>v. </em>Trego, 11 Casey 9, that they ought to presume the adjournments to have been duly made. In the absence of countervailing proof, there was no substantial error in the peremptory instruction to that effect in the charge of the court below.</p>
    <p id="b289-6" data-blocks='[["BL_289.5",289,[205,1613,1163,821]],["BL_290.1",290,[270,419,1160,858]]]'>In disposing of the questions relating to the sale by the commissioners to Henry'Deringer on the 8th of July 1826, too much significance was attributed to lapse of time. If possession of the land had been taken by Deringer, the long period intervening between the date of the sale and the date of the trial, would perhaps have áfforded, with the other evidence in the cause, ground for assuming that the formal provisions of the Act of 1824 had been complied with, as á presumption of law. It certainly would have warranted a charge that such a compliance ought to be inferred by the jury, as a presumption of fact. But “ mere lapse of' time,” it was said by Lowrie, C. J., in Alexander <em>v. </em>Bush, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%2062" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="10 Wright 62">10 Wright 62</a>, “ proves nothing in favor of a title, for the older it is,, without any claim being made under it, the weaker it is, and the-weaker are all presumptions in its favor.” It is true that Read <em>v. </em>Goodyear, 17 S. &amp; R. 350, decided that, where land is sold for-taxes and the warrantee makes no claim for twenty-one years, and pays no taxes during that time, it may be left to a jury to presume-ouster or abandonment by him; and that length of time strengthens a title founded on a sale for taxes. In Sorber v. Willing, <a href="/watts/10/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="10 Watts 141" data-case-ids="1851003" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0141-01">10 </a><a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a><a href="/watts/10/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="10 Watts 141" data-case-ids="1851003" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0141-01">Watts 141</a>, however, the facts in Reed <em>v. </em>Goodyear were said by Gibson, C. J., to have been indistinctly stated, and among them was the omitted fact that there had been an entry by the purchaser at the treasurer’s sale. The curative provisions of the Act of 1815 were held in Jenks <em>v. </em>Wright, 11 P. F. Smith 410, not to be applicable to a sale by county commissioners under the Act of the 29th of March 1824. The evidence in this case did not warrant the assertion by the court of the regularity and validity of the sale to Deringer as a presumption of law. But there was proof of the payment of the taxes from 1826 to 1840. At the time of the sale the land was the property of the county, and as such the commissioners conveyed it. The deed executed by them on the 5th of June 1827 recited the performance of all the conditions requisite to support the title they conferred on their grantee. The proceedings were spread upon the county records, and their regularity has never been assailed by the county authorities. All these were facts for the consideration of the jury, and under them they should have been left at liberty to find whether the directions of the Act of Assembly had been duly pursued, and whether the title of Deringer was, therefore, valid.</p>
    <p id="b290-6" data-blocks='[["BL_290.5",290,[268,1277,1154,218]]]'>With the remark that the evidence offered by the defendants to prove that all adjournments of treasurers’ sales have been noted on the sales-book since the year 1838, was irrelevant to any apparent issue in the cause, what has been said disposes of the first six specifications of error.</p>
    <p id="b290-7" data-blocks='[["BL_290.6",290,[266,1493,1159,473]]]'>The general offer by the plaintiffs, to which the seventh assignment of error relates, was unobjectionable. Under it there was, perhaps, no necessity for showing the date of the purchase of the four tracts other than the one in controversy belonging to Deringer, and the deeds for them, but this could not have led to any confusion or embarrassment on the trial. The five tracts were treated as a single body of land, and each tax-receipt related to them all. The evidence affecting the Samuel Rope tract involved a reference to the others, and it was admissible, as evidence is always admissible of extraneous facts with which the subject-matter of a suit is inseparably connected.</p>
    <p id="b290-8" data-blocks='[["BL_290.7",290,[266,1967,1158,473]],["BL_291.1",291,[227,400,1166,2029]],["BL_292.1",292,[247,401,1163,463]]]'>The eighth, ninth, twelfth and thirteenth specifications are founded on the rulings of the court in regard to the sale of the land in controversy by the treasurer to the commissioners in 1828 for the taxes of 1827. The deed recited the sale to have been made on the 25th of November 1828. If it was valid, it divested the title Mr. Deringer had acquired by his purchase in 1826, and an outstanding title, as to him at least, was subsisting in the county of Luzerne when the cause was tried. The books showing the assessment and the deed were given in evidence by the defendants. In their rebutting case, the plaintiffs showed what is called in the record a “ commissioners’ transcript-book,” containing a <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>charge against Mr. Deringer’s five tracts for taxes for the years 1827 and 1828, amounting to $29.58, the charge against the Samuel Rope tract being $5.58, made up of county and road taxes, each $1.86 for 1827, and $1.86 road tax for 1828. At the foot of the statement there is a credit of the entire amount of the charge dated the 10th January 1829. The treasurer’s sale book for the year 1828 was also produced by the plaintiffs, and the entry of the Samuel Rope tract on that book was permitted, under exception, to be given in evidence. The words “ paid before sale” were twice written, on the right and left margins of the entry. In the commissioners’ book of county rates and levies for 1826,1827 and 1828, the tract had been charged with taxes amounting to $3.72, and in the commissioners’ list to the treasurer for 1826 and 1827, a county tax for 1827 of $1.86, and a road tax for the same year and of the same amount were stated to be due. A pen appeared to have been drawn at some time through the figures “ 1.86” in both places where they occurred in this last book. This evidence was submitted to the jury on the question of the payment of the taxes of 1827 before the sale to the commissioners. The regular, authorized and authentic entry in the transcript-book showed the payment to have been made on the 10th of January 1829. The very language of the entry on the sale-book implied that it was made after the sale had taken place. It is said to be in the handwriting of Zurah Smith, the treasurer at the time. Let that be so, and it does not help the use of an unwarranted and illegal endorsement on a public record as evidence of a substantive and material fact. The entry was out of time and out of place. It was made after the sale, to which the treasurer had certified by his solemn deed. It was in contradiction of the explicit written statement of the credit appearing in the transcript-book. It was not an act done in the course of the current business of his office — it may have been made years after the transaction — from his letter to Deringer; it is not credible that he made it before the 4th of February 1829 — and it depended for its accuracy perhaps upon the recollection or declarations of other parties, or upon his own memory at the very best. No direct authority, is found upon this question. In Kennedy v. Daily, <a href="/watts/6/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="6 Watts 269" data-case-ids="1846030" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0269-01">6 Watts 269</a>, all that was decided was, that when the word “ paid” appears on the margin of the entry of a tract of land in the treasurer’s sale-book, the purchaser could prove that the word was written after the sale, and that the same entry was usually made after the sale as well as before. In Ankeny v. Albright, 8 Harris 157, the letters “pd.” on the treasurer’s book were held to be no evidence' of themselves, that the taxes were paid before the sale. In the last case two former county treasurers testified that they always marked the taxes in this way after the land was sold and the money paid by the purchaser, and that they always marked them in the same way when <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>paid at any time. But it is manifestly essential to the security of property that muniments of title and .public records should be free from the hazards that would be involved in making evidence of legends like this. It was no part of the duty of Zurah Smith to endorse his recollection of past events on any of the books the law required him to keep as treasurer of the county. His statement of official facts in their appropriate places and their current order would be evidence always. His statement of a fact that rested only on his own recollection, or that of others, was not entitled to be weighed against his formal deed and a distinct, explicit and authentic record.</p>
    <p id="b292-6" data-blocks='[["BL_292.5",292,[248,870,1162,1079]]]'>The admission of the evidence to which the tenth, eleventh, and fourteenth assignments of error apply, was warranted by the authority of McReynolds <em>v. </em>Longenberger, 7 P. F. Smith 13. Other questions aside, the sale in 1834 to Charles S. Coxe vested the title to this land in him, if the taxes for the years 1832 and 1833 were not paid. The plaintiffs were permitted to prove the existence of receipts for taxes from 1826 to 1840 by witnesses who had seen them, the loss of the receipts themselves being alleged. While such testimony is admissible, it is exceptional in its character, and is capable of producing unjust results. It should be submitted to a jury under carefully guarded and measured instructions as to the precise point in dispute. That point here was the payment, before the sale of 1834, of the taxes for the two preceding years. As the cause must go back on other grounds, it is not necessary to express an opinion as to the sufficiency of the preliminary proof that was made of the search for, and loss of, the papers. But Dr. Clark, one of the executoi’s of Henry Deringer, had possession of the key of the closet containing the receipts for more than a year, and not only had access to them, but had charge of, and was responsible for, them. The necessity for some examination of his papers would seem clear. No evidence in the record traced these papers to the hands of the other executor, Theophilus T. Deringer. Still, applications for such documents to executors or their representatives is, in all cases, a proper and safe precaution.</p>
