She subsequently joined him in executing an instrument under seal, by which the amount insured above the sum of $5000, was assigned and set over to one Henry Bunting, in trust for her husband’s children, who are alleged to be the offspring of a former marriage. This was not the conduct of a stepmother; but when her husband’s influence was removed by death, she challenged the right of the trustee to <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>the fund. The money was paid into court, and an issue framed and submitted to a jury, who found that the only consideration for the transfer was the affection which John R. Bond bore to his children. It is proper to add, that the trustees had notice of the assignment — a circumstance which might be material in England, but seems to be of no moment in Pennsylvania. We have now to determine the validity of the assignment, with the aid of the light derived from this verdict.</p>

It was long held, that where an assignment without a -valuable ^consideration was legally inoperative, it could not be upheld in equity: Kennedy <em>v. </em>Ware, 1 Barr 445. The presence of a seal made no difference in the application of the principle: Ellison <em>v. </em>Ellison, 6 Vesey 658; Ward <em>v. </em>Audland, 8 Beavan 20. If the instrument was so worded as to confer a right of action in debt or covenant, the plaintiff would not be restrained by an injunction. If it was not, the want of a legal remedy did not afford a ground for equitable relief. In either case, the chancellor suffered the law to take its course.</p>

But if the party has completely transferred stock, &amp;c., though it is voluntary, yet the legal conveyance being effectually made, the equitable interest will be enforced by this court.’ A grant which fails of effect at law, is a covenant in the sense of this distinction. In Ward <em>v. </em>Audland. Lord Langdale said: ‘ If the property was legally vested in the plaintiff, he might have recovered it at law, and applied it on the trusts; if the property was not legally and effectually vested in the plaintiff, then, as the deed was voluntary, this court could afford no assistance to the plaintiff in recovering it; and, under these circumstances, the only question between the parties is, what is the legal effect of the assignment? * * * The debt and policy of assurance are choses in action not assignable at law, and it is plain that the whole estate and interest of the assignor did not and could not pass to ,an assignee; and I apprehend that, in the case of a voluntary deed, neither the assignor nor his executor could’ have been compelled to <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>permit the assignee to use his name for the recovery of the debt.’ So in Meek <em>v. </em>Kettlewell, 1 Hare 474, the vice chancellor was clearly of opinion, that an assignment under seal of that which did not pass at law by the operation of the assignment itself, unaccompanied by other acts, was no better than a covenant or agreement to assign. It was by treating a deed which failed of effect as a covenant, that chancery was enabled to give relief through a decree for specific performance: Chew <em>v. </em>Barnet, 11 S. &amp; R. 389; Bayler <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%2037" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Wright 37">4 Wright 37</a>.

    <p class="summary" id="b213-6" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[214,914,1163,1163]]]'>“ This course of decision seems to have been well founded in the peculiar doctrines of equity and the relation which they bore to the common law. It can hardly be vindicated on the broad principles of jurisprudence. It is a general rule, that he who owns, shall have the power to dispose. The <em>jus disponendi </em>should not be withheld except for some sufficient cause, and on special grounds. What, if anything, the grantor receives as an equivalent, concerns him, and not society at large. The right to give is consequently as clearly incident to the right of property as the right to sell. Choses in action are as much within the scope of this principle as lands or chattels;. and yet, as they cannot be legally assigned, the refusal of equity to aid voluntary transfers rendered it impossible to give a chose in action. The effect was to impose an arbitrary restraint on alienation, which was not unfrequently attended with injurious consequences. A large amount of property is locked up at the present day, in bonds, stocks, and other evidences of debt. A capitalist might count his wealth in these by thousands, and yet find it difficult to provide for a friend or relative. It was easy to give a house or chattel, but if he attempted to bestow a debt, there was an unexpected obstacle. A demand might be sold, or pledged, or released, but it could not be the subject of a voluntary transfer. If the donor was versed in the law, he might obviate the difficulty by collecting the money, and investing it in the name of the beneficiary. But this required time and more knowledge than is ordinarily possessed. It was, moreover, impracticable where, as in the case of a policy of insurance, the debt was payable at a future day and contingent.</p>

A chose in action could not be assigned without a valuable consideration, but where a trust exists, it may be enforced, though in favor of a volunteer. Hence an inference, that where a man declared that he held assets which belonged to him in trust for a volunteer, it was a valid gift. If, said Lord Cranworth, ‘ I say expressly or impliedly that I constitute myself a trustee of personalty, that is a trust executed and capable of being enforced <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>without considerationand the doctrine was applied in numerous instances to choses in action.</p>

Such was the origin of uses, and, subsequently, of trusts. A declaration of trust, under these circumstances, substantiates the existence of a duty which would be obligatory, independently of the declaration. But it does not follow that an admission can give rise to a fiduciary obligation where none exists. ‘ The ordinary power of a chancellor,’ said Gibson, C. J., in Read <em>v. </em>Robinson, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 329" data-case-ids="480247" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0329-01">6 W. &amp; S. 329</a>, ‘extends no further than the execution of a trust sufficiently framed to put the title out of the grantor, or to the execution of an agreement for a trust founded on a valuable consideration,’ and the language of the same judge, in Morrison <em>v. </em>Beirer, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%2086" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 86">2 W. &amp; S. 86</a>, shows that he regarded a declaration of trust as inoperative where it does not rest on an antecedent obligation.</p>

A declaration of trust by the owner of property in favor of a volunteer, has no peculiar efficacy. It is simply a gift, which derives its force from the will of the donor. As applied to land, it is, consequently, invalid, if not under seal; and perhaps even then, unless the estate lies in grant. Where the law prescribes the mode of conveyance, it must be followed. When, however, there are no legal means of transfer, any words expressing an intention to confer a present interest, may be effectual in equity. There can be no clearer manifestation of a design to part with the right of property in favor of another, than an absolute assignment to him or for his use. The notion that a gift, which would be valid if made through a declaration of trust, will fail if put in the form of an assignment, was accordingly repudiated in Richardson <em>v. </em>Richardson, Law Rep. 3 Eq. 686.</p>

She did not endorse the notes, and the legal title consequently remained in her. The chancellor said that it was impossible to contend, after the decision in IiekeAvich <em>v. </em>Manning, 1 De Gex, Mac. &amp; G. 176, that the beneficial interest did not pass by the assignment, because ‘ the decision in that case was not merely that a person who, being entitled to a reversionary interest or to stock standing in another’s name, assigns it by a voluntary deed, thereby passes, notwithstanding that he does not, in formal terms, declare himself to be a trustee of the property; but it amounts to this, that an instrument executed as a present and complete assignment, is equivalent to a declaration of trust.’</p>

Accordingly where the donor signed and delivered the following memorandum to his physician : ‘ I hereby give and make over to Dr. Morris an India bond, number D. 506, value 10007, as some token for his kind attention to me during illness;’ Lord Romilly said, ‘ the writing is equivalent to a declaration of trust. If the donor had said : “ I undertake to hold the bond for you,” that would have been a declaration of trust, though there had been no delivery.

As a tribunal of the first instance, we ought to adhere implicitly to the rulings of the court above. If the case of Kennedy <em>v. </em>Ware, were identical with this, it would control our judgment. The assignment there was by parol. Here it is under seal. The difference seems to be immaterial, according to the authorities, but it affords room for a doubt. There is another consideration. The fund is given in trust for Jane and James S. Bond. They are described in the instrument as the children of John R. Bond. If they are also Mrs. Bond’s, there is a meritorious consideration arising from a-tie of blood. It seems that equity will give effect to a provision for a wife or child, though not for a collateral relation : see Hayes <em>v. </em>Kershaw, 1 Sandford Oh. 258; Buford <em>v. </em>McKee, <a href="/ky/31/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Dana 107" data-case-ids="8518236" data-case-paths="/ky/31/0107-01">1 Dana 107</a>; Dennison <em>v. </em>Goehring, 7 Barr 175; Kennedy <em>v. </em>Ware, 1 Id. 445.

At common law a married woman had no power to dispose of her personal estate. The right of alienation belonged to her husband, and could only be exercised by her as his agent. The act of 1848 provides, that the property of a <em>feme covert </em>shall not be sold, mortgaged or transferred, or in any manner encumbered by her husband, without her written consent first had and obtained before one of the judges of the Court of Common Pleas of this Commonwealth. Whoever drafted this act seems to have forgotten that disabling the husband does not enable the wife. The act forbids him to transfer without her written consent, &amp;c., but it provides no means by which she can alienate. The result was a painful uncertainty, which the lapse of twenty-five years, and an exhaustive <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>judicial investigation, have not removed. In Moore <em>v. </em>Cornell, 18 P. F. Smith 820, Sharswood, J., said that the great object of the statute was to secure the property of a married woman against her husband and his creditors. It did not confer upon her any power or capacity which she did not possess before, except that of making a will, and of binding her estate by a contract for necessaries. It had accordingly been held, in Stoops <em>v. </em>Blackford, that an assignment of a mortgage by a married woman is invalid, unless her husband joins in the instrument, and it is authenticated by her separate acknowledgment. It was said, in the course of the same opinion, that a mortgage, though in form a conveyance of land, is substantially a security for a debt. It is personal property — a chose in action — and whatever gives the money secured by the mortgage, will carry the security along with it.</p>

Nay, more, the restriction would extend to purchases, because it is impossible to buy without giving an equivalent. It has not been imposed in terms, and we may believe that the court above will do some gentle violence to the Act of 1848, rather than adopt a conclusion fraught with injurious consequences. The judge who delivered the opinion in Moore <em>v. </em>Cornell, has shown in other instances, with his wonted clearness, that if a mortgagee is a creditor, he is something more. He is an owner, who may enter and take rents and profits, until the debt is satisfied.

Chief Justice Gibson is reported in the ,latter case to have remarked, when Kennedy <em>v. </em>Ware was cited, <em>“ </em>there is a distinction between a gift and an assignment; the latter is only available in equity and will only be enforced so far as there is a consideration.” But is not a gift an assignment, perfected by a delivery which debars the donor from revocation, and must not the donee of a bond so given sue upon it in the name of the donor ? So he admitted when he came to pronounce the judgment. “ Such a gift would be inoperative at law, for as a bond is not negotiable the legal title would pass only by an observance of the formalities prescribed by the statute; but on the principle of Cross <em>v. </em>Powel, and the authorities already quoted, it would pass the equitable ownership.” That principle, as the chief justice states it, was that if a bond delivered to the obligor to be cancelled, but not cancelled, come again to the hands of the obligee, though valid at law, the obligor will be relieved in equity. His other authorities abundantly show that a bond delivered to be cancelled without consideration, and actually cancelled, is at an end both in law and equity. But all this serves to confirm the doctrine enunciated by Chancellor Kent, in regard to the delivery necessary to perfect a gift. “ Delivery in this, as in every other case, must be according to the nature of the thing. It must be an actual delivery so far a.s the subject is capable of delivery. It must be <em>secundum subjectam </em>materiam, and be the true and effectual way of obtaining the command and dominion of the subject.yTf the thing be not capable of actual delivery, there must be some act equivalent to it. The donor must part not only with the possession, but with the dominion of the property. If the thing given be a chose in action, the law requires an assignment or some equivalent instrument, and the transfer must be actually executed:” 2 Kent Com. 439. To hold otherwise would be in effect to decide that the owner of a chose in action not evidenced by a note, bond or other instrument, could not make a gift of it, which would be an unreasonable limitation of his right of property. There was a very good reason in the case before us for the non-delivery of the policy, because, being for $10,000, the donor retained the sum of $5600, and the whole was to be subject to the payment pro rata of the funeral and other expenses incurred in the last illness of John R. Bond. Taking the instrument to be not an assignment, but a covenant to allow the covenantee to use <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>the name of the covenantor to recover the money for the use declared, the seal at law imported a consideration.</p>
    <p id="b219-6" data-blocks='[["BL_219.5",219,[190,480,1164,128]]]'>There is, then, a distinction between this case and Kennedy <em>v. </em>Ware, which- was the ease of a parol assignment of a judgment without a delivery or anything which the law holds equivalent to it.</p>
    <p id="b219-7" data-blocks='[["BL_219.6",219,[187,610,1167,730]]]'>It is certainly the tendency of all the modern authorities to maintain the general doctrine which may indeed be stated as a formula, that wherever a party has the power to do a thing (statute provisions being out of the way), and means to do it, the instrument he employs shall be so construed as to give effect to his intention. It is but the application of the old maxim, <em>interpreta,tio chartarum benigne faeienda est ut res magis valeat quam </em>pereat— <em>quando res non valet ut ago valeat quantum valere potest. </em>It cannot he doubted that Mr. and Mrs. Bond could by a declaration under seal have constituted themselves trustees for the purpose set forth in the statement, and why, if it cannot for want of consideration operate as a good equitable assignment, may it not be effectual as declaration of trust ? The later English authorities certainly sustain the learned president below in his opinion upon this point, and they have been recognised in this court in a recent judgment, though the case was not one which justified their application: Helfenstein’s Estate, 27 P. F. Smith 328.</p>
    <p id="b219-8" data-blocks='[["BL_219.7",219,[187,1345,1163,604]]]'>The remaining question presents no serious difficulty. The provisions of the Married Woman’s Act requiring an acknowledgment by the wife, is confined by its terms to powers given by her to her husband to sell and dispose of her property, real or personal: Haffey <em>v. </em>Carey, 23 P. F. Smith 431, and cases there cited. It follows, that she may assign her choses in action, her husband joining in the act of disposition, without acknowledgment of any kind; nor is any change made by the Act of May 14th 1864 (Pamph. L. 158), which was evidently only intended to quiet a doubt upon the subject. The assignment of a mortgage stands upon a different footing. It is not a mere chose in action, hut also a conveyance of the real estate. The mortgagee is a purchaser within the statute of Elizabeth, and the recording acts apply to him. Judgment affirmed.</p>
