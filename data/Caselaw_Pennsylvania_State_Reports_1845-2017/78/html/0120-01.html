Burgess, being the owner of the real estate above mentioned, commenced the erection of a building on it; he dug the cellar, laid the cellar-wall and put on the sills ; this work was done between the above date and the 1st of December; he did nothing more after that time. On the 2d of March 1872, he conveyed the land to H. C. Burgess and A. Smith for $1425; he received $300 of the consideration, and the vendees gave a judgment note to William J. Mulford for $1125, that being the amount due by G. H.' Burgess to Mulford, for labor and materials for the building so far as it had progressed.

The real estate was sold under an execution on Mulford’s judgment, and the proceeds of sale were brought into court for distribution. The mechanics’ lien creditors of II. C. Burgess and Smith claimed that their liens had precedence of Mulford’s judgment, on the ground that the building had been commenced before the judgment was entered.</p>

But the law as settled by these cases was changed by the Act of 28th of April 1840, sect. 24, Pamph. L. 474, 1 Br. Purd. 1027, pi. 18. That act is in these words: “ The lien created by the Act entitled an Act relating to the lien of the mechanics and others upon buildings, passed the 16th of June 1836, shall not be construed to extend any greater or other' estate in the ground on which any building may be erected, than that of the person in possession at the time of commencing said building and at whose instance the same is erected.” The draftsman of this act, doubtless contemplated that the person in possession when the building is commenced would be the same person at whose instance the building is erected. But in our case, if we hold, in accordance with Pennock <em>v. </em>Hoover, that the commencement of the building erected by Burgess and Smith goes back to the foundation laid by George II. Burgess, there is some difficulty in construing the act, so as to give force to every part of it.</p>

The facts in that case were not precisely like the facts in ornease, and we do not find any case in the books, in which the Act of 1840 has been applied to a case exactly like ours. .Although George H. Burgess laid the foundation of this building it cannot be said that it was erected at his instance. He had ceased to have any interest in the property for ten months before Burgess and Smith <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>commenced work upon the building, against which these claims were filed. The building was erected at the instance of Burgess and Smith, and if we have taken the time idea of the Act of 1840, the mechanics employed by Burgess and Smith acquired a lien, commensurate with the estate held by them.” * * *</p>

More than six months afterwards, Burgess and Smith concluded to go on and erect a building on the walls left by the other Burgess, and did so. Under these circumstances, and in view of the operation of the Act of 28th April 1840, the persons engaged in the building thus put up, could not carry back the lien for work and materials beyond the time of the recommencement of the building by Burgess and Smith.
