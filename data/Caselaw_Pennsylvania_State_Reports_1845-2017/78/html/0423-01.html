Giving entire assent to the contention of the defendant that he thereby entered into copartnership with the- original contractor, he made the contract his own contract, even if he had not expressly agreed, as he did, <em>“ </em>to account to the within-named Abraham Collins for the full amount of the within agreement.” Was it any answer to the action to set up that there was another person liable to him on the contract jointly with him ? There is nothing better settled than that the non-joinder of a co-contractor can only be taken advantage of by a plea in abatement. It would be ah affectation of learning to cite authorities for this proposition. We have our own cases of Bellas <em>v. </em>Fagely, 7 Harris 275; Chorpenning <em>v. </em>Royer, 8 P. F. Smith 474 — full to the point. Nor does it matter that the declaration is upon an individual contract. A joint contract is not at variance with the count.
