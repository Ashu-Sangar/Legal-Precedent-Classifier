        "text": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM.\nThese are cross petitions for allowance of appeal from an opinion and order of Superior Court, \u2014 Pa.Super. \u2014, 460 A.2d 1121, affirming an order of Cambria County Common Pleas denying petitioner Sheldon Dorian\u2019s motion to modify his sentence. The sentencing judge sentenced petitioner Dorian to a six to twelve year prison term for a burglary he committed while on parole. He ordered that sentence to run concurrent with the remaining time on his original sentence which he was required to serve after his parole violation. The Superior Court panel correctly denied petitioner Dorian relief on this claim. However, we grant his petition for allowance of appeal to this Court because Superior Court erroneously concluded that a trial judge may impose a sentence on a parole violator for a crime committed while on parole to run concurrently with the time remaining on his original sentence.\n\u201c[T]he law [61 P.S. \u00a7 331.21a] is quite clear that a parole violator convicted and sentenced to prison for another offense must serve his or her back time and the new sentence in consecutive order.\u201d Commonwealth v. Zuber, 466 Pa. 453, 457, 353 A.2d 441, 443 (1976) (citing Commonwealth v. Draper, 222 Pa.Superior Ct. 26, 293 A.2d 614 [1972]). That law was not affected by the Act of December 30, 1974, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9761. We therefore disapprove of the dictum in the panel\u2019s decision which would hold that Section 9761 of the Sentencing Code enables the sentencing judge to direct that a parolee\u2019s \u201cfront time\u201d sentence run concurrent with his \u201cback time\u201d sentence.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal is denied. Mr. Dorian\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal is granted and the order of Superior Court denying post-conviction relief is affirmed.",
