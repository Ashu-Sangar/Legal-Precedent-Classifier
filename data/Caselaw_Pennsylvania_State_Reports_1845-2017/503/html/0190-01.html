McCann was found guilty of aggravated assault after a jury trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Mercer County. His post trial motions were denied, and a judgment of sentence was imposed of not less than five (5) years nor more than ten (10) years. On appeal, the Superior Court found that McCann’s trial attorney was ineffec<a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>tive, vacated the sentence, and remanded the case for a new trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Commonwealth petitioned this Court for allowance of appeal, which was granted.

    <p id="b248-5" data-blocks='[["BL_248.4",248,[269,540,1147,1020]]]'>The underlying facts of this case are as follows. On December 11, 1979, Mrs. Wilma Cooper was walking home when she was accosted by Robert McCann. As a result of the attack the victim suffered some twenty (20) stab wounds to all parts of her body. Shortly after this incident, McCann was picked up by the police near the scene of the attack. He was complaining of a knife wound to the leg, which he claimed was sustained in the course of aiding a woman who was being attacked. To prove his point, McCann took the police to the site where Mrs. Cooper was lying in a pool of blood. The police, after summoning an ambulance for the victim, transported McCann to the hospital. While there, the officer in charge of the investigation was handed a note from one of the ambulance attendants. The note gave a description of the assailant, as told to the writer by the victim. The description fit Mr. McCann. As a result the police located the accused, advised him of his rights, and shortly thereafter, secured a taped confession. Subsequently the victim selected McCann’s photograph out of a photo array.</p>

    <p id="b249-5" data-blocks='[["BL_249.5",249,[240,992,1140,761]]]'>To rebut this insanity defense the Commonwealth presented its own psychiatrist, a Dr. Phillip J. Resnick, who had reviewed McCann’s records and interviewed the accused for about three (3) hours prior to preparing his report. In testifying from his report Dr. Resnick agreed that the accused was a sexual sadist but he did not agree that such disorder was “something which causes someone to be out of touch with reality” (N.T. at 275); nor did he believe that his putative mental disease precluded him “from knowing the wrongfulness of the act.” (N.T. at 278.) However, Dr. Resnick did testify that the disorder (sexual sadism) suffered by the accused “ma[de] him extremely dangerous to society” and he described McCann “as being a highly dangerous person for the indefinite future.” (N.T. at 281.)</p>

Since McCann’s counsel chose not to request a specific charge, the jury was not instructed as to the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. Thereafter, the jury rejected McCann’s insanity defense and found him guilty of aggravated assault.</p>

Since trial counsel had neither requested such a charge, nor lodged any objection to the failure of the court to include such a charge as required by Pa.R.Crim.Pro. 1119(b), the post-trial court correctly noted that counsel’s effectiveness was called into question. The court, therefore, permitted trial counsel to withdraw, and appointed new counsel for the purpose of filing and arguing additional grounds in support of a Motion for New Trial and/or in Arrest of Judgment. In a supplemental motion by new counsel, he asserted that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request the trial court to instruct the jury concerning the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity; and for trial counsel’s failure to take specific objection to same at the conclusion of the charge. These motions were denied on May 18, 1981, and from this decision McCann appealed.</p>

On the facts of this case, counsel could have had no reasonable basis for failing to request a charge on the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. From the post-trial judge’s specific findings on counsel’s strategy, it is manifestly apparent that appellee’s trial counsel engaged in a course of action that was both contradictory and defeatist and that could in no way have served the best interests of his client.</p>
    <p id="b255-4" data-blocks='[["BL_255.3",255,[231,304,1138,653]]]'>
      <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>As the majority notes, the only issue at trial was appellee’s sanity at the time he attacked the victim. Thus, the only verdict logically available to the jury aside from guilty was that of not guilty by reason of insanity. Having chosen to defend at trial solely on the basis of appellee’s insanity, appellee’s counsel had presented a chilling picture of appellee’s history of mental disturbance and bizarre acts of sexual sadism. This picture was supplemented by the Commonwealth’s own psychiatric expert, who, although disputing appellee’s legal insanity at the time of the offense, testified that appellee’s disorder “ma[de] him extremely dangerous to society” and “a highly dangerous person for the indefinite future.”</p>
    <p id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.4",255,[232,981,1139,666]]]'>As the trial court noted, if appellee’s counsel had requested an instruction on the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, the instruction given would likely have been that prescribed by the Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Criminal Jury Instructions, § 5.01A, which appears in substantially abridged form at footnote 6 of the majority’s opinion. That instruction provides, in relevant part: “[WJhen a defendant is found not guilty by reason of insanity, he may be the subject of an immediate court proceeding to commit him to a mental treatment facility <em>and if committed his commitment will continue until he is no longer dangerous to others or to himself </em>” (emphasis supplied)</p>
    <p id="b255-6" data-blocks='[["BL_255.5",255,[232,1664,1139,302]]]'>Nonetheless, in the face of undisputed testimony concerning the danger presented by appellee and the existence of a standard jury charge stating that commitment would last until appellee was “no longer dangerous to others,” counsel chose not to request such an instruction.

In addition, trial counsel was concerned the District Attorney would request and receive an additional charge that defendant could be released in a year.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b256-5" data-blocks='[["BL_256.4",256,[310,560,1105,147]]]'>(9) The defendant’s counsel was of the belief that the Court could not commit the defendant in a mental institution for a period to exceed one (1) year without review.”</blockquote>
    <p id="Avy" data-blocks='[["BL_256.5",256,[265,724,1149,507]]]'>The majority endorses counsel’s “tactical decision” because “defense counsel was correct in concluding that commitment was not mandatory following a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity,” and, “[m]ore importantly, we find as reasonable trial counsel’s decision not to ask for the instruction in light of the opportunity it would have presented the prosecutor to argue to the jury that the procedures provided in the Mental Health Procedures Act would permit the defendant to be released within a relatively short period of time.” (at 129-130; footnote omitted).</p>

Following a full and fair jury charge on the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, could any juror, after hearing the testimony of both prosecution and defense experts concerning appellee’s history of dangerous mental illness, have reasonably believed that the Commonwealth would abandon its duty to its citizens and fail to seek appellee’s immediate commitment following such a verdict? Would the prosecution even dare to argue such a possibility? Could any juror, having been presented with a vivid picture of appellee’s violent behavior and poor prognosis, have rationally believed that appellee would not in fact be promptly committed to a mental institution? Could any juror, having heard the Commonwealth’s expert state that appellee was a “highly dangerous person for the indefinite <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>future,” have reasonably believed that appellee would be released in a year, or even several years, simply because of the existence of a yearly review procedure? Yet, instead of relying on his own skills as an advocate, the impartiality of the trial judge, and the jury’s common sense, trial counsel chose to leave the jury to reach its own speculative conclusion as to the consequences of the only verdict it could possibly render aside from guilty. See <em>Commonwealth v. Mulgrew, </em><a href="/pa/475/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="475 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="1734128" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0271-01">475 Pa. 271</a>, 276, <a href="/pa/475/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="475 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="1734128" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0271-01">380 A.2d 349</a>, 352 (1977) (instruction “reduce[s] the possibility of compromise verdicts of guilty occasioned by a jury’s misapprehension of ‘acquitting’ a defendant by reason of insanity”).</p>
    <p id="b257-5" data-blocks='[["BL_257.4",257,[227,889,1139,657]]]'>The issue in this case is not whether a jury charge on the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity must always be given, or whether situations may exist where the failure to request such a charge could constitute sound trial strategy. Rather, the issue is simply whether, on the facts of <em>this </em>case, appellee’s counsel was ineffective for failing to request a jury instruction that a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity could result in the commitment of his undisputedly disturbed and dangerous client to a mental institution until he was “no longer dangerous to others or to himself.” Manifestly, the order of the Superior Court remanding this case for a new trial should be affirmed.</p>
