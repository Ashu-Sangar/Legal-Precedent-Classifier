In her complaint, appellee sought nullification of a real estate conveyance from her estranged husband, Chester Krenzelak, to his son, Stanley, on the ground that the property transfer was effected solely to deprive appellee of her right to equitable distribution of marital property in a divorce action pending under the Divorce Code of 1980, P.L. 63, No. 26, § 101 <em>et seq., </em>23 P.S. § 101 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp. 1983-84).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

On March 25, 1980 Chester conveyed the property for no monetary consideration to Stanley, his son by a prior marriage. The General Assembly enacted the Divorce Code of 1980 in April, 1980 and it became effective on July 1, 1980. The statute includes, <em>inter alia, </em>provisions for equitable distribution of property. 23 P.S. §§ 402-04.

Wilma further contends that the transfer is fraudulent under Section 403(d) of the new Code. Chester and Stanley filed preliminary objections to the complaint in equity in the nature of a demurrer and motion to strike maintaining that the complaint fails to state an actionable claim. Appellants argue that at all times prior to the transfer, the property in question was in Chester’s sole ownership, that Wilma made no contribution to the purchase price and that, therefore, Chester had the right and authority to make the conveyance. Appellants further maintain that the conveyance is in no way affected by the Divorce Code of 1980 since it was not in effect at the time of transfer.</p>

The Court reasoned that such retroactive application of the Code’s provisions could impermissibly infringe on appellants’ vested property rights in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Consequently, the Court held that the concept of “marital property” as defined in the 1980 Code does not become operational until the date on which a divorce action is filed under the new statute.

Specifically, it referred to Section 401(c) which confers full equity power and jurisdiction on the Court of Common Pleas in all matrimonial cases, including the power to grant relief “against any third person over whom the court has jurisdiction and who is involved in or concerned with the disposition of the cause.” The Superior Court further noted that Section 401(e)(5) defines marital property subject to equitable distribution as “all property acquired by either party during the marriage” and that excluded from this definition is property which “a party has sold, granted, conveyed or otherwise disposed of in good faith and for value prior to the time proceedings for the divorce are commenced.” 23 P.S. § 401(e)(5).</p>

First, <em>Bacchetta </em>was a divorce action involving only the spouses. In this case, neither of the spouses now owns the property in controversy. Stanley Krenzelak, who currently holds title to the Morris Township tract, is not a principal party to Chester and Wilma Krenzelaks’ respective divorce actions. Moreover, unlike the marital property rights at issue in <em>Bacchetta, </em>which vest only in the event of divorce under the 1980 Code, Stanley Krenzelak’s rights in the property in question vested prior to enactment of the Code and are only tangentially, if at all, connected with a marital relationship, <em>i.e., </em>that of his father and stepmother. Accordingly, Stanley’s property rights do not arise “solely by reason of the marriage” of Wilma and Chester Krenzelak nor are they directly connected with that marriage. Furthermore, Stanley’s rights in the Morris Township property will not be merely diminished, altered or impaired should Section 403(d) be given retroactive effect. Rather, if the trial court found the conveyance fraudulent under the provision, his rights would be entirely extinguished.</p>

In applying equitable distribution statutes to property acquired prior to the effective date of legislation, several courts have asserted that, in so doing, they are, in fact, applying such laws prospectively. This notion derives from the fact that any impairment of property rights occurs only on termination of marriage and that divorce, on which equitable division of property is contingent, necessarily post-dates enactment of the distribution laws. <em>See Rothman v.

However, it must also be remembered that one can only enter into such a relationship voluntarily if he is apprised of the consequences of such a decision. From time to time it is to be expected that there must be a reassessment of those responsibilities and obligations to accommodate ever occurring societal change. The Code as drafted by the General Assembly reflects a proper response to such a reassessment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Unfortunately, by judicial interpretation a retroactive application was engrafted which improvidently transformed a reasonable accommodation into an impermissible derogation of fundamental individual rights.

Although the constitutional difficulties are obvious, it is not necessary to reach the question of the constitutionality of'the retroactive application of § 401, as does Mr. Justice Nix, as there are ample reasons to support the inescapable conclusion that the expressed legislative intent was that application of § 401 is to be <em>prospective only. </em>Thus, I concur in the result.</p>
