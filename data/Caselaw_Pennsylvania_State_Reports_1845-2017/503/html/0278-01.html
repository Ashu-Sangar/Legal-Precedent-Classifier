Appellant’s expressed intent on August 14, 1974 was to waive Rule 1100 so that an outstanding homicide charge could be disposed of first. Apparently “disposed of” meant more than simply completion of the trial on the homicide charge, for the record reveals that the trial on the charges stemming from the burglary was continued again, by agreement of the prosecution and defense, in January 1976, until disposition of the post-trial motions on the homicide. As the time when the homicide charge would be “disposed of” was obviously <em>unknown </em>and <em>unknowable </em>at the time appellant executed the waiver, it is apparent appellant must have intended to waive Rule 1100 for an indefinite period of time.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

On August 14, 1974, in a formal court proceeding, the Appellant waived Rule 1100. In dispute, is whether the Appellant waived his right to a speedy trial indefinitely. The trial court held that the Appellant waived his right to a speedy trial only until Appellant’s homicide trial was completed or until September 23, 1974. Since the Appellant was not tried by September 23, 1974, and excludable time amounted at most to 100 days, and the total delay was approximately 1195 days, the trial court granted the Appellant’s motion for <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>arrest of judgment and discharged him.

Myrick, </em><a href="/pa/468/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="468 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1719722" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0155-01">468 Pa. 155</a>, <a href="/pa/468/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="468 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1719722" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0155-01">360 A.2d 598</a> (1976). To insure that such waiver is knowing and intelligent, we hve held in <em>Commonwealth v. Coleman, <a href="/pa/477/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="477 Pa. 400" data-case-ids="1738323" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0400-01">supra,</a> </em>that the accused must be advised of the ramifications of such waiver, including the intended new <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>trial date, to guarantee that the defendant understands the consequences of his waiver and to assist him in making an intelligent decision as to whether he should waive Rule 1100.</p>
    <p id="b341-5" data-blocks='[["BL_341.4",341,[221,512,1139,529]]]'>Even without the <em>Coleman </em>rationale, the Commonwealth must still establish the scope and voluntariness of the waiver. The rule is clear that a trial commence within 270 days of the arrest, if such arrest occurred prior to July 1, 1974. Subsection (d) provides a safeguard to the Commonwealth when the delay in commencing the trial is attributable to the defendant. If the Commonwealth fails to commence trial within the mandatory time, it has the burden to prove that the delay has not been caused by its lack of due diligence.</p>
    <p id="b341-6" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[217,1080,1142,970]]]'>Reviewing the record, it is clear that the Appellant did not indefinitely waive his right to a speedy trial. In a rather lengthy colloquy, the trial court discussed with the Appellant’s trial counsel the basis for the Appellant’s waiver. Trial counsel indicated that the Appellant wanted to complete a homicide trial before engaging in the robbery and burglary trial. The trial judge then inquired as to when the homicide trial would be completed. Being advised that the homicide trial was scheduled sometime after Labor Day, the court set the new trial date for September 23rd. At no time did the Appellant indicate that he was indefinitely waiving his Rule 1100 rights. Consequently, trial should have commenced prior to September 23. Excluding any subsequent continuances attributable to the Appellant, trial was commenced more than 900 days beyond that which is permissible under Rule 1100. Thus, the Appellant’s right to a speedy trial, guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, has been violated.</p>
    <p id="b341-7" data-blocks='[["BL_341.6",341,[216,2088,1139,88]]]'>The Appellant’s conviction for burglary and robbery must be reversed.</p>
