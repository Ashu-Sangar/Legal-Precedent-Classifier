Manley, charing him with burglary, robbery, recklessly endangering other persons and theft by unlawful taking. The charges arose out of the January 10, 1978 hold-up of tavern owners Anthony and Leo Boyarsky. During the hold-up, the victims were beaten, threatened at gunpoint and bound, and $41,000 was taken. Mr. Manley was convicted by a jury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten to twenty years on the robbery charge. On appeal, a three judge panel of Superior Court, <a href="/pa-super/282/0376-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="282 Pa.

Thus, the last day to commence trial within the period of Rule 1100 was August 14, 1978. When the case was called to trial on May 30, 1978, appellee appeared without counsel, stating that he had previously been repre<a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>sented by privately retained counsel at his preliminary hearing; however, as he had not paid his counsel’s fees, appellee was now unrepresented. After questioning appellee, the court continued the case and advised appellee to seek representation by the Public Defender immediately. As it appeared appellee would not be prepared to proceed to trial during the same term of court, thus delaying trial of the case until the next term of court which commenced in September, on June 1, 1978, the Commonwealth filed a petition for an extension of time under Rule 1100. A Rule to Show Cause, returnable June 9, was attached to the petition and a hearing on the petition was scheduled for June 14. The petition was served on appellee’s formerly retained counsel, on appellee and on the Public Defender, but no answer was filed and no one appeared at the hearing or opposed the petition in any manner. No action was taken on the petition by the court at that time. On September 1, 1978, the Public Defender entered his appearance on appellee’s behalf. Appellee filed a counselled petition for dismissal pursuant to Rule 1100, which was denied by the trial court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Trial commenced December 1, 1978.</p>

Rule 1100(d)(1), in effect at the time, provided: “In determining the period for commencement of trial, there shall be excluded therefrom such period of delay at any stage of the proceedings as results from the unavailability of the defendant or his attorney.”</p>

We further held that those periods of delay in the proceedings which were caused by the accused’s failure to obtain counsel were excludable from the computation of the 180 day period in which the accused was required to be brought to trial.

The only reason trial did not commence on that date was Mr. Manley’s having failed to secure legal counsel, whether privately or publicly funded. The trial court advised Mr. Manley of the gravity of the charges against him and of the necessity of legal representation, both during the conduct of the trial and during the pendency of the trial to aid in posting bail. Mr. Manley did not waive his right to counsel, and the court requested that Mr. Manley be escorted to the Public Defender’s Office immediately following the proceedings in order to determine whether he qualified financially for the services of the Public Defender. The record does not disclose the time when Mr. Manley actually contacted the Public Defender; but at some point the Public Defender was contacted as he did in fact enter an appearance on Mr. Manley’s behalf more than three months later, on September 1. Mr. Man<a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>ley’s failure to obtain counsel on his behalf was the direct cause of the delay in the proceedings which resulted on May 30, and the period of time from May 30 to August 31, a period of 94 days, is attributable to Mr. Manley’s unavailability, and, thus, excludable from computation of the 180 day period within which the Commonwealth was required to bring Mr. Manley to trial.

Rule 1100 was promulgated to insure to the accused his Sixth Amendment rights of a speedy trial. Without digressing into a discussion of the abuse from which this right evolved, it suffices to say that this Court adopted Rule 1100 as a means of alleviating a subjective approach to the problem of a speedy trial. In the Rule itself, we provided not only safeguards to the accused, but the means by which the Commonwealth can proceed when such delays are caused by the accused. These exceptions are embodied in Section <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>(d) of the Rule and are limited to those instances in which the delay is caused either by the failure of the accused or his attorney to appear at the trial, or by the accused petitioning the court for a continuance.</p>

Not only did the court fail to enter an order on this petition, the court also failed to enter an order requiring the Appellee to appear at the June 14 hearing on the Commonwealth’s motion.
