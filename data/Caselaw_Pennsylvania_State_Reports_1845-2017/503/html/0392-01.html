Appellant filed his application after Commonwealth Court had affirmed a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of York County which, in turn, had quashed appellees, Edward and Susan Gossmans’, appeal of a subdivision plan approval by the Lower Chanceford Township Board of Supervisors. Common Pleas had dismissed the Gossmans’ appeal on the ground that they lacked standing because they were neither owners of the land nor parties before the Board of Supervisors. Commonwealth Court affirmed on the alternative ground that the Gossmans had no cause of action on the merits. On the merits, appellant had argued that the Board abused its discretion when it failed to impose <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>conditions which would reflect certain alleged restrictive covenants on DeLaski’s subdivision. In this connection, Commonwealth Court reasoned that the Township’s zoning ordinance did not permit the Board of Supervisors to consider private covenants before granting subdivision approval. The application for further costs in Commonwealth Court included counsel fees incurred not only in that court but in Common Pleas as well.</p>
    <p id="b451-4" data-blocks='[["BL_451.4",451,[224,735,1138,254]]]'>[II The Gossmans challenge our jurisdiction on direct appeal. We agree with the Gossmans that appellant DeLaski does not have a right to a direct appeal under 42 Pa.C.S. § 723(a) of our Judicial Code and so hold. Section 723(a), as it existed when this appeal was taken, provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b451-5" data-blocks='[["BL_451.5",451,[264,1004,1097,309]]]'>(a) General rule. — The Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from final orders of the Commonwealth Court entered in any matter which was originally commenced in said court and which does not constitute an appeal to the Commonwealth Court from another court, a district justice or another government unit.</blockquote>

It began in York County Common Pleas. In enacting the Judicial Code, our legislature attempted to delineate the jurisdiction of the various courts comprising our unified judicial system to promote the efficient execution and administration of those functions within the scope of that system. If we were to treat an application for further costs and damages including counsel fees as a distinct “matter originating in Commonwealth Court” for purposes of appeal, this Court would be required to hear the matter as an appeal of right in all cases in which costs are granted or denied. The efficient administration of justice is not served by this Court’s hearing appeals as of right in such collateral matters. Such a rule would require us to review collateral orders in cases where we have only discretionary review of the merits of an appeal under 42 Pa.C.S. § 724. Moreover, in many cases meaningful review of an order granting or denying additional costs would require an examination of the merits of the appeal. Inevitably, such <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>an interpretation of our jurisdiction would crowd cases involving important and unique issues from our allocatur docket.</p>

Moreover, appellant’s application here sought not only counsel fees incurred in opposing the allegedly frivolous appeal, but also those incurred in the court below. An appellate court has no jurisdiction to award counsel fees generally. Its jurisdiction in such matters is carefully circumscribed by Pa.R.A.P. 2744,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which serves the salutary purpose of insuring the right of appeal granted by Article V, Section 9 of our Pennsylvania Constitution. <em>See City of Philadelphia v.

    <p id="b453-5" data-blocks='[["BL_453.5",453,[245,608,1138,736]]]'>As stated, the application for counsel fees was based on appellant’s contention that appellees generally commenced or continued the litigation in an “obdurate or vexatious” manner.

As previously stated, Rule 2744 provides if an appellate court shall determine that an appeal is frivolous it may award as further costs an attorney’s fee of $25.00 and damages at the rate of 6% per annum in addition to legal interest. <em>See supra </em>p. 397 n. 2. The draftsman’s note to Pa.R.A.P. 2744 states that it is based on 42 Pa.C.S. § 2503(9). Pa.R.A.P. 2751 provides:</p>
