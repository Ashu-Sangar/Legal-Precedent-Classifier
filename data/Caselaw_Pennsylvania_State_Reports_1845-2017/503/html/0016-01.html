(Supp.1983). The Commonwealth Court construed Act 111 to require impartiality on the part of all three arbitrators, and thus invalidated the award on the ground that the arbitrator appointed by appellant, Police Employees of the Borough of New Cumberland, had consulted with the Police and had actively sought to advance their interests during the panel’s deliberations. The Commonwealth Court also held that the award was void because the arbitration board did not render an award within thirty days of the appointment of its third member. Because the Commonwealth Court has misconstrued Act 111, we reverse.</p>

Section 4(b) gives each of the parties seeking a resolution of a labor dispute the power to “appoint” one arbitrator, qualified only by the additional statutory requirement that the appointment is to be made within five days of a request for binding arbitration. By contrast, the third member of the panel, designated as its chairman, is to be “agreed upon” by the party-appointed arbitrators or, should the arbitrators be unable to agree, chosen by a process of eliminating names from a list supplied by the American <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>Arbitration Association. When compared with the statutorily prescribed method for the selection of the board’s third member, the statutorily prescribed method for the selection of the board’s first two members reveals a clear legislative intent to facilitate the resolution of the parties’ dispute by conferring upon each party the unfettered discretion to select the arbitrator of its choice. Indeed, in requiring the parties to make prompt appointments to the board, section 4(b) expressly characterizes the persons appointed to the board by the parties as <em>“representing </em>the public employer and the [public employees] (emphasis added).” See also 43 P.S. § 217.8 (compensation of the board member appointed by the public employer and of the third member shall be paid by the public employer, whereas “[t]he compensation, if any, of the arbitrator appointed by the [public employees] shall be paid by them”).</p>
