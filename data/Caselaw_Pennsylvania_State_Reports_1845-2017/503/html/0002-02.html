Judge Durham rejected that argument in his opinion and it was abandoned here in favor of the argument that detainers lodged against appellant on the probation violation were improper because Judge Durham’s sentence, concurrent with Judge Lord’s, under Rule 1406, entitled him to release on March 9, 1983 at the expiration of his minimum on the sentence imposed by Judge Lord.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
