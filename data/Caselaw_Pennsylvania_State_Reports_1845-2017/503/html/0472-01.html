Meyer, then ten years of age, was seriously injured while riding a tractor owned by appellants, the Heilmans, and manufactured in 1952 by International Harvester Company, as the tractor was being driven by a Heilman employee to pull a manure spreader on the Heilmans’ farm in Lebanon County. Douglas’ injuries, which necessitated the amputation of his left leg from the knee down, resulted when he lost his balance and came in contact with the tractor’s revolving shaft, which powered the spreader; the safety shield provided by the manufacturer to cover the shaft had been removed. Douglas and his parents, appellees Larry M. and Boneta F. Meyer, subsequently brought an action in trespass naming the Heilmans and International Harvester as defendants. The case proceeded to trial before a jury, and at the conclusion of the Meyers’ case, the trial court granted International Harvester’s motion for a compulsory non-suit. After the Heilmans presented their defense, the jury returned a verdict in their favor. The Meyers’ motions for removal of the non-suit, for a judgment n.o.v. and for a new trial were denied, and they appealed to the Superior Court. That court reversed the order of the trial court granting the <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>non-suit and awarded a new trial as to both defendants on all issues. <em>Meyer v.

      <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 2231. Appellees’ cause of action against the Heilmans was not affected by the joinder or the subsequent removal of International Harvester as co-defendant, but rather remained separate and independent throughout the proceedings. At the conclusion of trial, the jury returned a verdict in that action, just as it would have been required to do had International Harvester remained a party. The trial court’s improper grant of a non-suit of appellees’ case against International Harvester thus had no cognizable impact on the jury’s decision.</p>

Since International Harvester Company did not, it cannot complain during the retrial about any prejudice if any prejudice exists. Furthermore, it is important to note that the Appellees have not been prejudiced by the lower court’s ruling as so indicated by the majority today, for the purpose of Rule 2232 is to give a defendant the opportunity to present all evidence demonstrating that the co-defendant may be liable. It is of no consequence that the Appellees may have been prejudiced, because initially the Appellees failed to establish a prima facie case against International Harvester.</p>
    <p id="b537-7" data-blocks='[["BL_537.8",537,[236,1376,1140,416]]]'>The Appellees filed a Complaint with alternative claims for recovery. It was incumbent upon the Appellees to sustain their burden of proof for both alternate theories. It is obvious from the lower court’s opinion that insufficient evidence was offered to raise an issue based on products liability. Accordingly, the lower court did not err in refusing to permit the jury to consider the Appellees’ claim against International Harvester Company.</p>
    <p id="b537-8" data-blocks='[["BL_537.9",537,[236,1823,1138,192]]]'>Accordingly, I join in with the majority’s opinion and order today reversing the Superior Court and remanding the matter to that court for disposition of all the remaining claims.</p>
