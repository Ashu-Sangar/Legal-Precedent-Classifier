    <p id="b683-4" data-blocks='[["BL_683.4",683,[233,690,1139,579]]]'>At trial the Commonwealth’s evidence established that on October 22, 1978, Michael Edwards, James Smith and James Browne were the victims of an unprovoked gun attack while they sat in their car. The trio had been followed to their car by four males who gathered around the car and prevented them from driving away. According to the Commonwealth’s evidence, appellant struck a handgun inside the car and fired at Browne, while another one of the attackers, Kevin Hill, fired a shotgun blast through the car’s front window. When the barrage of gunfire had ceased, a bullet had been lodged in Edward’s thigh.</p>
    <p id="b683-5" data-blocks='[["BL_683.5",683,[232,1292,1138,308]]]'>During his trial appellant was identified as one of the assailants by Edwards and Browne.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Both victims testified that at the time of the attack, appellant was clothed in a dark cap and a brownish red waist length jacket. An hour after the attack, appellant had been apprehended by the police in the vicinity of the scene, clad in identical clothing.</p>
    <p id="b683-6" data-blocks='[["BL_683.6",683,[231,1621,1137,362]]]'>Another Commonwealth witness, James Lark, testified that after the shooting appellant, who was dressed in the above described clothing, approached him and said: “My name is Johnny Scott and I killed someone” and “I’m the one that shot your homies [friends].” On this evidence appellant was subsequently found guilty of the above enumerated charges.</p>
    <p id="b683-7" data-blocks='[["BL_683.7",683,[230,2006,1138,251]],["BL_684.1",684,[250,292,1145,148]]]'>In post-trial motions appellant alleged the existence of after-discovered evidence. The unsworn post-verdict motion alleged that appellant’s counsel, Patricia Pierce, was informed by a Mr. Franklin Green, counsel for co-indictee, Kenneth Hill, that his client told him that he could exoner<a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>ate appellant. The motion acknowledged, however, that Hill had previously given contrary sworn testimony at his own trial denying any involvement in the shooting.</p>
    <p id="b684-5" data-blocks='[["BL_684.4",684,[247,462,1147,833]]]'>An evidentiary hearing was held on July 18, 1979. At the hearing, appellant called Mr. Green in an attempt to elicit from him his client’s statement. Invoking the attorney-client privilege, Green refused to testify. The hearing judge suggested to the prosecutor that Hill be offered immunity from prosecution for perjury so he could testify on behalf of appellant. Alternatively, appellant’s counsel argued that the attorney-client privilege between Green and Hill had been waived by the former when he disclosed Hill’s statement to appellant’s counsel. The trial court disagreed. When the Commonwealth refused to grant immunity, the trial court found that although it did not have the power to grant judicial immunity to Hill, a new trial was warranted based on the contents of the unsworn post-trial motion, notwithstanding its double hearsay nature, since the judge considered it to be reliable and credible.</p>
    <p id="b684-6" data-blocks='[["BL_684.5",684,[248,1325,1145,363]]]'>In reversing the order of a new trial and reinstating the verdicts, the Superior Court found that since the proposed statement was unavailable at the post-trial hearing, there was no admissible after-discovered evidence. It further reasoned that even if the alleged after-discovered evidence was produced it would have been perjurious, and therefore improper upon which to base a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b684-7" data-blocks='[["BL_684.6",684,[248,1710,1145,257]]]'>Initially, appellant contends that the Superior Court erred in its conclusion. He complains that his co-indictee’s statement was of such a nature that if he was granted a new trial a different verdict would be likely. The trial court agreed and granted appellant a new trial for that reason.</p>

    <p id="b685-5" data-blocks='[["BL_685.4",685,[228,479,1140,1109]]]'>Here, the record is barren of any proof that Hill’s statement was producible or admissible. At the post-trial hearing, Mr. Green, attorney for Hill, was called by appellant’s counsel for the sole purpose of repeating to the court his client’s prior inconsistent out-of-court statement, which had been made in the confines of their attorney-client relationship. Declining to endanger his client’s rights Mr. Green invoked the attorney-client privilege and refused to testify. In response to the trial court’s questions, Mr. Green advised the trial judge that if Hill were called to testify for appellant he would be jeopardizing his right against self-incrimination by opening himself up to a charge of perjury based upon his sworn trial testimony, and if so, would invoke his Fifth Amendment right. Over appellant’s counsel’s objections, the trial court ruled that Mr. Green’s privilege claim was proper and that he could not be questioned further concerning his client’s statement. Because Hill intended to assert his right against self-incrimination, he was never subpoenaed to testify at the hearing. Appellant, however, presented no evidence that, even if Hill was called as a witness, he would have testified favorably for him.</p>
    <p id="b685-6" data-blocks='[["BL_685.5",685,[227,1620,1139,307]]]'>Nevertheless, Judge Lois Forer found that the statement by appellant’s counsel of what Mr. Green had told her of what his client told him, although double hearsay, was reliable, trustworthy and legitimate testimonial evidence; and that <em>“if </em>Mr. Green had testified” ... she <em>“would have </em>granted a new trial,” (Slip op.

Although the trial court did not actually hear testimony from co-indictee Hill, the post-trial motion statement exonerating appellant was clearly untrustworthy and unreliable, bordering on charade. During his own trial, Hill disclaimed any complicity in the assault.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Then following appellant’s trial, appellant’s attorney discovered another statement made by Hill in which he simultaneously confessed to the shooting and exonerated appellant. These two polarized statements were totally inconsistent and contradictory. Both of them could not be true.

Appellant’s counsel was attempting to gain a new trial based on a statement which had been relayed to her by another attorney, which in turn had been told to him by his client. When dissecting a double hearsay statement, the reliability and trustworthiness of each declarant must be independently established.

As the trial judge correctly observed, the real issue is whether an innocent person has been wrongly convicted. Observing that “post-verdict accomplice testimony should be considered with caution,” the majority dismisses Hill’s statement that appellant was not involved in the shooting as “clearly untrustworthy and unreliable, bordering on charade.” The majority neglects to mention, however, that appellant’s motion describes Hill’s statement as having been made to counsel <em>prior to trial, </em>and not, as the majority implies, following conviction. When Hill’s statement exculpating appellant is viewed in its proper context, the majority’s attack upon the credibility of that statement is unfounded. Basic common sense compels the conclusion that Hill’s pretrial admission of his guilt to his counsel with its exculpation of appellant is inherently more credible than Hill’s <em>subsequent, </em>self-serving testimony at his trial that he was not involved in the shooting inci<a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>dent — testimony which was necessarily found incredible through the verdict of guilty.</p>

The Commonwealth’s argument that courts have no power to compel a grant of immunity to a defense witness completely ignores the crucial question of why the Commonwealth, on this record, would refuse to grant Hill immunity in the first place. Hill has already been convicted for his part in the crimes charged. There is no record of his ever having appealed from that conviction. Assuming that Hill would testify as set forth in appellant’s motion, all that the Commonwealth would sacrifice by granting limited immunity to Hill is the opportunity to prosecute him for committing perjury at his first trial in 1979, an opportunity which has already existed for four years but which the Commonwealth has not chosen to seize. And, of course, if Hill were to stand by his trial testimony, nothing would be lost at all.</p>
