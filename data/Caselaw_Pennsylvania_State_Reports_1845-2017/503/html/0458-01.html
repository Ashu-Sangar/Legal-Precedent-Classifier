Ruffin was insured by Granite Mutual Insurance Company under a liability policy in the amount of $10,000. Granite had entered into a contract of reinsurance with Security Mutual Insurance Company (Appellee) for the last $2,500 of this coverage. Ruffin reported the accident to Granite, which in turn reported it to Security. Both insurance companies knew at the outset that Reid had sustained serious and probably permanent injuries to his right hand and arm, and that two witnesses would probably give testimony adverse to the insured driver, Ruffin. Reid initiated a personal injury action against Ruffin, but prior to trial offered to settle the case for the policy amount, $10,000, the offer to expire after thirty days. Granite received the offer but did not respond or inform Security. When no response was received within thirty days, Reid’s attorney petitioned to remove the case from Arbitration to Major Case Listing. Thereafter, Granite offered a settlement of $9,000, which was refused. Granite informed Security of the $9,000 offer of settlement and the refusal, of the removal of the case to Major Case Listing, and advised Security to carry a $2,000 reserve (indicating that Granite planned to make a second offer of $9,500).</p>

Almost three months later, at trial, Granite offered to settle for the policy limit of $10,000. This offer also was rejected, and the case proceeded to trial, where a jury awarded Appellant a verdict of $80,000. In a garnishment proceeding against Granite and Security, Reid charged both insurers with bad faith refusal to settle, and a jury awarded judgment against both insurance companies. <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>Granite, however, had become insolvent.

    <p id="b518-5" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[261,595,1146,728]]]'>The Appellant argues here that the Superior Court erred in reversing the trial court’s determination that Granite acted as Security’s agent. He points to language in the reinsurance contract directing Granite to advise Security of all claims which may result in an excess being charged against Security and to afford Security “the opportunity to be associated with [Granite] in the defense of any claim or suit or proceeding involving this reinsurance,” and obliging Granite to “co-operate in every respect in the defense or control of such claim, suit or proceeding.” This language, argues Appellant, establishes Security’s ultimate control over all claims matters undertaken by Granite. He points further to that section of Article 8 of the contract which dealt specifically with settlement matters as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b518-6" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[299,1338,1108,510]]]'>Settlement of claims involving this reinsurance shall not be made without the consent of the Reinsurer, except in those instances where an immediate decision is necessary and it is impracticable to obtain the consent of the Reinsurer.

    <p id="b518-7" data-blocks='[["BL_518.6",518,[258,1874,1145,307]]]'>The Appellant argues that Security’s reservation of the power to consent to all settlements involving the reinsurance establishes conclusively that the final decision regarding settlement of claims rested in Security and that Granite acted as an agent on Security’s behalf in such matters.

The Article does not require all decisions regarding settlement matters involving reinsurance to be approved by Security. Security is given no control over decisions by Granite not to settle a claim. Likewise, Security could not direct Granite to accept an offer of settlement if for some reason Granite was unwilling to do so. It is difficult to conceive of an agency relationship wherein the principal has no authority to require his agent to perform an act on his behalf.</p>
    <p id="b519-6" data-blocks='[["BL_519.5",519,[254,1147,1138,669]]]'>We think it is abundantly clear that Security authorized Granite to act on its behalf only “in those instances where an immediate decision is necessary and it is impracticable to obtain the consent of the Reinsurer.” Otherwise, settlement was not to be made without Security’s consent. Thus if Granite can be said to be the agent of Security, it is only to the limited extent of instances where an immediate decision <em>to settle </em>is necessary. Because those circumstances are not present in this case, and because the decision which resulted in a finding of bad faith was Granite’s decision <em>not to settle, </em>a decision over which Security had no control, the bad faith of the insurer cannot be imputed to the reinsurer.</p>

The primitive insurer, or the ceding company, finds that it has more risks than it cares to safely keep in its own portfolio. It has incurred expenses in connection with agency commissions, ordinary overhead, and the like, in addition to the reserve for payment of the claim. Consequently, it agrees to turn over to another insurer, usually one handling nothing but such reinsurances, half of such risk, or all of such risk in excess of a certain sum, in which latter event it is termed excess insurance. The premium which it pays to the reinsurer for the hazard which it assumes is not as large in proportion as that which the ceding company retains, since the reinsurer does not have a like agency expense or similar overhead. The original insured <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>is not notified of the reinsurance, has no contact with the reinsuring company, and is generally not a party to the contract and has no legal interest therein. Thus, a diversification or spread of risk is achieved with' greater security, though less profit, to the ceding company.</blockquote>
