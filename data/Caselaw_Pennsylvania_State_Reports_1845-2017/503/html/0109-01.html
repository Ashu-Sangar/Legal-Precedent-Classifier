Following a hearing, at which appellee Lancaster County Tavern Owners Association was represented by counsel and presented testimony in opposition to the application, the Board approved the issuance of the license on December 23, 1980. The Association then appealed the Board’s decision to the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County, which dismissed the appeal on the ground that the Association did not come within any of the specified classes of persons permitted to appeal under the Liquor Code. See 47 P.S. §§ 4-404 and 4-464. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court, stating that it was “reluctantly” following this Court’s decision in <em>Application of El Rancho Grande, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/496/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="496 Pa. 496" data-case-ids="1772860" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0496-01">496 Pa. 496</a>, <a href="/pa/496/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="496 Pa. 496" data-case-ids="1772860" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0496-01">437 A.2d 1150</a> (1981), held that the Association had standing to appeal under the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. § 701 et seq.

Although section 933(a)(1)(v) confers jurisdiction upon the courts of common pleas of appeals from “determinations of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board appealable under ... the Liquor Code,” that Code, as noted, limits the classes of persons and institutions permitted to appeal. Because the individual tavern owners in <em>El Rancho Grande </em>were not among the classes specified in the Liquor Code, the Board’s determination was not, as to the tavern owners, appealable under the Liquor Code to the court of common pleas pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 933. Thus, the exclusion contained in section 701(b)(2) did not apply to the tavern owners, and their appeal should have been taken directly to the Commonwealth Court under section 702 of the Administrative Agency Law. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 763(a) (jurisdiction of appeals from government agencies under § 702 vested in Commonwealth Court).

Accordingly, we held that the individual tavern owners had standing to challenge the Board’s action in approving the license application. At the same time, we denied standing to the Tioga-Potter Tavern Owners Association, which had also appealed, noting that the Association had not appeared as a protestant at the initial hearing before the Board, and had sought merely to allege the same injuries that had already been alleged by the individual tavern owners.</p>

      <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>Appellee Lancaster County Tavern Owners Association contends that, unlike the Tioga-Potter Tavern Owners Association, it should be granted standing because it was represented at the Board’s hearing on appellant’s application and because it has alleged injuries on behalf of the individual members of the Association rather than simply duplicating their efforts. Nowhere, however, has the Association demonstrated that it or its members are “aggrieved” within the meaning of the Administrative Agency Law and our case law. Unlike the individual tavern owners in <em>El Rancho Grande, </em>the Association presented no evidence at the Board hearing that any of its members would suffer direct and substantial harm as a result of the approval of a new liquor license. Aside from the testimony of one Association witness who stated that the granting of an additional license might adversely affect some of his competitors’ businesses, though not his own, all of the Association witnesses’ testimony concerned the questions of whether any customers would want to drink alcoholic beverages with a “family style” Pennsylvania Dutch meal and whether any area restaurants were presently equipped to serve both family style meals and alcoholic beverages. In its “Petition on Appeal” to the court of common pleas, the Association alleged simply that it was “aggrieved.” And in its brief to this Court, the Association has alleged only that the granting of an additional license will cause it economic injury as an association, without explaining how the Association will be financially harmed by the approval of the license application of a potential new member of the Association. In short, unlike the individual tavern owners in <em>El Rancho Grande, </em>the Association has failed to establish, on either its own or its members’ behalf, the type of substantial, direct, and immediate interest in the Board’s action necessary to confer standing to appeal under the Administrative Agency Law. Accordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed.</p>
