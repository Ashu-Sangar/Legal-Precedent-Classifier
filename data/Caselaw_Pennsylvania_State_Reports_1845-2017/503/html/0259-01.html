He retained Irving Madnick, Esq., to institute suit to recover for the loss sustained. A complaint in trespass was filed on November 2, 1972 in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County against Gloria and Ronald Fillette. The Fillettes were insured by the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. After negotiations, Liberty Mutual, in 1974, agreed to settle the case for the sum of Seven Thousand ($7,000) Dollars. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Liberty Mutual delivered to Madnick a release containing the terms of the proposed settlement and requiring the signature of appellee. The release was returned to Liberty Mutual purportedly signed by Philip Rothman and attested to by two witnesses. In return, Liberty Mutual presented to Madnick a check in the amount of Seven Thousand ($7,000) Dollars, payable to Philip Rothman and Irving L. Madnick. This check was thereafter purportedly endorsed by Philip Rothman and cashed. On order of Madnick, the case was marked settled, discontinued and ended on September 9, 1974.</p>

I disagree, however, with the majority’s conclusion that appellee is barred from pursuing his claim against appellants for amounts in excess of the $7,000 settlement <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>with which appellants have been credited. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>
    <p id="b325-5" data-blocks='[["BL_325.4",325,[246,405,1137,644]]]'>Since appellee never authorized the $7,000 settlement, there is no reason to believe that that amount was reasonable to compensate him for his injuries. In addition, I fail to see how prohibiting appellee from establishing the true value of his loss at trial will promote our policy favoring settlement. The only thing that would be accomplished by disallowing a suit such as appellee’s is the further punishment of a plaintiff and the provision of a bonanza to a defendant for conduct which was beyond their control. In this case, I do not think that appellee should be further penalized; rather, appellee should have an opportunity to establish at trial his actual damages.</p>
    <p id="b325-6" data-blocks='[["BL_325.5",325,[242,1086,1139,640]]]'>Further, the fact that a client security fund exists is no reason to deny appellee his right of action against appellants. The client security fund is funded by attorneys and its purpose is to assist clients who have suffered losses due to the misconduct of their attorneys. The fund’s purpose is not, however, to reimburse appellee for any injuries resulting from the negligence of appellants. While it is true that appellants should not bear the loss occasioned by appellee’s dishonest counsel, neither should appellants be permitted to profit from counsel’s misconduct. If appellants actually caused injury to appellee in an amount in excess of $7,000, then they should be responsible for that excess.</p>
    <p id="b325-7" data-blocks='[["BL_325.6",325,[241,1763,1138,141]]]'>I would hold that appellee may proceed to trial against appellants for any damages in excess of the $7,000 unauthorized settlement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a>
