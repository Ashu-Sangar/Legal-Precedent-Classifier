      <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>Ex-mayor Nacrelli is rewarded with a publicly funded pension notwithstanding his crimes in office in an opinion entered “per curiam,” a designation generally reserved for unanimous opinions of a court, or, at the very least, majority opinions, and not opinions such as today’s, which is embraced by only three of the six members of this Court who participate in the decision. That opinion advances a combination of two theories in support of its reward: one, that Nacrelli committed his crimes in office before the enactment of the Public Employees Pension Forfeiture Act, Act of July 8, 1978, P.L. 752, § 1 et seq., 43 P.S. § 1311 et seq. (Supp.1983), and thus was without “notice” that his breaches of the public trust would make him ineligible for his publicly funded pension; and two, that pension terms and conditions are immutable as of the commencement of employment and that Nacrelli, who commenced public employment before the enactment of the Forfeiture Act and managed to delay his resignation until he had completed twenty years of service with the City of Chester, has fulfilled all the conditions of eligibility for pension benefits. The per curiam opinion deems both theories to be “of equal significance,” yet the “immutable contract” theory, in the light of the most recent mandate awarding Nacrelli a public pension, is clearly controlling in the minds of at least some Court members joining in today’s result, who apparently would require that Nacrelli be awarded a pension even if he had committed his crimes after the enactment of the Forfeiture Act. See <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Zimmerman v. Officers and Employees Retirement Board, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/501/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="501 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="1782498" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0293-01">501 Pa. at 295-302</a>, <a href="/pa/501/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="461 A.2d 593" data-case-ids="1782480,1782498" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0292-01,/pa/501/0293-01">461 A.2d at 594-98</a> (Nix, J., joined by McDermott, J., announcing the judgment of the Court).</p>

Inexplicably, however, this purported concern for the advancement of the Forfeiture Act’s goals is discarded on the facts of this case, which show clearly that despite having been found guilty of public corruption as charged, Nacrelli was able to delay the effective date of his resignation until five weeks <em>after </em>he had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and three weeks <em>after </em>the twentieth anniversary of the commencement of his employment with the City of Chester. On this record, is it not clear that controlling effect should be given to the date that the convicted public official should have been removed from office or, for that matter, the date on which the public trust was breached? How are the goals of the Act advanced by endorsing a public servant’s ability to manipulate the date of his resignation and thus effectively foreclose his timely discharge?</p>

Snyder, </em><a href="/pa/282/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="282 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1088338" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0440-01">282 Pa. 440</a>, 454, <a href="/citations/?q=128%20A.%2080" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="128 A. 80">128 A. 80</a>, 85 (1925), and even longer standing case law embracing the common-law rule which subjects any employee, public or private, to a forfeiture of employment benefits if he breaches the duty to discharge his employment responsibilities with fidelity, see, e.g., <em>Peniston v. John Y.

The American ideal of equal justice under law rejects every device which would accord to public officials an exceptional position before the law. See <em>Commonwealth v. Casper, </em><a href="/pa/481/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="481 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1747275" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0143-01">481 Pa. 143</a>, <a href="/pa/481/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="481 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1747275" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0143-01">392 A.2d 287</a> (1978). Only through adherence to this ideal can respect for law and the integrity of public service be maintained.</p>
