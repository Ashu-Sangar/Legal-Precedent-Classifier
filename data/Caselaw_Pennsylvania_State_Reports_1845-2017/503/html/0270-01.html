Failure to file a claim within the statutorily prescribed period extinguishes the right, as well as the remedy, under the Workmen’s Compensation Act. If, however, the employer fraudulently or deceptively lulls the claimant into inaction, the employer will be estopped from raising the statute of limitations.

      <p id="b333-8" data-blocks='[["BL_333.8",333,[227,2074,1135,228]]]'>. I wish to emphasize that employers have no affirmative duty to advise claimants of their rights. Yet, when an employer is approached by a claimant, it should not be free to dispense legal advice which is negligently or intentionally false. Such a rule would in no way affect the rights of employers and claimants to enter into agreements for compensation. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 731.</p>
