In contrast, a mortgage note designed primarily to give the lender security for the timely repayment of his money at a profitable rate of interest, will more likely contain a prepayment clause without a penalty attached.

As the quote from <em>Dugan </em>indicates, this presumption arises ostensibly because private mortgage notes are becoming more and more valuable as an investment instrument, and thus freedom from mortgage anticipation is very important to the mortgagee who wishes to maintain a steady income over time.</p>

To do so, however, we need not embrace the conclusion reached by the Connecticut court and ignore other important considerations merely to accommodate this trend. Rather, and indeed because of this increased use of the mortgage as an investment instrument, we must consider the policy encouraging such use in light of the implications it might have on the free alienability of land — a consideration we feel is the dominant one, since the fundamental purpose of the mortgage note in most instances is to secure a debt incurred in the purchase of land from which the debt arises rather than to secure investment income for the mortgagee.</p>
    <p id="b121-5" data-blocks='[["BL_121.4",121,[229,970,1140,472]]]'>When the mortgagee takes a mortgage note for investment purposes, the usual effect will be to restrain the mortgagor from alienating the land securing the note for the duration of the mortgage, since the mortgagor cannot pass clear title to that land until the note is satisfied. Coterminous with this result is the possibility that the mortgagee can indirectly control or restrain the mortgagor’s ability to subdivide and sell portions of the mortgaged tract merely on the basis of his security interest in the land.</p>

Instead, we think it wiser to raise a presumption of a right to prepayment of the note where a mortgage is silent as to that right. This presumption could be rebutted by showing a contrary intent mutually manifested by the parties. Such a presumption would not work a hardship on the mortgagee since, in virtually all instances, he is the drafter of the mortgage note and can thus include within the note a clause stating that the note is not subject to prepayment. This would put the mortgagor on notice that he will in all probability be restrained from selling the land for the duration of the term. If he signs the note contain<a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>ing such a provision, he will then be bound by it even though it may restrain his right to its sale or use.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
