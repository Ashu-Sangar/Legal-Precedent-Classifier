Thus, the Commonwealth would have been permitted to ask appellant’s character witness if they had heard that appellant had been arrested for assaulting his wife and on a weapons charge. Despite any cautionary instruction the court may have given the jury, the undue prejudice to appellant is obvious. On one hand, the jury would have heard that appellant had a reputation for being peaceful while on the other hand, the jury would also have heard that appellant had been arrested on two charges. Had appellant been convicted of the charges, it would be easier to say that he must suffer the consequences of placing his character at issue. But instantly, the arrests which would have been alluded to never resulted in convictions. Since an arrest is equally consistent with either guilt or innocence, the cases allowing such cross-examination are overruled.</blockquote>

    <p id="b290-6" data-blocks='[["BL_290.5",290,[247,1000,1147,1286]],["BL_291.1",291,[252,286,1136,98]]]'>I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that <em>Commonwealth v. Scott, </em><a href="/pa/496/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="496 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1772862" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0188-01">496 Pa. 188</a>, <a href="/pa/496/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="496 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1772862" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0188-01">436 A.2d 607</a> (1981), must be applied retroactively to the instant matter for two reasons. First, the change embodied in <em>Scott </em>was not constitutionally compelled. “The argument of the necessity of decision-making consistency in the application of constitutionally compelled decisions loses its force when removed from the constitutional setting.” <em>Commonwealth v. Geschwendt, <a href="/pa/500/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="500 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="1781033" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0120-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/pa/500/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="500 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="1781033" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0120-01">500 Pa. at 130</a>, <a href="/pa/500/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="500 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="1781033" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0120-01">454 A.2d at 996</a>. Thus it would have been appropriate in the instant case for this Court to weigh appellant’s interest in reaping the benefit of the new rule against the purposes sought to be accomplished therein and the impact of retroactive application upon our system of criminal justice. Here, as in <em>Commonwealth v. Geschwendt, <a href="/pa/500/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="500 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="1781033" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0120-01">supra,</a> </em>“we are concerned with merely a change in state practice,” <em><a href="/pa/500/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="500 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="1781033" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0120-01">Id.</a> </em><a href="/pa/500/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="500 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="1781033" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0120-01">500 Pa. at 130</a>, <a href="/pa/500/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="500 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="1781033" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0120-01">454 A.2d at 996</a>. The change in <em>Scott </em>represents a refinement of that practice rather than a correction of a “serious flaw in the fact-finding process.” <em><a href="/pa/500/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="500 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="1781033" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0120-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/500/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="500 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="1781033" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0120-01">500 Pa. at 132</a>, <a href="/pa/500/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="500 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="1781033" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0120-01">454 A.2d at 997</a>. <em>Scott </em>announced a better rule of evidence to be applied in criminal trials. The salutary purposes of this new rule cannot be significantly advanced by its retrospective application. Moreover, the application of <em>Scott </em>to trials already conducted would have a deleterious effect upon the administration <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>of criminal justice. Thus there is no justification for the majority’s decision to apply <em>Scott </em>retroactively.</p>
    <p id="b291-5" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[249,408,1140,1005]]]'>My second ground for disagreement with the majority is the fact that the <em>Scott </em>decision represents a “clear break with the past.” <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em><a href="/us/457/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="457 U.S. 537" data-case-ids="6191611" data-case-paths="/us/457/0537-01">457 U.S. 537</a>, <a href="/us/457/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="457 U.S. 537" data-case-ids="6191611" data-case-paths="/us/457/0537-01">102 S.Ct. 2579</a>, <a href="/us/457/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="457 U.S. 537" data-case-ids="6191611" data-case-paths="/us/457/0537-01">73 L.Ed.2d 202</a> (1982) (where new constitutional rule was unanticipated, a finding of nonretroactivity is indicated). <em>Scott </em>explicitly overruled our prior case law, under which the prosecution was permitted to question a character witness as to prior arrests of the defendant not resulting in conviction. <em>See Commonwealth v. Little, </em><a href="/pa/449/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="449 Pa. 28" data-case-ids="1945656" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0028-01">449 Pa. 28</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=295%20A.2d%20287" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="295 A.2d 287">295 A.2d 287</a> (1972); <em>Commonwealth v. Amos, </em><a href="/pa/445/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="445 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="1939994" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0297-01">445 Pa. 297</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=284%20A.2d%20748" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="284 A.2d 748">284 A.2d 748</a> (1971); <em>Commonwealth v. Jenkins, </em><a href="/pa/413/0606-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="413 Pa. 606" data-case-ids="1888572" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0606-01">413 Pa. 606</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.2d%20497" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="198 A.2d 497">198 A.2d 497</a> (1964). Moreover, in <em>Scott </em>we noted that a vast majority of jurisdictions, following <em>Michelson v. United States, </em><a href="/us/335/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="335 U.S. 469" data-case-ids="6159942" data-case-paths="/us/335/0469-01">335 U.S. 469</a>, <a href="/us/335/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="335 U.S. 469" data-case-ids="6159942" data-case-paths="/us/335/0469-01">69 S.Ct. 213</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=93%20L.%20Ed.%20168" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="93 L. Ed. 168">93 L.Ed. 168</a> (1948), allow such an inquiry. Thus even if the <em>Scott </em>rule had been constitutionally compelled, its nonretroactive application would be clearly indicated. <em>See United States v. Johnson, <a href="/us/457/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="457 U.S. 537" data-case-ids="6191611" data-case-paths="/us/457/0537-01">supra;</a> Commonwealth v.
