The issue before us is whether appellant’s arrest, carried out by a McKees Rocks police officer in the City of Pittsburgh, was proper under 42 Pa.C.S. § 8901,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> authorizing local police to arrest individuals beyond the territorial limits of their jurisdiction “if the officer continues in pursuit of such person after commission of the offense.” We agree with the lower courts that the police were here in pursuit of appellant within the meaning of the applicable statute. Furthermore, the facts show the arresting officer had probable cause. Since the extraterritorial arrest was lawful, we affirm Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b227-7" data-blocks='[["BL_227.7",227,[252,1386,1141,786]]]'>An analysis of the term “pursuit” is necessary to this holding. Appellant argues that his arrest was improper because the arresting officer was not in “hot pursuit,” which he maintains the statute requires. He also argues that the proper standard for police entry into a foreign jurisdiction is a belief based on probable cause that the suspect has entered that jurisdiction. The Commonwealth contends that the term “pursuit” as used in Section 8901 has consistently been interpreted to mean “fresh” or “continuous,” rather than “hot” pursuit, and that under that standard the arrest in the present case was proper. It further argues that “reasonable belief”, rather than “probable cause”, is all the statute requires for local police to arrest in another jurisdiction. In the alternative it contends probable cause existed in this case.</p>

      <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>On August 23, 1980, Daniel Irvin was the only clerk operating a 24-hour Mini Mart on Chartiers Avenue in McKees Rocks, Allegheny County. At approximately 6:35 a.m., appellant, holding a sock over his face with his left hand, entered the store, pointed a silver toy gun at Irvin, and demanded the money from the cash register. Although he assumed the gun was authentic, Irvin reached for it. Appellant pulled away and left the store, dropping the sock from his face when he was outside, thus allowing Irvin a clear view of his face for a few seconds at a distance of about 12 feet. Irvin gave chase, but was unable to catch appellant. Irvin returned to the store and reported the attempted robbery to McKees Rocks Police. He also gave them a description of the suspect including his clothing and approximate height and weight. Officer Logue of the McKees Rocks Police arrived about 1 minute later and received from Irvin the route of appellant’s flight. Meanwhile, Officer Connors of the same police force drove to Thompson Avenue in the area where appellant had last been seen. A pedestrian informed him that he had seen a man fitting appellant’s description running down Thompson Avenue toward the Wind Gap Bridge which leads into the City of Pittsburgh. Five other patrol cars, from McKees Rocks, Stowe Township and Kennedy Township, also pursued the suspect.</p>

The officers knew that the only three street routes available to appellant were Church Avenue, Chartiers Avenue and Thompson Avenue. The last led over the Wind Gap Bridge. Because all other escape routes were covered and appellant had not yet been seen, Officer Logue suspected that appellant had taken a footbridge under the Wind Gap vehicular bridge into Pittsburgh. Acting on the thought he drove over the Wind Gap Bridge into the city. After crossing, while still looking for the suspect, he circled <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>back. Before he got back to the bridge itself he spotted a person whose description matched that of the robber. This person, also wearing clothes like those of the robber, was about 45 yards away when first seen. Apparently, on seeing Logue the person ran away. That Officer gave chase on foot and apprehended appellant on residential property in the City of Pittsburgh. Officer Logue then arrested appellant and seized the toy gun used in the attempted robbery, a sock in appellant’s left pocket, and a white and black print shirt.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Thirty-five minutes had passed since the attempted robbery.

Both <em>England </em>and <em>Davis </em>involved arrests by police officers pursuant to valid warrants, which were made outside their jurisdictions. No pursuit of any kind was involved. Section 11 came into play because of defendants’ arguments that Section 11 had impliedly repealed 19 P.S. § 3, authorizing the execution of arrest warrants beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the issuing magistrate. The Court in both cases rejected this contention. The <em>Davis </em>Court noted, however, that 19 P.S. § 11 did "not limit an arresting officer’s jurisdiction to ‘hot’ pursuit of felons.” <a href="/pa/466/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="466 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1714960" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0102-01">466 Pa. at </a>108 n. 4, <a href="/pa/466/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="466 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1714960" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0102-01">351 A.2d at </a>645 n. 4.</p>
