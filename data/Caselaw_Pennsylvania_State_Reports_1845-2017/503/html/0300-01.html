We conclude that the lack of knowledge or understanding of a clearly drafted exclusion clause in a written contract of insurance executed by both parties does not render the clause unenforceable. Hence we reverse the Superior Court’s determination to the contrary, and remand the record to the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County with the direction that judgment be entered in favor of American.</p>

Evans against Venetian and one of its partners, appellee Sheldon B. Morris, in which Evans sought to recover for damages to a portico installed by a subcontractor of Venetian pursuant to a contract between Venetian and Evans. The portico had been installed in April of 1974 on property owned by Evans, and was destroyed completely in January of 1978 when it collapsed during a heavy snowstorm. The collapse of the portico also caused damage to property owned by Evans which had been stored underneath the portico. Evans’ complaint, which alleged breaches of implied and express warranties, sought damages of $13,826.56, the cost of replacing the portico, and additional damages of $880, the cost of repairing the items stored beneath the portico plus the cost of labor needed to remove the collapsed structure.</p>

The contract was executed on behalf of Venetian by appellee Morris and on behalf of American by Boris H. Levitsky, an employee of Block Brothers Insurance Company, which acted as agent for American. The policy, which took effect May 1, 1975, provided personal injury and property damage liability coverage for all “sums which the insured shall be legally obligated to pay as damages.... ” The policy further provided that American had “the right and the duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage” up to the policy limits.</p>

He also testified that, although he had received a copy of the policy, he had never read it. He stated that he had not read the policy because he had relied <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>on the judgment of the Block Brothers Insurance Agency and because he had indicated to Block Brothers that “we wanted full coverage on everything we have.”</p>

American agreed, on Venetian’s behalf, to indemnify Evans for the cost of the damaged property which had been stored beneath the portico as well as the cost of labor, but refused to defend the assumpsit action or tender payment for the cost of the portico itself. American’s refusal was based on its assertion that, while the policy provided coverage for damage caused by products of Venetian, the policy expressly excluded coverage for damage to Venetian’s products themselves. Trial then commenced on the breach of warranty action, at the conclusion of which a jury returned a verdict against Venetian and Morris in the amount of $13,094.64.</p>

Nonetheless, the court of common pleas, relying on language in the Superior Court’s decision in <em>Hionis v.

Those provisions expressly excluded coverage for “property damage to the named insured’s products arising out of such products,” and for “property damage to work performed by or on behalf of the named insured arising out of such work ... or out of materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection therewith,” the very types of losses sustained here.

By focusing on what was and was not said at the time of contract formation rather than on the parties’ writing, <em>Hionis </em>makes the question of the scope of insurance coverage in any given case depend upon how a factfinder resolves questions of credibility. Such a process, apart from the obvious uncertainty of its results, unnecessarily delays the resolution of controversy, adding only, unwanted costs to the cost of procuring insurance. Thus, <em>Hionis, </em>which would permit an insured to avoid the application of a clear and unambiguous limitation clause in an insurance contract, is not to be followed.</p>

This record does not present such an occasion.

Its terms are not bargained for but rather dictated by the insurer. Thus the insured’s awareness and understanding of exclusions set forth in an insurance policy should not be presumed from the mere presence of such exclusions among the policy’s terms. The very fact that the insurer prescribes particular exclusions indicates an assumption that the purchaser could otherwise reasonably expect to be covered against the risk so excluded.</p>
    <p id="b377-8" data-blocks='[["BL_377.9",377,[215,1679,1141,635]]]'>It is therefore crucial that the insurer explain and the insured understand the precise nature of the policy’s limitations. For this reason I would apply the test adopted by the Superior Court in <em>Hionis v. Northern Mutual Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/230/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="230 Pa. Super. 511" data-case-ids="814741" data-case-paths="/pa-super/230/0511-01">230 Pa.Super. 511</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=327%20A.2d%20363" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="327 A.2d 363">327 A.2d 363</a> (1974), employed by both that court and the trial court in this matter, and hold the insured to a standard of proving the insured was aware of and fully appreciated the effect of exclusions in the insurance policy before permitting the insurer to escape its duty to defend the insured. Because the insurer in the instant case failed to sustain that burden, I would affirm the order of the Superior Court.</p>
