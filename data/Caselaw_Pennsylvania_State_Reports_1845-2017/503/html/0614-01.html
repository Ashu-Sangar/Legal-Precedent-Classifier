There, the plaintiff corporation entered into an enforceable contract with the defendant corporation in which the defendant agreed to obtain financing for a cooperative apartment house to be constructed by the plaintiff. The defendant breached the contract and plaintiff sued certain officers and agents of the corporation individually. In refusing to impose personal liability on those corporate officers and agents, this Court held that where the plaintiff knowingly dealt with the corporation as such, <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>and had full right of action against it, there was no reason why the officers, who were charged neither with fraud nor falsehood, should be held individually liable. <em><a href="/citations/?q=144%20A.%20823" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="144 A. 823">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/295/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="295 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="1115204" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0074-01">295 Pa. at 78</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=144%20A.%20823" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="144 A. 823">144 A. at 824</a>. In so holding, this Court relied on the general rule that “ ‘[wjhenever a corporation makes a contract, it is the contract of the legal entity of the artificial being created by the charter, and not the contract of the individual members.’ ” <em><a href="/citations/?q=144%20A.%20823" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="144 A. 823">Id.</a> </em><a href="/pa/295/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="295 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="1115204" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0074-01">295 Pa. at 79</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=144%20A.%20823" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="144 A. 823">144 A. at 824</a> (citations omitted).

    <p id="b676-4" data-blocks='[["BL_676.4",676,[258,935,1146,950]]]'>In addition, Superior Court cited <em>McKenna v.

In that case, the plaintiff sued to recover for personal injuries sustained while operating a punch press which had been purchased by plaintiff’s employer from Art Pearl Works, Inc., through its President and authorized agent, Bernard Dorfmann. Plaintiff sued both the Corporation and Dorfmann. The court noted that there was no evidence or averment of fraud, criminal conduct or other <em>ultra vires </em>conduct on the part of the corporation. Accordingly, the court concluded that “[a]bsent evidence that said corporation was being used for some illegal purpose, we cannot say that the mere fact that appellee [corporation] sold a defective machine, which subsequently injures an employee of the buyer, would justify holding the selling agent personally liable.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=310%20A.2d%20677" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="310 A.2d 677">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa-super/225/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="225 Pa.

Instead, appellants seek to hold Miller, Cook and Zollers liable on the theory that they personally participated in the alleged tortious acts committed on behalf of the corporations. There is a distinction between liability for individual participation in a wrongful act and an individual’s responsibility for any liability-creating act performed behind the veil of a sham corporation. Where the court pierces the corporate veil, the owner is liable because the corporation is not a bona fide independent entity; therefore, its acts are truly his.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Under the participation theory, the court imposes liability on the individual as an actor rather than as an owner.
