On the top shelf of the closet police seized two plastic bags containing a white powder, testified at trial to be thirty-percent cocaine. Two smaller plastic packages were found in the closet as well, containing what was testified to be two percent cocaine, along with a Tupperware container holding four empty plastic bags. Copies of “The Pleasures of Cocaine” and “The Pill Book” were seized from a bookshelf in the bedroom. On top of the bedroom dresser, the officers seized a pocket memo book, containing pages of numbers, a machine called a “Daisy Seal-a-Meal”, an appliance used in the drug trade to seal packages of cocaine in order to prevent seepage of the drug, and a device used to detect eavesdropping equipment on a telephone called an “Eavesdropper Stopper.” In the attic, police seized two one-pound containers of manitol, a substance used as a cocaine “cutting” agent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Since the cocaine was found in the appellee’s bedroom, and not on his person, the Commonwealth had the burden of proving that he had constructive possession of the drug.
