As § 106(c)(1) requires timely actions to be initiated “not later than two years after the victim <em>suffers the loss,” </em>resolution of the question whether an action is timely must rest on a determination of the meaning of the phrase “suffers the loss” within the context of the Act. The Act <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>provides: “Loss accrues <em>not when injury occurs, but as ... work loss ... is sustained.” </em>40 P.S. § 1009.106(a)(1) (emphasis supplied). Thus, the time for filing suit to recover benefits from a no-fault carrier commences, not as Superior Court concluded, on the date the accident occurs, but on the date the victim sustains the loss.</p>
    <p id="b596-4" data-blocks='[["BL_596.4",596,[279,600,1148,1311]]]'>Section 103 of the Act defines “loss” as “accrued economic detriment resulting from injury arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle consisting of, and limited to ... work loss ....” 40 P.S. § 1009.103. The pertinent provision of the Act defines “work loss”, in the case of a victim who is not self-employed, as “loss of gross income....” <em><a href="/pa/500/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="500 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="1781170" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0167-01">Id.</a> </em>The plain meaning of the Act is clear: work loss is economic detriment resulting from inability to work and earn a living, <em>e.g., </em>loss of a paycheck. In the case at bar, where the victim was gainfully employed but not self-employed prior to his death, the victim suffered the work loss on the date he could next have expected to receive his regular pay for work he would ordinarily have performed in due course, but for the accident. The record does not disclose the next date on which Mr. Kamperis would have expected to receive compensation for his labors in the event of the non-occurrence of his untimely accident. We hold the statute of limitations contemplates commencement of the period for bringing the action on the date the victim would next have expected to receive compensation for work he would have performed had the motor vehicle accident not occurred. Thus, the statute of limitation, 40 P.S. § 1009.106(c)(1), contemplates commencement of the action not later than two years after the date Mr. Kamperis <em>missed his next expected paycheck.</em>

This is evident by review of the provision of § 106(a)(1): “No-fault benefits <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>are payable monthly as loss accrues. Loss accrues not when injury occurs, but as ... work loss ... is sustained.” 40 P.S. § 1009.106(a)(1). Thus, it is clear that work loss is sustained each time a victim suffers economic detriment, or, as in the case at bar, misses a paycheck he would ordinarily have earned, but for the injuries sustained in the accident. Section 202(b) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, “Work loss, as defined in section 103 shall be provided ... (2) up to a total amount of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000).” 40 P.S. § 1009.202(b)(2). Thus, the period of limitations provided in § 106(c)(1) must be construed to mean that, where as here no-fault benefits have not been paid for loss arising otherwise than from death, and the work loss was known to have been caused by the accident, an action to recover work loss benefits under the Act may be commenced (a) within two years from any time the victim suffers work loss as a result of the accident, <em>Cf., Murphy v. Prudential Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/503/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="503 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="1785961" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0528-01">503 Pa. 528</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="503 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="1785961" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0528-01">469 A.2d 1378</a> (1983) (action to recover cost of medical services only barred by statute of limitations insofar as it sought recovery of medical services rendered more than two years before action commenced); (b) within two years after the victim’s accrued work loss equals the maximum amount recoverable under the Act for work loss, $15,000, 40 P.S. § 1009.-202(b)(2) and (c) not later than four years after the accident.</p>

Correspondingly, this event activated the rights of the victim and his survivors to receive payment of the benefits provided for by the insurance contract. Part of those benefits which the appellant has a duty to pay and the appellant has a right to receive are wage loss benefits occasioned by the decedent’s inability to engage in or continue to engage in gainful employment activities.</p>

    <p id="b602-5" data-blocks='[["BL_602.5",602,[274,775,1146,690]]]'>Because the No-fault Act assures a victim and a victim’s survivors payment of all basic loss benefits, no loss is suffered, within the contexual sense of the act, at the time of the accident, at the amount of death, or when a paycheck is missed. It is when the insurance carrier breaches its contractual duty to pay the required benefits that loss is suffered. The failure to pay the benefits is the event which gives rise to a cause of action in assumpsit against the insured. It is inconsistent with concepts of fairness and with the remedial purposes of the No-fault Act to hold that a cause of action is barred by a statute of limitations which begins to run before the cause of action arises.
