      <p id="b502-7" data-blocks='[["BL_502.7",502,[247,1079,1143,535]]]'>. In connection with this appeal, SEPTA has filed with this Court a Motion to Strike Evidence Presented by Appellant for the First Time on Appeal. At issue is a copy of a letter from The Travelers Insurance Company dated May 19, 1983, denying appellant’s claim for uninsured motorist benefits through the no-fault assigned claims plan. SEPTA seeks to strike this letter because appellant has never made it a part of the record in this case and because her failure to do so calls into question the letter’s authenticity, relevance and validity. Nevertheless, SEPTA fails to state how or that it has been harmed in any way by the presentation of this letter to this Court, nor does SEPTA actually allege that the letter is not authentic. Further, the information contained in this letter in no way forms the basis for this Court’s resolution of this appeal. Accordingly, SEPTA’s motion to strike is denied.</p>
