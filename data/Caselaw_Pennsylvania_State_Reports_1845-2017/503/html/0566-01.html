Ohle, Inc., a New York brokerage firm. Defendants were the principals of that broker. Ohle is a resident of New York and Jackson is a resident of New Jersey. On July 25, 1974 a Commonwealth premium check for $500,000.00 payable to Market Facilities, Inc., a subsidiary of Reserve, and Charles W. Ohle, Inc., the broker, was delivered to the latter. On August 5, 1974 a second check for $300,000.00 payable to the same Reserve subsidiary and Charles W. Ohle, Inc. was also delivered to it.

The Leflar article, cited by both appellees and the Commonwealth, criticizes the traditional territorial method of determining the applicable law in criminal cases and recommends instead use of certain “choice influencing” considerations suggested by the author. This choice influencing analysis goes beyond both the traditional territorial view of criminal jurisdiction and the analysis in terms of statutory construction employed in some jurisdictions. The latter two restrict jurisdiction only by due process considerations of fairness and contacts with the forum.</p>

Whether the Commonwealth suffered an actual loss from this cancellation is irrelevant. At the very least, appellees failed to perform their duty to transfer the premiums to Reserve, and thus also violated their legal duty under Pennsylvania law, a violation for which Pennsylvania imposes criminal sanctions. That violation substantially affected this Commonwealth’s interests. It lost both the assured coverage and the defense against claims which the premium was intended to purchase.

Although Superior Court’s analysis of this issue is not totally clear, the offeree’s lack of official power to accomplish the desired result is a variant of the impossibility defense. Neither this variant, nor the kind of impossibility which arises when the act the offeror assumes is prohibited is not illegal, has any application here. Hilton had power to award the insurance contract. His award of it in <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>consideration of private gain was plainly illegal.

Because of its determination of the jury charge and indictment issues, Superior Court did not address other allegations of trial error made by appellees. These issues are: (1) failure of the trial court to grant a mistrial after revealing its decision to deny appellees’ demurrer to the evidence to the news media, which report was read by several jurors; (2) refusal of the trial court to dismiss the conspiracy charge on grounds of merger; (3) refusal of the trial court to dismiss the bribery and conspiracy charges because only uncorroborated testimony of accomplices was introduced; (4) refusal of the trial court to grant a mistrial based on a Commonwealth witness’s reference to appellee’s prior criminal record.
