The appellant argues that this alleged contradiction works a fundamentally unfair paradox. In analyzing the definitional distinctions in the two Acts the analogy collapses. Under the Occupational Diseases Act, only the specifically enumerated occupational disease or diseases which pass a three-part test, 77 P.S. § 1208, bring statutory benefits for the employee and tort immunity for the employer; the Act does not intend to bar tort litigation involving diseases not covered by the Act. The Workmen’s Compensation Act, on the other hand, covers <em>“all injuries,” </em>and the exclusivity clause bars tort actions flowing from <em>any </em>work-related injury. This analogy was raised and rejected in <em>Hartwell v.

In this case, since appellant’s injury has no effect on his ability to work, he is not entitled to total or partial disability benefits under the Act.
