In applying for that pension he asked our Retirement Board to allow him to buy back his United States military service from February 17, 1941, when he was inducted from state service with our Welfare Department under the President’s Executive Order, until his discharge on September 30, 1954. In December, 1969, appellant received notice from the then Secretary of the Retirement Board of an adjudication allowing him only five years of military buy back, from February 17, 1941 to February, 1946. From the opinion of the Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas, reported <em>sub nom State Employees Retirement Board v. O’Brien, </em>93 Dauphin 101 (1970), at its No. 825 Commonwealth Docket, 1969, it appears appellant was eligible for release from the United States Armed Forces in February, 1946, but chose to remain on active duty until September 30, 1954.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Based on that fact, Dauphin County Common Pleas held petitioner was not entitled to buy back any military time beyond February, 1946, the date on which it determined he was eligible for release from federal military service. As a matter of statutory interpretation Common Pleas held the legislature intended to allow buy back for federal military service between September 16, 1940 and July 27, 1953 only for the included time interval between induction from state employment under executive order and eligibility for release. Thus it held actual discharge did not control where a former state employee chose to remain in the federal armed forces <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>after he was eligible for release. This decision affirmed the administrative adjudication limiting the statutory buy back to the period from compulsory induction to eligibility for discharge. The order so limiting the buy back became final when we denied appellant’s request for allocatur on December 4, 1970 and the time for appeal or petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court expired. The section of the State Employees Retirement Code of 1959 specifically applicable to appellant’s claim was Section 207(1) of the Act of June 1, 1959, P.L. 392, <em>as amended, </em>71 P.S. § 1725-207(1)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> which provided:</p>

Repeated requests to appear again before the Retirement Board were denied, culminating in the Board’s formal dismissal of what he called a petition for “Determination of Manner of Payment of Salary Deductions,” at the Board’s January 30, 1973 meeting. Appellant sought appellate review of this dismissal in the Commonwealth Court. Commonwealth Court affirmed the Board’s refusal to allow him to appear before it, holding that his claim was barred by <em>res judicata </em>and his request for an administrative hearing on the method of computation was unnecessary. <em>O’Brien v.

In denying appellant’s request for an administrative hearing, the court held determination of the amount of appellant’s pension, following Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas’ September 8, 1970 decision, was a mere matter of mathematical computation, not adjudicatory in nature, and therefore not of the type for which a hearing is required.</p>

The Board permitted appellant <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>to appear before it but denied his request for an administrative hearing.

Once again Commonwealth Court determined that the thrust of the petition was to relitigate the intent of the statute which was litigated previously. Consequently, Commonwealth Court sustained the Board’s preliminary objections. It decided the matter based on appellant’s petition, appellee’s preliminary objections, and its own judicial notice of previous proceedings in the matter. It did not hold a hearing or require additional testimony.</p>

Dauphin County Common Pleas determined that the legislature did not intend to permit an employee to obtain credit under Section 207(1) for periods of voluntary military service following a period of compulsory service. This would seem to be a correct construction in view of the language in Section 301(3)(a) so limiting "current contributions” while a state employee is on military service. Dauphin County Common Pleas also mentioned a five year limit on credit for time served in the armed services in an apparent reference to Section 207(5) of the State Employes’ Retirement Code. Coincidentally, Colonel O’Brien’s term of compulsory service happens to also be the maximum period of military service any state employee who served in the military after September 16, 1940 can buy back under Section 207(5) of our State Employes' Retirement Code. However, prior to the effective date of the Act of December 16, 1968, P.L. 1216, Section 207(5) applied only to state employees who were not in state employment before their military service.

His military buy back was necessarily determined under Section 207(1) which then applied to persons inducted into the military while employed by the state. Indeed, as appellant notes, a buy back under Section 207(5) would have required him to contribute twice the amount that would have been deducted from his pay for state retirement while he was in the military, not simply the equivalent amount he finally paid for the five year buy back he was allowed under Section 207(1). In any event, the Board’s decision to limit the Colonel’s “buy back” to five years is <em>res judicata. </em>Commonwealth Court’s reference to Section 207(5) in its most recent opinion and order from which this appeal was taken is simply <em>obiter dicta </em>and apparently results from the understandable failure of a busy court to fully trace the legislative history of Section 207(5) to determine its text when appellant retired.</p>
