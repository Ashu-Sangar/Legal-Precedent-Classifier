The Appellant was convicted of burglary and related charges in a non-jury trial on March 6, 1978. Following the denial of post-verdict motions, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment not less than two nor more than twelve years. No direct appeal was taken following imposition of sentence. In April of 1979, the Appellant filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act. Counsel was appointed and a hearing was held, following which the requested <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>relief was denied. The Superior Court affirmed. This Court granted allocatur to consider the question whether the Appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel by reason of counsel’s failure to explain all of the ingredients of the right to a trial by jury during the colloquy in which the Appellant waived his right to jury trial. We now affirm.</p>

There we observed that</p>

These essential ingredients, basic to the concept of a jury trial, are the requirements that the jury be chosen from members of the community (a jury of one’s peers), that the verdict be unanimous, and that the accused be allowed to participate in the selection of the jury panel.... In view of the failure of the record to establish that appellant had sufficient knowledge of the right which it is now contended he waived, we are unable to find that the waiver was either knowing or intelligent.</blockquote>

The Appellant argues only that because it was not explained that the jury would be chosen from “members of the community” or from his “peers”, the colloquy was defective, counsel was ineffective, and he is entitled to a new trial.

The focus in <em>Williams </em>was, and it remains, whether the waiver was knowing and intelligent, not whether certain talismanic questions were asked and answered. In determining whether this Appellant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to trial by jury, the PCHA court and the Superior Court had before them both the record of the colloquy and the testimony taken at the PCHA hearing from the Appellant and his trial counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We find no error in their determination based on this evidence that the Appellant fully understood the ingredients of a jury trial and his rights thereto, and made a knowing and intelligent waiver of those rights.</p>

It is also true that, in determining the sufficiency of the colloquy, we are confined to considering only the record. <em>See Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[220,773,1141,814]]]'>However, the mere finding that the colloquy is defective does not answer the question as to whether counsel was ineffective in his representation for either failing to call attention to the omission at the time of the colloquy or pursuing the objection on appeal. Unlike the determination as to whether or not the colloquy is sufficient, the question of the adequacy of the stewardship of counsel does not require that we confine ourselves to that which appears on the record of the proceeding in question. Here we had testimony by trial counsel at the post-conviction proceeding to the effect that it was his practice always to discuss the jury trial ingredient at issue before, rather than during, the waiver colloquy, and that he had no question that there had been an intelligent waiver. Given this additional record evidence, I discern no basis for a finding of ineffectiveness. Accordingly, I concur in the majority’s mandate.</p>
