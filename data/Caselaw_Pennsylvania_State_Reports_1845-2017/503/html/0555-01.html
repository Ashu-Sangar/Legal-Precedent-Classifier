At approximately 4:30 p.m. on the afternoon of August 24, 1980, appellee, while on-duty and in uniform, observed what he suspected to be a stolen vehicle travelling at high rate of speed in a populous area, and attempted to stop the vehicle. The driver ignored these efforts and appellee gave chase. When the vehicle subsequently was stopped, at least one passenger fled while the driver remained behind the wheel. Appellee approached the vehicle with gun drawn. As he reached the door of the vehicle, appellee was knocked to the ground as the driver again put the vehicle in gear and drove a short distance before crashing. Appellee again approached the vehicle, an altercation with the driver ensued, and the driver suffered wounds, including a gunshot wound from appellee’s gun. Approximately one hour later, at Temple Hospital, the driver was pronounced dead.</p>

Also, pursuant to regulations, appellee’s revolver was taken for ballistics tests. At approximately 6:40 p.m., the staff inspector, one Officer Taylor, arrived and commenced questioning of appellee. Between that time and midnight, appellee gave both oral and written statements to the staff inspector, and also drew a sketch illustrating where the events occurred leading up to the altercation. At no time were <em>Miranda </em>warnings given to appellee.</p>

The <em>McLaughlin </em>Court held that that suspect was not in “custody” for <em>Miranda </em>purposes, although there was a sanction for failure to appear (non-payment of the questioned expenses). Moreover, the Court found that even though information obtained through the administrative investigation ultimately resulted in criminal prosecution, <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required in investigations which were non-criminal in nature.</p>

It was not until five days later, after the post-mortem examination indicated that blows to the decedent’s head may themselves have been a sufficient cause of death, that a complaint was issued for appellee’s arrest. Thus, the post-shooting debriefing and questioning of appellee were conducted pursuant to routine administrative procedure, and appellee was <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>neither being held as a criminal suspect, nor had he reason to believe that such was the case.</p>
