On January 16, 1979, the day of the accident, appellee drove to appellants’ clinic to receive treatment for a back ailment. She parked her car next to a parked car in the patients’ lot, which is built on an incline contiguous to the clinic. A sheet of smooth ice covered the area of the parking lot between the two cars, but the rest of the surface of the parking lot <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>was free of ice and snow. Upon opening the driver’s door, appellee placed both feet on the icy surface and prepared to alight from her vehicle.

She entered the clinic some thirty feet away without incident. After receiving treatment, appellee retraced her steps to the rear of her car, where she again encountered the icy conditions. Again appellee gripped the adjoining automobile for support and proceeded across the ice toward the driver’s door of her own automobile; once there, she abandoned her support and reached into her pocketbook to get her keys.

The court, however, refused appellants’ proposed “assumption of risk” charge, reasoning that the defense of assumption of risk as a complete bar to recovery had been wholly merged with the defense of contributory negligence, and that the proposed charge was thus incompatible with Pennsylvania’s comparative negligence statute, 42 Pa.C.S. § 7102.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> After the jury’s verdict, the trial court denied <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>appellants’ motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial.</p>

She nevertheless proceeded across the ice, both when she emerged from her car and again on her return to the car. There was nothing presented on the record to indicate that, notwithstanding the obviousness of the danger, appellants should have anticipated that the patch of ice might go unnoticed by appellee or any other patient; on the contrary, appellants could reasonably expect that, in light of the number of clear, convenient spaces available, appellee and other invitees would recognize the danger posed by the ice and choose to park in another, ice-free space to avoid it.

According to appellee, once the invitee proves the existence of the invitee-possessor relationship, the existence of a duty has been established, and the burden then shifts to the possessor of land to show that the invitee is not entitled to relief because the invitee assumed the risk of injury from a hazardous condition of the possessor’s property. Appellee further argues that the comparative negligence statute, 42 Pa.C.S. § 7102, reflects a legislative intent to remove assumption of risk as an absolute bar to recovery and to incorporate the defense into the comparative negligence framework. Thus, appellee asserts, the fact that she appreciated the dangerous condition of the parking lot and proceeded voluntarily to encounter it are facts which may be considered by the jury in apportioning fault, but should not operate as a total bar to recovery.</p>

See Harper &amp; James, The Law of Torts, Vol. 2 § 21.1 (1956); Prosser, Law of Torts § 68 at 440-446 (4th ed. 1971); Restatement, supra, § 496A comment c &amp; § 496C comments b, d, &amp; e.

It is precisely because the invitee assumes the risk of injury from obvious and avoidable dangers that the possessor owes the invitee no duty to take measures to alleviate those dangers.
