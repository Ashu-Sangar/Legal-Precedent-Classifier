In response to its petition, the Township Commissioners held a duly advertised public meeting on March 14, 1977, to consider the vacation of approximately 770 feet of a township road known as Dorney Park Road. The entire length of Dorney Park Road is 1.7 miles. The portion proposed for vacation bisects the amusement park. Appellant sought vacation of this portion of the road both out of concern for the safety of its patrons and for better protection of its ride equipment against vandalism. The land abutting the portion to be vacated is owned solely by appellant. Appellee Whitner and others who testified against vacation at the March 1977 hearing objected, contending that the remaining road would no longer be a complete thoroughfare.</p>

Since appellees were in attendance at the January 8, 1979 meeting and have not complained of any failure to comply with Section 2011, we presume that this requirement was, also, properly observed and obeyed.
