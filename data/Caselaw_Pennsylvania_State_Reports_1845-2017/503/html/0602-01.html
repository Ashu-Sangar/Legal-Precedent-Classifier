At about 10:40 P.M. she left. She saw defendant Richard Nickol standing beside a car owned by appellant. She asked Richard if he had seen her girlfriend. He replied that she had gone home, took her by the arm and put her in the back seat of the car, which drove off. Appellant drove. Gerald Nickol was in the front seat, and Carol and Richard in the back seat. Carol testified that Richard raped her while Gerald held her down; that Gerald tried to climb over the seat in order to rape her, but that she managed to push him away; that she was finally released about midnight, after which she went home and then to a hospital. Tests taken there revealed the presence of semen and live sperm in her vagina.</p>

In excepting to the court’s ruling, appellant’s counsel stated that Richard’s testimony was not offered to attack the victim’s reputation for chastity, but to explain the presence of sperm and semen in the victim’s vagina shown by medical tests. Thereafter, no evidence of any sexual activity by the victim was introduced at trial, with the exception of Gerald Nickol’s testimony that his brother Richard had said he was having sexual relations with Carol. The Commonwealth objected to that remark and the court instructed the jury to disregard it. Thus, the evidence at trial amounted to Carol’s testimony to her rape in the car, the medical evidence showing recent intercourse and the defendants’ testimony denying that any act of intercourse took place in the car.</p>

An exception is created for “evidence of the alleged victim’s past sexual conduct with the defendant where consent of the alleged victim is at issue and such evidence is otherwise admissible pursuant to the rules of evidence.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 3104(a). The second stage (18 Pa.C.S. § 3104(b)) requires a defendant who seeks to introduce evidence of past sexual conduct under the consent exception in Section 3104(a) to “file a written motion and offer of proof at the time of trial” at which time the court will determine “if the motion and proof are sufficient on their faces.” If so, the court will hold an <em>in camera </em>hearing and “make findings on the record as to the relevance and admissibility of the proposed evidence.”</p>
