A creditor of one of the spouses has no standing to institute proceedings for the sale of former entireties property, <em>Eastern Acceptance Corporation v. Gold, </em>60 D. &amp; C. 95 (C.P. Montgomery, 1947). A claim involving property other than the former entireties estate may not be raised in a proceeding under the act, <em>Sandusky v. Sandusky, </em>30 Fayette L.S. 75 (1967). In the instant case, I would find that the joinder of Hazel Lohmiller is neither required nor permitted, as it would involve property that was not part of the entireties estate. I agree with the majority that there is a cognizable claim involving Hazel Lohmiller’s interest in the farm, but such claim must be brought in an action other than the instant one.</p>
