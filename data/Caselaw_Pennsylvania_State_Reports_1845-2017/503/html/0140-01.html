    <p id="b201-4" data-blocks='[["BL_201.4",201,[249,456,1137,849]]]'>The ownership of, and right to develop, coalbed gas are questions of first impression. Consideration of the characteristics, origins, and history of development of gas is necessary to a determination of the issues presented. The following factual background is condensed from the chancellor’s findings. Coalbed gas is found in and around coal veins, having long been recognized by the mining industry as a highly combustible and deadly poisonous gas which must be, at all times during the active coal mining process, ventilated to prevent explosion or inhalation; hence, the gas has traditionally been wasted into the atmosphere. Coalbed gas is always present in coal seams; its molecules are absorbed in micropores of coal, and even the smallest particle of coal always contains, and when exposed emits, some coalbed gas. Coal and coalbed gas are, nevertheless, separate physical entities.</p>
    <p id="b201-5" data-blocks='[["BL_201.5",201,[248,1336,1138,726]]]'>The gas which has commonly been referred to as “natural gas” is generally found in strata deeper than coal veins, though it shares many of the characteristics of coalbed gas. Both gases evolved, through natural processes, from carbonaceous material beneath the earth’s surface, and both contain mixtures of various hydrocarbons, including methane, ethane, propane, butane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide. Both are, as are all gases, migratory, thus being capable of escaping their natural habitats to enter other strata, and both are found in the same geographic areas of Pennsylvania. Due to its fugacious character, natural gas is capable, under certain circumstances, of commingling with coalbed gas in the upper strata.</p>
    <p id="b201-6" data-blocks='[["BL_201.6",201,[248,2102,1137,202]],["BL_202.1",202,[265,260,1146,87]]]'>Natural gas and coalbed gas have value as energy sources, the latter having approximately a 90 percent heating value as compared to the former.

    <p id="b202-4" data-blocks='[["BL_202.4",202,[255,374,1154,1523]]]'>Extensive and costly drilling operations are required in order to extract coalbed gas or natural gas from strata where they are found. As early as the year 1900, certain wells were drilled in Greene County into the subject Pittsburgh Vein of coal, and not deeper, and some of these wells produced coalbed gas in paying quantities. Commercial exploitation of coalbed gas, however, has remained very limited and sporadic until recently. As a result of our nation’s high energy demands and shortage of energy supplies, conditions which gained much attention during the past decade, both the gas industry and the mining industry have come to regard coalbed gas as having sound market potential. There has recently developed an industrial capacity to drill into coal seams both horizontally and vertically to recover coalbed gas. With either drilling approach, the process of hydrofracturing facilitates recovery of coalbed gas in greater volumes and over longer periods of time. Nevertheless, in some areas coalbed gas can be recovered in paying quantities without any artificial stimulation of the coal seam. As noted previously, certain gas companies have through the years produced coalbed gas from wells in Greene County and in other portions of western Pennsylvania. More recently certain coal owners, including Appellant, have drilled into and in some cases hydrofractured their own coal seams in various regions — as experimental determinations of coalbed gas production capacities and as a means of alleviating the presence of the gas in areas soon to be mined. Against this background, we examine the ownership and development rights to coalbed gas.</p>

When a landowner conveys a portion of his property, in this instance coal, to another, it cannot thereafter be said that the property conveyed remains as part of the former’s land, since title to the severed property rests solely in the grantee. In accordance with the foregoing principles governing gas ownership, therefore, <em>such gas as is present in coal must necessarily belong to the owner of the coal, </em>so long as it remains within his property and subject to his exclusive dominion and control. The landowner, of course, has title to the property surrounding the coal, and owns such of the coalbed gas as migrates into the surrounding property.</p>

Rather, the coal owner’s interest in that situs has been regarded as being in the nature of an estate determinable, which reverts to the surface landowner by operation of law at some time subsequent to removal of the coal. <em>Webber v.

The potential for reversion of the situs, however, does not diminish the character of the coal as property of its grantee, or of the gas contained therein as a mineral <em>ferae naturae </em>resting inside the coal owner’s property and falling within the dominion and control of the coal estate. The owner of coal may, as may any property owner, exercise dominion over his property so as to maximize his right of enjoyment thereover, within bounds limiting impingement upon the rights of other property owners. <em>Chartiers Block Coal Co. v.

Hence, the coal owner may mine his coal, extract the gas from it, or both. If he chooses to extract the gas, drilling as well as hydrofracturing are available means, so long as their utilization does not impinge upon the rights of owners of the surrounding property, since the damage to coal inflicted by these processes is within his dominion to inflict.</p>

Indeed for the most part coalbed gas was a dangerous waste product which had to be vented from the coal seam to allow for safe mining of the coal. This common practice is attested to by the presence in the deed under consideration of a “right of ventilation”, permitting the grantee of the coal severance deed the right of reasonable encroachment on the estate retained by the grantor for the purpose of ventilating the gas from the coal seam.</p>

Although the unrestricted term “gas” was used in the reservation clause, in light of the conditions existing at the time of its execution we find it inconceivable that the parties intended a reservation of all types of gas. In so finding, we are unable to overlook a basic question: Why would a party retain the right to something which is only a waste product with well-known dangerous propensities?

Appellant’s predecessor in title acquired rights to the coal from appellees’ predecessors in title via a severance deed dated July 23, 1920.

Hence, the following factual background, condensed from the chancellor’s findings<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a>, pertains. Coalbed gas, often called methane, is found in and around coal veins, having long been recognized by the mining industry as a highly combustible and deadly poisonous gas which must be, at all times during the active coal mining process, ventilated to prevent explosion or inhalation; hence, the gas has traditionally been wasted into the atmosphere. Coalbed gas is always present in coal seams; its molecules are adsorbed in micropores of coal, and even the smallest particle of coal <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>always contains and emits, when exposed, some coalbed gas. Coal and coalbed gas are, nevertheless, separate physical entities.</p>
    <p id="b209-4" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[251,449,1140,1042]]]'>The gas which has commonly been referred to as “natural gas” is generally found in strata deeper than coal veins, though it shares many of the characteristics of coalbed gas. Both gases evolved, through natural processes, from carbonaceous material beneath the earth’s surface, and both contain mixtures of various hydrocarbons, including methane, ethane, propane, butane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide. Both are, as are all gases, migratory, thus being capable of escaping their natural habitats to enter other strata, and both are found in mainly the same geographic areas of Pennsylvania. Due to its fugacious character, natural gas is capable, under certain circumstances, of commingling with coalbed gas in the upper strata. Natural gas and coalbed gas have value as energy sources, the latter having approximately a 90% heating value as compared to the former. The energy value of coalbed gas in the relevant geographic area is far less, however, than that of coal itself; the coalbed gas has an energy equivalent value of only 1% of the b.t.u. value of the coal.</p>

As early as the year 1900, however, certain wells were drilled in Greene County into the subject Pittsburgh vein of coal, and not deeper, and some of these wells produced coalbed gas in paying quantities. More recently there has developed an industrial capacity to drill into coal seams both horizontally and vertically to recover coalbed gas. With either drilling approach, the process known as hydrofracturing, see fn. 3, supra, facilitates recovery of coalbed gas in greater volumes and over longer periods of time. Nevertheless, coalbed gas can, in some areas, be recovered in paying quantities without any artificial stimulation of the coal seam. Developed by the drilling industry in the late 1940’s, hydrofracturing was initially and <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>has more regularly been utilized to recover natural gases from strata other than coal veins. When applied to coal seams, however, the process is highly efficient and desirable from the standpoint of the gas developer, but it presents serious threats to the interests of the owner of the coal estate.</p>
    <p id="b210-4" data-blocks='[["BL_210.4",210,[264,605,1148,889]]]'>When a coal seam is penetrated by a high frequency of gas well bore holes, and particularly when such holes are then hydrofractured, there is a distinct possibility of interference with coal mining processes, even when there is a careful exchange of information between the coal operator and the gas developer. Harm to the mining potential of coal arises from the fact that the inherently uncontrollable lesions caused by hydrofracturing permanently damage the coal seams, rendering any future mining operation slower in production, less safe, and more expensive. Even where hydrofracturing is not employed, but where gas wells are drilled with high frequency through the coal seam, the coal owner’s estate is damaged, since as a safety precaution there must be left in place by the coal operator a barrier of coal surrounding each well hole. Such barriers, of course, interfere with full development of the coal, and cause considerable additional costs to the coal operator.</p>
    <p id="b210-5" data-blocks='[["BL_210.5",210,[262,1514,1147,789]]]'>As a result of our nation’s high energy demands and shortage of energy supplies, conditions which gained much attention during the past decade, the gas industry and the mining industry have come to regard coalbed gas as having sound market potential. Certain gas companies have, to a very limited and sporadic extent through the years dating back to at least 1918, produced coalbed gas from wells in Greene County and in other portions of western Pennsylvania. More recently certain coal owners, including appellant, have drilled and in some cases hydrofractured their own coal seams in various regions as experimental determinations of coalbed gas production capacities, and as a means of alleviating the presence of the gas in areas soon to be mined. Against this background, we examine the ownership and development rights to coalbed gas.</p>

In addressing questions of title to coal, and of rights of access to and through coal to secure its removal, this Court has not construed the conveyance of coal alone as a grant of a fee simple estate in the situs where the coal is located. Rather, the coal owner’s interest in that situs has been regarded as being in the nature of an estate determinable, which reverts to the surface landowner by operation of law at some time subsequent to removal of the coal. <em>Webber v. Vogel, </em><a href="/pa/189/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="189 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="903462" data-case-paths="/pa/189/0156-01">189 Pa. 156</a>, 160, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20A.%204" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="42 A. 4">42 A. 4</a>, 5 (1899); <em>Chartiers Block Coal Co. v.

The potential for reversion of the situs, however, does not diminish the character of the coal as property of its grantee, or of the gas contained therein as a mineral <em>ferae naturae </em>resting inside the coal owner’s property and falling within the dominion and control of the coal estate. The owner of coal may, as is the right of any property owner, exercise dominion over his property so as to maximize his right of enjoyment thereover, within bounds limiting impingement upon the rights of other property owners. <em>Chartiers Block Coal Co. v.

Hence, the coal owner may mine his coal, extract the gas from it, or both.

It is argued by appellant that the term “gas”, as it was used in the deed, should be construed narrowly as a reference to what has traditionally been called “natural gas”, the characteristics of which have heretofore been described, rather than as a reference to all gases. The chancellor found, however, that in the year 1920 it was well known that coal mines always contained coalbed gas; thus, it cannot be asserted that the parties were unaware of the existence of the particular gas now in dispute, though they may or may not have been aware of the few wells in Greene County and elsewhere <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>that produced coalbed gas in paying quantities. Given their awareness of the presence of coalbed gas in the stratum, the earlier described similarities between coalbed gas and what has commonly been referred to as “natural gas”, and the fact that the unrestricted term “gas” was employed in the reservation clause, we believe the plain meaning of the term “gas” would be too far subverted were we to exclude coalbed gas as a recoverable gas.</p>

Thus, while the parties intended what the deed states, to allow drilling for gas generally, without specification as to its type, the broad reservation of gas rights may not have been motivated to any extent by an expectation of profitably developing coalbed gas within the future as foreseen from the year 1920.</p>
