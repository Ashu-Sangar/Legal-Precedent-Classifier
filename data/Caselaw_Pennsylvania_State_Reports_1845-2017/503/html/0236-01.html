    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.4",298,[247,588,1145,783]]]'>Meanwhile, section 702 gives public employers the license to refuse to bargain over matters of “inherent managerial policy,” otherwise known as management prerogatives. The provision supplies an expansive definition of what constitutes “inherent managerial policy,” including but not “limited to such areas of discretion or policy as the functions and programs of the public employer, standards of services, its overall budget, utilization of technology, the organizational structure and selection and direction of personnel.” Again, almost anything touching on managerial discretion could be regarded as “inherent managerial policy,” and therefore beyond the sphere of mandatory bargaining. Without a proper balance, the two sections might negate each other, a result which the legislature surely did not intend in passing PERA.</p>
    <p id="b298-5" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[246,1389,1144,573]]]'>In resolving this conflict, the Court noted that prior to PERA, public employees were barred from striking and public employers were not required to engage in collective bargaining.
