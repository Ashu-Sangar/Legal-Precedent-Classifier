(Raceway). The Raceway instituted a civil action in trespass against Pocono Produce, Inc. (Pocono Produce) on June 27, 1980, seeking to recover for damages allegedly resulting from the negligent operation of a truck in attempting to pass through the tunnel on either June 15 or June 18, 1978.</p>

The Raceway owns and maintains an arched steel tunnel which was used as a passage-way by pedestrians and vehicles to the Raceway’s facilities. On June 15 or June 18, 1978,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> structural beams in this tunnel were allegedly damaged by collision with a truck driven through the tunnel by an employee of Pocono Produce. In October, 1978, the premises were closed and the tunnel sealed until April, 1979. When reopened in early April of 1979, Joseph R. Mattioli, the Chief Executive Officer of the Raceway first learned that the tunnel had collapsed and upon his inspection, he noted the damage to the interior structural beams of the tunnel. George Ewald, who was employed full-time as a maintenance man, then told Dr. Mattioli that a refrigerated truck bearing the name “Frosty something” had been lodged in the tunnel. Knowing that the Raceway had previously purchased food from a company by the name of Frosty Acres but being unable to locate any company by that name, Dr. Mattioli contacted Edward Driebe, President of Pocono Produce, in early April 1979, for assistance in locating Frosty Acres. During their conversation, Mr. Driebe <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>told Dr. Mattioli that a truck driven by an employee of Pocono Produce had struck the tunnel. In its June 27, 1980 complaint instituting suit, the Raceway thus averred that it was without knowledge of the injury until early April, 1979.</p>
    <p id="b140-4" data-blocks='[["BL_140.4",140,[241,503,1147,663]]]'>On this record, the trial court granted Pocono Produce’s motion for summary judgment and ruled that the Raceway’s cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations. The court held that a two-year period of limitation began to run in mid-June, 1978, either June 15 or June 18, 1978 when the truck operated by Pocono Produce’s employee collided with and damaged the structural beams in the Raceway’s tunnel. In so ruling, the court rejected the Raceway’s argument that the statute of limitations was tolled until April, 1979 when the Raceway discovered that the tunnel had collapsed. Motion for reconsideration was denied whereupon the Raceway appealed to the Superior Court.</p>

    <p id="b141-4" data-blocks='[["BL_141.4",141,[213,665,1154,1638]]]'>The “discovery rule” is such an exception, and arises from the <em>inability </em>of the injured, <em>despite the exercise of due diligence, </em>to know of the injury or its cause. Thus, in a case of subsurface injury in which, unknown to the plaintiff, the defendant removes coal from his land via access originating on the defendant’s land, the inability of the plaintiff, despite the exercise of diligence, to know of the trespass, tolls the running of the statute, for “no amount of vigilance will enable him to detect the approach of a trespasser who may be working his way through the coal seams underlying adjoining lands,” and until such time as the plaintiff discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, the trespass, the running of the statute is tolled. <em>Lewey v.

Likewise, in a case of medical malpractice involving the failure of a surgeon to remove an implement of surgery, it is the inability of the plaintiff to ascertain the presence of the offending implement which prevents the commencement of the running of the statute, for “[cjertainly he could not open his abdomen like a door and look in; certainly he would need to have medical advice and counsel.” <em>Ayers v. Morgan, </em><a href="/pa/397/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="397 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="1286289" data-case-paths="/pa/397/0282-01">397 Pa. 282</a>, 289, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.2d%20788" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="154 A.2d 788">154 A.2d 788</a>, 792 (1959). The salient point giving rise to the equitable application of the exception of the discovery rule is the inability, despite the exercise of diligence by the plaintiff, to know of the injury. A court presented with an assertion of applicability of the “discovery rule” must, before applying the exception of the rule, address the ability of the damaged party, exercising reasonable diligence, to ascertain the fact of a cause of action.</p>

That the tunnel was, subsequent to the impact, physically sealed from October, 1978 through April, 1979 does not alter the ascertainability of the damage. This is not the sort of blameless ignorance which compels the application of the discovery rule, which is an exception, not one of general application such that before the statute of limitation is deemed to commence, it must be established that the plaintiff has acquired finite knowledge of all operative facts.</p>

In opposition, the affidavit of Dr. Mattioli was filed, denying that Mr. Driebe told him of the date of the accident. However, this contradiction in opposing affidavits does not raise a material issue of fact. The material issue is the date itself, not whether or when the President of the Raceway gained the information of that date. That established, the difference between the date of June 15 in the Raceway complaint and the date of June 18 in the affidavit of Pocono Produce President Driebe is likewise not material, for in either case, as noted by the trial court, the complaint filed June 27, 1980 is filed two years past either date.</p>
