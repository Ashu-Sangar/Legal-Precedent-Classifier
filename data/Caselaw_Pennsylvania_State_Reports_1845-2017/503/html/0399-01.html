Nevertheless, considering the tortuous procedural history of this dispute, we believe we should treat appellant’s notice of appeal and questions on appeal as a petition for allocatur, addressed to our discretionary power of review. As such, we grant the petition and affirm the order of Commonwealth Court dismissing both appellant’s suit for specific performance and its ancillary motion for a preliminary injunction against the Liquor Control Board’s action in permitting the other appellees to perform the services appellants claimed were the subject of its asserted contract.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Such dismissal, however, is without prejudice to appellant’s right to pursue its exclusive legal remedy, for breach of any valid and enforceable contract that it may <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>have made with the Liquor Control Board for delivery services, in its pending action before the Board of Claims.</p>

Holt was properly notified of the Board’s decision on January 27, 1982. The Liquor Control Board then solicited bids on a cost per case basis for such delivery and warehouse services by issuing an invitation for bids to some sixty-nine companies.</p>

These three bids were publicly opened on March 1, 1982. Appellant’s bid was apparently low, appellee Holt’s high, while that of United Paper Services’ fell somewhere between the other two bids. However, before any contract was awarded a labor problem arose. Both appellant and United Paper Services concluded they would be unable to resolve that problem in a manner enabling them to perform the contract offered in their bids. They so advised the Liquor Control Board. The Board then rejected all bids on March 17, 1982, decided to operate the warehousing portion of the contract with its own personnel and entered into competitive negotiations for a delivery service contract with appellant and United Paper Services. The Board deliberately excluded appellee Holt from these negotiations.</p>

Holt learned of this new round of negotiations and its exclusion from them when it examined the minutes of the March 17th meeting. Thereupon, it requested permission to participate. On April 2, 1982 its request was refused and on April 6, 1982 it sought relief by filing an original suit in equity against the Liquor Control Board in Commonwealth Court. <em>Holt Hauling and Warehousing Systems, Inc. v.

However, the formalities and statutory approvals normally incident to the execution of such government contracts delayed execution by the Liquor Control Board. On May 4, 1982, with the contract awarded to XPress and apparently the subject of all necessary approvals, but still unexecuted by the Liquor Control Board itself, Commonwealth Court, without participation of appellant, granted appellee Holt’s motion for an injunction against negotiations in Holt’s absence and ordered the Liquor Control Board to negotiate in “good faith” with all interested parties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Holt relies on a line of cases which hold that no binding contract comes into existence unless the Commonwealth and its potential contractor strictly comply with procedures prescribed by statute, ordinance, instructions and agency practices. It argues since no contract was fully executed by all the appropriate and designated officials, no binding contract exists. Finally, it maintains that any contract between the Board and XPress is invalid because the bidding process was unfair. The Commonwealth simply argues that the contract with XPress was not binding because it was never signed by the comptroller or the Board’s Executive Director.

Instead, this is a case where the state has arguably awarded a contract to a bidder and then later agreed, in the face of litigation over unfairness in the bid process, to a rebid which resulted in the award to another company of a second contract covering the work previously awarded to the first company. When the parties, including the Commonwealth, signed the stipulation to a court-supervised rebid and agreed that a contract would be awarded to the low bidder without prejudice to XPress’s right to bring an action for breach of contract, they forfeited the opportunity to determine in a single proceeding whether the first contract between XPress and the Liquor Control Board was valid in the face of Holt’s allegations that the negotiations leading up to the contract were unfair.</p>
    <p id="b466-4" data-blocks='[["BL_466.4",466,[259,1322,1147,683]]]'>Prior to that stipulation Commonwealth Court refused to allow appellant an opportunity to litigate the unfairness issue. Indeed, its application to intervene in the Holt action was ultimately denied by Commonwealth Court, again without opinion. Thus, the issue of whether there is a valid contract between XPress and the Liquor Control Board and the issue of damages are properly before the Board of Claims. Whether appellant’s stipulated agreement to the rebid <em>ipso facto </em>cancelled any contract it may have had or precluded it from preserving that issue are matters within the jurisdiction of the Board of Claims, subject to initial appellate review in Commonwealth Court as of right and further discretionary appellate review by this Court.</p>

    <p id="b469-7" data-blocks='[["BL_469.8",469,[221,1331,1139,310]]]'>Although I agree that this case should have been brought in the Board of Claims, I cannot agree with the majority’s decision to treat appellant’s direct appeal from the Commonwealth Court’s dismissal of this case as a petition for allowance of appeal. Section 723(a) of the Judicial Code provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b469-8" data-blocks='[["BL_469.9",469,[263,1676,1098,309]]]'>“The Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from final orders of the Commonwealth Court entered in any matter which was originally commenced in said court and which does not constitute an appeal to the Commonwealth Court from another court, a district justice or another governmental unit.”</blockquote>

The present case was in fact “originally commenced” in the Commonwealth Court, and our determination that the case should have been brought in the Board of Claims in no respect alters this fact.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">*</a> Because the <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>majority’s treatment of appellant’s direct appeal as a petition for allowance of appeal manifestly disregards the express legislative conferral of direct appellate jurisdiction upon this Court, I concur only in the result.</p>

See Note to Pa.R.A.P. 311. Only if appellant had in fact commenced its case in the Board of Claims and then unsuccessfully appealed to the Commonwealth Court would the filing of a petition' for allowance of appeal be appropriate.</p>
