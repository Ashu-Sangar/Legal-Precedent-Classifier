Pollino, Jr. was tried before a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Columbia County on charges of aggravated assault and simple assault. At trial he introduced evidence of self defense and asked the trial judge to charge the jury that, under the circumstances, he was not required to retreat. The court refused to give the requested charge and the jury found him guilty of simple assault. Following the denial of his post trial motion for a new trial, appellant was sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment of 2 to 23 months, to pay a fine of $500.00 and to make restitution. Appellant’s petition for reconsideration of the sentence was denied. Appellant appealed <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>from the judgment of sentence and in a memorandum opinion the Superior Court affirmed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We granted allocatur.</p>

There were no eyewitnesses to the incident. All of the testimony as to how the altercation began, unfolded and ended, came from the appellant and the victim.</p>

He arrived at approximately 2:00 P.M., parked his car, went to Ms. Knapp’s trailer and knocked on the door. Receiving no answer, Yorty concluded that Ms. Knapp was not at home and he decided to wait in his car for her to return. While waiting, he fell asleep. The next thing he remembers is being hit over the head with a club and then being pulled out of his car by the appellant. He testified that after he was dragged from his car, he was repeatedly struck with the club until he fell to the ground. Yorty admitted that the club used to beat him was his own. When he fell asleep, it was laying on the floor in the rear of his car directly behind the driver’s seat.</p>

Upon arriving, appellant noticed two cars parked near her trailer, one of which belonged to Yorty. After he parked his vehicle, Ms. Knapp got out and started to walk to her trailer. As she walked by the Yorty’s parked car, she stopped briefly and said something to the victim who was seated behind the steering wheel. She then continued on to her home. The appellant, walking behind Ms. Knapp, <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>approached the side of the victim’s vehicle. As he started to go by, the car door suddenly opened; Yorty jumped out wielding a club and encountered the appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> An altercation ensued and the appellant wrested the club away from the victim, landing punches about the victim’s face in the process. As appellant gained control of the club, he hit the victim on the face and head once. At this point the violence ended.</p>

On cross-examination he agreed that he could have turned away and ran from the club-wielding Yorty. He, however, stood his ground and took the club away from the victim instead of trying to flee. The appellant used force in taking the club from Yorty and in subduing him.</p>

The jury heard the appellant cross-examined concerning his opportunity to run from the victim. The prosecutor argued to the jury that appellant had the opportunity to flee and should have avoided the altercation. The appellant, however, had no duty to retreat, even if he could do so with safety. This is not a case involving deadly force where the doctrine of retreat would apply. This case involves a mere battery, and in such cases, force may be met with force so long as it is only force enough to repel the attack. Because of the cross examination of appellant concerning his opportunity to flee from the confrontation, and the prosecution’s argument that appellant should have avoided the altercation, the jury could have been led to believe that the appellant had a legal duty to retreat. The court’s <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>failure to instruct the jury that appellant was not required to retreat deprived appellant of a fair trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
