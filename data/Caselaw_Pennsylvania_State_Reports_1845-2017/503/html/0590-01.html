In <em>Hagans </em>and <em>Brown </em>Superior Court reversed two Philadelphia Common Pleas Court decisions which had followed the practice of treating delays caused by a co-deferidant’s counsel as excludable time under Rule 1100 and it discharged the defendants.

Although this practice is not expressly allowed by the rule neither is it expressly forestalled. Moreover, the Philadelphia Common Pleas Court’s position prior to <em>Brown </em>and <em>Hagans </em>was not unreasonable in a practical sense and did not conflict with the basic purpose of the rule. Finally, had <em>Hagans </em>and <em>Brown </em>been decided prior to appellee’s trial the Commonwealth would have been on notice that such delays were not excludable and could have avoided the harsh sanction of dismissal by seeking a timely severance.</p>

The Commonwealth argues that the then prevailing law in Philadelphia and throughout the Commonwealth provided that waivers like appellee’s January 31, 1975 waiver were unconditional with no time limits.

The Commonwealth also argues that by permitting a petitioner in a post-conviction proceeding to avoid the doctrine of waiver upon a showing that trial counsel’s failure to raise an issue or to preserve an issue for appeal had no reasonable basis designed to effectuate petitioner’s interest, Post-Conviction Hearing Act proceedings have become “nothing less than a second appeal.” In making that argument, the Commonwealth says our standard for ineffectiveness goes beyond the Post-Conviction Hearing Act’s purpose of “providing a procedure for obtaining relief from convictions obtained and sentences imposed <em>without due process of law." </em>(Emphasis added.)
