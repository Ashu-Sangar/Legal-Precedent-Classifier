They accepted a ride offered by appellant and three other men. The victim was eventually taken to a cottage, where she engaged in various sexual acts with appellant that night and the following day. The evening of that second day, she was taken into a <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>wooded area where she was stabbed in the chest and back by appellant a number of times with an ice pick and hit over the head with a hatchet by appellant’s co-actor Chester Fulton. She was abandoned but managed to seek aid and recovered to testify at trial. Appellant was convicted of statutory rape, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3122, and attempted murder, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2502. Appellant was sentenced for each conviction to a term of imprisonment of not less than five years nor more than ten years, sentences to run consecutively.</p>
    <p id="b190-4" data-blocks='[["BL_190.4",190,[258,845,1151,1267]]]'>Appellant argues that Superior Court erred in affirming the summary dismissal of his first PCHA petition which asserted that the doctrine of merger in sentencing was applicable to these crimes. The Post Conviction Hearing Act provides that the court, when presented with a petition under the act, shall order a hearing unless the petition presents a claim which is “patently frivolous,” in which case the petition may be dismissed without hearing. Post Conviction Hearing Act, <em>supra, </em>§ 1180-9. The doctrine upon which appellant relies provides that where the crimes arise from the same act and where one crime necessarily involves another, the crimes have merged and a defendant may not be sentenced separately for each crime. <em>Commonwealth v. Ayala, </em><a href="/pa/492/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="492 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="1767110" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0418-01">492 Pa. 418</a>, <a href="/pa/492/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="492 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="1767110" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0418-01">424 A.2d 1260</a> (1981).

In the early evening of November 1, he inflicted wounds with a deadly weapon, an ice pick, upon a vital area of the victim’s body, her chest and back, for which he was convicted of attempted murder. The crimes do not arise from the same act and, thus, appellant’s argument is “patently frivolous” and the Superior Court affirmance of the dismissal by the Post Conviction court without hearing was correct.</p>

The information charged that appellant had engaged in sexual intercourse with a thirteen year old female. The additional allegation that the rape was nonconsensual merely preserved the right of the Commonwealth to present evidence at trial that the rape was forcible; it did not foreclose proof of statutory rape. That the information refers to a specific section number of the Crimes Code is unfortunate but not fatal.

Formerly, the crime of statutory rape required proof of consent by the victim, 18 P.S. § 4721, <em>repealed, </em>Act of Dec. 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, § 1 eff. June 6, 1973, and such proof excluded the possibility of conviction of the offense of rape, the <em>non-consensual </em>carnal knowledge of a female of any age. Thus, in <em>Commonwealth v. Walker, </em><a href="/pa/468/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="468 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="1719674" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0323-01">468 Pa. 323</a>, <a href="/pa/468/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="468 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="1719674" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0323-01">362 A.2d 227</a> (1976), this Court held that, due to the distinction between the crimes based on presence or lack of consent, those prior definitions of rape were mutually exclusive. This distinction of rape was mutually exclusive. This distinction has <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>been abandoned by the Legislature. Under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3122, the crime of statutory rape is committed by engaging in sexual intercourse with a person, not a spouse, who is less than 14 years of age, regardless of consent. Under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3121, the crime of rape is defined in such a manner that the dispositive feature is absence of consent in the victim regardless of age. Because the current offense of statutory rape does not require proof of consent, intercourse by force, if the female is under the age of 14, may constitute both the offense of rape and statutory rape. Therefore, the information filed merely reflects this intermingling of offenses where the offense is one of force against a female less than 14 years of age. Appellant’s argument being without merit, counsel will not be deemed ineffective for failing to pursue the issue. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d 349</a> (1967).</p>

      <em>Commonwealth v. Chester Fulton, </em>Notes of testimony, June 21, 1981, p. 189.

The <em>pro se </em>petition, which apparently presented only the issue of the legality of sentence, was not amended. Additionally, appellant avers that in preparation for appeal to this Court, the same appointed counsel submitted to appellant a proposed four page petition. Appellant, with the assistance of a “jailhouse lawyer” prepared a more lengthy petition for allowance of appeal, abandoning that prepared by counsel.

Submission of an <em>Anders </em>brief induces the court’s review of the potential merit of an appeal before ruling on counsel’s application to withdraw.

The February 24 complaint was filed as a result of information gained at the preliminary hearing of co-actor Harris at which the victim identified appellant as one of the actors who attempted to murder her.

      <p id="b189-10" data-blocks='[["BL_189.9",189,[245,1604,1138,693]]]'>. This appeal arises as a result of appellant’s filing of a second PCHA petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County after the time for appeal from the Superior Court’s denial of relief from appellant’s first PCHA petition had passed. Although the record does not indicate the relief sought by the second PCHA petition, the Court of Common Pleas granted leave to the appellant to file a petition for allowance of appeal to this Court <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>which petition was granted. The Superior Court opinion, from which appellant was granted leave <em>to </em>appeal <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>addressed the issue of the dismissal, without hearing, of appellant’s first PCHA petition challenging the legality of sentence imposed; we cannot determine with certainty what other issues, if any, were presented to Superior Court and which, by virtue of the Superior Court affirmance, were deemed nonmeritorious. Accordingly, for the sake of judicial economy, we address the additional issues raised by petitioner. While this procedure is admittedly irregular, it is merely a concession to this Court’s grant of allocatur, undertaken apparently without full knowledge of the procedural irregularities of the case.</p>
