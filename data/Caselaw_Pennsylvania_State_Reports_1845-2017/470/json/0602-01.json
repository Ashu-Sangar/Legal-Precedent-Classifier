(1965) 1580, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-1 et seq. The trial court concluded that the reasons for relief cited in the petition were frivolous and without support in the record, and dismissed the petition without the appointment of counsel or conducting an evidentiary hearing.\nUnder the provisions of Rule 1503(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure (adopted January 24, 1968 and effective August 1, 1968) which superseded Section 12 of the Act of 1966, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-12, supra, the trial court may not summarily dismiss a petition filed by an indigent under the Act of 1966, without the appointment of counsel, if counsel is requested, unless the same issues have been previously adjudicated adversely to the petitioner in a counseled proceeding or one wherein he has knowingly waived his right to the assistance of counsel. See Commonwealth v. Blair, 470 Pa.-, 369 A.2d 1153 (1977) and Commonwealth v. Adams, 465 Pa. 389, 350 A.2d 820 (1976).\nHence, the order appealed from is vacated and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",
