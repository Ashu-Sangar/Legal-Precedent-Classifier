        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nThis is an appeal from a decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, in which the trial court sustained objections to an accounting filed by appellant Louis Cusat as the administrator of the Estate of Louis F. Cusat.\nAppellant raises two issues on appeal: (1) whether he is entitled to claim a family exemption as a member of decedent\u2019s household at the time of decedent\u2019s death pursuant to section 3121 of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3121 (1975); and (2) whether he established that certain funds he received from the decedent were an inter vivos gift. Review of the record satisfies us that appellant\u2019s claims are without merit, and we find no reason to disturb the trial court\u2019s decree.\nDecree affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\n. We have jurisdiction pursuant to section 202 of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. II, \u00a7 202, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202 (Supp.1976).\n. Appellant also asserts that the testimony of Attorney Bogdanoff should not have been received into evidence because he and his firm represented appellee. However, appellant has not preserved this issue for appellate review. Although appellant objected to Attorney Bogdanoff\u2019s testimony at the hearing, he based his objection on a different ground than he now argues before this Court. See J. McCormick on Evidence 117 (2nd ed. 1972); Commonwealth v. Negri, 414 Pa. 21, 198 A.2d 595 (1964). See generally Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Co., 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114 (1974).",
