        "text": "OPINION\nNIX, Judge.\nThe case presently at bar raises questions concerning the authority of a court, under the Act of November 22, 1968, P.L. 1080, 19 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 640.1 et seq. (Supp.1975-76) (hereinafter referred to as Immunity Act), to grant immunity from prosecution to a witness appearing before an indicting, grand jury. The Superior Court affirmed the order of the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas denying the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for a grant of immunity. The Commonwealth appealed. We affirm.\nThe pertinent facts disclose that by a criminal complaint filed on August 10, 1972, Warren Brady and Henry George were charged with the crimes of \u201cextortion, prohibited acts by public officers, and conspiracy.\u201d The complaint alleged that Brady and George, in their capacity as Bansalem Township supervisors, had extorted money and other rewards from construction contractors Joseph D\u2019Egidio and John Carmerlengo, in return for favorable action on certain subdivision approvals and zoning changes needed by D\u2019Egidio and Carmerlengo in their construction business.\nAt a preliminary hearing held on August 18, 1972, both defendants were bound over to court on the charges of extortion and prohibited acts by a public officer. The prosecuting attorney, however, withdrew the conspiracy charge.\nOn February 16, 1978, the remaining charges were presented to the regularly convened January Term, 1973, Bucks County Grand Jury. At this proceeding, D\u2019Egidio and Carmerlengo were subpoenaed to testify regarding their transactions with the defendants. Both witnesses appeared, but refused to answer certain questions on the basis of their constitutional privilege against self incrimination. The supervising judge subsequently sustained their refusal to testify.\nOn March 2, 1973, the Attorney General, joined by the Bucks County District Attorney, petitioned the Court of Common Pleas for an order immunizing D\u2019Egidio and Carmerlengo from prosecution and compelling them to testify. The court dismissed the petition, however, concluding that since the bill of indictment presented to the indicting grand jury did not allege a conspiracy, it was not a proceeding \u201crelated to organized crime or racketeering\u201d as required by the Immunity Act. The court therefore held that it was without authority to confer the grant of immunity and order the witnesses to testify.\nThe Commonwealth appealed the court\u2019s order to the Superior Court, which affirmed per curiam. This Court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal to resolve the questions raised concerning the scope and applicability of the Immunity Act.\nI.\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides in relevant part that \u201cno person . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S.Const. Amend. V. The policies and rationale underlying this privilege against self incrimination were succinctly stated by the United States Supreme Court in Murphy v. Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, 378 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964).\nThe privilege against self-incrimination \u201cregisters an important advance in the development of our liberty \u2014 \u2018one of the great landmarks in man\u2019s struggle to make himself civilized.\u2019 \u201d It reflects many of our fundamental values and most noble aspirations: our unwillingness to subject those suspected of crime to the cruel trilemma of self-accusation, perjury or contempt; our preference for an accusatorial rather than an inquisitorial system of criminal justice; our fear that self-incriminating statements will be elicited by inhumane treatment and abuses; our sense of fair play which dictates \u201ca fair state \u2014 individual balance by requiring the government to leave the individual alone until good cause is shown for disturbing him and by requiring the government in its contest with the individual to shoulder the entire load,\u201d our respect for the inviolability of the human personality and of the right of each individual \u201cto a private enclave where he may lead a private life,\u201d our distrust of self-deprecatory statements; and our realization that the privilege, while sometimes \u201ca shelter to the guilty,\u201d is often \u201ca protection to the innocent.\u201d Id. at 55, 84 S.Ct. at 1596. (footnotes and citations omitted).\nOn another occasion, the court in discussing the privilege stated that:\nNo doubt the constitutional privilege may, on occasion, save a guilty man from his just deserts. It was aimed at a more far-reaching evil \u2014 a recurrence of the inquisition and the Star Chamber, even if not in their stark brutality. Prevention of the greater evil was deemed of more importance than occurrence of the lesser evil. Having had much experience with a tendency in human nature to abuse power, the Founders sought to close the doors against like future abuses by law-enforcing agencies. Ullman v. United States, 350 U.S. 422, 428, 76 S.Ct. 497, 501, 100 L.Ed. 511 (1956).\nThe Fifth Amendment thus defines the relationship between the government and the citizenry. It serves the function in our constitutional democracy of balancing are privacy and dignity of the individual with the power of the government to obtain testimony. While it may generally be asserted that the public \u201chas the right to every man\u2019s evidence,\u201d that right is clearly limited by and subject to the Fifth Amendment. Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 12 S.Ct. 195, 35 L.Ed. 1110 (1892).\nIt has been recognized, however, that a grant of immunity may \u201csupplant\u201d the Fifth Amendment privilege, provided that it is coextensive with that privilege. This principle is premised upon the view that immunity leaves the witness and the government in substantially the same position as if the witness had claimed his privilege. See, e. g., Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1971); Counselman v. Hitchcock, supra. While we recognize that immunity can be a valuable prosecutorial tool, we must also consider, however, that it constitutes an extraordinary exercise of power. It cannot be denied that a grant of immunity authorizes and even encourages interrogation which would otherwise be prohibited by the Fifth amendment. Therefore, if a grant of immunity is to erase the line drawn by the privilege between government and citizen, it must be done so with the utmost care, and with the least possible infringement of Fifth Amendment rights. For this reason, we reject at the outset the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that the Immunity Act is a \u201csweeping provision\u201d which must be \u201cbroadly construed.\u201d To the contrary, the delicate balance created by the privilege requires that the Act be construed according to its express terms, and that its applicability be limited to only those proceedings clearly within the purview of the language employed by the legislature. It is with this principle in mind that we approach our analysis and interpretation of the Immunity Act.\nII.\nThe threshold question raised by this appeal concerns whether the Immunity Act may be employed to immunize witnesses called to appear before a regularly convened indicting grand jury. The lower court suggested that the language of the Act indicated that as to grand juries, the power of immunity is available only to those engaged in conducting an investigation, not to those solely concerned, as here, with the finding of indictments. We agree.\nIn reaching this conclusion, we first note that immunity statutes have historically been considered a prosecutorial \u201cinvestigative tool.\u201d The first federal immunity provision, enacted in 1857, was passed to aid an investigation into a vote selling scheme allegedly occurring in the House of Representatives. Since that time, the underlying premise upon which immunity statutes have been enacted is their effectiveness in securing prosecutorial information. Restated, it is apparent that immunity statutes were designed to assist in the uncovering of criminal activity, as opposed to simply providing a means whereby sufficient information may be obtained for the prosecution and conviction of an individual offender. See, e. g., Kastigar v. United States, supra, 406 U.S. at 446-47 nn. 14-15, 92 S.Ct. 1653. We have no doubt that the Immunity Act of 1968 was passed by the General Assembly to achieve this same purpose.\nTurning to the language of the Act, it should first be noted that the title to the Act provides that it is \u201c [a] n Act authorizing courts of record to grant witnesses immunity from prosecution . . . in a proceeding before certain grand juries, investigating committees or commissions and courts of record; . . .\u201d (emphasis added). The legislature has specifically provided that \u201c[t]he title and preamble of a statute may be considered in the construction thereof.\u201d In the title to the Act, it is clear that the Act is intended to apply only in proceedings before \u201ccertain\u201d grand juries. The word \u201ccertain\u201d cannot be considered mere surplusage, and must be construed to indicate that not all grand jury proceedings fall within the contemplation of the Act. Moreover, the entire thrust of the Act compels the conclusion that it is primarily intended to assist in the investigation of organized crime and racketeering. Such investigations are undertaken not by a regular, indicting grand jury, which functions only to receive complaints and approve indictments, but by a special grand jury convened under a mandate to procure information and make recommendations, or a regular grand jury specially charged by a ju\u2022dicial authority to investigate a specifically delineated type of widespread criminal activity.\nThe distinction between the regular grand jury and the latter two categories of \u201cspecial\u201d grand juries is crucial; the preservation of the distinction assures that the grand jury\u2019s investigative powers are employed only in situations where the subject matter of the inquiry is aimed at conditions affecting the members of the community as a whole, and not in instances where the primary target is the individual. The Immunity Act by its express terms is similarly available only in proceedings relating to \u201corganized crime and racketeering.\u201d Accepting this view, we then give meaning to the obvious legislative purpose in framing the Immunity Act to provide an effective means for the uncovering of pervasive and systematic criminal activity. We also preserve the delicate balance between the competing rights of the individual and society, by excluding the power to immunize from the arsenal of the prosecutor in his efforts to secure convictions of particular individuals. It is therefore clear that it is only the latter two categories of \u201cspecial\u201d grand juries to which the Immunity Act was intended to apply, and the record adequately demonstrates that the Bucks County Grand Jury in the instant case was not clothed with special investigative authority.\nThe conclusion that the Immunity Act applies only to investigating grand juries is further supported by other language contained in that provision. Section 2 provides for a grant of immunity upon petition by the Attorney General, and requires that \u201c[s]uch petition shall set forth the nature of the investigation and the need for the immunization of the witness.\u201d Act of November 22, 1968, \u00a7 2, 19 P.S. \u00a7 640.2 (Supp.1975-76) (emphasis added). This language clearly demonstrates that the Act is intended to be operative only to aid an \u201cinvestigation\u201d, such as that undertaken by the two types of investigating grand juries delineated above. The legislature obviously did not intend to confer upon the Attorney General the power to immunize witnesses in all grand jury proceedings; such unlimited authority would undoubtedly subvert the fine balance between the rights protected by the Fifth Amendment and the power of the government to obtain testimony. We believe that the legislature specifically intended to avoid such a result, and did so by proscribing the power to immunize in proceedings before a regular, indicting grand jury, like that in the case presently at bar.\nIII.\nAn alternative ground for our holding also requires consideration, however, since it is our view that absent an allegation of conspiracy, the power to obtain a grant of immunity is not available under the Act.\nSection 1 of the Immunity Act sets forth the circumstances under which a court may order a witness to testify, specifically limiting such authority to proceedings \u201crelating to organized crime or racketeering.\u201d In addition, this Court has previously stated that \u201c[u]nder the Act, a court may grant immunity to a witness and order him to testify only if the proceeding in which his testimony is sought relates to \u2018organized crime or racketeering.\u2019 \u201d In re Salvatore LaRussa, 464 Pa. 86, 89, 346 A.2d 32, 34 (1975). There terms are defined in Section 6 of the Act as follows:\n\u201cOrganized crime\u201d and \u201cracketeering\u201d shall include, but not be limited to, conspiracy to commit murder, bribery or extortion, narcotic or dangerous drug violations, prostitution, usury, subornation of perjury and lottery, bookmaking or other forms of organized gambling.\nAct of November 22, 1968, \u00a7 6, 19 P.S. \u00a7 640.6 (Supp. 1975-76).\nBoth the trial court and the Superior Court construed the words \u201cconspiracy to commit\u201d in Section 6 to modify each of the substantive crimes following thereafter. Since the conspiracy charge against both defendants had been withdrawn, it was concluded that under the statutory definition, the grand jury proceeding did not relate to \u201corganized crime or racketeering\u201d, and the court was therefore without authority to grant immunity. We believe that the courts below correctly interpreted this language of the Act.\nThe Commonwealth argues that the lower courts erred in holding that the words \u201cconspiracy to commit\u201d in Section 6 of the Act modified each of the substantive crimes following thereafter, contending instead that these words should be construed to modify only the substantive crime of murder. To support its contention, the Commonwealth asserts that each substantive offense listed in Section 6 should be considered the food upon which organized crime feeds, and that the legislature must have intended the Act to become operative whenever a crime of that nature was involved. Thus, it is suggested that the language \u201cconspiracy to commit\u201d should be interpreted to modify only murder in order to achieve the purpose of reaching this class of criminal activity.\nSuch a construction, however, not only vitiates the natural and nontechnical word arrangement employed by the legislature in Section 6, but it disregards an obvious legislative intention to reach the vast network of well conceived criminal ventures undertaken by those involved in organized crime. It is obvious that the legislature did not intend the Act to be operative to reach the criminal activity of one individual acting alone. Rather, the Act unquestionably addresses itself to the concerted action of organized criminal activity. It has long been recognized that \u201c[a]n unlawful act may not prove injurious . . . when attempted by an individual, and may be readily prevented; the sam\u00e9 act attempted by the confederation of two or more may become dangerous to the public peace and to the security of persons and property, and harmful to the public morals by the very weight and power of numbers.\u201d Fimara v. Garner, 86 Conn. 434, 437-38, 85 A. 670, 672 (1913); See also, United States v. Rabinowich, 238 U.S. 78, 35 S.Ct. 682, 59 L.Ed. 1211 (1915). The substantive crimes listed in Section 6 may or may not be the product of organized crime. Rather, we are inclined to believe that it is when such acts are the end product of an \u201cunlawful agreement\u201d that constitute the evil sought to be eradicated by the legislature. Thus, on the basis of the obvious legislative intention to reach organized, concerted activity, and the plain meaning of the language of Section 6, it is clear that before the authority to confer immunity arises under the Act, there must be a conspiracy to commit any of the substantive offenses as set forth in Section 6.\nThe Commonwealth also asserts, however, that the language of Section 6 \u201cshall include, but not be limited to,\u201d implies that the legislature must have intended to reach the substantive offenses as well, including others not specifically enumerated in the Act. We agree that the legislature may have foreseen that it could not specifically identify all substantive offenses relating to organized crime, and we therefore agree that the legislature did not limit the Acts applicability to conspiracies to commit only the enumerated crimes. However, we also believe that the legislature intended only to provide sufficient latitude to reach conspiracies for any such unenumerated offenses relating to organized crime. We therefore cannot accept the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that this language indicates a legislative intention to reach something less than concerted activity.\nThe Commonwealth also argues that the Immunity Act should be read in pari materia with the subsequently enacted Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 911 (1973). That Act imposes criminal penalties and civil liability on anyone who receives benefit, pecuniary or otherwise, from a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u2019\u2019\u2019 Its primary purpose is, through the use of civil remedies of the type traditionally employed against antitrust violators, to prevent the infiltration of legitimate business enterprises by organized crime. The Commonwealth contends that the definition of \u201cracketeering activity\u201d in the Corrupt Organizations Act should be incorporated into the Immunity Act. Subsection (h) of the Corrupt Organizations Act defines \u201cracketeering activity\u201d as follows:\n(i) any act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of this title:\nChapter 25 (relating to criminal homicide)\nSection 2706 (relating to terroristic threats)\nChapter 29 (relating to kidnapping)\nChapter 33 (relating to arson, etc.)\nChapter 37 (relating to robbery)\nChapter 39 (relating to theft and related offenses)\nSection 4108 (relating to commercial bribery and breach of duty to act disinterestedly)\nSection 4109 (relating to rigging publicly exhibited contest)\nChapter 47 (relating to bribery and corrupt influence)\nChapter 49 (relating to perjury and other falsification in official matters)\nSection 5512 through 5514 (relating to gambling)\nChapter 59 (relating to public indecency)\n(ii) any offense indictable under section 20(d) of the act of September 26, 1961 (P.L. 1664), known as \u2018The Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act\u2019 (relating to the sale and dispensing of narcotic drugs);\n(iii) any conspiracy to commit any of the offenses set forth in subclauses (i) arid (ii) of this clause; or\n(iv) the collection of any money or other property in full or partial satisfaction of a debt which arose as the result of the lending of money or other property at a rate of interest exceeding 25% per annum or the equivalent rate for a longer or shorter period, where not otherwise authorized by law. . . . \" 18 Pa.C. S. \u00a7 911(h) (1973).\nAt the outset, we must note that the Commonwealth urges upon us a technique of statutory construction unknown to the law of this jurisdiction \u2014 that is, definition by reference to subsequent legislation. Section 1921(c) of the Rules of Construction Act clearly provides:\n(c) When the words of the statute are not explicit, the intention of the General Assembly may be ascertained by considering, among other matters:\n(1) The occasion and necessity for the statute.\n(2) The circumstances under which it was enacted.\n(3) The mischief to be remedied.\n(4) The object to be attained.\n(5) The former law, if any, including other statutes upon the same or similar subjects.\n(6) The consequences of a particular interpretation.\n(7) The contemporaneous legislative history.\n(8) Legislative and administrative interpretations of such statute.\nAct of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1339, \u00a7 3, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c) (Supp.1976-77) (emphasis added).\nHere, the legislature has specifically provided that former law on similar subjects may be used as an aid to construction, while never mentioning the possibility of so employing subsequently enacted legislation. Thus, reference to the Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 to interpret the previously enacted Immunity Act would clearly be improper.\nHowever, even if we assume for purposes of argument that reference to subsequent legislation is a valid interpretive technique, the Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 does not support the Commonwealth\u2019s contention, but refutes it. First, the 1970 Act defines \u201cracketeering activity\u201d as set forth above, which definition includes the substantive offense of \u201ccriminal homicide.\u201d We note that the Commonwealth would concede, under its interpretation of the language, that the Immunity Act would not apply to a criminal homicide where no conspiracy was alleged. Therefore, the application to the Immunity Act of the definition of \u201cracketeering activity\u201d set forth in the Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 would artificially broaden the Immunity Act\u2019s scope far beyond that provided by its express language. We do not believe that the legislature intended such a result.\nSecond, subsection (g) of the Corrupt Organizations Act, entitled \u201cImmunity,\u201d incorporates by reference the Immunity Act of 1968. However, by its terms, subsection (g) permits a grant of immunity only \u201c [wjhenever any individual refuses, on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination, to comply with a civil investigative demand issued pursuant to subsection (f) of this section or to testify or produce other information in any proceeding under subsection (d) [Civil Remedies] of this section.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 911(g) (1973). The Immunity Act is thus incorporated by reference to apply only to civil proceedings. It seems unlikely that the legislature would have confined the Immunity Act\u2019s application solely to civil proceedings under the Corrupt Organizations Act if the interpretation urged upon us by the Commonwealth was correct. Indeed, the civil \u2014 criminal distinction in the Corrupt Organizations Act would have been unnecessary if the legislature had vested the Attorney General with the power to petition for an immunity award in all proceedings. In light of these considerations, it is clear that any effort to define the language of the Immunity Act by reference to the Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 would be inappropriate and beyond the bounds of reasonable judicial construction. An accurate interpretation of the Immunity Act requires that we confine our examination to the express language employed by the legislature in that enactment alone, and that language clearly requires that a conspiracy be alleged before authority to grant immunity under the Act is conferred.\nFinally, it is argued that our construction of the Immunity Act today is in conflict with this Court\u2019s recent decision in In re Falone, 464 Pa. 42, 346 A.2d 9 (1975). We, however, see no such contradiction. In Falone, supra, this Court upheld a judgment of contempt entered against a witness who refused to testify before the January, 1974, Special Investigating Grand Jury of Philadelphia, despite a grant of immunity. The proceeding involved in Falone was an investigating and not an indicting grand jury. Moreover, the opinion in that case clearly referred to the fact of the Attorney General\u2019s allegation that Falone had \u201cconspired with other organized crime figures to make payments of money to members of the Philadelphia Police Department for the purpose of influencing them in the performance of their official duties.\u201d 464 Pa. at 55, n. 17, 346 A.2d at 16, n. 17. Since the facts in Falone are clearly in line with our present holding, any language in that opinion indicating that immunity may be granted absent an allegation of conspiracy must be regarded as surplusage.\nOrder of the Superior Court Affirmed.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nROBERTS, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which O\u2019BRIEN and POMEROY, JJ., joined.\n. U.S.Const. Amends. V and XIV; Pa.Const. art. I, \u00a7 9.\n. Commonwealth v. Brady and Commonwealth v. George, 69 D. & C.2d 146, 24 Bucks 149 (1973).\n. 228 Pa.Super. 233, 323 A.2d 866 (1974). Judge Cercone filed a dissenting opinion which was joined by Judge Spaeth.\n. See Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 204(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204(a) (Supp.1975-76).\n. It is quite clear, however, that immunity statutes in operation do not fully preserve the status quo provided by the privilege. See, e. g., Patrick v. United States, 524 F.2d 1109 (7th Cir. 1975) (defendant subjected to $900,000.00 jeopardy assessment by I.R.S. on basis of immunized testimony). Compelled testimony has also been used to impeach. See Comment, The Fifth Amendment and Compelled Testimony: Practical Problems in the Wake of Kastigar, 19 Vill.L.Rev. 470, 481 (1974).\n. Testimony is still \u201ccompelled\u201d in the literal sense under a grant of immunity. As a means of obtaining statements, a grant of immunity merely substitutes the threat of contempt and a jail term for the beatings, intimidation and psychological coercion proscribed by the Fifth Amendment. See Ullman v. United States, 350 U.S. 422, 446, 76 S.Ct. 497, 100 L.Ed. 511 (1956) (Douglas, J., dissenting).\n. The Commonwealth contends that a grand jury\u2019s powers are traditionally broad, United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974), and that privileges against testifying should therefore \u201cnot [be] lightly created nor expansively construed . . .\u201d United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 710, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 3108, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974). We do not believe, however, that the Fifth Amendment privilege may be subverted by a mechanistic invocation of the grand jury function. Rather, the privilege has traditionally been viewed as \u201cthe firmest limitation upon inquisitional power in the grand jury.\u201d Rief, The Grand Jury Witness and Compulsory Testimony Legislation, 10 Am.Crim.L.Rev. 829, 852 (1972). Nor can it reasonably be argued that the Fifth Amendment privilege is susceptible to the same type of limited breadth given to the amorphous \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d in United States v. Nixon, supra.\n. See Comment, The Federal Witness Immunity Acts In Theory and In Practice: Treading the Constitutional Tightrope, 72 Yale L.J. 1568, 1571 (1963).\n.

It should be noted that the original draft of the Immunity Act as introduced in the Senate provided for the granting of immunity \u201c. . . in any proceeding ... to any person.\u201d S.B. 1507, 1968 Sess., May 22, 1968. Upon consideration in the House, this provision was amended, with Senate concurrence, to strike out \u201cany proceeding\u201d and replace in its stead the phrase \u201ca proceeding relating to organized crime or racketeering.\u201d The purpose of the amendment, according to its author, Representative Caputo, was to \u201cprovide certain safeguards to the citizens of this Commonwealth.\u201d Pa.Leg.J. (House), p. 1658 (1968). Undoubtedly, the primary \u201csafeguard\u201d was the elimination of the wide open investigations which could have resulted from the broad language of the original bill. On the basis of this history, it is abundantly clear that the legislature was concerned with restricting the scope of the Immunity Act only to investigations concerning organized criminal activity.\n. For instance, while blackmail is not specifically enumerated in Section 6 of the Act, it seems evident that a conspiracy to commit blackmail would fall within the scope of the Act as relating to \u201corganized crime and racketeering.\u201d\n.

It is clear that the legislature utilized civil proceedings in the Corrupt Organizations Act in order to deal with the problem of organized crime without being burdened by the strict requirements of criminal procedure.\nOne feature of the legislation is that by treating violations as civil questions, it lessens the burden of proof, simplifies legal procedures, and affords the government broader rights of pretrial discovery.\nPennsylvania Crime Commission, Report on Organized Crime 93 (1970).

A witness testifying against an accused to avoid incarceration presents the same potential for perjury as a witness whose testimony is secured by use of the rack, the turning of the screw, or the payment of a monetary bribe. Using this kind of testimony to convict an accused raises serious due process questions.

        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice,\ndissenting.\nIn recognition of the dangers presented by organized crime and racketeering and the attendant danger of governmental corruption, the Legislature enacted the Immunity Act to assist law enforcement officials in their efforts to fight organized crime. The majority holds that the Immunity Act is inapplicable to proceedings before an indicting grand jury, and is inapplicable to investigations into bribery and extortion unless conspiracy to commit these crimes is alleged. There is no justification for such an interpretation of the Act; it serves only to obstruct prosecution of organized crime and. corruption.\nToday\u2019s decision denies the Attorney General the power to use the Immunity Act to obtain testimony necessary for the prosecution of two public officials accused of extortion. The prosecution began with the filing of a criminal complaint, in August 1972, charging that Warren Brady and Henry George, Bensalem Township supervisors, had committed \u201cextortion, prohibited acts by public officers, and conspiracy.\u201d Specifically, the complaint alleged that the two supervisors had extorted money and property from two construction contractors, Joseph D\u2019Egidio and John Camerlengo, in return for subdivision-approvals and zoning changes. The conspiracy charges were dropped after a preliminary hearing, but the Commonwealth made out a prima facie case on the other charges. When these charges were presented before an indicting grand jury, D\u2019Egidio and Camerlengo invoked the privilege against self-incrimination and refused to testify. The Attorney General, pursuant to the Immunity Act, then petitioned the court of common pleas for an order immunizing the two witnesses and compelling them to testify.\nThe court of common pleas dismissed the petition, ruling that the proceeding was not within the scope of the Immunity Act because it involved an indicting, as opposed to an investigating grand jury. As an alternative holding, the court held that the Immunity Act was not applicable because the Commonwealth was no longer alleging a conspiracy. The Superior Court affirmed in a three judge per curiam opinion (Wright, P. J., and Spaulding, J., not participating). Commonwealth v. Brady, 228 Pa.Super. 233, 323 A.2d 866 (1974). Judge Cercone filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Judge Spaeth.\nThe majority today follows the interpretation of the Immunity Act adopted by the court of common pleas. I believe that such an unnecessarily restrictive interpretation is contrary to the text of the Immunity Act and inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s intention that the Immunity Act provide a means of obtaining testimony against organized crime and racketeering. I dissent.\nI.\nThe Immunity Act Applies to Proceedings Before Indicting Grand Juries\nThe majority first decides that the Immunity Act may not be used to immunize witnesses called before an indicting grand jury. Section 1 of the Immunity Act provides that a witness may be ordered to testify:\n\u201c. . . in a proceeding relating to organized crime or racketeering before a court, grand jury or investigating body set up by legislative enactment or by order of the Governor . . ..\u201d\nThis provision, by its terms, applies to grand juries, and makes no distinction between investigating and indicting grand juries. The majority ignores the express language of this provision, however, and instead construes the title of the Immunity Act to limit its application to proceedings before investigating grand juries.\nThere is no justification for interpreting a statute solely on the basis of its title, without considering its text. The Statutory Construction Act of 1972 provides that \u201c[t]he title and preamble of a statute may be considered in the construction thereof.\u201d Thus, reference to the title is permissible in order to interpret the text of a statute. The majority\u2019s use of the title to reach a result at odds with the text of the statute is indefensible.\nThe majority\u2019s interpretation also contravenes the purpose of the Immunity Act: to promote the prosecution of organized crime and racketeering. I cannot agree with the majority that the only purpose of the Immunity Act is investigation.\nIndeed, the Immunity Act applies \u201cin a proceeding relating to organized crime dr racketeering before a court . . . .\u201d Ordinarily, courts are engaged in adjudication, not investigation. When the Act provides that a witness must \u201ctestify or . produce evidence\u201d \u201cbefore a court,\u201d it is clear that the Act contemplates the use of this immunized testimony in criminal prosecution, not just investigation.\n. As defined, \u201corganized crime\u201d and \u201cracketeering\u201d refer to crimes which present a serious danger to the public welfare and which, by their very nature, excape prosecution if the Commonwealth is limited to ordinary law enforcement techniques. Immunity has long been recognized as a useful tool for gathering evidence against such criminal activity. Thus, the purposes of the Act are not limited to the gathering of information for the further edification of the public about the threat of organized crime and racketeering. Rather, its purposes include prosecution.\nThe majority asserts that \u201c . . . immunity statutes [are] designed to assist in the uncovering of criminal activity, as opposed to simply providing a means whereby sufficient information may be obtained for the prosecution and conviction of an individual offender.\u201d If by this statement the majority means that immunity statutes were aimed only at discovering crimes, not at producing testimony for the prosecution of crime, the proposition is belied by the very source relied on by the majority. Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 446 n. 14, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 1657 n. 14, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972), points out that some of the earliest immunity legislation was enacted in order to obtain testimony at particular trials.\nThus, far from reaching the result specifically intended by the Legislature, the majority appears to have frustrated the purpose of the Legislature by preventing the use of immunity in the situation most clearly contemplated by the Legislature: in the prosecution of organized crime and racketeering.\nFinally, the language of the title itself does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion. The title reads:\n\u201cAn Act authorizing courts of record to grant witnesses immunity from prosecution for or on account of any matter or thing concerning which they were ordered to testify in a proceeding before certain grand juries, investigating committees or commissions and courts of record; making the refusal to testify after such immunity criminal contempt and providing penalties.\u201d\nThe majority reads the words \u201ccertain grand juries\u201d to mean investigating grand juries, reasoning that the word certain cannot be surplusage. Although the Immunity Act does not apply to all grand juries, reference to the text of the statute itself makes clear that it applies to this proceeding. The limitations referred to by the word \u201ccertain\u201d in the title are not those created by the majority. The Act provides that a grant of immunity may be given in \u201ca proceeding relating to organized crime\u201d and only when \u201cthe attorney general has established a need for the grant of immunity . . . .\u201d Thus the Act applies only to grand jury proceedings, like the proceedings in this case, which meet these conditions. Since the title does not refer to organized crime or racketeering, or the requirement that need for a grant of immunity be established, the most reasonable interpretation is that the word \u201ccertain\u201d refers to these requirements. Moreover, the title itself refers to \u201cinvestigating committees.\u201d If the Legislature intended to limit the Act\u2019s applicability to investigating grand juries, it would not have drafted the title to read \u201ccertain grand juries,\u201d but would have used the words \u201cinvestigating grand juries,\u201d just as it used the words \u201cinvestigating committees.\u201d\nThe Legislature adopts the title of a statute as a convenient label for referring to the enactment. While the title may shed some light on legislative purpose, it is not intended to catalogue every situation in which the statute might apply, or to expressly limit its applicability. When the Legislature enacted the Immunity Act, it saw the need not just to investigate, but to eradicate, organized crime and racketeering. The majority\u2019s use of the title to the Immunity Act to limit its applicability to investigating grand juries violates the most basic rule of statutory interpretation: \u201c[T]he object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d\nII.\nThe Immunity Act Applies to Proceedings Relating to Bribery or Extortion\nAs an alternative holding, the majority decides that the Immunity Act cannot be invoked absent an allegation of conspiracy. Section I of the Act authorizes a grant of immunity \u201cin a proceeding relating to organized crime or racketeering.\u201d Section 6 of the Act provides:\n\u201cAs used in this act\u2014\n\u2018Organized crime\u2019 and \u2018racketeering\u2019 shall include, but not be limited to, conspiracy to commit murder, bribery, or extortion, narcotic or dangerous drug violations, prostitution, usury, subornation of perjury and lottery, bookmaking or other forms of organized gambling.\u201d\nThe majority reads the words \u201cconspiracy to commit\u201d in Section 6 to modify each of the substantive crimes listed. It reasons that only conspiracies to commit the crimes listed in Section 6 and conspiracies to commit similar crimes constitute \u201corganized crime or racketeering.\u201d Because the conspiracy charges against both Brady and George were withdrawn, the majority concludes that the grand jury proceeding did not relate to \u201corganized crime or racketeeting\u201d and holds that the court of common pleas was without authority to grant immunity. I cannot agree.\nMy disagreement with the majority\u2019s interpretation is compelled by four factors: (1) the arrangement of the words of Section 6; (2) the nature of the problem which the Legislature addressed; (3) the broad language of the Act; and (4) a subsequent enactment of the Legislature defining the term \u201cracketeering.\u201d\nA.\nI reject the majority\u2019s assertion that its construction of the Act follows naturally from the arrangement of the words in Section 6. On the contrary, a textual analysis of the section yields the conclusion that the words \u201cconspiracy to commit\u201d modify only the following word: \u201cmurder.\u201d The arrangement of the words provides no indication that the phrase \u201cconspiracy to commit\u201d modifies every word that follows. It requires a strained construction to conclude that the eleven crimes listed, which are connected by four conjunctions, are all modified by the phrase \u201cconspiracy to commit.\u201d By contrast, the words \u201cshall include,\u201d are words which normally serve to alert the reader that a list follows. Thus, the natural arrangement of the words in Section 6 indicates that the list of crimes which constitute organized crime or racketeering begins after the words \u201cshall include, but not be limited to,\u201d and that \u201cconspiracy to commit,\u201d modifies only \u201cmurder.\u201d\nMoreover, the majority\u2019s interpretation injects an ambiguity into Section 6. The crimes, or groups of crimes (e. g., \u201cbribery or extortion\u201d), listed in Section 6 are connected by the conjunction \u201cand.\u201d (i. e., \u201c. . . subornation of perjury and lottery, bookmaking or other forms of organized gambling.\u201d) When the phrase \u201cconspiracy to commit\u201d modifies two or more crimes connected by the conjunction \u201cand,\u201d this denotes a single conspiracy encompassing multiple objectives. For example, the words \u201cconspiracy to commit murder and robbery\u201d imply a single criminal scheme, having as its objectives both murder and robbery. If the phrase \u201cconspiracy to commit\u201d modifies all the crimes listed in Section 6, this would mean that a petition for a grant of immunity must allege a single conspiracy having the objectives of murder, prostitution, usury, subornation of perjury, and at least four other crimes. Although the majority does not claim that such a multifarious conspiracy need be alleged, this conclusion would apparently follow from the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute.\nIn short, the majority\u2019s interpretation does not follow from a straightforward interpretation of the statute. The most plausible interpretation is that suggested by the Commonwealth: that the phrase \u201cconspiracy to commit\u201d modifies only the crime of \u201cmurder.\u201d If anything, it is the majority\u2019s interpretation, not the Commonwealth\u2019s, that \u201cvitiates the natural and nontechnical word arrangement employed by the legislature.\u201d\nB.\nThe conclusion that the phrase \u201cconspiracy to commit\u201d modifies only the crime of murder is supported by an examination of the nature of the crimes listed in Section 6 in light of the purposes of the Immunity Act. The Legislature specifically addressed itself to the problem of organized crime. Of the substantive crimes listed in Section 6 of the Act, only murder can be performed by an individual acting by himself. All of the others require two or more persons for the substantive violation to be consummated. A murder committed by an individual acting completely by himself is simply not a proper case to be investigated by the use of grants of immunity. The only person who could claim immunity with regard to the murder under investigation would be the killer. The Legislature intended to reach those crimes which are committed by at least two people and, commonly, by organized criminals. This includes conspiracy to commit murder, and the other substantive crimes listed that enable organized crime to exist and flourish: corruption of public officials, corruption of the means by which crime is fought, and the crimes which pay for it all \u2014 extortion, prostitution, gambling, and the drug trade. For this reason, I am of the view that the other listed crimes were intended by the Legislature to be included within \u201corganized crime or racketeering,\u201d not only conspiracies to commit these crimes.\nI find it particularly hard to believe that the Legislature did not intend the Immunity Act to apply in proceedings relating to \u201corganized gambling.\u201d Yet the construction adopted by the majority makes the statute applicable only to cases involving conspiracy to commit organized gambling. If gambling is organized, this implies the existence of a conspiracy. In effect, the majority's construction requires the Commonwealth to allege a conspiracy to enter into a conspiracy.\nC.\nThe interpretation of the Act adopted by the majority fails to give effect to the broad language used by the Legislature in drafting the Immunity Act. It is apparent that the Legislature intended to sweep broadly with the Act. In Section 1, the Act provides that immunity may be granted in proceedings before courts, grand juries, legislative investigative bodies, and executive investigative bodies conducting inquiries \u201crelating to organized crime or racketeering.\u201d The nature of this relation is in no way restricted. It may include the causes, operations, beginnings, effects or scope of organized .crime or racketeering. I cannot agree with the majority that the bribery of public officials, and extortion by public officials, do not \u201crelate to\u201d organized crime or racketeering in one or more of the ways enumerated above.\nThe majority also fails to give the proper effect to the language in Section 6 of the Act which defines organized crime and racketeering to include \u201cbut not be limited to\u201d the enumerated crimes. Again, the Legislature chose broad language seeking to avoid the possibility of a technical construction which would allow an aspect of organized crime, or a matter relating to organized crime, to escape scrutiny. The majority's narrow reading of the Immunity Act is contrary to the broad language of the Act itself.\nD.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s interpretation of the Immunity Act is supported by other legislation dealing with organized crime and racketeering. The Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 was enacted to prevent those who procure wealth and influence through \u201cracketeering activities\u201d from utilizing that wealth and influence to obtain control over legitimate enterprises. As such it is clearly in \u201cpari materia\u201d with the Immunity Act; the two statutes both relate to the control of organized crime and racketeering. Since the Immunity Act and the Corrupt Organizations Act are in pari materia, we must construe the two statutes together. Since the two statutes have common objectives, and the Legislature anticipated that the Immunity Act would be used to aid enforcement of the Corrupt Organizations Act, it is both possible and desirable to construe the Immunity Act in light of the Corrupt Organizations Act.\nSubsection (h) of the Corrupt Organizations Act specifically enumerates those crimes which are included within the term \u201cracketeering activity\n\u201c \u2018Racketeering activity\u2019 means:\n(i) any act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of this title:\nChapter 25 (relating to crime homicide)\nSection 2706 (relating to terroristic threats)\nChapter 29 (relating to kidnapping)\nChapter 33 (relating to arson, etc.)\nChapter 37 (relating to robbery)\nChapter 39 (relating to theft and related offenses)\nSection 4108 (relating to commercial bribery and breach of duty to act disinterestedly)\nSection 4109 (relating to rigging publicly exhibited contest)\nChapter 47 (relating to bribery and corrupt influence)\nChapter 49 (relating to perjury and other falsification in official matters)\nSection 5512 through 5514 (relating to gambling)\nChapter 59 (relating to public indecency)\n(ii) any offense indictable under section 20(d) of the act of September 26, 1961 (P.L. 1664), known as \u2018The Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act\u2019 (relating to the sale and dispensing of narcotic drugs);\n(iii) any conspiracy to commit any of the offenses set forth in subclauses (i) and (ii) of this clause; or\n(iv) the collection of any money or other property in full or partial satisfaction of a debt which arose as the result of the lending of money or other property at a rate of interest exceeding 25% per annum or the equivalent rate for a longer or shorter period, where not otherwise authorized by law. . . .\u201d\nThus, the Corrupt Organizations Act, with its broad definition of racketeering activities, includes all of the listed crimes regardless whether a conspiracy is alleged. Because this Act and the Immunity Act should be construed together, this Court should not artificially restrict the definitions found in the Immunity Act.\nTo do otherwise creates an anomalous situation. The Corrupt Organizations Act contains an immunity provision which adopts by reference the Immunity Act and extends its application to civil proceedings when there is a pattern of \u201cracketeering.\u201d There is no requirement that the Commonwealth allege a conspiracy to commit racketeering activity. As Judge Cercone stated in his dissenting opinion in the Superior Court:\n\u201cIt therefore seems incongruous to suggest that the legislature sought to grant broader immunity powers to the Attorney General in civil proceedings where only a divestiture or injunction might be at stake; and where, because of the less severe sanction to be imposed upon the defendant, the \u2018immunized\u2019 witness would be more easily induced to commit perjury \u2014 or at least less motivated to tell the truth.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Brady, 228 Pa.Super. 238, 238, 323 A. 2d 866, 869 (1974) (dissenting opinion of Cercone, J., joined by Spaeth, J.). The Legislature did not intend such an incongruous result.\nThese considerations leave no doubt that the Legislature intended the Immunity Act to apply to those substantive crimes which are listed in Section 6. These crimes include the crimes by which organized crime and racketeering profit, and the methods by which they evade prosecution. The corrupting influence of these crimes presents a serious threat to society, irrespective of whether a conspiracy is alleged. These crimes may escape prosecution if law enforcement officials cannot resort to the use of immunity, even when a conspiracy is not involved. I see no reason to depart from the position taken by this Court in In re Falone, 464 Pa. 42, 346 A.2d 9 (1975), that the Immunity Act is not limited to proceedings relating to conspiracies.\nIII.\nImmunity Leaves the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination Inviolate\nIn support of its decision, the majority relies on the proposition that the Immunity Act must be narrowly construed to avoid infringement of fifth amendment rights. The simple answer to this proposition lies in the language of the fifth amendment: \u201cno person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S.Const, amend. V (emphasis added). The fifth amendment does not grant the right to refuse to testify against others. When immunity is granted, so that the testimony cannot be used against the witness in any criminal proceeding, the witness is not being compelled to testify against himself. The idea that the fifth amendment gives a witness a privilege to refuse to testify, even when immunity has been granted, was rejected by the Supreme Court in Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972), and by this court in In re Falone, 464 Pa. 42, 346 A.2d 9 (1975). The grant of immunity offered to the witnesses in this proceeding would fully protect their fifth amendment rights.\nAs this Court reasoned in Falone:\n\u201c [The] conclusion that the Act must receive a \u2018strict construction\u2019 is based on an erroneous view of immunity and the privilege against self-incrimination. It is incorrect that under the Act \u2018a person can be compelled to give testimony against himself\u2019 in the constitutional sense. When a witness receives a grant of immunity from prosecution that is at least as broad in scope and effect as the privilege against self-incrimination, his privilege is completely displaced because he has \u2018complete protection from all the perils against which the [privilege] was designed to guard.\u2019 [Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 586, 12 S.Ct. 195, 206, 35 L.Ed. 1100 (1892); accord] Zicarelli v. New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, 406 U.S. 472, 92 S.Ct. 1670, 32 L.Ed.2d 234 (1972); Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972); Gardner v.

A grant of immunity is sufficient to supplant the privilege if the witness is protected against use of the compelled testimony and all its fruits. Kastigar v. United States, supra. Immunity granted under the Act is \u2018transactional\u2019 immunity, Riccobene Appeal, supra, 439 Pa. at 412, 268 A.2d at 109, and thus is more extensive than necessary to displace the privilege.\nAs the Supreme Court stated in Kastigar v. United States, supra:\n\u2018[The] sole concern [of the privilege against self-incrimination] is to afford protection against being \u201cforced to give testimony leading to the infliction of \u2018penalties affixed to . . . criminal acts.\u2019 \u201d Immunity from the use of compelled testimony, as well as evidence derived directly and indirectly therefrom, affords this protection. It prohibits the prosecutorial authorities from using thei compelled testimony in any respect, and it therefore insures that the testimony cannot lead to the infliction of criminal penalties on the witness.\u2019\n406 U.S. at 453, 92 S.Ct. at 1661 (footnote omitted). Accordingly, a witness who is compelled to testify under the Act is not testifying \u2018against himself\u2019 in the constitutional sense, because his testimony cannot result in the infliction of criminal penalties. Thus, it is not necessary to accord the Act a \u2018strict construction\u2019 for the protection of the privilege against self-incrimination. We can perceive no reason why the Act should not \u2018be liberally construed to effect [its] objects and to promote justice.\u2019 Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928(c) (Supp.1974). Cf. United States v. Chavez, 416 U.S. 562, 94 S.Ct. 1849, 40 L.Ed.2d 380 (1974).\u201d\nId. at 47-48, 346 A.2d at 12-13 (footnotes omitted).\nThe majority does not assert that the Immunity Act, as interpreted by the Commonwealth, would be unconstitutional. The federal immunity statute, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 6001 et seq. (Supp.1976), which was upheld in Kastigar v. United States, supra, contains neither of the restrictions imposed by the majority today. Thus, there is no constitutional limitation restricting the use of the immunity power to proceedings before investigating grand juries, or to proceedings relating to criminal conspiracies.\nIf a statute must be given a narrow construction to avoid infringement of constitutional rights, the restrictions imposed should be directly related to the statute\u2019s asserted constitutional infirmity. See e. g., Scales v. United States, 367 U.S. 203, 81 S.Ct. 1469, 6 L.Ed.2d 782 (1961). The restrictions imposed by the majority, however, bear no relation to the values protected by the privilege against self-incrimination.\nThe majority refers to the \u201cdelicate balance created by the privilege,\u201d and concludes that these two witnesses cannot be required to testify because the proceeding is not before an investigating grand jury and does not relate to a criminal conspiracy. If the majority means to imply that the privilege against self-incrimination provides less protection when investigating grand juries are involved, or conspiracies are alleged, its analysis undermines fifth amendment values.\nIt is the provision for immunity, not the arbitrary restrictions imposed by the majority, which enables a grand jury to compel testimony without infringing on fifth amendment rights. The privilege against self-incrimination has been fully protected by the grant of immunity. Since a grant of immunity protects against infringement on the privilege against self-incrimination, there is no reason not to give the Immunity Act the broad interpretation intended by the Legislature.\nIV.\nImmunity is Essential to the Prosecution of Organized Crime and Racketeering\nLaw enforcement must be directed not only at crime in the streets, but also at crime in the halls and chambers of government. To allow those who gain wealth and power through racketeering and corruption to escape prosecution erodes public confidence in government, and breeds disrespect for the law. The very power and influence which makes these crimes so inimical to the public welfare, however, makes it difficult to obtain testimony against these crimes. With this in mind the Legislature passed the Immunity Act; immunity is an essential tool for the prosecution of such crimes. Therefore, justice is not served by unnecessarily restricting the ability of prosecutors to use the Immunity Act in order to produce testimony before an investigating or an indicting grand jury.\nThe scope of power granted to grand juries is necessarily broad. As Mr. Justice Powell recently stated for the Supreme Court of the United States in United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 343-44, 94 S.Ct. 613, 617-18, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974):\n\u201cThe scope of the grand jury\u2019s powers reflects its special role in insuring fair and effective law enforcement. A grand jury proceeding is not an adversary hearing in which the guilt or innocence of the accused is adjudicated. Rather, it is an ex parte investigation to determine whether a crime has been committed and whether criminal proceedings should be instituted against any person. The grand jury\u2019s investigative power must be broad if its public responsibility is adequately to be discharged.\u201d\nAccord, Pirillo v. Takiff, 462 Pa. 511, 523, 341 A.2d 896, 902 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1083, 96 S.Ct. 873, 47 L.Ed.2d 94 (1976); see United States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564, 96 S.Ct. 1768, 48 L.Ed.2d 212 (1976) (plurality opinion); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 709, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 3108, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039, 1064 (1974); United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 764, 35 L.Ed.2d 67 (1973); Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972); Appeal of Freedman, 541 F.2d 373 (3rd Cir. 1976).\nThus, the principle that the public has \u201cthe right to every man\u2019s evidence\u201d is particularly relevant to grand jury proceedings. United States v. Mandujano, supra; United States v. Nixon, supra; United States v. Dionisio, supra; Branzburg v. Hayes, supra; In re Falone, 464 Pa. 42, 346 A.2d 9 (1975). Of course a witness may be protected by the privilege against self-incrimination. In such a case, the Commonwealth must determine whether the testimony is of sufficient import to its investigation to warrant a grant of immunity. The ability to grant immunity is an integral part of the grand jury\u2019s power and essential to its proper function. As stated by Mr. Chief Justice Burger in Mandujano:\n\u201c[Fjederal statutes conferring immunity on witnesses in federal judicial proceedings, including grand jury investigations, are so familiar that they have become part of our \u2018constitutional fabric.\u2019 . . . Immunity is the Government\u2019s ultimate tool for securing testimony that otherwise would be protected [Wjhen granted immunity, a witness once again owes the obligation imposed upon all citizens \u2014 the duty to give testimony \u2014 since immunity substitutes . for the privilege.\u201d\n425 U.S. at 575, 96 S.Ct. at 1776 (plurality opinion) (citations omitted).\nThe majority today prohibits the Commonwealth from using the Immunity Act to secure testimony before an indicting grand jury. Without such testimony, an indictment may not be obtained, and those engaged in organized crime and racketeering may escape prosecution. By its alternative holding, restricting the Immunity Act\u2019s application to conspiracies, the majority also impedes the efforts of investigating grand juries to uncover crimes involving bribery, extortion, and other forms of racketeering and corruption.\nThe majority asserts that the Immunity Act must be narrowly construed because \u201c. . .a grant of immunity authorizes and even encourages interrogation which would otherwise be prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d As the majority recognizes, however, the privilege does not apply when there has been a grant of immunity, coextensive with that privilege. To reason that, because the grand jury\u2019s inquiry would be limited if the privilege applied, it must be limited when the privilege does not apply, is nonsense.\nThe grant of immunity \u201cdisplaces the danger\u201d of self-incrimination by fully protecting the witness. Ullmann v. United States, 350 U.S. 422, 439, 76 S.Ct. 497, 507, 100 L.Ed. 511, 525 (1956); accord. United States v. Mandujano, supra at 575, 96 S.Ct. at 1776; 48 L.Ed.2d at 222; In re Falone, supra at 47, 346 A.2d at 12. At the same time, it is an important ingredient to the successful functioning of grand juries and to the successful prosecution of organized crime and racketeering. Given the importance placed by the Legislature on investigating and prosecuting organized crime and racketeering, it could not have intended to limit arbitrarily and irrationally the power to use this essential tool.\nAccordingly, I cannot accept the majority\u2019s arbitrary interpretation of the Immunity Act. Neither the Act nor the constitution limits the power to grant immunity to proceedings before investigating grand juries; there is no reason for this Court to do so. Likewise, I am satisfied that \u201corganized crime or racketeering\u201d is not limited to conspiracies to commit the substantive offenses listed in Section 6. As Judge Cercone stated in his dissenting opinion in the Superior Court:\n\u201c. . . I am convinced that a construction of the immunity act which requires the allegation of a conspiracy to commit extortion is not warranted because of the clear intention of the legislature to employ broad new powers to eliminate the evil of organized crime and racketeering, especially when the racketeering is carried out in violation of a public trust. In the typical case, such racketeering is merely one link in a pernicious chain which shackles honest men both private and public. This link must be broken if the legislature and the courts hope to prevent further erosion of the trust that the governed must have in their government. The legislature has determined, and I of course agree, that this is a condition that can no longer be tolerated.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Brady, 228 Pa.Super. 233, 241, 323 A.2d 866, 870-71 (1974) (dissenting opinion of Cercone, J., joined by Spaeth, J.) (footnotes omitted).\nThe grand jury proceeding in this case relates to alleged extortion and prohibited acts by public officials. Extortion and official corruption constitute a malignancy which threatens the public welfare and the public\u2019s confidence in government. Such crimes must be prosecuted, but it may be impossible to prosecute without resort to the immunity power.\nManifestly, this is the situation which the Legislature intended to reach when it adopted the Immunity Act. If the powers made available by the Immunity Act cannot be utilized, corrupt public officials can escape prosecution. The arbitrary limitations imposed by the majority are contrary to the language and the purpose of the Immunity Act.\nI dissent.\nO\u2019BRIEN and POMEROY, JJ., join in this dissenting opinion.\n. Act of November 22, 1968, P.L. 1080 \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq., 19 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 640.1 et seq. (Supp.1976).\n. Id. \u00a7 640.1.\n. Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1339 \u00a7 3, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1924 (Supp.1976).\n. The majority states that the Act \u201cis primarily intended to assist in the investigation of organized crime and racketeering,\u201d (emphasis deleted), but proceeds to interpret the statute as if investigation were its only purpose. Even if investigation is the statute\u2019s primary purpose, there is no justification for interpreting the statute to frustrate its other purposes. A statute must be interpreted, if possible, so as to effectuate all of its purposes.\n. 19 P.S. \u00a7 640.1 (Supp.1976).\n. Id.\n. \u201cAs used in this act\u2014\n\u2018Organized crime\u2019 and \u2018racketeering\u2019 shall include, but not be limited to, conspiracy to commit murder, bribery or extortion, narcotic or dangerous drug violations, prostitution, usury, subornation of perjury and lottery, bookmaking or other forms of organized gambling.\u201d\n19 P.S. \u00a7 640.6 (Supp.1976).\n. \u201cWhen the words of the statute are not explicit, the intention of the General Assembly may be ascertained by considering, among other matters:\n(1) The occasion and necessity for the statute.\n(2) The circumstances under which it was enacted.\n(3) The mischief to be remedied.\n1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921 (Supp.1976). I believe that the language of the statute is explicit. The majority has manufactured an ambiguity by looking at the title instead of the statute itself. Since the majority\u2019s construction of the statute does not follow from the explicit language of the statute, it should consider the legislative purpose of facilitating prosecution of organized crime before adopting its construction of the statute.\n. 19 P.S. \u00a7 640.1, Annot. (Supp.1976).\n. Id. \u00a7 640.1.\n. It also appears from a reading of the title that the word certain is intended to modify the words \u201cgrand juries, investigating committees or commissions and courts of record,\u201d not just the words \u201cgrand juries.\u201d 19 P.S. \u00a7 640.1, Annot. (Supp.1976). If the word certain refers to the limitation to proceedings relating to organized crime, and modifies all of the bodies or tribunals listed in the title, then the title clearly reflects the provisions of the statute itself. If the word \u201ccertain\u201d means \u201cinvestigating,\u201d however, as the majority asserts, the words \u201ccertain . . investigating committees\u201d would mean \u201cinvestigating ... investigating committees.\u201d The word \u201ccertain\u201d would be surplus-age.\n. In United States v. Campanale, 518 F.2d 352 (9th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1050, 96 S.Ct. 777, 46 L.Ed.2d 638 (1976), the Ninth Circuit rejected an argument that the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1961 et seq. (Supp.1976), applies only to those engaged in large-scale \u201corganized crime:\u201d\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Congress was concerned with organized crime in passing this amendment to the Hobbs Act. The official short title of the statute evidences this concern. But quite obviously Congress focused on some of the kinds of activities by which individuals and associations engaged in organized crime maintained their income or influence. The statute makes unlawful such activities no matter who engages therein.\u201d\nId. at 363. (citation omitted).\n. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921 (Supp.1976).\n. 19 P.S. \u00a7 640.1 (Supp.1976).\n. Id. \u00a7 640.6 (Supp.1976).\n. Basing today\u2019s decision on the fact that the conspiracy charges were withdrawn creates an absurd result. The original complaint charged conspiracy, and a grant of immunity therefore could have been given before the conspiracy charge was dropped. Indeed, immunity can be granted even before a complaint is filed. In In re Falone, 464 Pa. 42, 346 A.2d 9 (1975), the allegation of conspiracy was contained in the Attorney General\u2019s petition for a grant of immunity, and the majority states that this was sufficient. Consequently, the request for immunity in this case is being denied merely because the request was filed at a later stage in the proceedings.\n. The majority relies on a statement made by Representative Caputo on the House floor in support of its interpretation of the Immunity Act. This court has determined, however, that statements made on the floor of the House or Senate should not be relied on in formulating legislative intent. Commonwealth v. Alcoa Properties, Inc., 440 Pa. 42, 269 A.2d 748 (1970); Martin\u2019s Estate, 365 Pa. 280, 74 A.2d 120 (1950); National Transit Co. v. Boardman, 328 Pa. 450, 197 A. 239 (1938). Moreover, such statements \u201c\u2022 . . can be so ambiguous as to cause confusion rather than clarification.\u201d Commonwealth v. Alcoa Properties, Inc., supra at 46, 269 A.2d at 749, a problem amply illustrated by the majority\u2019s use of Representative Caputo\u2019s statement.\nRepresentative Caputo introduced a group of amendments, including the Immunity Act\u2019s requirement that immunity be granted only \u201cafter a hearing in which the attorney general has established a need for the grant of immunity.\u201d Pa.Leg.J. (House), at 1658 (1969); 19 P.S. \u00a7 640.1 (Supp.1976). This Court recognized the significance of this requirement in In re Falone, supra:\n\u201cThe Legislature recognized that a grant of immunity is an extraordinary benefit conferred on the witness. The public interest is usually best served by prosecuting persons guilty of crime, but in certain limited circumstances the public interest may require the conferral of that benefit in return for disclosure of information in the witness\u2019 possession. The Legislature was not satisfied to entrust the determination that those limited circumstances exist to law enforcement officials alone. Therefore, the Act provides that the Attorney General\u2019s decision that immunization is necessary is subject to approval of the court.\u201d\n464 Pa. at 42, 346 A.2d at 9. Thus, when Representative Caputo stated that the amendments were to \u201cprovide certain safeguards to the citizens of this Commonwealth,\u201d Pa.Leg.J. (House) at 1658 (1968), he probably was referring to the need to insure that criminals are not immunized from prosecution except when a court agrees with the Attorney General that it is more important to obtain their testimony. Both the limitation to proceedings relating to organized crime and racketeering, and the requirement that a need for the grant of immunity be established, are consistent with this interpretation.\n. 19 P.S. \u00a7 640.6.\n. Id. \u00a7 640.6.\n. Act of December 8, 1970, P.L. 874 \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq., repealed and reenacted, Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482 \u00a7 1, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 911 (1973).\n. \u201cStatutes or parts of statutes are in pari materia when they relate to the same persons or things or to the same class of persons or things.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1932(a) (Supp.1976).\nThe majority states that the Corrupt Organizations Act emphasizes civil remedies, but that is no reason to decide that the Corrupt Organizations Act and the Immunity Act are not in pari materia. Both deal with the same subject: organized crime and racketeering.\nThe majority\u2019s statement that the privilege against self-incrimination cannot be diluted by a reference to a statute emphasizing noncriminal remedies and procedures reflects a complete misunderstanding of the privilege. \u201cIt ... is the danger of formal imposition of legal criminal liability against which the privilege protects.\u201d J. McCormack, Evidence \u00a7 121 at 256 (2d ed. 1972). Thus, the availability of the privilege depends on the possibility that the witness may be subject to criminal prosecution; it does not depend on the particular proceeding before which the witness is called to testify. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 135, 143. The distinction between a grand jury investigation and a civil proceeding pursuant to the Corrupt Organizations Act, relates only to the kind of proceeding in which the witness testifies, not to the possibility of any subsequent prosecution. To distinguish the provision for immunity made in the Corrupt Organizations Act because the Act emphasizes civil remedies is to make a distinction without a difference.\nMoreover, the Corrupt Organizations Act is not limited to civil remedies. It defines criminal offenses which constitute felonies of the first degree, and apply independently of the Act\u2019s civil remedies. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 911(b)-(c) (1973). These offenses all relate to organized crime and racketeering. Therefore, the Immunity Act should be construed together with the Corrupt Organizations Act so that the power to grant immunity is available when these crimes are prosecuted.\n. \u201cStatutes in pari materia shall be construed together, if possible, as one statute. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1932(b) (Supp.1976).\nThe majority simply ignores this provision of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972. Even if this provision did not exist, however, it would not follow, as the majority asserts, that it is improper to consider the Corrupt Organizations Act in construing the Immunity Act. The section of the Statutory Construction Act relied on by the majority provides:\n\u201cWhen the words of the statute are not explicit, the intention of the General Assembly may be ascertained by considering, among other matters:\n(5) The former law, if any, including other statutes upon the same or similar subjects.\n(8) Legislative and administrative interpretations of such statute.\u201d\nId. \u00a7 1921(c) (Supp.1976). The majority\u2019s reliance on this provision is unfounded. First, since the Legislature\u2019s intent may be determined by considering these factors \u201camong other matters\u201d it is clear that this list is not intended to be exclusive. Just because this subsection provides for consideration of prior legislation does not mean that subsequent legislation cannot be considered as well. Second, the Immunity Act is incorporated by reference in the Corrupt Organizations Act. Since that incorporation reflects the Legislature\u2019s understanding of the Immunity Act, it can be thought of as a \u201cLegislative interpretation\u201d of the Immunity Act.\n. As the majority points out, the Corrupt Organizations Act defines racketeering to include \u201ccriminal homicide,\u201d 18 P.S. \u00a7 911(h)(l)(i) (1973), and the Immunity Act applies to \u201cconspiracy to commit murder.\u201d 19 P.S. \u00a7 640.6 (Supp.1976). This apparent contradiction, however, is no reason to ignore the Corrupt Organizations Act in construing the Immunity Act. The statutory Construction Act provides that \u201cStatutes in pari materia shall be construed together, if possible, as one statute.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1932(b) (Supp.1976). The better interpretation of this subsection, and of the Statutory Construction Act as a whole, is that if two statutes in pari materia cannot be treated as one statute for all purposes, they still should be treated together to the extent possible. The objective of statutory interpretation still should be to \u201ceffectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1921(a) (Supp.1976). Thus, when two statutes deal with the same subject, they should be considered together so as to effectuate the purposes of both statutes.\n. The majority asserts \u201cthat the legislature . . . confined the Immunity Act\u2019s application solely to civil proceedings under the Corrupt Organizations Act . . . .\u201d I cannot agree. Subsection (g) of the Corrupt Organizations Act provides:\n\u201cWhenever any individual refuses, on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination, to comply with a civil investigative demand issued pursuant to subsection (f) of this section or to testify or produce other information in any proceeding under subsection (d) of this section, the Attorney General may invoke the provisions of the act of November 22, 1968 (No. 333), entitled \u2018An act authorizing courts of record to grant witnesses immunity from prosecution for or on account of any matter or thing concerning which they were ordered to testify in a proceeding before certain grand juries, investigating committees or commissions and courts of record; making the refusal to testify after such immunity criminal contempt and providing penalties,\u2019 by presenting a petition pursuant to section 2 of that act: Provided, however, That the phrase \u2018cause of action\u2019 in section 3 of that act shall not refer to civil proceedings brought pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section.\u201d\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 911(g) (1973) (footnotes omitted). Nowhere does subsection (g) say that the Immunity Act applies \u201conly\u201d to civil proceedings. A reasonable construction of subsection (g) is that it was intended to ensure that the Immunity Act extended to civil proceedings under the Corrupt Organizations Act, not that it was intended to limit the use of immunity in criminal proceedings. In enacting the Corrupt Organizations Act, the Legislature made it clear that it perceived organized crime as a serious threat to the Commonwealth. Subsection (a) of the Act provides:\nThe General Assembly finds that:\n(1) organized crime is a highly sophisticated, diversified, and widespread phenomenon which annually drains billions of dollars from the national economy by various patterns of unlawful conduct including the illegal use of force, fraud, and corruption;\n(2) organized crime exists on a large scale within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, engaging in the same patterns of unlawful conduct which characterize its activities nationally;\n(3) the vast amounts of money and power accumulated by organized crime are increasingly used to infiltrate and corrupt legitimate businesses operating within the Commonwealth, together with all of the techniques of violence, intimidation, and other forms of unlawful conduct through which such money and power are derived;\n(4) in furtherance of such infiltration and corruption, organized crime utilizes and applies to its unlawful purposes laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania conferring and relating to the privilege of engaging in various types of business and designed to insure that such businesses are conducted in furtherance of the public interest and the general economic welfare of the Commonwealth;\n(5) such infiltration and corruption provide an outlet for illegally obtained capital, harm innocent investors, entrepreneurs, merchants and consumers, interfere with free competition, and thereby constitute a substantial danger to the economic and general welfare of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and\n(6) in order to successfully resist and eliminate this situation, it is necessary to provide new remedies and procedures.\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 911(a). Similar considerations also contributed to the enactment of the Immunity Act. Given these legislative purposes, this Court should not construe subsection (g) of the Corrupt Organizations Act as a limitation on the Attorney General\u2019s power to use the Immunity Act in the prosecution of organized crime and racketeering. Certainly it is inappropriate to do so in this case, which does not involve a criminal prosecution under the Corrupt Organizations Act. By its unfortunate dictum, the majority has erected yet another barrier to the prosecution of individuals involved in organized crime and racketeering.\n. In In re Falone, this Court stated: \u201cSection 6 defines \u2018organized crime or racketeering\u2019 to include \u2018bribery or extortion.\u2019 \u201d 464 Pa. 42, 54, 346 A.2d 9, 16 (1975). In dissent, Mr. Justice Nix stated that the majority found \u201cthat conspiracy modified only the substantive crime of murder\u201d and that the majority supported this finding by reasoning \u201cthat the legislature intended to grant immunity when the substantive crimes of bribery and narcotics offenses were committed.\u201d Id. at 64, 346 A.2d at 21.\n. If anything, the danger of the state intruding into the affairs of the individual is at its greatest in conspiracy prosecutions. As an inchoate crime requiring little or nothing in the way of an overt act, \u201cconspiracy prescribes punishment for little more than state of mind.\u201d Filvaroff, Conspiracy and the First Amendment, 121 U.Pa.L.Rev. 189, 195 (1972).\nSimilarly, an investigating grand jury is much more likely to intrude into the affairs of the individual than an indicting grand jury because the scope of its inquiry is much less restricted. When testimony is presented before an indicting grand jury, it is for the purpose of determining whether there is a basis for indictment of a particular suspect against whom a criminal complaint has already been filed. When a witness is called before an investigating grand jury, on the other hand, he may be subjected to a much wider range of questioning, because the investigating grand jury is charged with uncovering possible criminal violations.\n. In sharp contrast with the majority\u2019s decision today is People v. Superior Court (Kaufman), 12 Cal.3d 421, 115 Cal.Rptr. 812, 525 P.2d 716 (1974). In that case, the California Supreme Court held that a court has the power to grant immunity despite the absence of any specific legislative authorization. Recognizing that the grant of immunity leaves the privilege against self-incrimination inviolate, the court authorized a grant of immunity where it would further enforcement of the state\u2019s consumer protection laws.",
