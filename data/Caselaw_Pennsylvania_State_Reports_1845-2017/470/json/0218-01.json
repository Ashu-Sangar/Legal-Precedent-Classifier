Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) and (b) they were involuntary; and (2) the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict of voluntary manslaughter.\nHis first claim has been waived because it was not raised in written post-trial motions. Commonwealth v. Blair, 460 Pa. 31, 331 A.2d 213 (1975). The record demonstrates that the second claim is without merit. Therefore, I agree that judgment of sentence should be affirmed.",
