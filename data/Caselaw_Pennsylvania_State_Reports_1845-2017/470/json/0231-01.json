Post-verdict motions, alleging that the jury\u2019s verdict was not supported by the \u201cweight and sufficiency\u201d of the evidence, were filed and denied, appellant was sentenced to six to twenty years imprisonment, and this appeal followed.\nAppellant argues here that, for various reasons, he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial. Our review of the circumstances of this case convinces us that trial counsel\u2019s stewardship of appellant\u2019s trial had a reasonable basis designed to effectuate appellant\u2019s interest, and was therefore not ineffective. See Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A.2d 349 (1967).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.",
