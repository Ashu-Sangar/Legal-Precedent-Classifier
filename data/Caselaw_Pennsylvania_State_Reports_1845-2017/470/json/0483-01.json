        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPOMEROY, Justice.\nIn March 1967, Edith June Stanley, the decedent, made her will in which she named Cliftos J. Minggia executor of her will and sole beneficiary of her estate. Following the decedent\u2019s death in 1972, a caveat to the probate of this will was filed by decedent\u2019s daughter, Jewell Francis, the appellant herein, averring, inter alia,, lack of testamentary capacity and the exertion of undue influence. A hearing was held before the Register of Wills of Philadelphia County, and on April 26, 1973, a decree was entered dismissing the caveat and granting letters testamentary to Cliftos J. Minggia.\nAppellant then appealed the Register\u2019s decree to the orphans\u2019 court division of the court of common pleas, where hearing was listed for January 13, 1975. On that date the contestant was present, but her counsel was not. The court refused to continue the matter, and the proponent, Minggia, presented testimony in support of the validity of the will; the contestant declined to offer any evidence or to participate in the hearing. Later the same day counsel for both parties met in chambers with the orphans\u2019 court judge at which time, according to the opinion later filed by the court in support of the decree appealed from it was agreed that appellant\u2019s case would rest upon the testimony of the psychiatric witness which Jewell Francis had previously presented to the Register of Wills. Thereafter, on February 27, 1975, the court entered a decree dismissing the appeal from probate, and this appeal followed.\nWe are met at the threshold with a motion by appellee to quash the appeal for contestant\u2019s failure to file exceptions to the decree of the orphans\u2019 court within the fifteen days authorized by the rules of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. In Sniderman\u2019s Estate, 450 Pa. 138, 299 A.2d 207 (1973), we stated:\n\u201cThe Orphans\u2019 Court Act [now the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, Sections 725 and 792] defines as not final (and hence not appealable) an order or decree from which exceptions are authorized by rule of court. The rules prescribed by this Court leave the matter of exceptions to local court rules, and the rules of the lower court which heard this case clearly authorize exceptions from these orders. None having been taken, the appeals must be quashed.\u201d Id. at 137, 299 A.2d at 209. (Emphasis in original).\nSee also, Estate of Strunk, 467 Pa. 213, 355 A.2d 587 (1976). We cannot agree, however, that quashing the appeal is the appropriate disposition in this case, for the local rules in Philadelphia County provide that the decree of the orphans\u2019 court must become final:\n\u201c[O]rders and decrees of a Hearing Judge entered upon appeal . . . from the Register shall become absolute as of course, unless written exceptions thereto are filed with the clerk within fifteen days from the entry thereof.\u201d Phila.O.C.Div.Rule 77.1(a) (Emphasis added).\nThe situation here presented is thus similar to that in Estate of Rothermel, 461 Pa. 1, 334 A.2d 603 (1975), wherein we declined to grant a motion to quash an appeal from an orphans\u2019 court decree which itself provided that it would become final at the expiration of ten days.\nWhile we conclude that the decree below entered February 27, 1975, is thus an appealable final order, we nonetheless do not reach any of appellant\u2019s several assignments of error. Since no exceptions were taken, no issues were properly preserved for our review. Rothermel, Id.; Estate of Banes, 461 Pa. 203, 336 A.2d 248 (1975); Sup.Ct.O.C. Rules \u00a7 3, Rule 1; Pa.R.C.P. 1518; cf. Estate of Miller, 467 Pa. 193, 355 A.2d 577, 579 n. 3 (1976) .\nMotion to quash the appeal denied and decree affirmed ; costs on appellant.\n. The appeal was originally filed in the Superior Court; on May 1, 1975, that court transferred the appeal to our Court. See Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.503(c) (Supp. 1976-77).",
