Appellant raised this issue at trial in the form of an oral motion to quash the indictments. The trial court denied the motion because appellant did not challenge the transfer in a written pretrial motion in compliance with Rules 304 and 305 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure. In disposing of appellant’s post-trial motions, the court en banc held that “The failure to <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>raise this issue in writing prior to trial acted as an effective waiver of the right to challenge the certification at the time of trial. It is for these reasons that the oral motion was dismissed at that time and is found to be without merit in this subsequent written motion.” While we agree that the challenge to the transfer should have been made by means of a written pre-trial motion, we believe that in light of appellant’s objection to the propriety of the transfer made at the transfer hearing itself, made again at the preliminary hearing, renewed at the commencement of trial and again in post-trial motions, he has adequately preserved the issue for appellate review.</p>

He claims that the transfer of these charges to the criminal division is governed by Sec. 28(a)(4) of the Juvenile Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">6</a> which section requires as a condition of transfer that the Commonwealth make out a “prima facie case that the child committed the delinquent act alleged” and demonstrate “that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the child is not amenable to treatment, supervi<a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>sion or rehabilitation as a juvenile through available facilities.” Appellant then asserts that at the transfer hearing the Commonwealth failed to make out such a prima facie showing, with the result that the transfer of the robbery and conspiracy charges was improper.

The argument ignores the fact that he was charged not merely with robbery and conspiracy, but with murder as well. The Juvenile Act makes a clear distinction between juveniles charged with murder and those charged with delinquencies of a lesser nature.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">7</a> The robbery and conspiracy charges here involved, although initially brought in the juvenile division, were the underlying felonies of the felony murder charge simultaneously initiated in the criminal division. We have held that in cases charging a juvenile with murder, the criminal division has original and exclusive jurisdiction over the offense, and the burden is on the juvenile “to show that he does not belong in the criminal court.” <em>Commonwealth v. Pyle, </em><a href="/pa/462/0613-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="462 Pa. 613" data-case-ids="485197" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0613-01">462 Pa. 613</a>, 622, <a href="/pa/462/0613-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="462 Pa. 613" data-case-ids="485197" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0613-01">342 A.2d 101</a>, 106 (1975). In the case at bar, the charges brought against Keefer in the juvenile division were part and parcel of a felony murder charge properly within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the criminal division. Indeed, the record and briefs of the parties clearly demonstrate that the judge at the <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>transfer hearing knew that a murder was alleged to have arisen out of the offenses before him. Thus, this is not a case where the juvenile petition merely alleges conduct which if proved, would constitute acts of delinquency over which the juvenile division has original jurisdiction. It is, rather, a case where the delinquencies charged in the juvenile petition constitute an integral part of the one offense over which the juvenile court, in the first instance, had no jurisdiction whatsoever. In this situation the hearing judge was correct in transferring the underlying felonies to the criminal side of the court of common pleas.</p>

Post-trial motions were timely filed on July 22, 1974, but at "the same time leave was granted Keefer to file additional specific grounds in support of his written motions once the transcript was completed. The trial transcript became available on September 9, 1974, and from that date until May 16, 1975, when appellant’s original post-trial motions were denied by the court en banc, appellant submitted no supplemental grounds. In fact, the record indicates that appellant took no action until October 3, 1975, the date of sentencing, at which time he presented the sentencing judge with a petition entitled “Petition for Allowance to Submit an Additional Argument to the Court En Banc” raising the Fifth Amendment issue. This petition stated that defense counsel believed the trial court would hear oral argument on the post-trial motions and that he intended to raise this issue at that time. The sentencing judge denied appellant’s petition.</p>

Appellant also seeks review of two issues concerning the propriety of the preliminary hearing on the criminal homicide charge. Appellant did not raise these issues in his original written post-trial motions nor did he attempt to have them considered following the denial of post-trial motions. We have held repeatedly that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered. <em>Comonwealth </em>v. <em>Agie, </em><a href="/pa/449/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="449 Pa. 187" data-case-ids="1945676" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0187-01">449 Pa. 187</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20741" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="296 A.2d 741">296 A.2d 741</a> (1972).</p>
