Cercone, Judge of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania. Our resolution of this question will determine the time in which Judge Cercone may file his declaration of candidacy for retention pursuant to Article V, Section 15(b), of the Pennsylvania Constitution and set the date on which he must run, if he should choose to do so, for retention election.</p>

He has been serving as a Judge of the Superior Court since that time. Article V, Section 15(a), of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides in part that “[t]he regular term of office of justices and judges shall be ten years . . .” and were it not for a change wrought by the new Judiciary Article, Article V of the Pennsylvania Constitution, adopted in 1968, Judge Cercone could run for reelection in 1978 for a term commencing on the first Monday of January 1979. Section 13(a) of the new Judiciary Article, however, affected the election process by requiring that all judges be elected at municipal elections which, pursuant to Article VII, Section 3, of the Pennsylvania Constitution, are strictly held in odd-numbered years. For judges who were elected previously in even-numbered years this constitutional change created problems which were recognized by the framers of the new Judiciary Article. To allow for a smooth transition from the former to the present judicial system, Section 2 of the Schedule to Article V provides for the extension of judgeships which would naturally “expire on the first Monday of January in an odd-numbered year” to “the even-numbered year next following.” Thus, a judge elected under the old Constitution may comply with the Constitution and run for retention election “at the <em>municipal election </em>immediately preceding the expiration of the term of office . . . .” Pa.Const. art. 5, § 15(b) (emphasis supplied).</p>

It comports with the clear intent of the framers to eliminate the chaos and confusion which would otherwise result in the transition from the old judicial system to a new system requiring all judges to be elected at municipal elections held in odd-numbered years. It would contravene Article V, § 13(a), and Article VII, § 3, of the Pennsylvania Constitution to conduct the retention election in the even-numbered year of 1978.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Running for retention in the municipal election of 1977 is an equally untenable solution. Retention of Judge Cercone in 1977 would apply to a term commencing some fourteen months later in January of 1979. This extended hiatus between election and assumption of office is contrary to the public policy of Pennsylvania. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Barratt v.

Under this rationale, Judge Cercone is therefore included because his “term” commenced when he took his oath of office on January 6, 1969. On the other hand, the dissenting Justice concludes that “present terms” should be restricted to terms that commenced prior to the effective date of the amendments. Judge Cercone therefore would not be included because his oath was administered five days after the amendments became effective. I am unable to accept either of these interpretations.</p>

The 1968 Judiciary Amendment was obviously intended to enhance the quality and the efficiency of the judiciary of this Commonwealth, and one of the cardinal tenets of this new philosophy was expressed in the concept of the retention election. Retention was seen as a vehicle which would insulate the jurist from political and other outside influences by eliminating the necessity of a partisan election if the judge decided to seek another term in office. A vacancy occurs at the end of the term only if the incumbent jurist elects not to seek the succeeding term or is rejected by the voters in the retention election. <em>See </em>Pa.Const. art. V, § 15(b) (1968). Thus, it was the incompatibility of the retention concept as applied to the terms of Judges of the Superior Court, who took office under the former constitutional provision, with the new requirement that judges be elected in odd-numbered years, which occasioned the necessity of Section 2 of the Schedule to Article V.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_8" id="ref_footnote_2_8">8</a>

Even though Judge Cercone did not take his oath of office until January 6, 1969, his entitlement to the judgeship in question and his term of office became fixed, pursuant to the 1874 Constitution, on November 5, 1968, the day that he was elected.

Since there could be no election in 1912 for a term ending in 1913, the Court found that a vacancy would occur which would be filled by gubernatorial appointment. However, the Constitution at that time did not include provision for reelection by retention. The Court in <em>McAfee </em>merely removed whatever advantage exists for an incumbent seeking reelection in a competitive election. Today, however, a judge has the right to stand for reelection by retention. The retention system established by the new Judiciary Article supplies a reason to permit an election in an even-numbered year which was not present at the time <em>McAfee </em>was decided.</p>
