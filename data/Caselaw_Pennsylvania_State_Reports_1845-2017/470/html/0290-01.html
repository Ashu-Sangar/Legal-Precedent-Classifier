Jeffrey’s sister, Christine Denise Spriggs, now eleven years old and in the custody of the father, was born on September 13, 1965. Jeffrey was born on September 1, 1967. Jeffrey’s mother, now Mrs. Carson and appellee herein, was stricken in 1968 with a severe mental depressive condition which caused her on several occasions to threaten to take her life. As a result, in February 1970, the parties separated and the children remained with the father while the mother freely visited them. This arrangement, in view of the mother’s debilitating illness and financial situation was conceded by both parties to be in the best interests of the children. The parties were divorced in June 1970, and in February 1971, Mrs. Carson married her present husband.</p>

On March 9, 1971, the father forcibly took the children from the mother and drove with them to Florida, where he resided with the children in his parents’ home. In May 1971, after learning of the children’s whereabouts, the mother went to Florida and instituted custody proceedings. A hearing attended by all parties was held before the Florida Court on February 1, 1972, and the judge issued a temporary order awarding custody to the father. The order contained a provision granting liberal visitation rights to the mother while she was in Florida and in Pennsylvania over the summer. The order further provided for a final hearing after the summer visitation.</p>

    <p id="b336-5" data-blocks='[["BL_336.5",336,[239,981,1155,920]]]'>It should first be noted that while the hearing judge did express concern over the mother’s activities occurring prior to the date of the hearing, it is clear that the crux of his analysis was in fact directed to the overall fitness of the contending parents at the time of the hearing. There was ample testimony to support the finding that either parent was fully capable of providing for the child’s physical well-being. Indeed, the hearing judge stated that “the father impressed us as a quiet, sincere person, who is deeply attached to his children and interested in their well-being. He also can offer this child all of the physical advantages.” As to the mother, the trial judge noted that “she is intelligent, enormously concerned with the welfare of this child, and presently able to provide fully for his daily care and well-being.” There is no dispute therefore on the basis of the testimony that both parents were fit to have custody.</p>
    <p id="b336-6" data-blocks='[["BL_336.6",336,[236,1932,1154,261]]]'>The decision of the hearing judge thus depended largely upon a determination of the character and weight to be afforded the testimony offered by the competing parents. In this respect, we quote extensively from the trial judge’s opinion as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b336-7" data-blocks='[["BL_336.7",336,[283,2223,1108,153]],["BL_337.1",337,[242,273,1112,2040]],["BL_338.1",338,[288,273,1120,1110]]]'>The most disturbing factor affecting an award of custody to the mother is our conclusion, as testimony developed, that this mother would do anything and say <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>anything to gain custody. To some this may be construed as evidence of all-conquering love. To this Court, it indicates amorality. We are convinced that the Respondent has been less than candid in many respects. Our first indication was her reaction to the Florida proceeding. When recounting it in Court, she purported to break down and sob at the very recollection of a horrible one-sided kangaroo proceeding. As we read the record, the Florida Court took an entire day in an effort to work out a constructive and temporary solution. The Judge heard a number of witnesses, including three called by Respondent’s counsel. He obviously reached the conclusion that whatever the cause, a severe rupture in the relationship between the mother and her two children had occurred. In what appears to us to be an effort to restore that relationship, and probably to then award custody of one or both children to the mother the Judge adopted a temporary approach insisting upon abundant visitation. Remembering that the Respondent is intelligent, we are forced to conclude that she is emotionally unsound on this subject, or is deliberately misrepresenting the situation in an attempt to justify her conduct in abducting and hiding the child. Another example is her testimony that visitation with the daughter went smoothly, and that there was no indication that the child was upset until the mother stated that it was time to take her home. All parties agreed that the mother brought the daughter home early. Since she had not seen the child for a long time, had to do a great deal of driving, and had only obtained the child a few hours before such return, this early return suggests that the testimony of the father and paternal grandmother more accurately reflected the facts. Along this line, we believe the paternal grandmother when she testified that the mother understood Christine’s reluctance to go with her the following day, <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>and that, she did not vigorously press for visitation. The mother would have us believe that she took her son and fled out of frustration over her inability to visit her daughter, and that she did not believe that the Florida Court could or would do anything about this. This is hard to believe, given the attitude of the Florida Judge when he established such visitation the preceding day. A final example is the testimony of the mother on cross-examination that she was receiving benefits from Social Security for total physical disability, which contradicted her prior testimony as to her physical fitness. We note in this regard that she had not advised either doctor that she called before this Court of any such disability. Perhaps more important than the significance of this contradiction was the effect that it had upon the Respondent in Court. She changed from a confident, alert witness, adroitly fencing with opposing counsel to a highly distressed state, consistent with Dr. Pandelidis’ description of a “colitis person”.</blockquote>
