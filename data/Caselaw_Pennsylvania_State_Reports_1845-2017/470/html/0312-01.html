Appellants’ argument is based on Equal Protection and Due Process rights which were announced years before appellants’ prior proceedings, and are by no means “novel.” The fact that appellants claim may arise in a novel factual situation, even though grounded in accepted principles of constitutional law does not nullify their waiver of their right to now raise the constitutional issues. Appellants do not contend that subsequent to their prior proceedings, a newly announced appellate decision has <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>been handed down which entitles them to relief.

All of the facts and legal precedents necessary to construct and argue this claim were as available at the time of appellant’s direct appeal as they are now. So long as counsel in her prior appeal was constitutionally effective, the fact that her present counsel may perhaps be more imaginative in constructing allegations of trial error is of no moment. To excuse an otherwise effective waiver of a claim on the sole ground that the claim arises from a novel factual setting is contrary to the significant policies of finality clearly embedded in Sections 3 and 4 of the Post-Conviction Hearing Act and the cases cited supra.”</blockquote>
