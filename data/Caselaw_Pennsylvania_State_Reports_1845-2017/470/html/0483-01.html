    <p id="b525-6" data-blocks='[["BL_525.8",525,[191,699,1152,592]]]'>In March 1967, Edith June Stanley, the decedent, made her will in which she named Cliftos J. Minggia executor of her will and sole beneficiary of her estate. Following the decedent’s death in 1972, a caveat to the probate of this will was filed by decedent’s daughter, Jewell Francis, the appellant herein, averring, <em>inter alia,, </em>lack of testamentary capacity and the exertion of undue influence. A hearing was held before the Register of Wills of Philadelphia County, and on April 26, 1973, a decree was entered dismissing the caveat and granting letters testamentary to Cliftos J. Minggia.</p>
    <p id="b525-7" data-blocks='[["BL_525.9",525,[190,1308,1153,918]]]'>Appellant then appealed the Register’s decree to the orphans’ court division of the court of common pleas, where hearing was listed for January 13, 1975. On that date the contestant was present, but her counsel was not. The court refused to continue the matter, and the proponent, Minggia, presented testimony in support of the validity of the will; the contestant declined to offer any evidence or to participate in the hearing. Later the same day counsel for both parties met in chambers with the orphans’ court judge at which time, according to the opinion later filed by the court in support of the decree appealed from it was agreed that appellant’s case would rest upon the testimony of the psychiatric witness which Jewell Francis had previously presented to the Register of Wills. Thereafter, on February 27, 1975, the court entered a decree dismissing the appeal from probate, and this appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
