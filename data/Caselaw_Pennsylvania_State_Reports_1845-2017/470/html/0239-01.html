    <p id="b281-6" data-blocks='[["BL_281.6",281,[172,739,1151,1348]]]'>Claimant-appellant, Joseph Bartosevich (claimant) was injured on August 21, 1967, while working for Ira Berger &amp; Sons (appellee). The parties entered into a compensation agreement for total disability payments of $52.50 per week. On February 19, 1969, appellee filed a termination petition which alleged that claimant was able to return to work on December 1, 1968. On October 8, 1971, a referee granted the termination petition, finding that, although appellant remained disabled, his disability was not causally related to the accident of August 21, 1967. Claimant appealed and the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (the board) vacated the referee’s findings and remanded the case for appointment of an impartial medical expert. Upon rehearing, a different referee denied the termination petition, and the board affirmed. Two impartial medical experts testified that claimant was totally disabled. The disability was due to “conversion neurosis caused by the mismanagement or improper treatment of [the claimant] by [a chiropractor], who was selected by the claimant himself.” Since there was no evidence that the claimant was either malingering or acting in bad faith when he sought treatment for the initial injury, the board held that the continuation of the disability was a direct result of the initial injury.</p>

To make it a little clearer, for example, if an individual has a little heart attack and the doctor insists on seeing this patient two or three times a week and tells him to take it easy and be careful of your diet and over emphasizes the damage that is done, the patient frequently soon will develop a secondary illness which would be a psychiatric one. In other words, over concern about his illness which then would be termed an iatrogenic. Genic meaning caused by and the iatro means from treatment.”</blockquote>

By the same token, if the subsequent exploratory or diagnostic procedure discloses that the symptoms stem from some cause unrelated to the accident, it would seem that the exploratory operation and any damages caused by the operation should be attributed to the condition which produced the symptoms, even though the parties may originally have thought that the symptoms were produced by the accident. </em>But if a claimant genuinely experiences symptoms after an accident which were not present before the accident, and if his doctor in good faith performs a [procedure] to determine the cause of the symptoms, and the [treatment] causes disability, the disability is compensable even though the [treatment] does not affirmatively establish that the symptoms were due to the original accident.
