At 2:25 a. m., prior to any questioning by police, appellant was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. He “waived” his constitutional rights, and admitted involvement in the robbery-slaying of Selez. His statement was reduced to writing by 3:23 a. m. At this point, the police called appellant’s parents, who were taken by the police to see their son. The parents arrived at 3:53 a. m., and were told that appellant had been given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Appellant was allowed to talk to his parents alone and at 4:45 a. m. told police he wished to give a formal statement. The formal statement, which did not vary in substance from the original confession, was completed at 8:20 a. m.</p>
