    <p id="b390-5" data-blocks='[["BL_390.5",390,[267,911,1160,1448]]]'>On September 5, 1973, a warrant for Boyle’s arrest for the killing of the Yablonskis was issued by the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County. On September 6, 1973, Boyle was indicted by a federal grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania for violating the civil rights of the Yablonskis. On the same day, Boyle was arrested in Washington, D.C. by federal authorities in connection with the federal charges. Following a hearing before a United States magistrate in Washington, D. C., Boyle was released on $50,000 bond, and a hearing to determine whether he should be ordered removed to Pennsylvania to face the federal charges was scheduled for September 25, 1973. On September 24, 1973, Boyle was hospitalized after apparently having taken an overdose of barbiturates. Boyle remained hospitalized until December 19, 1973. The removal hearing was postponed until September 28, 1973, at which time the United States magistrate revoked Boyle’s bond and ordered Boyle to undergo psychiatric examinations. Another hearing was held in Washington, D.C. before the United States magistrate on October 1, 1973, and on October 2, 1973, Boyle’s bond was “temporarily suspended” because of Boyle’s condition and because of the possibility of another suicide attempt. Further, federal officials were directed to guard Boyle; that is, Boyle was placed in protective custody.</p>

The record does not establish that any attorney had filed a praecipe for appearance in any court of this Commonwealth prior to the presentment being made; nor does it establish that any attorney was authorized to accept notice for Boyle of any proceedings in a court of this Commonwealth. Further, Boyle was in federal custody at the time of “notice” and we cannot say as a matter of law that he was free to appear even if we assume the “notice” was sufficient.

The Commonwealth had established that two loans were made by the International Union to District 19 and that funds from these loans were used to finance the slayings. The Commonwealth had further established that the requests for the loans had been sent directly to Boyle by Pass and that normally such requests were sent to the secretary-treasurer of the International. Thus, the fact that loans were made by the International to District 19 or other districts was irrelevant because it would not discount the inference that the two loans involved herein were unusual because the requests for them had been sent directly to Boyle.</p>

Counsel did not represent that the audit would, in fact, show irregularities with regard to the District 19 finances; rather, he stated he believed the audit would show such irregularities. He did so because the federal government refused to allow the audit to be examined until Kane actually took the stand at trial. But counsel had subpoenaed the audit for trial. Furthermore, the Commonwealth did not object to the offer on the basis that the audit would not show what counsel represented, as his belief, it would show, and the court ruled on the officer as if the audit would, in fact, show irregularities in District 19’s finances.

Of course, to be admissible the audit showing the irregularities of District 19’s finances would have to provide a basis from which the jury could have inferred the officials of District 19 had a motive for the slaying independent of any Boyle may have shared in order to provide a basis from which to further infer Boyle was innocent. <em>Commonwealth v.

But the Commonwealth does not assert that Boyle was in any way connected with the irregularities in District 19’s finances other than his involvement with the two loans used to finance the slaying involved herein, and his involvement with those loans was a triable issue of fact in this case. Thus, if the jury believed the evidence showing irregularities, it may have then inferred that Boyle did not share this motive and that would have clearly militated against accepting the motive on the part of Boyle established by the Commonwealth.</p>
