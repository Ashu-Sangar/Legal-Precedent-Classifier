Finally, in resolving the issue, since the suppression court concluded the consent to be voluntarily given, we must consider the Commonwealth’s evidence and so much evidence presented by Smith as remains uncontradicted, <em>Commonwealth v.

While there she was questioned numerous times after having been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. And while one officer testified that she was free to leave at any time she wished, he did not contradict her testimony which established that she was locked in a room during the time she was at the Police Administration Building before she affirmatively indicated her consent. Under such circumstances, we must consider the effectiveness of the consent as if given while in custody.</p>

Finally, while the search involved was not actually conducted until July 7, 1971, and Vernita was not in custody at the time of the search and cooperated fully with the police conducting the search, it is apparent from the record that she was merely acquiescing in police directives at the time and nothing in the record shows any affirmative indication of consent other than that obtained on July 3, 1971.
