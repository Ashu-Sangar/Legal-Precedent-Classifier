In May, 1974, he moved with a “girl friend,” one Pat McDanel, to Columbus, Ohio, where the two lived in a house trailer.

He appeared in court without counsel and, on May 29, 1975, he was adjudged guilty of contempt and committed to jail until such time as he should purge himself by paying $500 on the arrearages in each case. Subsequently, counsel supplied by Neighborhood Legal Services entered an appearance on his behalf and petitioned the court to revoke the contempt orders. On June 6, the court did so, and Barrett was released from prison when Ms. McDanel posted an appearance bond for him in the sum of $1,000. On June 19, a rule to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for willfully violating the support orders was issued on Barrett. After a hearing on July 3, the court determined that probable cause to issue an attachment existed and doubled the bond requirement; when this requirement was not met, Barrett was recommitted to prison. On August 4, an evidentiary hearing was held after which, in an opinion and orders dated August 20, 1975, the court again found Barrett in contempt and ordered him imprisoned until he should pay a total of $500 in arrearages and post compliance bonds amounting to $500.

He raises two issues for our consideration: (1) whether an indigent person who in the past willfully disobeyed support orders may now be imprisoned for civil contempt when he cannot purge himself of contempt due to his indigency, and (2) whether it is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution to imprison an indigent for civil contempt, his release conditional upon financial criteria, when the indigent has no economic means of complying with the court’s order.

In determining whether a contempt proceeding is criminal or civil, a court must look to whether its dominant purpose is to punish for the violation of a court order or to coerce the contemnor into compliance with the order. It is well-settled that where the dominant purpose of the contempt proceeding is to aid a private litigant or interest rather than to vindicate the authority of the court or to protect the public interest, the contempt is civil. <em>Woods v.

Accordingly, the trial court, after finding Barrett in contempt of its orders of sup port, imposed conditional sentences of imprisonment in order to coerce him into compensating his children for the arrearages accumulated in the past and providing the support due them in the future.

      <em>Travitzky </em>also held that a second wife has no duty to support her husband’s children by his first wife; <em>a fortiori </em>this would be true of Ms. McDanel, who also had no duty to support Barrett.

The Pennsylvania Constitution provides that: “The person of a debtor, where there is not strong presumption of fraud, shall not be continued in prison after delivering up his estate for the benefit of his creditors in such manner as shall be prescribed by law.” Constitution, Article I, Section 16. A money judgment resulting from a support order should, in my opinion, be treated as any other money judgment. If the defendant has assets against which such a money judgment can be enforced, the plaintiff may proceed as in any enforcement action, See generally Pa.R.C.P. Rule 8101, et seq. Therefore, unless the non-support defendant wilfully conceals assets in order to avoid execution of the money judgment, he or she should not be subjected to the sanction of imprisonment.
