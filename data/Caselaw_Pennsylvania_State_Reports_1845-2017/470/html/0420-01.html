The legislature has specifically provided that “[t]he title and preamble of a statute may be considered in the construction thereof.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> In the title to the Act, it is clear that the Act is intended to apply only in proceedings before “certain” grand juries.

Moreover, the entire thrust of the Act compels the conclusion that it is primarily intended to assist in the <em>investigation </em>of organized crime and racketeering. Such investigations are undertaken not by a regular, indicting grand jury, which functions only to receive complaints and approve indictments, but by a special grand jury convened under a mandate to procure information and make recommendations, or a regular grand jury <em>specially charged </em>by a ju<a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>•dicial authority to investigate a specifically delineated type of widespread criminal activity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

We also preserve the delicate balance between the competing rights of the individual and society, by excluding the power to immunize from the arsenal of the prosecutor in his efforts to secure convictions of particular individuals. It is therefore clear that it is only the latter two categories of “spe<a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>cial” grand juries to which the Immunity Act was intended to apply, and the record adequately demonstrates that the Bucks County Grand Jury in the instant case was not clothed with special investigative authority.</p>

This language clearly demonstrates that the Act is intended to be operative only to aid an “investigation”, such as that undertaken by the two types of investigating grand juries delineated above. The legislature obviously did not intend to confer upon the Attorney General the power to immunize witnesses in all grand jury proceedings; such unlimited authority would undoubtedly subvert the fine balance between the rights protected by the Fifth Amendment and the power of the government to obtain testimony.

Therefore, the application to the Immunity Act of the definition of “racketeering activity” set forth in the Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 would artificially broaden the Immunity Act’s scope far beyond that provided by its express language.

Indeed, the civil — criminal distinction in the Corrupt Organizations Act would have been unnecessary if the legislature had vested the Attorney General with the power to petition for an immunity award in all proceedings. In light of these considerations, it is clear that any effort to define the language of the Immunity Act by reference to the Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 would be inappropriate and beyond the bounds of reasonable judicial construction. An accurate interpretation of the Immunity Act requires that we confine our examination to the express language employed by the legislature in that enactment alone, and that language clearly requires that a conspiracy be alleged before authority to grant immunity under the Act is conferred.</p>

Upon consideration in the House, this provision was amended, with Senate concurrence, to strike out “any proceeding” and replace in its stead the phrase “a proceeding relating to organized crime or racketeering.” The purpose of the amendment, according to its author, Representative Caputo, was to “provide certain safeguards to the citizens of this Commonwealth.” Pa.Leg.J.

I make the assumption because the appellants have raised no issue concerning the constitutionality of the Act. Under the Immunity Act ancient modes of extracting statements from people are replaced with coercion by incarceration. A witness testifying against an accused to avoid incarceration presents the same potential for perjury as a witness whose testimony is secured by use of the rack, the turning of the screw, or the payment of a monetary bribe. Using this kind of testimony to convict an accused raises serious due process questions.

The prosecution began with the filing of a criminal complaint, in August 1972, charging that Warren Brady and Henry George, Bensalem Township supervisors, had committed “extortion, prohibited acts by public officers, and conspiracy.” Specifically, the complaint alleged that the two supervisors had extorted money and property from two construction contractors, Joseph D’Egidio and John Camerlengo, in return for subdivision-approvals and zoning changes. The conspiracy charges were dropped after a preliminary hearing, but the Commonwealth made out a prima facie case on the other charges. When these charges were presented before an indicting grand jury, D’Egidio and Camerlengo invoked the privilege against self-incrimination and refused to testify.

On the contrary, a textual analysis of the section yields the conclusion that the words “conspiracy to commit” modify only the following word: “murder.” The arrangement of the words provides no indication that the phrase “conspiracy to commit” modifies every word that follows. It requires a strained construction to conclude that the eleven crimes listed, which are connected by four conjunctions, are all modified by the phrase “conspiracy to commit.” By contrast, the words “shall include,” are words which normally serve to alert the reader that a list follows. Thus, the natural arrangement of the words in Section 6 indicates that the list of crimes which constitute organized crime or racketeering begins after the words “shall include, but not be limited to,” and that “conspiracy to commit,” modifies only “murder.”</p>

If the phrase “conspiracy to commit” modifies all the crimes listed in Section 6, this would mean that a petition for a grant of immunity must allege a single conspiracy having the objectives of murder, prostitution, usury, subornation of perjury, and at least four other crimes.

The Legislature specifically addressed itself to the problem of organized crime. Of the substantive crimes listed in Section 6 of the Act, only murder can be performed by an individual acting by himself. All of the others require two or more persons for the substantive violation to be consummated. A murder committed by an individual acting completely by himself is simply not a proper case to be investigated by the use of grants of immunity. The only person who could claim immunity with regard to the murder under investigation would be the killer.

In the typical case, such racketeering is merely one link in a pernicious chain which shackles honest men both private and public. This link must be broken if the legislature and the courts hope to prevent further erosion of the trust that the governed must have in their government.

The distinction between a grand jury investigation and a civil proceeding pursuant to the Corrupt Organizations Act, relates only to the kind of proceeding in which the witness testifies, not to the possibility of any subsequent prosecution.

This apparent contradiction, however, is no reason to ignore the Corrupt Organizations Act in construing the Immunity Act. The statutory Construction Act provides that “Statutes in pari materia shall be construed together, if possible, as one statute.” 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1932(b) (Supp.1976).
