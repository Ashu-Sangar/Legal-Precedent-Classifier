On that date the Rules and Executive Nominations Committee of the Senate convened and, at a meeting during which two bills were also considered, voted to refer the appointment of Dr. Denenberg to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote. Max Weiner, the executive director of the corporate plaintiff in this action [CEPA], attended this meeting and protested orally to the chairman of the committee, Senator Thomas M. Nolan, that the committee had failed to provide the public notice of a public meeting required by the Sunshine Law. The chairman responded that he had complied with the Sunshine Law’s requirements, and he proceeded with the meeting and the aforementioned vote. The next day, April 9, 1975, Lieutenant Governor Ernest P. Kline, in his capacity as President of the Senate, placed the matter on the Senate agenda, and Dr. Denenberg failed to receive the two-<a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>thirds vote necessary for confirmation. Subsequently, James M. Kelly, then acting chairman of the PUC, refused to recognize Dr. Denenberg as a commissioner.</p>

Plaintiffs moved for an ex parte injunction to restrain Mr. Kelly and his agents from taking any action to remove Dr. Denenberg while their <em>motion </em>for a preliminary injunction was pending. This motion was denied on the same day. On April 30, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint naming as an additional defendant the Honorable Milton J. Shapp, individually and in his capacity as Governor of Pennsylvania.</p>

Although we agree with the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion that relief cannot be granted instantly, we do conclude that section 9 of the Act, 65 P.S. § 269, which provides in pertinent part that “[t]he Commonwealth Court shall have original jurisdiction of actions involving State agencies ... to render declaratory judgments or to enforce this act, by injunction or other reme<a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>dy deemed appropriate by the court,” and that “[t]he action may be brought by any person” is inclusive enough to give appellants standing to bring the action and equity jurisdiction to hear it.

We agree, however, with the contention of appellees Nolan and Kline, not passed upon by the Commonwealth Court but reiterated on appeal, that the complaint should have been dismissed as to them because of Article II, Section 15 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which provides in pertinent part that “for any speech or debate in either House” the members of thé General Assembly “shall not be questioned in any other place.”</p>

It then concluded that the specific provisions of section 7, which do not refer to meetings considering executive nominations, prevail over the more general language of section 1. Appellants argue that the Commonwealth Court in construing the Act failed to utilize the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921 <em>et seq., </em>that a liberal construction of section 7 is thereby re<a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>quired, and that under such a construction there is no conflict between sections 1 and 7. We agree that there is no conflict between the two sections, but this is because we find that section 7 clarifies, rather than contradicts language in section 1, which, were it to stand alone, would be ambiguous. We conclude that the Sunshine Law, taken as a whole, does not support appellants’ construction of it.</p>

We agree with appellants that the non-penal provisions of the Act must be “liberally construed to effect their objects and to promote justice.” 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1928. It is clear that the object of the Sunshine Law, enacted in 1974 at a time of wide-spread public dismay over the Watergate disclosures of extensive secret corruption and abuse of power at the highest levels of the federal government, was to open the decision-making processes of Pennsylvania government to greater public scrutiny and accountability. It is also clear, however, that it was not the intention of the legislature that state agencies be required to hold <em>all </em>of their meetings in public; the Sunshine Law is entitled “An Act requiring public agencies to hold <em>certain </em>meetings and hearings open to the public and providing penalties.” [Emphasis supplied.] In order, therefore, to ascertain whether the meeting in question was covered, we must look to the language of the Act and remain mindful that “[e]very statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.” 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(a).</p>

The Statutory Construction Act states that “[p]rovisos shall be construed to limit rather than to extend the operation of the clauses to which they refer.” 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1924. In addition, it is well-settled that “[t]he Legislature cannot be deemed to intend that its language be superfluous and without import.” <em>Daly v.

Since the General Assembly was already included in “any branch” and since departments, boards, authorities, and commissions had also been mentioned previously, a second mention in the proviso would have been superfluous, were not the function of the proviso to limit the Act’s coverage of those agencies to their meetings “on official policy making business.”</p>

    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[257,1063,1152,909]]]'>The latter section, however, makes it plain that in addition to “all sessions of the House of Representatives and the Senate,” the intent of the Act was to cover “all meetings of committees where bills are considered” and “all hearings where testimony is taken.” The legislature thus recognized that the testimony taken at committee hearings and committee deliberations and reports on pending or proposed legislation are integral parts of the legislature’s policy-making function. Thus, a meeting or hearing at which a bill is considered or testimony taken is covered by the Act, even if no vote is scheduled or taken. On the other hand, a committee meeting at which an executive nomination is considered is not specifically covered by section 7. Appellants argue that even though such meetings are not specifically covered, a liberal interpretation of the Act compels us to find them within its intent. We cannot agree.</p>

In this instance, however, we think that the legislature must be deemed to have been aware of the difference between meetings at which bills are considered and meetings at which executive nominations are considered, and to have intended that the latter not be included within the scope of the Sunshine Law. We note that Senate Rule XXX treats executive nominations as separate and distinct from bills, and that section 2 of the Rule specifically provides that “[a] 11 information, communication or remarks made by a Senator when acting upon nominations in committee, concerning the character or qualifications of the person nominated, <em>shall be kept secret.” </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</p>

    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[243,513,1160,861]]]'> Appellants also argue that because section 7 of the Sunshine Law specifically excludes party caucuses from the intent of the Act, the absence of a similar specific exclusion of meetings considering executive nominations shows an intent to include such meetings. Because of our interpretation of the Act as a whole, we cannot agree.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> They further argue that even if meetings at which executive nominations alone are considered are not within the scope of the Act, at the meeting in question two bills were also considered; they thus contend that the failure to comply with the requirements of the Act at this meeting where bills were considered invalidated the formal action taken on the nomination. But since such a vote is not within the scope of the Act in any event, the fact that bills were separately considered at the same meeting is irrelevant to appellants’ complaint.</p>

Although the complaint makes it clear that the committee meeting in question was open to the public and was indeed attended by the executive director of CEPA, section 5 makes it plain that adequate notice to the public at large is an integral part of the public-meeting concept; a meeting cannot be deemed to be public merely because its doors are open to the public if the public is not properly informed of its time and place. Because of the posture of this case, we must accept as true appellants’ allegation that notice of the meeting was not provided by newspaper publication or by a posted notice in the principal office of the committee, both of which were required for public meetings by section 5.
