See, e. <em>g., Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em><a href="/pa/453/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="453 Pa. 187" data-case-ids="577587" data-case-paths="/pa/453/0187-01">453 Pa. 187</a>, 198, <a href="/citations/?q=307%20A.2d%20264" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="307 A.2d 264">307 A.2d 264</a>, 267 (1973). It is contended that one addicted to drugs is therefore in constant need of money and is thus more likely to commit a larcenous act. As recognized by the concurring members of the Superior Court, this argument does not demonstrate an intent or reason to commit a specific act charged, but merely accentuates the propensity of the accused to commit a crime of this nature. It is this general predisposition to commit crime that this principle of law was designed to eliminate. If we were to construe the “motive exception” as suggested, we would completely abrogate the principle relating to references to prior criminal misconduct.</p>

It should be noted that the nature of the improper reference is critical in a decision as to whether prompt curative instructions may be adequate. We can conceive of specific reference to prior unrelated criminal conduct which would be so offensive and prejudicial as to mandate a mistrial. In such a situation, immediate curative instructions would obviously be inadequate. <em>See e. </em>g., <em>Commonwealth v. Fortune, </em><a href="/pa/464/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="464 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="1710327" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0367-01">464 Pa. 367</a>, <a href="/pa/464/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="464 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="1710327" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0367-01">346 A.2d 783</a> (1975). Also, where it is shown that the remark was deliberately introduced by the Commonwealth, the proper remedy would be the award of a new trial.</p>
      <p id="b219-14" data-blocks='[["BL_219.3",219,[206,2212,1114,149]]]'>Here, the trial court stressed that the witness had no basis for assuming the accused’s addiction to drugs and thereby neutralized the effect of the statement. Further, we are satisfied that the comment was not intentionally elicited.</p>
