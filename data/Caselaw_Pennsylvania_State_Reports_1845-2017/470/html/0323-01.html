The prosecution contends that the delay was the “fault” of defense counsel because defense counsel was on vacation for a period of one week from February 5 to February 12, 1974, and because defense counsel was in the hospital for one week from February 13 to February 20, 1974. We first note that this two-week period was many weeks prior to the expiration of the one hundred twenty day time period. More importantly, however, it is undisput<a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>ed that the appellant’s case was not listed for trial during the above two-week period. The mere fact that an attorney would not have been able to try a case <em>if </em>the case had been listed for trial cannot serve as a justification for tolling the one hundred twenty day time period. If that were the case, the one hundred twenty day time limit would be meaningless. All the prosecution would have to do after expiration of the time limit would be to establish with hindsight that on each of the one hundred twenty days defense counsel was occupied with other matters. The whereabouts of defense counsel is immaterial <em>unless </em>the case is called to trial and the whereabouts or activities of defense counsel <em>causes </em>a delay.</p>

We must reject this argument. The Agreement provides in Article IV(c) that</p>

For this reason we cannot agree with the prosecution that a “continuance” was granted. Even if, as the prosecution’s brief intimates, court officials took it upon themselves to make certain deductions as to trial counsel’s ability to conduct a jury trial because of his hospitalization, the fact remains that neither the defense nor the prosecution ever came before the court with a request for a continuance.

It is also quite clear that the case was not scheduled for trial until after May 4, 1974. A fair reading of the entire testimony of the trial coordinator permits only one conclusion: that defense counsel’s expression of hope that the Ira Gregg case would not be called to trial0 at “a particular time” immediately after defense counsel’s release from the hospital was not a request for a delay or a continuance. The trial coordinator admitted that the case was not called to trial and defense counsel was never informed that it was being called for trial until after May 4, 1974.</p>
