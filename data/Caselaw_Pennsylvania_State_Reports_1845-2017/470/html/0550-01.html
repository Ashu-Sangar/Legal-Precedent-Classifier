Policemen and firemen have the right to select a bargaining representative, and through it to bargain collectively, but no procedure is set forth in the statute for the selection of the bargaining representative. The Act states only that “labor organizations or other representatives designated by fifty percent or more of such policemen or firemen” have the right to bargain collectively.</p>

    <p id="b595-5" data-blocks='[["BL_595.5",595,[193,1367,1156,972]]]'>The PLRA is a statute which deals extensively and in detail with the procedure for selecting bargaining representatives, with the means of preventing coercion of employees in the free exercise of their rights, and with the subject of collective bargaining in general. Act No. Ill deals also with the subject of collective bargaining, but for a limited group of public employees, and contains none of the detailed provisions for selection of a bargaining representative found in the PLRA. We are instructed by the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S. A. § 1932 (Supp.1976-77), that statutes which are <em>in pari materia </em>are to “be construed together, if possible, as one statute.” We are of opinion that the PLRA and Act No. Ill, which are both, after all, collective bargaining statutes, are <em>in pari materia </em>within the meaning of that provision. We believe, also, that it is entirely possible, and indeed salutary, within the limits delineated below, to construe the two acts together as a single statute.</p>

      <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>While Section 3(d) of the PLRA, 43 P.S. § 211.3(d), did originally when enacted in 1937 exclude public employers generally from the duty to bargain collectively with employee representatives, Act No. Ill, on the other hand, imposed a duty on the part of public employers to bargain with their police and firemen. As noted above, Act No. Ill repealed all “parts of acts inconsistent” therewith. We think it reasonable to conclude that by imposing that duty in Act No. Ill, the Legislature intended that the exclusion of public employers from the definition of “employer” in the PLRA be <em>pro tanto </em>repealed. We believe that when the Legislature spoke in Act No. Ill of “labor organizations or other representatives designated by 50 percent or more of such policemen or firemen,” it necessarily meant a labor organization designated in accordance with the provisions and procedures already established by statute and administered by the Labor Board. Our conclusion is bolstered by the further admonition contained in the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922 that the General Assembly, in enacting statutes, must be presumed not to intend results which are “absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable.” It is certainly arguable that a statute which provides for collective bargaining but which lacks procedure for designating bargaining agents and for guaranteeing freedom of employee choice in the process is “unreasonable”, if not “absurd.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Our courts of common pleas, however, do not conduct labor elections, and we can judicially notice that the various labor boards, both federal and state, do conduct secret elections through their staffs whose task it is to journey from workplace to workplace for such purpose. For employees of the courts of common pleas to conduct elections in firehouses and police barracks and stations would, in our view, be a strained, if not an “absurd”, interpretation of the legislative intent in enacting Act No. 111.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
