At trial appellant objected to several remarks made by the prosecutor during closing argument and moved for a mistrial. Appellant preserved these objections in his. post-trial motions. The prosecutor’s remarks included an attempt to disparage appellant’s trial strategy, a personal attack on appellant himself, and an appeal to. the emotions of the jury. Appellant contends that he is entitled to a new trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We agree.

They stopped at a roadside tavern to buy beer. The trip continued with three more stops during which appellant propositioned his passengers to engage in sexual acts.
