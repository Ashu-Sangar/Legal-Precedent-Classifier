On July 1, 1974, William Moore was shot while entering an all-night store in Pittsburgh. Following the shooting, Moore ran to a car, stating, “I have been shot, take me to the police.” He died as a result of two gun shot wounds. <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>Appellant was arrested on March 12, 1975.

Although weigh the alternatives we must, the balance tips in favor of a finding of effective assistance as soon as it is determined that trial counsel’s decisions had any reasonable basis.” (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>

We must first point out that statements are not within the purview of a bill of particulars. The purpose of a bill of particulars is to give notice to the accused, of the offenses charged in the indictment. See <em>Commonwealth v. Simione, </em><a href="/pa/447/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="447 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="1942934" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0473-01">447 Pa. 473</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=291%20A.2d%20764" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="291 A.2d 764">291 A.2d 764</a> (1972).</p>

The court held that the denial of the motion was proper, as the motion was merely a petition for discovery. We likewise view appellant’s request as a backdoor attempt to obtain pretrial discovery. Pa.R. Crim.P. 310 provides, in relevant part:</p>
    <blockquote id="Aa-" data-blocks='[["BL_236.5",236,[275,1243,1109,585]]]'>“All applications of a defendant for pretrial discovery and inspection shall be made not less than five days prior to the scheduled date of trial.

No other discovery or inspection shall be ordered except upon proof by the defendant, after hearing, of exceptional circumstances and compelling reasons.” </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>
    <p id="b236-6" data-blocks='[["BL_236.6",236,[228,1858,1150,258]]]'>As the statements in question were not reduced to writing, such discovery would not have been permitted.

      <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>When appellant was arrested, he was living at the Team Challenge Center in Reheersburg, Pennsylvania. The arresting officers introduced themselves to appellant as Pittsburgh police officers. Appellant stated, “I’m glad it’s all over with.” Appellant was taken to a district magistrate and then to the state police barracks. During this trip, there was no conversation pertaining to the case. Upon arrival at the barracks, the police informed appellant he was under arrest for murder and appellant stated, “I know, Billy Moore.” Appellant was then given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, which he orally waived. The police told appellant that they had information that he had killed the victim over drugs, to which he responded, “No. I did it for other reasons ... it was a personal thing.” Appellant, however refused to further discuss the incident.</p>
    <p id="b237-4" data-blocks='[["BL_237.4",237,[210,1209,1153,315]]]'>The Commonwealth called the arresting officer to testify as to this exchange.

The final response of “No. I did it for other reasons it was a personal thing” was given immediately after appellant was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, which he orally waived. Immediately after appellant was arrested, the officers took him to the district magistrate. There is no evidence of either fatigue or lack of education on appellant's part. It follows that there was simply no evidence upon which to base a claim that the statements in question were constitutionally involuntary.</p>
