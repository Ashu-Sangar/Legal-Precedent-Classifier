On March 12, 1974, a pretrial proceeding was deferred until March 20, 1974, when appellee again was unrepresented by counsel. On April 15, 18, 25 and May 1, 1974 scheduled preliminary proceedings could not be held because appellee had not retained counsel.

Appellee also contends that this 69 day period should not be excluded because other, subsequent delays would have prevented the case from reaching trial within the 270 day period, even if the appellee had been available for the entire 69 day period. We cannot accept this argument. Rule 1100(d)(1) requires the exclusion of any delay caused by the unavailability of the defendant “at any stage of the proceedings.” Thus, if the unavailability of the defendant causes a delay at an initial stage, the period of the delay is excluded from the period set by Rule 1100, regardless of what happens later.

The Commonwealth filed an appeal from the February 24, 1975 order of Judge Porter, reversing his earlier ruling and quashing the indictments because of an asserted violation of Pa.R.Crim.P. 203(c). The appellee, after a certification from the court below that the order was appropriate for interlocutory review, filed an appeal challenging Judge Greenberg’s denial of his motion for discharge on the basis of a denial of speedy trial. Efficient administration, judicial economy and logic should have suggested the prior disposition of the merits of the appeal of the Commonwealth relating to the validity of the order quashing the indictments.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Obviously, a decision dismissing the indictments would necessarily moot the speedy trial claim and eliminate the necessity of reaching the merits of the issues presented therein.

However, in such an event, the posture of that claim would be materially different from that which has been presently presented because of the additional time that would then have been consumed through the re-indictment process.

If however, there was a procedural basis for the Superi- or Court’s decision to quash, then that basis should have been articulated, and if this Court determined that review was appropriate, the propriety of the order to quash should have been addressed before a consideration of the Rule 1100 claim.</p>

    <p id="b562-7" data-blocks='[["BL_562.7",562,[241,979,1154,750]]]'>Accordingly, the 69 day delay between March 20, 1974 and May 28, 1974, is attributable to appellee, however, because of Section (d) (2) of Rule 1100, he is not charged with the first 30 days. The remaining 39 days (69 days minus 30 days), are chargeable to appellee and properly excluded from the computation of the 270 day time period. So calculated, appellee’s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 1100 was made 263 days after indictment. (January 3, 1974 to November 1, 1974, equals 302 days, minus 39 days delay attributable to appellee, equals 263 days.) At the time the motion to dismiss was brought. (November 1, 1974) appellee could still have been tried within the period specified by Rule 1100, and his motion to dismiss was therefore properly denied.</p>
