He was questioned for approximately thirty minutes during which time he maintained that he was in no way connected to the Rosenbaum crimes. However, during this interview, two Gang Control Officers entered the room and informed McFadden that his accomplices had confessed and implicated him.

First, he argues the admissions were the product of an unnecessary delay between arrest and arraignment in violation of Pa.R.Crim.P. 130 (then Rule 118) and <em>Commonwealth v. Futch, </em><a href="/pa/447/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="447 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1942994" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0389-01">447 Pa. 389</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=290%20A.2d%20417" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="290 A.2d 417">290 A.2d 417</a> (1972) and related cases. Appellant’s argument stresses that a delay of over twenty-two hours occurred between the time McFadden was arrested and the time he was arraigned. He does not, however, consider that the admissions complained of in this appeal and used in the second trial were made within one and one-half hours of his arrest and within forty-five minutes of his arrival at the Police Administration Building. That is a crucial oversight. This Court has repeatedly held that, in order to suppress evidence under Rule 130, that evidence must be a product of the unnecessary delay between arrest and arraignment; that is, there must be some nexus between the delay and the evidence. <em>Commonwealth v.

From this, Dr. Shuman testified that even if McFadden ingested heroin before his arrest, it would have no effect on his ability to comprehend the situation and would certainly not impair his volition unless the police offered him heroin in return for his admissions. Since that was not the case here, the suppression court found that even if McFadden ingested heroin immediately prior to his arrest, it had no effect on the voluntariness of his waiver or of his admissions.</p>

McCutchen, supra. </em>In <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, supra, </em>this Court stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b656-4" data-blocks='[["BL_656.4",656,[278,1282,1105,314]]]'>“ ‘. . . absent a showing that a juvenile had an opportunity to consult with an interested and informed parent, or adult or counsel <em>before he waived his Miranda rights, </em>his waiver will be ineffectual.’ ” [Emphasis in original.] [Quoting from <em>Commonwealth v. Chaney, <a href="/pa/465/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="465 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="1712670" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0407-01">supra.]</a> </em>465 Pa. at 312, 350 A.2d at 411.</blockquote>

At the time he was informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. He was then handcuffed to a chair in the living room and left there, with his mother, while the police completed their search of the house. The search took only ten minutes. During the course of the search appellant’s mother got into an argument with the police over the money that they discovered. Furthermore, it is not clear whether appellant and his mother were left alone in the living room or whether the police stayed in the room with them. The majority’s <em>assumption </em>that advice could pass freely from mother to son is not warranted. The record, as pointed out by the majority in footnote 4, does not show whether or not po<a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>lice were in the living room with appellant and his mother during the ten minute duration of the search.</p>
    <p id="b657-4" data-blocks='[["BL_657.4",657,[188,415,1156,906]]]'>It is now axiomatic that the prosecution has the burden of proving that an alleged waiver of constitutional rights is knowing and intelligent. <em>Commonwealth v. Goodwin, </em><a href="/pa/460/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="460 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="482856" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0516-01">460 Pa. 516</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="460 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="482856" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0516-01">333 A.2d 892</a> (1975); <em>Commonwealth v. Ewell, </em><a href="/pa/456/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="456 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="584420" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0589-01">456 Pa. 589</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20153" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="319 A.2d 153">319 A.2d 153</a> (1974). In my opinion the prosecution did not show that the appellant was given the opportunity to <em>consult </em>with his mother at the time that he was arrested, as required by <em>Smith, supra. </em>After he was informed of his rights, he was in his mother’s presence for only ten minutes and for at least part of that time his mother was embroiled in an argument with the police over ownership of the money. Moreover, the prosecution did not show that appellant and his mother were left alone during this ten minute period. Under these circumstances I cannot conclude that appellant had meaningfully consulted with his mother.</p>
    <p id="b657-5" data-blocks='[["BL_657.5",657,[185,1350,1155,475]]]'>Additionally, police gave no indication to either appellant or his mother that they were going to question him at that time. It appears that their only interest was incarcerating appellant and searching the house for evidence. When the police finally did decide to question appellant, his mother was not present with him, although she was present in the police administration building. As we stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Webster, <a href="/pa/466/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="466 Pa. 314" data-case-ids="1715017" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0314-01">supra,</a> </em>466 Pa. at 326, <a href="/pa/466/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="466 Pa. 314" data-case-ids="1715017" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0314-01">353 A.2d at 378</a>,</p>
