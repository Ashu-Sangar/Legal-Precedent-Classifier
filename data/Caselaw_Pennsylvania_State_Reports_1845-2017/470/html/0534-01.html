The judge checked with police and learned that a warrant had been issued, and advised appellant to come to his chambers and surrender himself to police there. At the time of his surrender to police appellant did not have an attorney. Bullard was given over to the custody of the police with instructions by the judge that he was not to be interrogated until his family had obtained a lawyer. Bullard was taken to police headquarters at 3:00 p.m., and placed in an interrogation room, handcuffed to a metal chair which was bolted to the floor. Interrogation began after police detectives read standard <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Bullard and obtained from Bullard typical “yes” and “no” responses to their inquiries as to his desire to give a statement to police, and as to his wish to be represented by an attorney. At 11:40 p.m., Bullard signed an eight-page statement admitting his participation in the homicide. These facts, according to the <em>Bullard </em>court “indicate [d] an alarming disregard for appellant’s constitutional rights.” <a href="/pa/465/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="465 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="1712687" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0341-01">465 Pa. at 344</a>, <a href="/pa/465/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="465 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="1712687" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0341-01">350 A.2d at 798</a>.

The officers transported appellant to a nearby hospital where he was placed under arrest at approximately 1:15 a.m. At 1:30 a.m., a police detective attempted to talk to appellant who was lying handcuffed and unconscious on a hospital stretcher. After arousing appellant, the detective noticed the strong smell of alcohol on appellant’s breath. Appellant refused to speak to the detective. Appellant was released from the hospital at 3:35 a.m., having been treated for facial bruises and alcoholic intoxication by a Dr. Todhunter. At the detective’s request, Dr. Todhunter prepared a condition report upon appellant’s release, briefly stating the time and purpose of appellant’s admission, and concluding with the apparently misworded statement: “His condition is no [sic] satisfactory for travel.” To clarify this statement, the police detective was permitted to testify at the suppression hearing that, based on his conversation with the doctor prior to appellant’s release, the word “no” in the condition report should have read “now.” Following his release appellant was brought directly to the homicide division for interrogation, and arrived there at 4:05 a.m. At 4:40 a.m., he was taken to the men’s room. His condition at that time was described by the testifying detective as alert and talkative. This detective also testified, however, that appellant was subsequently handcuffed to a chair which was bolted to the floor, and that at that time appellant was attempting to sleep by leaning on a table also located in the interrogation room. According to this detective, appellant, in an apparently groggy state slumped over against the table in such a manner as to cause it to slide away from the rigidly bolted chair on which he was sitting. At this time appellant also had a badly swollen left eye. <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given, and interrogation began at 5:30 a.m. In response to the <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>standard <em>Miranda </em>warnings appellant indicated his understanding of these rights, and his desire not to have counsel present, in one word, “yes” and “no” responses. From 5:30 a.m., until 6:40 a.m., in response to the police questioning, appellant gave the statement in question, read it out loud, and signed each of its four pages. The series of questions and answers was handwritten by the interrogating officer. At the time, appellant was twenty-three years old, had a seventh grade education, and was a poor reader.</p>

In the instant case, the testifying police officer stated that in response to his initial questioning at the hospital, appellant clearly stated his desire not to answer police questions.

The basis for this contention that appellant changed his mind inside the homicide division was the series of one word “yes” and “no” responses given by appellant to the <em>Miranda </em>warnings read to him by the interrogating officers. The <em>Bullard </em>court found this evidence insufficient to sustain the waiver asserted by the prosecution. As in <em>Bullard, </em>the prosecution here contends that appellant’s waiver of his constitutional rights, was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent because appellant Walker gave the appropriate “yes”, “no” responses to the standard <em>Miranda </em>warnings. As we found in <em>Bullard, supra, </em>we find this insufficient to sustain the waiver asserted by the prosecution. Also as in <em>Bullard, </em>we cannot infer a valid waiver of constitutional rights from the fact that the appellant ultimately answered questions put to him by interrogating officers. “The Commonwealth must show not merely that appellant acquiesced in the face of interrogation but also that they ‘scrupulously honored’ appellant’s assertion of his rights.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Although he apparently was in great fear of the police, Bullard, according to the record in that case, was in no way affected by adverse physical conditions at the time of his arrest. The record in the instant appeal, however, shows that appellant Walker was injured at least seriously enough to require hospital treatment ; had been drinking heavily enough that the odor of alcohol remained on his breath several hours after the incident leading to his arrest; had been knocked unconscious less than six hours prior to the commencement of <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>the interrogation that led to the statement in question; had, at the time of the interrogation, a bruised and swollen eye; and was fatigued to the point of falling asleep against a table while handcuffed to a chair bolted to the floor of the interrogation room.

For example, <em>Bullard, </em><a href="/pa/465/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="465 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="1712687" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0341-01">supra at 347-349</a>, <a href="/pa/465/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="465 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="1712687" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0341-01">350 A.2d at 800</a>, referred to standard warnings as “pro forma” and today’s decision refers to “yes” and “no” responses as “mere.” Further, both decisions refer to “yes” and “no” responses to standard warnings as mere “acquiescence,” that is, as if the accused merely <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>“acquiesced in the face of interrogation.” Neither <em>Bullard, </em><a href="/pa/465/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="465 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="1712687" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0341-01">supra,</a> nor this case present silent records and the propriety of treating standard warnings followed by “yes” and “no” responses as acquiescence or silence is not only a questionable method of analysis since it defies logic, experience, and ordinary common sense to say that a verbal expression just because it is short is silence, but also since such a position will lead to an erosion of the protections afforded an accused by <em>Miranda.</em>

    <p id="b589-4" data-blocks='[["BL_589.4",589,[203,812,1155,480]]]'>If standard warnings and “yes” and “no” responses are to be treated as silent acquiescence, then this Court must be demanding more of both the police and the accused. Are the police to depart from standard warnings? Are the police to request an accused to say more than “yes” and “no” in responding to warnings? In my view, standard warnings are the most desirable form of warnings and “yes” and “no” responses are certainly adequate and acceptable responses.</p>
    <p id="b589-5" data-blocks='[["BL_589.5",589,[201,1328,1154,423]]]'>If we require more than standard warnings by the police, then the danger that an accused will be misled either deliberately or inadvertently will be seriously increased. If we require more than definite and precise responses, such as “yes” and “no”, then we will be forcing the police to interpret what more protracted responses are given. Also, our courts will then be forced to interpret those responses in each and every case.</p>
    <p id="b589-6" data-blocks='[["BL_589.6",589,[197,1787,1156,551]]]'>Both standard warnings and “yes” and “no” responses are the most desirable form of warnings and responses in most instances. Use of standard warnings avoids any danger that a police officer, who is not necessarily learned in the law, will mislead an accused. Moreover, they inform an accused concisely and realistically of alternatives and possible consequences. In terms of predictability and definiteness, “yes” and “no” responses serve the accused, the police, and the courts quite well because they do not admit of misinterpretation.</p>
