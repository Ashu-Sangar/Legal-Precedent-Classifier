    <p class="author" id="b659-7" data-blocks='[["BL_659.7",659,[242,785,313,33]]]'>PER CURIAM:</p>
    <p id="b659-8" data-blocks='[["BL_659.8",659,[194,845,1154,369]]]'>Appellants, Charles Randolph Patterson and James Lewis Patterson, are brothers who pleaded guilty to murder on January 6, 1973. Following a degree of guilt hearing, appellants were found guilty of murder in the second degree and each was sentenced to serve ten to twenty years in prison. No post-verdict motions were filed and no appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b659-9" data-blocks='[["BL_659.9",659,[193,1246,1153,608]]]'>On April 26, 1974, appellants filed separate but identical petitions under the Post Conviction Hearing Act. Both petitions, after alleging that appellants were without financial resources and were unable to employ an attorney, requested that an attorney be appointed to represent them. No attorney, however, was appointed. After the filing of answers to appellants’ petitions, the trial court on May 23, 1974, entered an order denying the petitions. Subsequently, the trial court appointed counsel to represent petitioners in the filing of an appeal to this Court from the denial of post-conviction relief.</p>
