The record reveals that throughout the trial appellant was respectful toward the court. His demeanor was consistently proper and polite. Moreover, his good faith attempt to comply with the court’s instruction is attested to by the fact that the appellant failed to introduce the polygraph evidence in his detailed and extensive direct testimony concerning the police interrogation. Only on cross-examination, with his liberty and reputation at stake and his credibility under fire, did appellant inject the forbidden evidence into the controversy. In such a setting, a layman like appellant could not possibly be expected to respond to the prosecutor’s question with a calculated answer intended to deviate from what he contended to be the truth while preserving the integrity of the court’s ruling.

The majority completely ignores the fact that following the citation for contempt (which was imposed after the jury had retired for its deliberation) the trial court conducted a hearing thereon, and found as fact that the quoted reference to the result of the polygraph test was wilful disobedience of the court’s order; that the reference to the test was interjected by Haefner solely to bolster his defense. This finding was supported, in part, by the testimony at the contempt hearing that Haefner had not, in fact, made any complaint before Justice of the Peace Lees.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Since the finding of wilful disobedience is <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>supported by ample evidence, there is no reason for this Court to disturb it on review.

    <p id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.5",440,[243,496,1153,630]]]'>The trial judge was present and observed the demeanor of the contemnor both at trial and at the subsequent contempt hearing. He rejected the argument that the answer given by Haefner was the only one which could have been given. The trial court’s opinion explains at some length the reasons for his conclusion “that the defendant knew how [to respond] but that he did not want to.” The opinion also describes the interruption of the court proceeding which was caused by the contumacious answer. We should be slow to ignore the reasoned basis of a trial court’s action in a case such as this. Hence this dissent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

One police officer was in the room the entire time and others were there most of the time. Their testimony was positive and firm. We find the testimony to be credible and conclude therefrom that the defendant’s testimony that he had made a complaint at the arraignment was incorrect. We have no doubt that the defendant has complained about the lie detector test and the non-use of it on numerous occasions, but the testimony of the police officers has convinced us beyond a reasonable doubt that the occasion of the arraignment was not one of the times when he voiced a complaint. Having concluded that he made no complaint, as we do, we thereupon conclude that the sole purpose of the answer given by the defendant was to bring the lie detector test to the attention of the jury in the hope that it would benefit his defense.” [Record, 16a].</blockquote>
