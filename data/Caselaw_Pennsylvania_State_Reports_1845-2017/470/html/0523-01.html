Post-trial motions were denied by a court en banc and Daniels was sentenced to life imprisonment. This court reversed the conviction with a ruling that Daniels had been arrested without probable cause and that his confession was a product of the illegal arrest and should have been suppressed. The case was remanded for a new trial. <em>Commonwealth v.

We based our decision in <em>Cephas </em>on the fact that the witness who was found would not have been located but for the illegal search and illegal arrest. This conclusion was supported by the fact that if the witness had come forward to testify, she would have had to implicate herself in certain criminal activities, and that after the witness was found, police pressure motivated her statements. In <em>Cephas, </em>based on these facts, we found that the Commonwealth had found a witness as the result of an illegal search and could not meet its burden of establishing that the testimony of the witness was purged of any illegal taint and, therefore, admissible.</p>

First, Diane Jones was the person who initially called the police and informed them that “Dead Leg” (Daniels’ nickname) may have committed the homicide. This information led the police to Daniels’ residence, where Diane Jones was at the time preparing dinner. Second, Diane Jones voluntarily went to police headquarters with Daniels and thereafter voluntarily gave the statement that is now in question. In the instant case, Diane Jones, unlike the witness in <em>Cephas, </em>was present because of her direct actions of calling the police with an anonymous “tip”, and voluntarily accompanying appellee to police headquarters and giving the police a statement of her own free will.

A suppression hearing was held on April 25, 1974. The Commonwealth offered no evidence, entering instead into the following stipulation:</p>

    <p id="b571-5" data-blocks='[["BL_571.5",571,[153,1369,1152,569]]]'>At the suppression hearing of April 25, the Commonwealth chose not to present any testimony, instead stipulating to the facts, apparently content to rely on its legal argument that the evidence in question was admissible notwithstanding its derivation from an illegal arrest. The suppression court disagreed. Following the suppression order and the filing of an appeal in this Court, the Commonwealth decided that it should have attempted to prove the existence of an independent basis for its acquisition of the challenged evidence.</p>

      <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>It is surely the general rule that, absent some extraordinary justification, a party has one and only one opportunity to carry his burden of proof. The Commonwealth once failed to carry its burden of proving admissibility and, absent a compelling justification, ought not to be permitted to try again. The Commonwealth sought that second chance by its claim that the stipulation was erroneous and that this circumstance entitled it to another opportunity to carry its burden. I assume that, under certain circumstances, a showing that the Commonwealth was laboring under the constraint of an erroneous stipulation would entitle it to that second opportunity. However, after entry of an order concluding the proceeding, fairness to the defendant and the integrity of the judicial process require, in my view, that the showing include proof that the Commonwealth exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to learn the facts and that it reasonably relied on defense counsel’s misrepresentation of the facts.</p>

When this Court granted the Commonwealth’s petition on October 8 and remanded the matter for an evidentiary hearing, it could only have been to permit the Commonwealth to prove the existence of circumstances which would entitle it to relief from its stipulation. It is clear that the Commonwealth may not, absent proof of justifying circumstances, simply discard its stipulations and have a second opportunity to carry its burden of proof. And it surely did not prove the existence of those circumstances in this Court. All we had before us were the Commonwealth’s allegation and Daniels’ denial. That we somehow determined from the petition and answer that justifying circumstances existed is plainly beyond the realm of possibility. The only course open to us was to <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>remand for an evidentiary hearing in which the Commonwealth could attempt to prove the facts necessary for entitlement to relief.</p>

The now-disputed facts concern how the police came to learn of the existence of certain witnesses. Why the Commonwealth’s attorney could not, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have examined the file and formulated his own view of the facts, and how he could have reasonably relied on defense counsel’s representation of matters peculiarly within the knowledge of the police are mysteries to me. In any event, contrary to the majority’s unsupportable assertion, our remand was designed to permit the Commonwealth to attempt to make the necessary showing.</p>
    <p id="b573-5" data-blocks='[["BL_573.5",573,[143,1196,1155,418]]]'>However, since the purpose of the hearing was misperceived by the Commonwealth and the suppression court, the record remains barren of proof of circumstances justifying relief from the stipulation.

In my view, the majority has far exceeded the proper bounds of appellate review and, in doing so, has impeached the integrity of the judicial process. Therefore, I dissent.</p>

The majority avoids this issue by stating: “This Court, on October 8, 1974, vacated a stipulation entered into between the prosecution and defense counsel and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing on appellee’s suppression motion.” Supra at 1280, n. 1. The October 8 order merely stated: “Petition to remand for supplemental evidentiary hearing granted.” This eight word order in no way supports the majority’s assertion that we vacated the stipulation. Such a request was not even before us. See infra at 1282.</p>

Accepting for the moment the suppression court’s conclusions of January 28, the most that the police could have learned from Diane Jones was the existence of Michael Francis, Michael Presley, Anthony Rush, and Alexander Drain. But the suppression order included the murder weapon and the testimony of Charles McEachin, John Rush, and Diane Jones herself. Since the majority fails to deal with that portion of the suppression order, it apparently intends to affirm the order to that extent.</p>
