Melvin Wilcox, Jr., was, fehot twice through the heart and died as a result of these wounds. The other injured youth, Norman Dugan, was shot in the back and shoulder. Although Dugan fortunately recovered, he nonetheless sustained some paralysis as a result of the injury. Hailey was indicted and tried as a participant in this incident and a verdict of guilty of murder of the first degree was returned by the jury. He was also convicted of assault with the intent to kill for the shooting of Dugan. After disposition of post-verdict motions, a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed under the murder indictment. Sentence was suspended on the assault indictment. This direct appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

After a hearing held on June 15, 1973, the Juvenile Court certified the cause to the Court of Common Pleas for trial. Indictments were thereafter returned at the July 1973 Term of the Court of Common Pleas charging appellant with offenses relating to both victims, Dugan and the deceased Wilcox.

Appellant alleges that the error of the Commonwealth in failing to have the Dugan charges properly certified was the cause of the continuance and that if this inadvertent omission had not occurred, the trial would have promptly proceeded on January 29, 1974. There is, however, no support in the record for appellant’s contentions. It is true that by the first trial date nothing had been done by appellant to challenge either the certification proceedings of June 15, 1973, or the July indictments. In fact, it was not until January 31, 1974, two days later, that appellant filed a motion to quash the allegedly faulty July Term Dugan indictments. Even assuming that it is appropriate to assign any delay occasioned by the pre-trial process to the Commonwealth, we find no such delay in this case.

Such a formulation avoids the rigidities of the demand-waiver rule and the resulting possible unfairness in its application. It allows the trial court to exercise a judicial discretion based on the circumstances, including due consideration of any applicable formal procedural rule. It would permit, for example, a court to attach a different weight to a situation in which the defendant knowingly fails to object from a situation in which his attorney acquiesces in long delay without adequately informing his client, or from a situation in which no counsel is appointed. It would also allow a court to weigh the frequency and force of the objections as opposed to attaching significant weight to a purely pro forma objection.</blockquote>

Where, as here, the appellant was promptly placed on notice by the return of the July indictments that he was going to be called upon to face the charges stemming from the shooting of both Wilcox and Dugan, the interests of justice cannot be said to require a dismissal. Appellant cannot assign his loss of liberty to this allegedly defective procedure since his detainment was equally attributable to the homicide charges, the procedure of which he does not complain. It is also very significant that the indictments were quashed due to a procedural infirmity and not due to any finding of a substantive deficiency. We agree with the trial court that the relief sought was unwarranted and the refusal to grant said relief was not an abuse of discretion.</p>

The two requisite elements of proof of such a waiver on the part of a minor defendant are a showing that, 1) the accused had access to the advice of an attorney, parent or interested adult <em>before an </em>effective waiver may be established, <em>see Commonwealth v. McCutchen, supra, </em>463 Pa. at 92-93, <a href="/pa/463/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="125" data-cite="343 A.2d 669" data-case-ids="1708038,1708098" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0090-01,/pa/463/0089-01">343 A.2d at 670</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> and 2) that the consulted adult was informed as to the constitutional rights available to the minor. <em>See Commonwealth v. Starkes, <a href="/pa/461/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="461 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="483653" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0178-01">supra,</a> </em>461 Pa. at 188, <a href="/pa/461/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="461 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="483653" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0178-01">335 A.2d at 703</a>. It is uncontradicted in the record that at the crucial moment when appellant offered his first inculpatory oral and written statement he did not have “access to the advice of a parent, attorney, or other adult who was primarily interested in his welfare.” It is undisputed that appellant’s first access to the advice of an interested adult was provided only after six hours of questioning during which period he had already incriminated himself. Further, the Commonwealth did not establish that the father, at the time of his belated entrance, was in fact provided an opportunity to confer alone with his son or that he, the father, was in fact aware of the options available to appellant. On such a record, it is manifest that the Commonwealth has failed to establish that appellant executed an effective waiver of his rights.</p>

The reasons for this position have been frequently stated heretofore. See <em>Commonwealth v. Chaney, </em><a href="/pa/465/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="158" data-cite="465 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="1712670" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0407-01">465 Pa. 407</a>, 409, <a href="/pa/465/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="159" data-cite="465 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="1712670" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0407-01">350 A.2d 829</a>, 831 (1975) (dissenting opinion of Pomeroy, J., joined by Mr. Chief Justice JONES and Mr. Justice EAGEN), and cases there cited. I would therefore affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>
