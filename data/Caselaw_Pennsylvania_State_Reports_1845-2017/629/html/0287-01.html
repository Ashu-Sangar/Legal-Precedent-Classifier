Specifically, Appellees maintained that Rite Aid’s act of charging a flat fee for the reproduction of records violates Section 6152(a)(2)(i) of the MRA. In Count II of their complaint, Appellees requested a declaratory judgment that the MRA prohibits Rite Aid from charging more than the reasonable expenses it incurred to reproduce the requested records, and, further, precludes Rite Aid from charging a flat fee.</p>

In concluding the MRA does not apply to pharmacies, or the reproduction of pharmacy records, Judge Wettick observed that Section 6155(b)(1), from the time it was enacted in 1986, has used the term “patient,” and that, generally, “persons describe themselves as patients of the physician who wrote the prescription and customers of the pharmacy that filled the prescription. Persons describe themselves as patients of a hospital but persons do not describe themselves as patients of a pharmacy.” Trial Court Opinion, 5/5/11, at 5. Judge Wettick reasoned that, “by using the term <em>patient, </em>the Legislature was focusing on problems concerning access to the records of hospitals and physicians.

As a result, we interpret the term “health care provider,” as contained in the MRA, according to the definition of “health care provider” set forth in the HCFA. Interpreting the MRA’s use of the term “health care provider” in this manner, we conclude that pharmacies are not health care providers under the MRA, as they are not entities that operate a health care facility. <em>See </em>35 P.S. § 448.103.</p>

As discussed <em>supra, </em>the Superior Court relied, <em>inter alia, </em>on the use of the term "patient profile” and the requirement that pharmacists offer "patient counseling” under 49 Pa.Code § 27.19 ("Prospective drug review and patient counseling”) to conclude that a pharmacist is a health care provider, an individual to whom prescription medication is dispensed is a patient, and the patient pharmacy records maintained by the pharmacist are medical records under the MRA:</p>
      <blockquote id="b344-7" data-blocks='[["BL_344.8",344,[327,1747,1084,192]]]'>The Code use of the term “patient profile,” the requirement that the pharmacist maintain and review the profile, the duty to provide counseling, and the importance of maintaining confidentiality of all information compiled support the conclusion that pharmacy records are medical records of a patient.</blockquote>

However, the term "patient” is not defined in 49 Pa.Code § 27.1 ("Definitions”), and we are unable to conclude that the term "patient” referred to in the Code means a patient of a pharmacy, as opposed to a patient of a "medical practitioner,” which is defined as a "physician, dentist, veterinarian or other individual authorized and licensed by law to prescribe drugs.” <em><a href="/a3d/40/1280-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="40 A.3d 1280" data-case-ids="7315936" data-case-paths="/a3d/40/1280-01">Id.</a></em>

In light of our determination that pharmacies are not health care providers for purposes of the MRA, we need not address the issue of whether, or under what circumstances, a pharmacy would be permitted under the MRA to charge a flat fee for the reproduction of records.</p>
