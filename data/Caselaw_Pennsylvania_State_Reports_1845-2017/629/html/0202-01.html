The PCRA court below denied relief. A divided Superior Court reversed and remanded in a 2-1 decision, in the process adopting and applying a test for measuring <em>Miranda </em>waivers devised by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit after the trial in this matter. The panel majority held that: appellee’s pre-polygraph <em>Miranda </em>waiver did not encompass the post-polygraph interview; the Commonwealth failed to prove that appellee validly waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel for the post-polygraph interview; appellee’s trial counsel lacked a reasonable basis for failing to seek suppression of the statement; and the admission of the statement at trial was prejudicial. We accepted review because the Superior Court’s approach led to an underlying merits holding — that federal law may require a second set of <em>Miranda </em>warnings and a second <em>Miranda </em>waiver before police may conduct a post-polygraph interview — that presents an important issue of first impression. For reasons that follow, we hold that the Superior Court’s approach was flawed in multiple respects, requiring a remand to that court to reconsider the ineffectiveness claim under the proper review paradigm. Accordingly, we vacate the order of the Superior Court and remand for reconsideration of the issue consistently with this Opinion, and for consideration of appellee’s remaining appellate issue.</p>
    <p id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[151,1631,1154,746]]]'>Because the issue involves a failure to seek suppression, there is no pre-trial suppression hearing record. The courts below focused on competing factual accounts, including appellee’s testimony, offered at the PCRA hearing, without looking to the trial record; the parties’ appellate presentation to this Court has a similar focus. However, because appellee’s various statements to police were introduced at trial, the trial transcript also includes substantial evidence relevant to the circumstances surrounding those statements. The failure to recognize relevant evidence in the trial record contributed to the Superior Court’s ultimate legal error, as we will explain. Given these circumstances, we must begin with a factual and procedural overview essential to obtain an accurate understanding of the merits issue.</p>

At some point in their travels, appellee passed the home of a family (the victims) in Dauphin County, and appellee told Purcell that he would not mind assaulting the victims’ teenage son. Thereafter, appellee and Purcell returned to the residence and stood outside of the victims’ home, appellee handed Purcell the baseball bat, and Purcell proceeded to enter the home.</p>

The husband earlier had retired to sleep in another room. Purcell eventually entered the master bedroom, where he awoke the wife and terrorized her by threatening to assault her sleeping children. Purcell began to rape the wife as she pleaded with him not to hurt her children.</p>
    <p id="b242-7" data-blocks='[["BL_242.6",242,[254,1554,1153,740]],["BL_243.1",243,[143,327,1151,246]]]'>Awakened by the commotion and the sound of appellee’s car outside, the husband came to his wife’s defense, attacking Purcell as he struggled to pull his pants up. The husband beat Purcell into submission and dragged him from the bedroom, not wanting to kill him in front of the children. The victims’ teenage son then assisted his father, wielding a baseball bat of his own. As the son stood over Purcell, the husband ran outside in search of other possible intruders, given the sound of appellee’s car and the fact that the husband thought he had heard more than one strange voice in his house. The husband then saw appellee, age 17 at the time,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> sitting in a car positioned at the bottom of the driveway, with its engine running, and headlights turned off. Appellee fled upon seeing the husband, who then pursued appellee in his <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>own vehicle. Appellee eluded the husband and then attempted to run him off the road by driving head-on at the husband’s car at a high rate of speed. The husband then returned to his home and the police arrived shortly thereafter and arrested Purcell.</p>
    <p id="b243-5" data-blocks='[["BL_243.4",243,[145,604,1152,468]]]'>The following morning, based on information received from Purcell, Derry Township police officers went to appellee’s home to interview him. According to the trial testimony of Detective Daniel Kelly, the detective sergeant in charge of the criminal investigation section of the Derry Township Police Department, appellee told police that on his way home the night before, he dropped Purcell off in front of the victims’ home, that appellee never saw Purcell with a bat, and that there was never any bat in appellee’s car.</p>

Detective Kelly asked appellee to meet him at the police station and appellee agreed and followed the detectives in his own vehicle. Upon arrival, police escorted him to an interrogation room to wait for his parents, who were not home when the detectives invited appellee to the station.</p>

Appellee testified at the PCRA hearing that, when he arrived at the police station, he was seated in a small room with the door closed and was made to empty his pockets. He testified to a subjective belief that he did not have the ability to leave, that he waited for “a couple of hours” before his parents arrived, and that he was not questioned by police prior to his parents’ arrival. Appellee conceded, however, that the room had two doors and that when he had to use the bathroom he may have opened the door himself and, upon leaving the bathroom, he walked directly back to the interview room. Appellee also acknowledged that he was not handcuffed, shackled, or otherwise physically restrained in any way. Appellee claimed that, before his parents arrived, he asked police, “Why are you keeping me here?” and police responded: “We’re holding you <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>here until your parents arrive so we can ask you some questions or question you.” N.T., 4/25/06, at 63-65, 69.</p>
    <p id="b244-5" data-blocks='[["BL_244.4",244,[261,450,1152,411]]]'>In his own PCRA testimony, Detective Kelly stated that the room in which appellee waited had two doors: a door to the hallway which remained open, and a door to the lock-up/booking area which remained closed to keep juveniles separate from adult offenders. Detective Kelly explained that appellee was neither restrained nor kept under guard, and that he was never told he was not free to leave, albeit police also did not specifically inform appellee that he had the right to leave.</p>
    <p id="b244-6" data-blocks='[["BL_244.5",244,[258,885,1154,934]]]'>After appellee’s parents arrived, Detective Kelly advised them and appellee of appellee’s <em>Miranda </em>rights. At the PCRA hearing, appellee claimed that: “When he got to the part about the attorney, we asked, I believe my father or my mother asked, and I asked, both, for an attorney.... We specifically said if we have the right to one, we would like one.” Appellee said that the police response was “No,” and “you don’t need an attorney at this point.” <em>Id. </em>at 66-67. Appellee’s father, also testifying during PCRA proceedings, confirmed: “I indicated we wanted a lawyer.” <em>Id. </em>at 94. Appellee further testified that he did not sign the <em>Miranda </em>waiver form presented to him because: “Well, I kind of thought I needed an attorney. They told me I had ... the right to an attorney and then they told me I couldn’t have one.” <em>Id. </em>at 67. Detective Kelly’s PCRA testimony specifically contradicted appellee and his father, as he testified that appellee never invoked his right to silence or his right to counsel.</p>

Appellee’s father admitted to signing a “Constitutional Rights Notice” consenting to the interview, but stated that at some later point, he refused to sign the <em>Miranda </em>Waiver form. Appellee’s father was present when appellee was questioned and, he admitted, “the questions they asked him, I did consent to.” <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>
      <em>Id. </em>at 94-97. For his part, Detective Kelly testified that the Constitutional Rights Notice and the “Waiver of Rights <em>Miranda </em>Warnings” form were actually two parts of the same document; appellee’s parents signed the document where Detective Kelly requested they sign; and the failure to have them sign a second time at the bottom of the same form was merely his error and, in any event, the second part of the form is redundant. <em>Id. </em>at 101-102.</p>
    <p id="b245-5" data-blocks='[["BL_245.4",245,[149,757,1154,1054]]]'>Detective Kelly proceeded to take a written statement from appellee, the contents of which were introduced, through the testimony of the detective, at trial. Appellee admitted to being at a party with Purcell on the evening of April 17, 1998, and then driving home with Purcell in the early morning hours of April 18. According to appellee, Purcell exited appellee’s vehicle with a baseball bat, which was the first time appellee had seen the bat. Purcell swung the bat against the windshield of appellee’s car, cracking the windshield, then swung the bat at appellee and another individual, Wes Sumner, who had also been in the car. Purcell then walked away carrying the bat, and appellee entered his own house. Upon seeing police lights ten to fifteen minutes later, appellee stated, he assumed Purcell had been taken into custody by the police, and the next thing that he knew the police were at his door at 8:30 or 9 a.m. the next morning. After reviewing his typewritten statement with his parents, appellee made and initialed corrections, and signed the statement, with his parents present. Appellee was then arrested and detained in the Dauphin County Prison.</p>

Counsel informed appellee that appellee would be given a polygraph examination to confirm the veracity of his April 21st statement.

According to trial counsel’s PCRA hearing testimony, appellee had told counsel he was innocent, did not enter the victims’ house, and was “not involved at all.” Explaining his reasoning respecting the polygraph, counsel stated:</p>

Counsel also explained that in his nearly forty years of experience, both as a prosecutor and a defense attorney, the polygraph process included three phases: a pre-polygraph interview, the examination itself, and a post-polygraph interview. He explained that defense counsel is not permitted to be present in the room for any portion of the polygraph testing process, and indeed, if the attorney insisted on being present, no polygraph would be administered. Relying on appellee’s account of his non-involvement, however, counsel “absolutely” believed the polygraph would be “a very positive thing” for appellee. <em>Id. </em>at 49-50. The polygraph examiner, Detective Joseph Steenson, confirmed <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>the protocol that polygraph examinations are not administered with attorneys present.

N.T., 11/19/98, at 599-602. Counsel then waited outside of the examination room while Detective Steenson proceeded with the polygraph, but counsel departed upon receiving a call indicating he was needed in his office and counsel did not return.</p>

Detective Steenson testified that he routinely compiled and utilized a polygraph packet that included a specific series of forms. He testified to a present recollection of appellee’s polygraph examination and the forms used, including that he read the <em>Miranda </em>waiver form to appellee verbatim prior to conducting the polygraph exam, as part of his routine process. Detective Steenson said he was certain that he read each of the questions aloud to appellee, and that appellee answered “yes” each time. He further testified that had appellee answered “no,” or had he given any equivocation, he would have stopped the polygraph.

The court identified the four <em>LeonDelfis </em>factors as: “ ‘who requested the polygraph examination; who initiated the post-polygraph questioning; whether the signed waiver clearly specifies that it applies to post-polygraph questioning or only to the polygraph test; and whether the defendant has consulted with counsel.’ ” <em>Hill, </em>42 A.3d at 1094, quoting <em>Leon-Delfis, </em><a href="/f3d/203/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="203 F.3d 103" data-case-ids="11481320" data-case-paths="/f3d/203/0103-01">203 F.3d at 111</a>.

Fields </em>because in that case, as here, the dispute centered on the admissibility of a statement given after a government polygraph examination requested by the defendant’s attorney. The Commonwealth stresses that the <em>Wyrick </em>Court held that a defense request for a polygraph examination amounts to the defendant himself initiating interrogation: “ ‘That is, [the defendant] waived not only his right to be free of contact with the authorities in the absence of an attorney, but also his right to be free of interrogation about the crime for which he was suspected.’ ” Commonwealth’s Brief at 14, quoting <em>Wyrick, </em><a href="/us/459/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="459 U.S. 42" data-case-ids="6190887" data-case-paths="/us/459/0042-01">459 U.S. at 47</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20S.%20Ct.%20394" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="108 S.

To make matters worse, the Commonwealth continues, the court applied all four prongs of the <em>Leon-Delfis </em>test despite recognizing that two of the prongs were called into question by later decisional law from the U.S. Supreme Court; and the court construed the absence of the waiver form as a factor weighing against the Commonwealth as a failure of proof, even though the burden was on appellee to prove counsel ineffective.</p>

Appellee argues that <em>Wyrick </em>is distinguishable because there was a break between his post-polygraph written statement to Detective Steenson, and his post-polygraph interview with Detective Kelly. Although appellee does not address the significance of his PCRA testimony that this break was only fifteen minutes in approximate duration, N.T., 4/25/06, at 90, he does contend that during this time he was not re-Mirandized and no spontaneous effort was made by police to contact his counsel. Citing <em>Leon-Delfis, </em>appellee argues that police initiated the post-polygraph examination without first securing an additional, explicit waiver of rights. Appellee also argues that the failure of the Commonwealth to produce a signed waiver form that raised the possibility of post-polygraph questioning “strongly supports” his claim. Appellee alleges that the police took advantage of his youth and naiveté by questioning him, and took advantage of his counsel’s distinct ineffectiveness in “abandoning” him. Appellee concludes that Detective Kelly’s post-polygraph interrogation violated his right to counsel, providing a basis for forwarding a meritorious suppression claim.</p>

What remains to determine is whether appellee’s claim of ineffectiveness, properly assessed, entitles him to relief on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to file a motion to suppress. In our view, this is a matter better determined by the Superi- or Court in the first instance, following relevant additional briefing. The claim as presented in this Court has complications not appreciated by the parties or the courts below— specifically, the relevant trial evidence concerning appellee’s waiver and his post-polygraph interview with Detective Kelly. The interrelationship of that evidence with the PCRA hearing testimony is a matter that should be addressed prior to an ultimate decision. We recognize that we could simply ignore the trial testimony, as the lower courts and the parties have, and assess appellee’s claim upon a diminished record. But, we do not regard this as the optimal practice, particularly where it appears that central points appellee testified to under oath, at different proceedings, are in tension, and no factual finding has been made to resolve the tension. In addition, we note, the Superior Court did not address appellee’s second claim, involving his April 21st statement, nor did it assess his post-<a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>polygraph statement to Detective Steenson; the content and admissibility of those statements could affect an appropriate prejudice assessment.

Justice Saylor is correct that the waiver form, as read by Detective Steenson at trial, did ask appellee if he consented to talk “with me,” “me” being Detective Steenson; on the surface, this could be interpreted to limit the waiver to questions by the polygraph examiner, but there is no evidence at all nor circumstantial reason to believe that such a precise limitation was contemplated by the parties in this case.

The Superior Court conceded appellee, like the defendants in <em>Wyrick </em>and <em>Eagle Elk, </em>had the aid of counsel during the pre-polygraph process, but noted appellee’s counsel did not have a second discussion with him between the end of the examination and the beginning of the post-test interview. However, neither <em>Wyrick </em>nor <em>Eagle Elk </em>involved such a discussion, and the Superior Court cited no authority suggesting its absence should weigh against the continued vitality of a valid waiver. Indeed, we are offered no authority that the end of the test somehow initiates a new interface between police and citizen requiring reiteration of warnings already given and understood. The two cited circuit court cases holding a pre-polygraph waiver did not extend to post-polygraph questioning, <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Gillyard, </em>involved defendants who had no representation at all.</p>

This statement also contravenes the Superior Court’s interesting suggestion that “in drafting the questions to be asked during the polygraph examination!], counsel] established the scope of [appellee]’s waiver of his right to counsel during the polygraph examination.’’ <em>Hitt, </em>at 1096. Following the remand in <em>Wyrick, </em>the defendant argued he did not waive his Sixth Amendment right to counsel because his counsel and law enforcement agreed the waiver was limited to the polygraph examination, citing counsel’s suppression hearing testimony to that effect. <em>Fields, </em>at 881.

PCRA Hearing, 4/25/06, at 49-50 (emphasis added). This is not an insignificant difference: under the Superior Court’s analysis, it bears on the credibility of appellee's assertion that when he executed the waiver, he was oblivious to the possibility of a post-polygraph interview. In this, the Superior Court gilded its reasoning, as "always” is quite different than "sometimes."</p>
