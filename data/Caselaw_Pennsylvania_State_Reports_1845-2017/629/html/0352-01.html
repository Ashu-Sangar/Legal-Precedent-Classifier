Evidence presented at trial in January 1993 included Bardo’s statement to police that he had digitally penetrated the child’s vagina, accidently killed her by putting his hand over her mouth to quiet her, placed her body in a trash bag, and threw it from a bridge into a creek. The defense strategy at trial was to acknowledge that Bardo was criminally responsible for the child’s death, but to try to establish that the killing was not intentional. The Commonwealth’s forensic pathology expert testified that the child’s death was due to asphyxia resulting from a deliberate, forceful compression of her neck lasting four to five minutes, with the pressure continuing even after she lost consciousness. <em>Commonwealth v.

Ms. Wolfe testified that Bardo was the sixth of her seven children, and she could not remember the year he was born. Bardo’s father (George Bardo) was an alcoholic who “never came home” and drank to the point of drunkenness “all the time”; had no contact with his son since the time Bardo was a toddler; and tried to commit suicide by cutting his wrists with a razor blade at the family home, an injury that he survived. Ms. Wolfe did not think that Bardo remembered his father, and his stepfather did not participate in Bardo’s activities or act as a father figure to him. Bardo went to several schools and the family moved often. Ms. Wolfe acknowledged that she had her “hands full” with her children, and had a hard time controlling her son when he got older. Bardo began drinking at about age thirteen, and at times “fell in the door” to the family home due to his intoxication. Also, as a young teenager, Bardo was sexually abused on a number of occasions by a man who bought beer for him. Ms. Wolfe learned about <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>this sexual abuse from Bardo when he was eighteen years old, although it had occurred years earlier. Ms. Wolfe thought that Bardo married at age sixteen. He had two children, ages six and five, by the time of trial. At one time, according to Ms. Wolfe, Bardo and his wife lived in an empty warehouse.

His appearance in school was very unkempt. A teacher testified that Bardo “had a very difficult time” in school, and “was in over his head.” Bardo went to the Children’s Service Center at age fifteen for help functioning in a school setting. The assistant principal testified that Bardo’s “parents were cooperative, but things did not change that much.” However, a teacher testified that Bardo’s parents were uncooperative on the rare occasion when school personnel were successful in contacting them.

Such evidence, in the PCRA court’s view, was sufficient to warrant presentation to the jury of both the Section (e)(2) and the Section (e)(3) mitigating circumstances, which require the petitioner to establish, respectively, that he was under the influence of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance, and that his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired.

Moreover, similar to voluntary intoxication, alcohol dependence is not in and of itself a mitigating circumstance; more is required beyond the mere averment of dependence. Here, Bardo has done little more than to assert that he was alcohol dependent. In sum, we would conclude that Bardo has not carried his burden to show that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present expert testimony regarding his abuse of alcohol, voluntary intoxication, and/or alcohol dependence. In reaching this conclusion, we do not discount the possibilities that some additional jurors might have found alcohol abuse as a mitigating factor, or that the juror(s) who found alcohol abuse as a mitigating factor might have applied more weight to this factor.

PCRA Court Opinion at 29. More specifically, the PCRA court determined that the following was not presented to the sentencing jury: Bardo’s genetic pre-disposition to alcoholism based on the fact that his biological father was an alcoholic; Bardo’s own drinking at an early age, resulting in blackouts and injury to himself; Bardo’s history of sexual victimization, as revealed through records, and not just uncorroborated family testimony; and Bardo’s psychiatric interventions, hospitalizations, and diagnoses following his two suicide attempts. <em>Id. </em>at 29-31. Nevertheless, based on our review of the penalty phase testimony and the relevant records, we would conclude that the PCRA court’s ultimate determination is not supported by the record. As summarized above, Bardo and his mother <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>testified at the penalty phase regarding his biological father’s alcoholism; Bardo’s heavy drinking beginning in his preteen years, which his mother was unable to control and which caused him to “fall into the house” some nights; his sexual abuse at the hands of an older male in order to obtain alcohol; and his two suicide attempts.

For example, PCRA counsel put great emphasis on an LCCYS Case Report dated July 20, 1972, when Bardo was three years old and had been admitted, along with one of his siblings, to a day-care home. <em>See </em>Case Record re: Michael Bardo, dated 7/20/72, prepared by Caseworker Mariellen Fine (“1972 Bardo Case Record”) (Petitioner’s Exhibit 4).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> LCCYS apparently made these daycare arrangements to assist Bardo’s mother. <em>Id. </em>at 1. PCRA counsel emphasized the caseworker’s findings that Bardo was “rather dirty” when he came daily to the home, and that “the children stated they were not being fed at home.” N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/12/09, at 348 (citing 1972 Bardo Case Record at 2). However, the document must be considered in its entirety before evaluating its possible import. Bardo’s mother denied the accusation that she was not feeding her children and was said to be “extremely upset” by the charge. 1972 Bardo Case Record at 2. The caseworker further noted that Bardo was “not a very good eater” and would not eat very much; nonetheless, she described him as “of normal size <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>and appearing] to be developing normally ... [and] appearing] to be a normal, healthy little boy.” <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. She also noted an attachment to and close relationship with his mother. The caseworker concluded that Bardo had made progress in the day-care home, that he enjoyed playing with the other children and going outside to play, that he talked constantly, that he was a very polite child, and that he listened attentively to instructions. <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. Thus, the 1972 Bardo Case Report is far from uniformly negative in describing Bardo’s earliest years. As set forth in another document cited by the PCRA court, the LCCYS file on the Bardo family was closed on May 31, 1984, after fourteen years of services. <em>See </em>Letter from LCCYS to Jean McCoskey, Chief Probation Officer of the Luzerne County Juvenile Court, dated 1/16/86 (Petitioner’s Exhibit 3). The letter indicated that there had been no contact with the Bardo family since the file was closed, there was no reason given as to why the file was closed, and there is no indication from the records that the file was ever reopened. Thus, other than clarifying that LCCYS involvement with the Bardo family ended for unspecified reasons when Bardo was fifteen, this letter offered no helpful insights, except to document that LCCYS had been involved with the Bardo family in unspecified ways for many years.</p>

The document indicated that Bardo’s mother reported as her only income $379 from Social Security, and that the family resided in a “very poorly kept” apartment, which was “dark and dirty with soiled clothing visible.” <em>Id. </em>Two other documents are short and undetailed juvenile probation records with regard to Bardo, prepared when he was ages twelve and sixteen, respectively. <em>See </em>Luzerne County Juvenile Probation Records, dated 4/10/82, and 6/3/85 (Petitioner’s Exhibits 6 and 7, respectively).

As summarized in the second probation document, Bardo had been arrested on unspecified charges, and he subsequently stated that he had been drinking and was drunk at the time of his arrest; in addition, his mother stated that he was uncontrollable when he was drinking. Petitioner’s Exhibit 7. These records, cited by the PCRA court, clearly set forth a troubled household and a troubled youth, but they do not present a picture materially different from that provided by trial counsel, through the testimony of Bardo, his mother, and school personnel.</p>

However, this is not the ultimate question. Testimony presented during the penalty phase described all these aspects of Bardo’s childhood and the environment in which he was raised. The expert testimony presented at the PCRA hearing was largely cumulative of that prior testimony and presented only relatively minor fresh insights. Counsel is not ineffective merely because he or she fails to present expert testimony concerning a defendant’s childhood history and home life that would have been cumulative of testimony presented by a defendant’s mother. <em>See Commonwealth v. Lark, </em><a href="/pa/548/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="548 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="960516" data-case-paths="/pa/548/0441-01">548 Pa. 441</a>, <a href="/a2d/698/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="698 A.2d 43" data-case-ids="11998055,960516" data-case-paths="/a2d/698/0043-01,/pa/548/0441-01">698 A.2d 43</a>, 51 (1997).

However, two aspects of these records greatly decrease their significance and import. First, with respect to Bardo’s sexual abuse, the documents contain only his self-reports; thus, the four documents corroborate Bardo’s penalty phase testimony only to the extent that a self-report can be corroborated by a prior self-report. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T.

The first time Bardo disclosed the sexual abuse was during a February 27, 1988 interview with police concerning these prior sexual offenses. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 121-24 (testimony of Dr. Blumberg as to Bardo’s statement to police on 2/27/88 (Commonwealth Exhibit 3)).

The documents serve to “corroborate” Bar-do’s testimonial self-report of abuse only via a similar, albeit earlier, self-report — made in the context of a criminal offense, disturbingly similar to the instant offense. Proffering the documents as evidence, rather than simply relying on the testimony of Bardo and his mother regarding his sexual victimization, may very well have opened the door for the Commonwealth to present evidence regarding the criminal circumstances that gave rise to the documents, evidence that would have been highly prejudicial to Bardo. Not surprisingly, trial counsel made clear that he successfully sought to exclude <em>any </em>evidence relating to Bardo’s prior sexual offense against a minor. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/12/09, at 388, 414-15.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> This was a reasonable strategy.

Accordingly, we would conclude that Bardo’s claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness for failing to proffer the 1988 documents to “corroborate” his and his mother’s penalty phase testimony regarding his alleged sexual victimization fails.</p>

This kid really had no rearing as a young child or a medium child. And then he had <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>a very significant homosexual sexual abuse from age 13.” <em>Id. </em>at 529-30; <em>see also id. </em>at 561. Notably, despite three psychiatric admissions and psychiatric treatment much closer in time to Bardo’s sexual victimization and other negative childhood experiences, there is no indication in any of the psychiatric records that Bardo ever experienced, reported, or was diagnosed with any symptoms of PTSD. In contrast, a diagnosis of PTSD, or its symptoms, was rendered only in 2008 or 2009, and only by psychiatrists retained for PCRA purposes, decades after the alleged sexual abuse and sixteen years after the current offenses.</p>

Consistent with Dr. O’Brien’s opinion, the records showed that Bardo had never been treated with psychotropic medication until after his arrest for the first sexual assault of one of his nieces, and then he was similarly treated for a time after his incarceration for the current offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 622-23, 658. Dr. O’Brien also rejected the diagnosis of dysthymic disorder, which, he explained, is a chronic depression in which the affected individual has “a chronically depressed mood that occurs most of the day, more days than not, for at least two years,” and experiences “clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational ... or other important areas of functioning.” <em>Id. </em>at 657, 659. Dr. O’Brien found no evidence that Bardo exhibited any such clinically significant distress or impairment in the two years prior to the offenses, which was the most stable and quiet period of Bardo’s life, when he was continuously employed full time, functioning, not hospitalized, and undergoing counseling related to his prior offense; furthermore, although he was continuing to use alcohol socially, there was no evidence that it was impairing his ability to function or was escalating. <em>Id. </em>at 659-60; 614-15, 625, 642, 649.</p>

Thus, the testimony of Dr. O’Brien, whom the PCRA court found credible, <em>see </em>PCRA Court Opinion at 34, serves as a strong counterbalance to Dr. Berger’s opinion of Bardo’s psychiatric history and diagnoses, and their manifestation at the time of the offenses. All of the above considerations must enter into the re-weighing on collateral review of the totality of the mitigating and aggravating factors in this case. After careful review and consideration of Dr. Berger’s testimony and the above-summarized records on which he relied, we would conclude that Dr. Berger’s testimony did not support a finding that Bardo’s psychiatric problems were manifest at the time of his offenses, such as would have led to an extreme mental or emotional disturbance, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. 9711(e)(2); thus, we cannot conclude that any reasonable juror would have found this statutory mitigator, much less assigned determinative weight to it. We acknowledge that it is reasonably probable that one or more jurors may have found that Bardo’s psychiatric history and diagnoses constituted a mitigating factor pursuant to the catch-all mitigator, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). However, upon reweighing the mitigating and aggravating circumstances in light of Dr. Berger’s PCRA testimony as to Bardo’s psychiatric history and diagnoses, we would not conclude that the additional evidence <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>of mitigation would have caused any reasonable juror to conclude that the mitigating factors balanced or outweighed the aggravating circumstances. Again, we view the aggravating factors in this case as particularly egregious: the murder of a three-year-old child by strangulation, involving forceful pressure to and deliberate compression of her neck over a period of approximately four to five minutes until after she lost consciousness, while perpetrating an indecent assault of the child that caused a four-millimeter tear to her vagina, pain, and bleeding.

Dr. Blumberg’s testimony contributes little to the resolution of these questions. To support his PTSD diagnosis, Dr. Blumberg, like Dr. Berger, relied on Bardo’s self-reports that he had suffered sexual abuse as a teenager, as well as on Bardo’s self-reports of his symptoms. N.T.

On cross-examination, Dr. Blumberg acknowledged that Bardo had told him that the symptoms he had experienced from his sexual abuse as a teenager had “faded” after three to four years, <em>i.e., </em>when he was nineteen or twenty years of age, which was three years prior to the current offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 158-59.

Dr. Blumberg opined that the most serious event was Bardo’s teenage sexual abuse, but suggested further that other events could also have served as triggers, including physical abuse within the family, an auto accident, an accident at work or home, threats of injury or injury at the hands of another, and some other experience causing serious injury or fear of serious injury or death. <em>Id. </em>at 88, 152-53. Apparently, when Dr. Blumberg provided him with a diagnostic self-reporting questionnaire, Bardo claimed to have experienced all the types of traumatic events listed. <em>Id. </em>at 152-54. While Dr. Blumberg testified that an individual is more likely to develop PTSD when exposed to more types of different traumatic events, <em>id. </em>at 88, he acknowledged that he had not asked specific questions about most of the incidents Bardo reported as traumatic; hence, the timing and severity of most of Bardo’s self-reported traumatic events were unexplored. <em>Id. </em>at 154. Dr. O’Brien challenged Dr. Blumberg’s use of the self-reporting questionnaire, as well as his conclusions regarding Bardo’s PTSD symptoms and stressors: “I think that the diagnostic criteria [for PTSD] require[ ] a certain amount of specificity in terms of identifying, not only what the symptoms are with specificity, but [also that] they’re linked to the alleged trauma, the reported trauma[,] and also the trauma has to be of a certain severity. It’s not just any trauma.” N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 652.

Our conclusion is based on the facts of this case, Dr. Blumberg’s acknowledgment that Bardo had a basic appreciation of what he was doing at the time of the offenses, Dr. Blumberg’s statements concerning Bardo’s mental status and personality characteristics, and the lack of any evidence upon which to ground a finding that his mental status at the time of the offenses supported the applicability of either the § 9711(e)(2) or § 9711(e)(3) statutory mitigators.

Indeed, the evidence was uniformly to the contrary.

Another of Bardo’s experts, Dr. Lage, a pharmacologist and toxicologist, opined that with a blood alcohol level of .10%, which was his estimate of Bardo’s blood alcohol level at the time of the offenses, an individual would have impaired judgment and a loss “to some extent” of inhibitions. <em>Id. </em>at 213. Thus, the testimony of Bardo’s own experts did not establish that, at the time of the offenses, Bardo was unable to formulate the specific intent to kill because he was overwhelmed to the point of losing his faculties and sensibilities by voluntary ingestion of alcohol.

It may well be that even after hearing all of the PCRA testimony, the jury will find that the aggravating circumstances of the case still outweigh the mitigating circumstances.

Indeed, in his attempt before this Court to make that showing, Bardo merely asserts that only one prospective juror “had not read or heard anything about the case” and that 40% of prospective jurors formed an initial opinion regarding his guilt or innocence. <em>See </em>Bardo’s Brief at 67.

Furthermore, in the present posture, the PCRA court’s inquiry is not whether counsel’s failure to seek a change of venue may either have presumptively or actually caused his jury to be prejudiced against him, but rather whether counsel’s failure to obtain a venue change likely precluded an out-of-county jury from acquitting him or imposing a different penalty. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.
