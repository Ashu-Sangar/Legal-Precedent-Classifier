Wolfe attributed blame to Zierle and demanded $25,000 from Zierle’s insurer carrier, Appellant Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company, equating to half the liability limits under the applicable policy. Allstate counteroffered $1,200, which Wolfe refused.</p>
    <p id="b482-11" data-blocks='[["BL_482.11",482,[249,1937,1150,311]]]'>Wolfe then instituted a personal injury action against Zierle seeking compensatory damages grounded in negligence.

A jury trial ensued, and Wolfe secured a verdict and judgment against Zierle comprised of $15,000 in compensatory damages and $50,000 in punitive damages. Allstate proceeded to satisfy the compensatory component of the judgment only. As to the punitive-damages portion, Wolfe and Zierle entered into an agreement whereby Wolfe committed to forbear from executing in exchange for an assignment from Zierle of all claims arising under the policy which he might possess against Allstate.</p>

This position was grounded on two main premises. First, Allstate explained, under <em>Ash v. Continental Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/593/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="593 Pa. 523" data-case-ids="3248128" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0523-01">593 Pa. 523</a>, <a href="/pa/593/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="932 A.2d 877" data-case-ids="3248128,3249517,8348767,8348865" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0523-01,/pa/593/0522-01,/a2d/932/0877-01,/a2d/932/0877-02">932 A.2d 877</a> (2007), Section 8371 created a form of an unliquidated tort claim. <em>See id. </em>at 536, <a href="/pa/593/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="932 A.2d 877" data-case-ids="3248128,3249517,8348767,8348865" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0523-01,/pa/593/0522-01,/a2d/932/0877-01,/a2d/932/0877-02">932 A.2d at 885</a> (holding, in determining the appropriate limitations period, that “an action under § 8371 is a statutorily-created tort action”). Second, per longstanding Pennsylvania law, unliquidated tort claims generally are personal and cannot be assigned to third parties. <em>See, e.g., Sensenig v. Pa. R.R. Co., </em><a href="/pa/229/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="229 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="971841" data-case-paths="/pa/229/0168-01">229 Pa. 168</a>, 172, <a href="/citations/?q=78%20A.%2091" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="78 A. 91">78 A. 91</a>, 91 (1910) (“A right of action strictly personal is not assignable and the general doctrine is, both in law and equity, that a right of action for pure tort is not the subject of assignment^]”).

Allstate explains that the prohibition against assignment of tort claims has been interposed to preclude champerty, or the involvement of intermeddlers pursuing litigation for profit-making purposes. <em>See, e.g., Marsh v. W. N.Y. &amp; Pa. Ry. Co., </em><a href="/pa/204/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="204 Pa. 229" data-case-ids="927455" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0229-01">204 Pa. 229</a>, 231, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.%201001" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="53 A. 1001">53 A. 1001</a>, 1002 (1903) (“ ‘[N]o encouragement should be given to litigation by the introduction of parties to enforce those rights which others are not disposed to enforce.’ ” (quoting <em>Prosser v.

In this regard, Allstate categorizes assignees who have received judgments in third-party tort actions as such intermeddlers, since, according to the carrier at least, their only legitimate expectation is to be <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>compensated for their own injuries.

We realize that, conceptually, such overlay is by no means the only, reasonable treatment, and a number of other jurisdictions have recognized a common-law cause of action grounded in tort theory arising out of bad-faith conduct of insurance companies directed toward their insureds. <em>See, e.g., Gruenberg v.

Obviously, we have not undertaken to consider whether assignments should be viewed as substantive or procedural for separation-of-powers purposes, <em>see </em>Pa. Const, art. V, § 10(c) (delegating procedural rulemaking authority to this Court), because it is beyond the scope of our present inquiry. Our fundamental conclusion here is, simply, that we discern no legislative intent to preclude assignability of damages claims under Section 8371 to the degree these have been reposited into a preexisting liability scheme which permits assignments.</p>
