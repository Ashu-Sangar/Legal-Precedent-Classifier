She agreed in the contract that she would pay for repairs for any damage the car incurred during the rental period, along with any administrative, loss-of-use, and diminishment-in-value fees. The contract set forth formulas for calculating the loss-of-use and diminishment-in-value fees. It also contained a power-of-attorney clause allowing Enterprise to request payment for any unpaid “claims, damages, liabilities, or rental charges” directly from Appellee’s insurance carrier or credit card company. When Appellee returned the car following the rental, an Enterprise employee informed her that she was responsible for a scratch on the car. Enterprise later sent Appellee a letter with an estimate for repairs and an invoice for administrative, loss-of-use, and diminishment-of-value fees, for a total of $840.42.

The court also pointed out that Enterprise had stipulated that it would cease its collection efforts only if the trial court granted its motion. In support of its decision, the Superior Court cited to a case it had decided in support of the proposition that this Court has engaged in the “consistent reminder that the UTPCPL ‘should [be] liberally construe[d] ... in order to effect the legislative goal of consumer protection.’ ” <em>Grimes, supra, </em>at 339 (quoting <em>Fazio v.

Enterprise argues that if that proposition was correct, then anyone can meet the “ascertainable loss” requirement simply by finding a lawyer to bring a lawsuit, without actually suffering a loss of money or property. Enterprise criticizes the Superior Court’s application of the notion that the UTPCPL should be liberally construed as leading to a result that is contrary to the Act’s plain language.

Appellee’s Brief at 45. She emphasizes that the General Assembly added the provision for costs and fees so that consumers who had been deprived of small amounts of money could afford to bring UTPCPL suits. Appellee argues that, in order to effectuate that purpose, we should construe the “ascertainable loss” requirement liberally and conclude that her allegations suffice. She also argues that we should not permit Enterprise to deprive her of standing by agreeing to cease its collection efforts, and thereby avoid the UTPCPL’s strictures.

Appellee never asserted in her primary pleading, or admitted in a response to Enterprise’s pleadings, a loss of money or property due to Enterprise’s alleged UTPCPL violations.

This express authorization of attorney fees awards is “in addition to other relief provided in this section,” which “other relief’ encompasses the damages made available as compensation for ascertainable losses. The fees are derivative and consequential. Section 9.2(a)’s plain language makes it readily apparent that the General Assembly deemed ascer<a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>tainable losses and attorneys’ fees to be distinct items for redress. Appellee’s construction of the “ascertainable loss” element as including attorney fees is unreasonable, and contradicted by the plain language of the statute. Moreover, as Enterprise has pointed out, Appellee’s reading would allow a plaintiff to manufacture the “ascertainable loss” required to bring a private UTPCPL claim simply by obtaining counsel to bring a private UTPCPL claim; we presume that such an unreasonable result was not intended by the General Assembly. Because Appellee’s argument is not premised upon a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language, neither her resort to the asserted purpose for which the Act allows costs and attorneys’ fees, nor the Superior Court’s reliance on the “deterrence value” of the UTPCPL, is persuasive. In either case, we would still be left with the untenable result that a plaintiff could incur an “ascertainable loss” simply by hiring counsel.</p>
    <p id="b502-4" data-blocks='[["BL_502.4",502,[253,1274,1149,580]]]'>A similar infirmity attends Appellee’s additional assertion that Enterprise’s position will weaken enforcement of the Act. Moreover, that argument runs counter to the overall statutory scheme. The UTPCPL’s private right of action is not a general-purpose enforcement provision. Rather, the Act confers on the Attorney General and district attorneys the power to bring actions in the public interest to enforce the Act. <em>See </em>73 P.S. § 201-4. Only those who can meet the requirements of the UTPCPL’s private cause of action may bring a personal action, and Appellee’s allegations simply do not satisfy the statutory “ascertainable loss” element.</p>

In both cases, the plaintiff had alleged a specific loss of money. In <em>Jarzyna, </em>the plaintiff asserted that his landlord withheld his security deposit; in <em>Agliori, </em>the plaintiff claimed that he had been deprived of insurance benefits. As for Enterprise’s stipulation, we do not dispute the general proposition that a defendant should not be permitted to evade a legal obligation by stipulating away a plaintiffs standing.
