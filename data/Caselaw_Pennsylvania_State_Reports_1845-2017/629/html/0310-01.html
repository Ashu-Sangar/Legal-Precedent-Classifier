    <p id="b346-12" data-blocks='[["BL_346.11",346,[260,1335,1150,149]]]'>AND NOW, this 25th day of November, 2014, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED. The issues, as stated by petitioner, are:</p>
    <blockquote id="b346-13" data-blocks='[["BL_346.12",346,[304,1508,1106,526]]]'>(1) Whether the Commonwealth Court erred when it held that FT Holdings’ objection to standing was untimely and the issue of standing was waived where, pursuant to the Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court holding <em>Spahn v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/602/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="602 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="4195040" data-case-paths="/pa/602/0083-01">602 Pa. 83</a>, <a href="/pa/602/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="977 A.2d 1132" data-case-ids="4195040,7297499" data-case-paths="/pa/602/0083-01,/a2d/977/1132-01">977 A.2d 1132</a> (2009), standing to appear before the SBA is fundamentally different than standing to appeal a [Board] decision to the Court of Common Pleas and the issue of standing was, therefore, timely raised by FT Holdingfs’] Motion to Quash.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b346-14" data-blocks='[["BL_346.13",346,[302,2057,1105,311]]]'>(2) Whether, pursuant to the Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court’s holding in <em>Spahn v.
