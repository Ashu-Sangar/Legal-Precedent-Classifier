When Robin vomited blood, Appellant wiped her mouth with a rag and continued to rape her. When he finished, he turned her over and stabbed her multiple times in the neck. Appellant threw Robin’s clothes, the knife, and the bloody rag into a nearby sewer.

As Appellant was being released from the emergency room at approximately 1:54 p.m., the police approached Appellant in the waiting room and asked him to accompany them to their office.

At trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence from a number of witnesses, including Robin’s mother, Robin’s sister-in-law, Ms. Britton, several police officers, the doctor who examined Robin after the first rape, and the chief forensic pathologist from the coroner’s office.</p>

Accordingly, as the Commonwealth was seeking the death penalty, the jury remained empanelled for a separate penalty-phase hearing. On October 13, 1999, after hearing additional testimony, the same jury unanimously found two aggravating circumstances: Appellant committed the killing while in the perpetration of a felony (rape) and Appellant was subject to a PFA order restricting his contact ■with the victim when he killed her.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The jury found no mitigating circumstances.

After Appellant unsuccessfully sought to withdraw his guilty plea at CC No. 9713318, on February 10, 2000, the trial court sentenced Appellant to eight years to twenty years in prison for the September 10, 1997 rape to be served consecutively to both the death sentence and the sentence imposed for the September 1,1997 rape and related offenses. The trial court imposed no further penalty for the remaining counts. On direct appeal, this Court affirmed Appellant’s judgments of sentence. <em>See Mitchell I, supra.</em>

However, at the PCRA hearing, Dr. Charles Wetli, a forensic pathologist, testified that the report from Robin’s rectal swab was negative for seminal fluid in the anal or rectal areas, and although there was sperm inside of her vagina, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether the ejaculate was “fresh.” N.T. 10/15/12, PCRA <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>hearing, at 493-94.

Moreover, there was no evidence the interrogation was so manipulative or coercive that it deprived Appellant of his ability to make a free and unconstrained decision to confess. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Thus, similar to his neuropsychological testing issue, Appellant has failed to demonstrate he suffered from a borderline personality disorder at the time of the murder such that penalty-phase counsel was deficient in investigating the matter further. <em>See Spotz, supra </em>(discussing penalty-phase counsel’s duty includes investigating only reasonably available mitigating evidence and does not <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>include investigating every conceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how unlikely it is to assist the defendant in sentencing).</p>
