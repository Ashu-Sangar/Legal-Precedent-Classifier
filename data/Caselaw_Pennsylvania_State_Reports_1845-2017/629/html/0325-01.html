As discussed below, while there are remedies available to a court faced with an agency which is not providing reasonable efforts, refusing a properly proven termination of parental rights petition, and thus harming an innocent child, is not among them. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and reinstate the trial court’s decision terminating father’s parental rights.</p>

Although she was placed briefly with maternal relatives and another foster family, Child has lived most of her life with her current foster family. The trial court found that she has bonded with this family, who is willing to adopt her.</p>

Additionally, it is beyond cavil that the protection of children, and in particular the need to provide permanency for dependent children, is a compelling state interest. In balancing these interests, the General Assembly has created a detailed system setting forth the limited situations which would result in removal of children from their parents and termination of parental rights. Moreover, the statutory construct requires specific determinations by the trial court regarding the proper placement and permanency goals of the children at each step of the process. Ultimately, the grounds of termination must be demonstrated by the state by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Santosky v.

Yet, after determining faults of an agency do not inhibit termination — thereby deciding the issue we granted — the majority elaborates further by describing potential remedies or financial penalties that courts might impose against agencies neglecting to make reasonable efforts and follow court orders and permanency goals. <em>See </em>Majority Op., at 345-47, 105 A.3d at 674-75. In my view, the majority’s discussion, particularly as to federal reimbursements and federal funding available to child-welfare services, serves only as <em>dictum; </em>it is inapposite to the instant case and beyond the scope of the issues we granted.
