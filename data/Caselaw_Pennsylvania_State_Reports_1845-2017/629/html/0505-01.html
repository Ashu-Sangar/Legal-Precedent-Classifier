The Commonwealth Court held that the post-election forgiveness of debt would constitute a “contribution” to the candidate’s political campaign under Section 1001(6) of the Code, and, thus, was subject to the $10,000 per year contribution limitation set forth in Section 1001(2). For the reasons set forth herein, we hold that the law firm’s forgiveness of debt would not constitute a contribution to the candidate’s political campaign as the debt at issue was not incurred “for use in ... influencing the election of the candidate.” <em>Id. </em>§ 1001(6).

Prior to the election, Thomas Knox, who was also a democratic mayoral candidate, filed a challenge to Brady’s nomination petition, alleging defects in his statement of financial interests. The political campaign committee, “the Friends of Bob Brady Campaign Committee” (“Committee”), hired Cozen O’Connor (“the Firm”) to represent Brady in the litigation. There is no evidence suggesting that the Firm agreed to provide representation <em>pro bono </em>or at a discounted rate. The Firm successfully litigated the ballot challenge, keeping Brady on the ballot. Brady, however, lost his bid for the nomination.</p>

In making this determination, the Ethics Board compared the Code’s definition of “contribution” to the definitions of the same term in both state and federal campaign finance laws. Significantly, Section 1001(6) of the Code defines a “contribution” as “[m]oney, gifts, forgiveness of debts, loans, or things having a monetary value incurred or received by a candidate or his/her agent for use in advocating or influencing the election of the candidate.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Phila.

Ethics Board Advisory Opinion at 2-3.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> It relied on the Federal Election Commission’s interpretation of the federal statute as prohibiting post-election fundraising that exceeds contribution limits based on the policy that, otherwise, candidates could evade contribution restrictions by running their campaigns at a deficit, and later collecting contributions in excess of the Federal Election Code’s limits after the election. <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>

The Firm also sought a declaration that legal expenses incurred by the Committee were not “expenditures,” and, therefore, funds raised by a campaign to defray such expenses were not subject to the contribution limits of the Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

It held that the Firm did not have a direct interest in the litigation as its relationship with the Committee regarding the debt was too tenuous, and that an advisory opinion, such as that of the Ethics Board, is not a final adjudication subject to review by the court.</p>

The Firm suggests that here, City Council’s amendment of the Philadelphia Code materially changed the existing law going forward by expanding it to regulate post-election liquidation of campaign debts. Thus, it concludes, such change makes it clear that the prior law, in effect in 2007, did not regulate post-election liquidation of campaign debts.</p>

According to the Firm, the federal campaign finance law is irrelevant to the interpretation of a local ordinance.</p>

Code § 20-1001(6). It views the Commonwealth <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>Court’s analysis as conflating the defense of a challenge to a nomination petition, which, if successful, allows the candidate to remain on the ballot, and the purportedly very different act of actually influencing the outcome of the election. The Firm acknowledges that debt incurred for defense of a lawsuit commenced against a candidate may have some collateral effect on an election, but contends that it cannot reasonably be encompassed by the Code’s “contribution” definition. Rather, the Firm interprets the term “influencing” as requiring a showing that the debt forgiven was incurred to urge a prospective voter to choose one candidate over another-ie., electioneering that a political campaign contributor with donative intent would promote.</p>
    <p id="b556-4" data-blocks='[["BL_556.4",556,[260,1029,1151,358]]]'>The Firm argues further that the Commonwealth Court’s interpretation of “influencing” as anything that “affects or alters an election by indirect or intangible means or that has an effect on the condition or development of an election,” is far too broad because it ignores whether the effect on the election is intentional, incidental, or wholly unanticipated and unintended.

    <p id="b556-5" data-blocks='[["BL_556.5",556,[258,1413,1152,563]]]'>The Firm emphasizes that it is undisputed that the legal fees were incurred solely to mount a legal defense on behalf of Brady against an opponent’s challenge to his nomination petition; and not to influence the outcome of the election by urging the citizenry to cast their votes for Brady. By the undisputed facts and the unambiguous statutory language, monies received by the campaign for the express purposes of defraying the cost of such involuntary obligations cannot be considered “contributions” under § 20-1001(6), and, thus, the “contribution limits” of § 20-1002 cannot apply to such solicitations.</p>

      <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>Finally, in its fourth contention, the Firm submits that the Commonwealth Court misinterpreted this Court’s decision in <em>Cozen I </em>by concluding that it had standing only to seek a declaratory judgment as to whether it could forgive the Committee’s legal debt <em>in toto </em>without violating the Code’s campaign contribution limitations, and not whether it could seek a declaration regarding the Committee’s ability to engage in fundraising to pay the debt. Ignoring that our allocatur grant in <em>Cozen I </em>was limited to the Firm’s standing in terms of its own ability to forgive the debt at one time and <em>in toto, </em>the Firm emphasizes that this Court instructed in <em>Cozen I </em>that “upon remand, the parties are free to move forward regarding the merits of the case.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=67%20A.2d%20380" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="67 A.2d 380">Id.,</a> </em>18 A.3d at 470 n. 5.

It acknowledges that the definition does not discuss explicitly whether post-election contributions are regulated, but emphasizes that the Code defines “contribution” as including “forgiveness of debt” where the debt was “incurred” to influence an election. The Ethics Board asserts that the only logical way to interpret “incurred” is to find that it modifies the term “debt,” thus, forgiveness of a debt that was itself incurred to influence the election is a covered contribution. It contends that the Firm’s interpretation, excluding post-election transactions, gives no effect to the term “incurred.” The ordinance, it reasons, must be interpreted so as to give effect to all of its language.</p>

    <p id="b558-4" data-blocks='[["BL_558.4",558,[255,720,1150,730]]]'>The Ethics Board also argues that the Commonwealth Court’s reasoning based upon analogous federal law is sound and should be upheld. It reiterates that federal law, like the Code, is silent as to whether a “contribution” includes post-election debt forgiveness. Nevertheless, federal courts and the Federal Ethics Commission (“FEC”) have interpreted the federal campaign finance law to encompass post-election contributions for purposes of contribution limits for the same policy reasons that apply here, i.e., that “exempting post-election contributions ... would provide an opportunity for the exception to swallow the rule” by allowing candidates simply to run up debts and defer all fundraising until after the election. <em>United States v.

It asserts that the decision relied upon by the Firm for the proposition that a change in a statute indicates a change of legislative intent, <em>Midvale, supra, </em>is a sixty year-old Superior Court decision. More germane, the Ethics Board argues, is this Court’s <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>decision clarifying that a change in language, at most, “ordinarily” indicates a change in intent. <em>See Masland v.

Rather than altering existing law, it contends, City Council enacted the 2010 amendments, in recognition of the Ethic Board’s previous interpretation of “contribution” as including post-election activities, and codifying it to avoid all doubt.

Faced with the undefined term, “influence,” it asserts that the Commonwealth Court relied on the well-established rule of statutory construction that courts may look to “common and approved usage,” including dictionary definitions, when interpreting undefined terms. The dictionary defines “influence,” in relevant part, as “to affect or alter by an indirect or intangible means” or “to have an effect on the condition or development of.” Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary at 641 (11th ed.2003). The Ethics Board maintains that this definition is sufficiently broad to support the Commonwealth <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>Court’s conclusion that fees incurred to secure the right to appear on the ballot in the 2007 Democratic mayoral primary necessarily influenced the outcome of that election. In the Ethics Board’s view, nothing can be more fundamental to the outcome of an election than who appears on the ballot. It maintains that candidates spend significant time and money to secure a sufficient number of valid signatures to appear on the ballot precisely because the determination of which candidates are listed on the ballot influences the election.</p>

Code § 20-1001(1). The Commonwealth Court’s holding that a campaign committee’s unpaid legal fees should be classified as a debt rather than an expenditure, the Ethics Board argues, has no bearing on whether the post-election forgiveness of the legal fee debt constitutes a “contribution.”</p>

It submits there is no textual basis in the Philadelphia Code or the Commonwealth Court’s opinion for the argument that if a debt incursion was not an “expenditure” then the debt’s liquidation is unregulated. Moreover, the Ethics Board asserts, the Firm’s argument would lead to an absurd result in that the forgiveness of campaign debt of any sort would be unregulated solely because the original incursion of the debt was not an “expenditure” by the candidate. It concludes that the express inclusion of “forgiveness of debt” in the definition of “contribution” puts the Firm’s erroneous contention to rest.</p>

It contends that our ruling in <em>Cozen I </em>did not encompass the Firm’s request for a declaration regarding the Committee’s ability to raise funds to pay the debt. The Ethics Board maintains that this Court limited the parameters of the Firm’s declaratory judgment action in 2009, with its initial narrow allocatur grant, and in 2011, in <em>Cozen I. </em>Since then, it asserts, both the Commonwealth Court and the trial court have uniformly held that this declaratory judgment action involves only the Firm’s desire to clarify “its own right” to forgive the total outstanding legal fee debt owed to it by the Committee, without running afoul of the Code’s campaign contribution limitations.</p>

We recognize that, as found by the Commonwealth Court and advocated by the Ethics Board, this policy concern is akin to that espoused by the federal courts and the FEC when interpreting the federal campaign finance law, which, like the Code at issue, does not include language in the definition of "contribution” extending the term expressly to include post-election contributions. <em>See e.g. United States v. Crop Growers Corporation, </em><a href="/f-supp/954/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="954 F.

Having concluded that legal fee debt incurred to defend Brady in ballot litigation was not incurred "for use in advocating or influencing the election,” we need not elaborate on the Firm’s contention that the Commonwealth Court’s holding that the Committee’s unpaid legal fee debt is not an "expenditure” is incompatible with its ruling that the debt constituted a "contribution.” Summarily, we note our agreement with the Ethics Board's rebuttal that the Commonwealth Court found no "expenditure” solely because the Committee had never paid the legal fees, thus, there was no "payment, distribution, loan or advancement of money or any valuable thing,” as set forth in the definition of "expenditure.” Phila. Code § 20-1001(1). Such ruling has no bearing on whether post-election forgiveness of the legal fee debt constitutes a "contribution.”</p>
