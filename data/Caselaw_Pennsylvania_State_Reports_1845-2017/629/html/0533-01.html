At trial, appellee testified that Draper and another individual committed the crime; he claimed he was elsewhere at the time and uninvolved. He testified he did not know the victim, had never seen him before, and had no reason to be angry with him or wish to harm him.

The court held the Commonwealth violated <em>Brady </em>and found appellee identified a specific claim, Norwood’s homosexual ephebophilia, which he was unable to discover or develop due to interference by the Commonwealth. The interference consisted of withholding or “sanitizing” three specific pieces of evidence: a statement by Norwood’s wife, a statement by the pastor of appellee’s church, and notes made by the prosecutor.</p>

She said Norwood once woke her at 2 a.m. and asked her for money while a young male stood in the hall outside their bedroom. She saw Norwood load stereo equipment into his car and drive away with the young male. She told police she believed this to be a kidnapping; when Norwood returned <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>home around 9 a.m., he said he was abducted but escaped by using psychology on his captors.

    <p id="b576-4" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[259,509,1151,566]]]'>The second statement was from appellee’s pastor, who was also a friend of Norwood. The pastor told police Norwood worked with and counseled young males in the church for many years. Omitted from the 1984 activity sheet was the pastor’s suspicion that Norwood may have been a homosexual, and that five years earlier, the pastor received a complaint from a mother alleging Norwood propositioned her 17-year-old son for sex. The pastor also repeated for police the “kidnapping” story told by Norwood’s wife — this was included with the pastor’s statements in the 1984 police activity sheet, which had been disclosed to the defense.</p>

Appellee timely filed his PCRA petition within 60 days of learning the substance of Draper’s affidavit. Furthermore, the court noted appellee could not have known the Commonwealth interfered with his ability to present evidence of Norwood’s homosexual ephebophilia until the underlying evidence was uncovered during the hearing held as a result of Draper’s affidavit; therefore, appellee timely filed the amendment and supplement to his PCRA petition in order to particularize his <em>Brady </em>claim just three days after government files were opened. Accordingly, the court concluded appellee met his burden under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(l)(i), and subsection (b)(2), so it had jurisdiction to grant relief. Finding appellee established his <em>Brady </em>claim, the court held he was entitled to a new penalty hearing. The court denied relief regarding the guilt phase.

The PCRA court below should have decided the claim actually presented to it, while maintaining a proper perspective. And, it has become apparent that PCRA courts throughout Pennsylvania need to be vigilant and circumspect when it comes to the activities of this particular advocacy group, to ensure that the FCDO does not turn PCRA proceedings, and in particular serial proceedings, into a circus where FCDO lawyers are the ringmasters, with their parrots and puppets as a sideshow.</p>

Draper claimed that he had told the arresting officers, as well as the prosecutor, that the victim, Amos Norwood, was a homosexual, that Norwood and appellee were involved in a sexual relationship, and that the murder was about that relationship. What was obfuscated by Draper and the FCDO was that this information could only have been learned through appellee’s own communications with Draper, since appellee obviously knew his “true” motivation; or else it was just Draper’s irrelevant opinion. Draper further claimed that police told him to testify that the motive for the murder was robbery. Appellee also included a “declaration” from Poindexter (who had testified for the Commonwealth at the guilt phase of trial), claiming he had learned from police that the victim would sometimes meet gay men in a house or an apartment.</p>

The argument was akin to a “bad faith” argument, <em>i.e., </em>the Commonwealth had argued that a churchgoing man was robbed and murdered by appellee and Draper, despite knowing that appellee may have had a different relationship with the victim, and a different motivation that he was keeping to himself.</p>

In addition, the Draper and Poindexter <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>statements — conveniently secured by the FCDO only after losing in federal court — rehashed the same information concerning the victim’s character and appellee’s “true” motivation for the murder already litigated in the first PCRA proceeding. Thus, the FCDO’s last-ditch <em>Brady </em>claim consisted of evidence already known to appellee, a claim already litigated by appellee, and a contrary defense theory springing from an admission that appellee perjured himself at trial. The PCRA court should have taken the frivolous issue as the FCDO presented it and dismissed it as time-barred. The court inexplicably did not; and instead, the frivolous issue now before this Court is a different <em>Brady </em>claim never raised by appellee until prompted to do so by the PCRA court, after the issue was uncovered by the PCRA court itself only by losing sight of fundamental precepts, including its role as neutral arbiter.</p>

In concisely summarizing why the PCRA court erred in finding that appellee’s reconfigured-by-the-PCRA-court claim did not qualify under the governmental interference exception, based upon information appellee himself had known before trial, and supplemental information which he secured for use in a prior PCRA petition over fifteen years before, the Commonwealth succinctly explains:</p>
      <blockquote id="b599-7" data-blocks='[["BL_599.6",599,[202,1674,1087,659]]]'>When, at trial, defendant considered it in his interest to deny any sexual relationship with his victims so as to distance himself from their deaths, he made the strategic decision, independent of any information in the government’s possession, to do so. And when that did not work, and he decided it was in his interest to instead claim in his first PCRA petition that he killed the victims [both here and in the Hamilton case] because they sexually abused him, he had no difficulty marshalling evidence outside the government’s possession to support that version of events. At no point was his ability to defend against the charges, or to present any claim, constrained by the actions of the trial prosecutor or any other government official. Consequently, his untimely fourth PCRA petition, which he filed more than twenty years after his judgments of sentence became final, did not satisfy the governmental-interference exception to the one-year filing deadline. His petition was time-barred, and the PCRA court’s order purporting to grant relief was a jurisdictional nullity that should be reversed.</blockquote>

In point of fact, appellee never so much as offered to prove that, but for the alleged non-disclosure, he would have presented evidence detailing his ongoing, prior sexual relationship with the victim, and then claimed that the relationship was why he murdered the victim. Furthermore, the decision to testify was defendant’s alone; his trial counsel's role was limited to consultation. In this regard, it is notable that, in the prior PCRA proceeding, where appellee litigated the same basic claim, trial counsel testified that he had negotiated a plea deal where appellee would receive life in prison — the best possible circumstance where appellee faced the death penalty, had substantial aggravators, and the fact of the robbery meant that his best, realistic prospect was a conviction for second-degree murder, which carries a mandatory life sentence. Counsel consulted with appellee. But, counsel testified, appellee was adamant that he was not willing to exchange his prayer of a hope for an outright acquittal for a term of life imprisonment. Appellee told counsel he would rather be executed than spend his life in jail. No claim but innocence could lead to acquittal, and appellee decided to go that route by then perjuring himself.</p>
