It also raises the question of whether this is a strict liability crime, and if not, requires us to determine the appropriate <em>mens rea </em>for such offense. We hold § 4701 is not a strict liability crime; the <em>mens rea </em>for this offense is the Crimes Code’s “default” culpability provision, <em>id., </em>§ 302(c). As such, there was sufficient evidence to support appellant’s conviction. We further hold that while the trial court erred in its instructions to the <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>jury regarding intent, such error was harmless here.

The board decided to sell a 209-acre parcel of land on which the former Haverford State Mental Hospital was located. Appellant and Commissioner George Twardy comprised the “liaison committee” authorized to negotiate with potential buyers on behalf of the township. The firm of Goldenberg-Pohlig (GP) entered a preliminary sales agreement with the board, pursuant to which GP would pay $30.65 million for 61 acres of the parcel, on which it would develop residential properties and build six ball fields; GP paid a refundable $5 million deposit to the township.</p>

One of their replacements, Commissioner Andrew Lewis, believed the agreement with GP was unworkable; he learned GP intended to develop an additional 15 acres beyond what it paid for, and the ball fields could not be constructed due to steep topography. The board formally rescinded the prior preliminary sales agreement and authorized the continuation of negotiations with GP.</p>

The parties subsequently verbally altered its terms, such that GP would donate an additional $500,000 to the township for construction of a nature center or walking trails on the parcel; in exchange, the condominiums and carriage houses were more loosely designated as “age-targeted” and GP was no longer obligated to construct single-family homes. The board formally approved these new terms and authorized preparation of a written final sales agreement.</p>

Trial, 11/19/07, at 104. When another commissioner asked appellant why GP would consider pre-paying these taxes, appellant responded, “[W]ell, maybe they want to accelerate this process, get it moving.” <em>Id. </em>Appellant expressed displeasure with the prospect of budget cuts and stated the township “should have income coming in from [the parcel].” <em>Id. </em>Lewis suggested he and appellant call a representative of GP so appellant could present his proposal. <em>Id.</em>

Lewis informed Lawry the board was addressing a budgetary shortfall and told him appellant had a proposal. Appellant then said to Lawry, “[C]all it extortion, call it what you will. We need $500,000, and we’ll accelerate the zoning. We’ll get you the zoning approvals you need and accelerate the process.” <em>Id., </em>at 112. Lewis recalled Lawry asked whether the $500,000 was included in the $17.5 million, and appellant indicated it would be added to the purchase price. <em>See </em>N.T. Trial, 11/20/07, at 93. Lawry responded he was not in a position to answer but would discuss the matter with others at GP and get back in touch with appellant and Lewis. A few minutes later, Lewis called Lawry back and told him, “I want no part of that conversation. Haverford Township is not in the business of selling zoning.” N.T. Trial, 11/19/07, at 113.

The Commonwealth contends the evidence proved appellant specifically linked the township’s expeditious zoning approval to the payment of extra monies by GP; the township, an entity in which appellant was interested as a politically elected official, a public servant, and a taxpayer, would receive an extra $500,000 if appellant’s solicitation was successful.

Neither the plain language of Section 302, nor our prior caselaw, requires the automatic application of Section 302’s default culpability requirements in every situation where a criminal statute does not expressly state a requisite level of culpability for the conduct it seeks to penalize, and there is no other indication the legislature intended to make the offense one of strict liability. Rather, Section 302 has a narrower application: it applies only where the “culpability sufficient to establish a material element of an offense is not prescribed by law.” 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 302 (emphasis added). Consequently, in <em>Commonwealth v. Ludwig, </em><a href="/pa/583/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="583 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="687707" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0006-01">583 Pa. 6</a>, <a href="/pa/583/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="874 A.2d 623" data-case-ids="687707,8954766" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0006-01,/a2d/874/0623-01">874 A.2d 623</a> (2005), even though the statute establishing the offense of drug delivery resulting in death did not contain an express culpability standard, we refused to apply Section 302(c) as the default culpability requirement. Our refusal was based on the fact that the statute defined the crime as “third-degree murder.” We deemed the legislature’s choice of those specific words, coupled with our prior case law designating malice as the proper mental state for third-degree murder, to reflect its intent to <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>incorporate the <em>mens rea </em>for third-degree murder into the statute.</p>

Accordingly, even when the legislature does not use specific culpability standards of intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently in a non-strict liability criminal statute, if a legislative intent to establish a minimum level of culpability can, nonetheless, be discerned from the legislature’s utilization of other language indicating a particular <em>mens rea, </em>resort to Section 302 is unnecessary.
