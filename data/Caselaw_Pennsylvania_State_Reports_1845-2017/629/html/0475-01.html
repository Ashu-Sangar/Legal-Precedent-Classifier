In light of the unique circumstances of the instant matter wherein the Commonwealth conceded continued questioning of the unconversable child complainant on direct examination would have been futile, and the juvenile court suggested she be removed from the witness stand, we hold the admission of the recorded forensic interview of the child complainant violated the juvenile accused’s right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>

Thinking the redness was a rash, Mother applied Vaseline to the affected area and called N.C.’s father who also was Grandmother’s boyfriend. N.C.’s father told Mother that N.C. had not been at the home all day, and she, thus, believed his absence meant it was not possible for N.C. to have touched A.D. inappropriately.</p>

Upon receiving this new information, Mother took A.D. to the Brockway Police Department where she informed the Chief of Police of A.D.’s allegations. An investigation ensued pursuant to which A.D. was questioned by a forensic interviewer at Western Pennsylvania Cares for Kids Child Advocacy Center (hereinafter “Western Pennsylvania Cares”), a facility wherein trained individuals interview children who have been abused or who are suspected of having been abused. A.D. disclosed to the forensic interviewer that N.C. had touched her pudendum, and she demonstrated digital penetration on an anatomical doll after making this revelation. Following November 5, 2011, and the interview at Western Pennsylvania Cares, A.D. told Mother at least two or three additional times that N.C. “touched her pee pee.”</p>

The juvenile court further noted it was uncontested that A.D.’s out-of-court statements were relevant to the charges <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>brought against N.C., but it found that certain statements she had made to Mother would be inadmissible at the adjudicatory hearing because they lacked sufficient indicia of reliability in that the specific time at which they were made and the circumstances surrounding those spontaneous statements were not clear. Notwithstanding, the juvenile court did determine that as the time and date of A.D.’s initial assertions to Mother and of those she made during the forensic interview were known, the Commonwealth would be allowed to introduce at the adjudicatory hearing the declarations A.D. made to her Mother on November 5, 2011, as well as the complete videotaped interview made at Western Pennsylvania Cares on November 23, 2011, provided that A.D. would testify at that hearing. <em>See </em>Trial Court Opinion, 4/17/12 at 4-6 and Order of Court, 4/17/12.</p>

A.D. shook her head when asked if anything bad had ever happened to her around N.C. and failed to react at all when the prosecutor queried if anything had happened to her while she was with N.C. that she did not like, at which time A.D.’s father requested that he be permitted to encourage A.D. to speak. <em>Id. </em>Defense counsel objected, and a short recess was taken so that A.D. could be removed from the courtroom. Defense counsel then expounded that the basis for his objection was the concern that any participation in the questioning by A.D.’s father would affect her responses. <em>Id. </em>at 29-31. At this early stage of the proceeding, the prosecutor stated “[A.D.] clearly does not want to talk about this. That’s obviously, for the [c]ourt to decide, but I would submit that she does not want to talk about N.C.” <em>Id. </em>at 30.

She replied “Yeah” when the prosecutor inquired: “Can you — Show me that you can talk. Can you say yes? ... Can you prove to [the trial court] that you can talk? You can say yes to him. Can you say yes? ... Now, let’s keep talking instead of just nodding your head, okay? Can we keep talking?” <em>Id. </em>at 33-34.
