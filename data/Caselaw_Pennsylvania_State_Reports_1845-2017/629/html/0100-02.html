The objection was overruled, and <em>voir dire </em>was conducted in the same manner as it had been the previous day, i.e. — the parties exercised for cause challenges, and then the Commonwealth exercised its one remaining peremptory challenge.

The next day, they picked up a woman named Sara Stayton and decided to rob a drug dealer she arranged for them to meet in the Aramingo Avenue ShopRite parking lot. According to Reiner, when the dealer did not appear, Appellant got out of the Mitsubishi and approached McPeak. Reiner saw Appellant pull out a pistol, but he returned empty handed, and the trio drove away. They soon encountered Willis, whom Appellant then robbed with the pistol. Reiner testified that after robbing Willis, he and Appellant bought cocaine and heroin and got high in the car. In the meantime, police had been notified that a black Mitsubishi was involved in a robbery in the neighborhood. When a police cruiser began following Reiner, a car chase ensued, ending when Reiner crashed the Mitsubishi. Reiner fled in one direction, carrying the pistol.

We do not view this single instance of combining the characteristics of Rules 631(E)(1) and (2) to require that most serious remedy of a new trial. As the Superior Court expressed in <em>Pittman, </em>“[i]t is only when the court permits the [jury] selection process to impugn the fundamental qualities of competence, fairness and impartiality that we may conclude that a ‘palpable abuse of discretion’ has been committed.” <em>Pittman, </em><a href="/pa-super/320/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="320 Pa.

Even if the method of <em>voir dire </em>employed here is viewed as an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court, Appellant is not entitled to a new trial as the result of the error. Appellant has consistently argued that he was prejudiced by the trial court’s instruction <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>to the parties to begin making their peremptory challenge decisions before examining the entire jury pool. This Court has formulated the rules for jury selection to specifically allow for a method by which the parties exercise their challenges without such knowledge. Underlying our disagreement with Appellant’s insistence that he is entitled to a new trial is our opinion that the method of <em>voir dire </em>employed simply did not deprive Appellant of that which Rule 631 provides. Appellant urges that his exercise of peremptory challenges was impaired because the trial court failed to follow Rule 631(E)(2). It is clear, however, Rule 631 provides two methods of <em>voir dire, </em>one in which peremptory decisions are made one juror at a time, without knowledge of those jurors to come, and the other in which they are made after all jurors have been examined. Here, although the method of <em>voir dire </em>employed was clearly a hybrid of these two methods, and thus did not strictly comply with Rule 631(E)(2), the parties were fully aware of the procedure chosen by the trial court before any challenges were exercised. The <em>voir dire </em>method employed merely combined elements of the individual and the list systems, it did not deprive Appellant of a right so fundamental that it requires the award of a new trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_25" id="ref_footnote_1_25">25</a>

Constitutions have formed these hallmarks, statutes and judicial decisions have defined them, and procedural rules have sharpened them. Inextricably encompassed within the right to trial by a fair and impartial jury is the process by which the jurors are selected; and, in Pennsylvania, that process is regulated by Pa.R.Crim.P. 631-635. Specifically, subsections (E)(1) and (E)(2) of Rule 631 provide for two different methods of <em>voir dire: </em>the “individual <em>voir dire </em>and challenge system,” and the “list system of challenges,” respectively.

Based on this procedure, any juror not stricken by the end of the first day would be seated on the jury. Appellant’s counsel objected, but the court overruled the objection. Appellant’s counsel then exercised all seven of his peremptory challenges, while the prosecuting attorney saved one for the next day’s “fresh panel.” Given the thirteen peremptory strikes, the list of twenty-three potential jurors was reduced to ten, who all became principal jurors.</p>

After the court indicated that it would not <em>sua sponte </em>strike any of the six for cause, Appellant’s counsel moved for the court to strike prospective Juror No. 2 for cause, as she had indicated during questioning that her sister was a police officer, and was equivocal in her answers as to whether she could therefore evaluate a police officer’s testimony without any untoward bias.

Counsel therefore averred that, absent the trial court granting him an eighth peremptory strike, Appellant would be denied his constitutional right to an impartial jury. The prosecuting attorney responded that he would have liked to have stricken a juror during the previous day’s proceedings, but strategically kept his seventh peremptory challenge for day two, and that it was not his fault that Appellant’s counsel did not do the same.

When the trial court denied that motion, counsel could then have made the strategic decision to strike Juror No. 2 or some other prospective juror via peremptory challenge when the list was passed for the exercising of those challenges. Then, had Appellant used a peremptory challenge on Juror No. 2, Appellant may have had a meritorious issue for appeal pursuant to <em>Ingber, </em>if an appellate court determined that the trial court erred in not striking Juror No. 2 for cause.</p>

The Court has not consistently applied harmless error constructs when faced with a violation of a criminal rule. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Absent persuasive policy justifications for undertaking an <em>ad hoc </em>approach based upon the character of the rule violated, which the Commonwealth has not advanced in this case, I see no grounds for deviating from the general rule imposing the burden upon the Commonwealth to prove that preserved meritorious trial court errors are harmless.</p>

I also agree with Justice Baer that the trial court should have suspended jury selection once it became clear that insufficient numbers of prospective jurors remained to complete jury selection by the list method, and then resumed the following day with a fresh panel of prospective jurors added to the depleted pool. With respect to the question of whether this error caused Appellant to suffer actual prejudice, however, I agree with Justice Saylor that the Commonwealth had the unshifting burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the trial court’s error was harmless, and that the Commonwealth did not attempt to satisfy this burden. Accordingly, I join his Dissenting Opinion.</p>

I find considerable force in the arguments of <em>amicus, </em>the Pennsylvania Association of Justice, that the right to exercise peremptory challenges in the manner provided for by Pennsylvania law is a critical component of the right to a trial by jury protected by Article I, Section 6 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. <em>See Commonwealth v.
