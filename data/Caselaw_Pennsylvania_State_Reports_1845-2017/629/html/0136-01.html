The victim left the bar alone at approximately 1:25 a.m. the following morning, and her blue Honda Civic was discovered shortly thereafter on the southbound off-ramp of the Springfield-Lima exit of Interstate 476 in Delaware County at approximately 2:00 a.m. No one was found inside the vehicle, but the driver’s side door was open, the engine was running, and the interior lights and headlights were still on.

Specifically, the PCRA court pointed out that O’Donald entered a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in February 1997 — prior to his cooperation in Appellant’s case — in which he agreed to provide investigators with information concerning 12 unsolved bank robberies. In exchange for his guilty plea, prosecutors agreed to inform the sentencing court of his cooperation in the other cases and to encourage the court, at its discretion, to impose a sentence below the applicable mandatory minimum. The PCRA court opined that O’Donald initiated discussions with authorities in Appellant’s case because he hoped that cooperating with local authorities in that investigation would result in an additional sentence reduction pursuant to his earlier plea agreement.

    <p id="b195-5" data-blocks='[["BL_195.5",195,[146,1406,1153,850]]]'>Appellant similarly argues that an agreement existed between prosecutors and Williams, claiming Williams was facing first-degree murder charges, but was permitted to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter in exchange for his testimony in Appellant’s case. As proof of this alleged agreement, Appellant references Williams’ testimony from the PCRA hearing stating that he testified in Appellant’s case because the prosecutor promised him that he would be released on parole, and that his testimony was false and based on information fed to him by the prosecutor and detectives. Appellant also refers to a letter First Assistant District Attorney (“ADA”) Daniel J. McDevitt wrote to the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole two years after Appellant’s trial acknowledging Williams’ cooperation in the case and a letter Williams wrote to ADA McDevitt in 2003 inquiring into their “deal” regarding his parole.</p>

PCRA Court Opinion, 9/4/12, at 58. Specifically, the PCRA court observed that, while Williams testified during the PCRA hearing regarding an alleged agreement he had with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony, credible evidence proved otherwise, as ADA McDevitt testified during the PCRA hearing that Williams’ cooperation in Appellant’s case had no influence on his office’s decision to allow Williams to plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter, and that prosecutors made no specific sentencing recommendations and did not ask for leniency on Williams’ behalf. The PCRA court further noted that ADA McDevitt explicitly stated in a 2003 letter to Williams that no deal existed between them, and that, although ADA McDevitt did, in fact, write a letter to the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole advising the Board of Williams’ cooperation in Appellant’s case, he did so at the request of Williams’ mother, and the letter did not represent that an agreement existed between Williams and law enforcement. Based on the foregoing, the PCRA court concluded that, “[w]hile Williams may have harbored the subjective hope that at some point his testimony would garner a benefit, there is no credible evidence supporting the conclusion that Mr. McDevitt, or anyone in law reinforcement [sic], promised him parole upon the service of his minimum sentence.” <em>Id. </em>at 59 (footnote omitted).</p>

While Appellant bases his claim on Williams’ testimony, the PCRA court specifically found the testimony was incredible. Appellant’s reliance on his earlier plea agreement and ADA McDevitt’s letter to the Parole Board is similarly unavailing. Indeed, Williams entered his open guilty plea and was sentenced in July 1998, months before Appellant’s trial began, and ADA McDevitt’s parole letter makes no reference to an agreement with Williams and, in fact, states that Williams’ cooperation with law enforcement was entirely voluntary. Further, although, as noted above, Williams referenced a deal in his letter to ADA McDevitt, ADA McDevitt’s letter in response explicitly rejected the existence of an agreement between Williams and the Commonwealth. Accordingly, <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>because Appellant has failed to establish with credible evidence that an agreement existed between Williams and the Commonwealth, his claim fails.</p>

According to Appellant, if the PCRA court had properly applied the materiality standard, it would have found the non-disclosure of the agreements between the prosecution and the Commonwealth witnesses and the motivation for the witnesses’ testimony affected the judgment of the jury, as, according to Appellant, the testimony was damaging in nature and the jury would not have believed it if it knew the witnesses were testifying pursuant to agreements for reduced sentences.</p>
    <p id="b197-7" data-blocks='[["BL_197.6",197,[144,1500,1153,517]]]'>Appellant’s argument is largely beside the point. The PCRA court rejected Appellant’s <em>Brady </em>claims based upon its finding that no agreements existed between the Commonwealth and its witnesses, and, thus, that the Commonwealth did not conceal any evidence. Moreover, as we discussed in detail above, even if an agreement existed between prosecutors and O’Donald, its nondisclosure did not affect the judgment of the jury in light of the wealth of significant other evidence implicating Appellant in the murder. Appellant is, thus, not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>

The trial court appointed Dr. Robert Sadoff to conduct a competency evaluation, which occurred on January 10, 1998. At the time of the evaluation, Dr. Sadoff was not provided with Appellant’s prison records; however, counsel advised him of Appellant’s suicide attempts, Appellant’s accusations against him, and his disruptive behavior in prison. Ultimately, Dr. Sadoff found that Appellant exhibited symptoms of a paranoid personality disorder, but concluded that Appellant was nevertheless competent to stand trial, as his personality disorder did not impact his ability to understand the nature of the proceedings against him or to participate in his defense. The trial court conducted a competency hearing on January 16, 1998,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> during which <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>Appellant’s trial counsel stated that he did not object to Dr. Sadoff s conclusions and that he did not wish to obtain his own expert.

Specifically, Appellant references prison records from January 1998 through August 1998, which he claims reflect that he was <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>delusional, rambled incoherently, and was “suffering from psychosis and uncontrollable rages.” Appellant’s Brief at 25. Appellant notes that Dr. Sadoff did not receive these prison records prior to his evaluation, and suggests that, if Dr. Sadoff had received them, he would have found Appellant incompetent. Rather than crediting the testimony of Dr. Sadoff, Appellant maintains that the PCRA court should have credited the testimony of Dr. Dudley, who, upon examination of Appellant after trial, found that “Appellant was undergoing psychotic breaks during his pre-trial incarceration and that, as a result, he was unable to rationally assist counsel and was incompetent.” Appellant’s Brief at 27.</p>

Initially, only in the broadest terms does the threat relate to a central issue in the case. However, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>a connection between the threat and a central issue in his case, Appellant’s argument fails because he has not provided any proof that it was suggested that he or “his people” were the source of the threat. Rather, the record discloses only a report of a generic threat. Secondly, while the sheriff deputy’s statement certainly provided Mertz with information that he did not have before him at trial, the statement was isolated, appears to have been directed only to Mertz, and constituted only the reference to a vague threat without any specifics. Further, Appellant does not provide any indication that the sheriffs deputy or Mertz relayed the information concerning the general threat to other members of the jury; thus, we cannot accept Appellant’s claim that the entire jury was provided with information that they did not have before trial. Finally, while we agree with Appellant that a reference to a death threat may be intrinsically inflammatory, here, the threat was vague, its origins unknown, and it was conveyed by a sheriffs deputy to a single juror, rather than communicated to the jury directly from the source of the threat, thus minimizing its inflammatory nature.</p>

The court-appointed expert found appellant to be competent and, consistent with his testimony, the trial court specifically found that appellant was competent to stand trial.

Indeed, if a capital defendant truly was incompetent — was so impaired that he could not even communicate with and assist counsel — it is difficult to believe that his counsel would not notice, unless counsel himself was incompetent. And, we have Sixth Amendment principles to govern that eventuality: there is no reason to negate a salutary provision of the PCRA.</p>

My only comment pertains to Part 11(A), concerning whether an agreement existed between prosecutors and David O’Donald. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 158-59, 104 A.3d at 1192-93. Based on the evidence outlined by the majority, I am of the opinion that O’Donald had an understanding, known to both state and federal prosecutors, that if he testified against Appellant at trial, the district attorney would provide a favorable recommendation to federal counsel in support of a further reduction of his sentence. This is the type of scenario which, to my mind, requires disclosure, so as to reveal to the jury the motivations and, thus, any possible bias, a testifying witness may harbor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> In this re<a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>gard, it appears that the PCRA court focused too stringently on the notion of a “promise” in the contractual sense of that term. <em>See Commonwealth v. Bomar, </em>No. 5045-97, slip op. at 49, 51, <a href="/citations/?q=2012%20WL%209515416" class="citation" data-index="188" data-cite="2012 WL 9515416">2012 WL 9515416</a> (C.P.Delaware Sept. 4, 2012). To the contrary, this Court has emphasized that such an agreement “need not be a formal, signed document, but may be simply a promise or an understanding that the prosecution will extend leniency and favorable treatment in exchange for a witness’s testimony.” <em>Commonwealth v. Spotz, </em><a href="/pa/616/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="189" data-cite="616 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="4208456" data-case-paths="/pa/616/0164-01">616 Pa. 164</a>, 201, <a href="/pa/616/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="190" data-cite="47 A.3d 63" data-case-ids="4208456,7312412" data-case-paths="/pa/616/0164-01,/a3d/47/0063-01">47 A.3d 63</a>, 84 (2012). Accordingly, I would conclude that the prosecution failed to disclose the existence of an agreement for leniency with one of its testifying witnesses in violation of <em>Brady. </em>Nonetheless, I agree with the majority that Appellant has failed to establish the degree of prejudice necessary to obtain post-conviction relief relative to either his guilt- or penalty-phase claims.</p>
