Thereafter, the municipality administered the plan term along the lines of the incomplete or inaccurate assessment that resulted from the incomplete or inaccurate information submitted to the actuary, in effect unilaterally modifying both the plan and the CBA. The Commonwealth Court here ultimately determined that because Act 205 has statutory primacy over any CBA, the plan must be administered as understood by the actuary when it made its Act 205 cost study, even if this effectively alters a bargained-for term of the parties.

The Municipality’s Assistant Manager apparently arrived at the 15% amount based on the difference between the base benefit of a <em>regular </em>retiree (75% of the regular retiree’s final average monthly compensation) and the COLA cap of 90% of the retiree’s final average monthly compensation, or 15%. The actuary’s subsequent cost estimate regarding the financial health of the 2000 Plan (and thereafter, the 2004 Plan) was made based on the information provided by the Municipality’s Assistant Manager; that is, the actuary applied a 15% COLA cap for both regular <em>and </em>early retirees. However, the base benefit of an early retiree’s pension could be as low as 50% of the early retiree’s final average monthly compensation. Moreover, after the 2004 amendments to the Plan, early retirees’ COLA increases were linked not to their final average monthly compensation, but to their actual early retirement benefits.</p>

Subsequently, in 2006, the Union, thirteen retired officers, and a number of unspecified, active officers filed a grievance with the Plan Administrator concerning the Municipality’s calculation of the duration of COLA benefits. On January 15, 2007, the Plan Administrator issued a “Notice of Denial” indicating that the claim was not ripe for review for the unspecified, active officers, and was untimely and, therefore, waived for the thirteen retired officers. On March 1, 2007, an appeal of the Notice of Denial was filed with the Mt.

Relevantly, the Commission found that the Assistant Manager of the Municipality, Ms. Marcia Taylor, who was charged with administration of the Plan, was present and had participated in the 1999 negotiations with the Union that had resulted in the adoption of the COLA. It was she who had reported to Mockenhaupt Benefits Group (“Mockenhaupt”), the benefits consulting firm that performed the actuarial study of the Plan modifications adopted in 1999, that the COLA increases had a blanket 15% cap. Ms. Taylor reported this information in a good faith belief that this was how the COLA was to be implemented for all retirees. The 1999 negotiations did not include a separate discussion of how the COLA cap should apply to early retirees. Although the 2004 amendments to the Plan did specifically address COLA increases for early retirees, those amendments “did not address the issue in this case, i.e., how long an early retiree may receive the COLA.” <em>Id. </em>at 5, ¶ 18.

The court noted that there is no remedy set forth in Act 205 that would support this result; rather, the only remedy the court perceived in Act 205 was the authorization of a mandamus action when the municipality fails to meet its minimum funding for a pension plan. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 895.306. The court also noted that the plainly stated legislative intent of Act 205 — and this remedy of mandamus — was to insure that municipal pension plans are not underfunded. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 895.306(a). The court then observed that there was no issue concerning the underfunding of the Plan before the Commission. The only issue before that body, as the court determined, was whether a municipality was relieved under Act 205 from implementing the plain language of its pension plan merely because it had provided incomplete information to the Act 205 actuary. The court concluded that Act 205 does not relieve the municipality from its obligations under a pension plan, where, as here, there was no evidence that the implementation of the plan would affect the plan’s actuarial soundness.

Further, the court observed that her testimony, as well as that of the Mockenhaupt actuary who had performed the relevant Act 205 cost studies, revealed that Ms. Taylor had “merely assumed that there was a 15% limit on the COLA for [e]arly [r]etirees, an assumption that is nowhere to be found within the four corners of the CBA or the Plan.” <em>Id. </em>Going further, the court determined that “Ms. Taylor <em>ignored </em>the clear and unambiguous language of the Plan that <em>all </em>retirees were ‘participants,’ entitled to COLA increases until their pension payment reached 90% of [their final average monthly compensation].” <em>Id. </em>at 41 (emphases in original). To the extent that Ms. Taylor’s testimony constituted parol evidence concerning an interpretation of a contractual term, the court opined that such testimony was not relevant or appropriate when the relevant language of the Plan is plain and unambiguous.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

In short, there is no evidence in <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>the record that, prior to the adoption of the language in the Ordinance, the Municipality specifically promised to calculate the COLA for early retirees differently than they would for normal retirees.

The Union notes that the 90% cap, which applies to all participants, is the only cap mentioned in the Plan, indicating a bargained-for result. Further, the Union observes that the Municipality’s own witnesses testified that the language of the Plan governed its implementation, and that the Plan makes no mention of a 15% cap, but only of a COLA cap of 90% of a participant’s final average monthly compensation. Additionally, the Union cites to the 2004 amendment, that carved out an exception for COLA increases for early retirees, and the testimony underlying the adoption of that amendment as evidencing the “mutual understanding” of the Municipality and the Union “that the ninety percent ... cap applied to early retirees.” Union’s Brief at 18.</p>

Corporal Duane Fisher, who had negotiated for the Union for the 2004-06 CBA, testified before the Commission that the Union had agreed with the Municipality on this point, and that the parties had rectified the issue by slowing the rate of COLA increases for this group of early retirees, from 2% of the participant’s final average monthly compensation to 2% of the participant’s pension benefit. The COLA cap, however, was not changed during these negotiations; indeed, Corporal Fisher testified that the only issue <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>regarding early retirees was how quickly regular and early retirees would, respectively, obtain the 90% cap.

Further, during the negotiations, the Municipality successfully fended off the Union’s attempt to remove the cap altogether for all participants. <em>Id. </em>at 17. The parties further agreed in the 2004 CBA that pensions, including COLAs, for officers hired on or after January 11, 2004, would — and must — be governed by the provisions of the law known as Act 600, 53 P.S. §§ 767-778, and not by the provisions at issue in this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> All of these amendments, including the 90% cap negotiated into the CBA, became part of the Plan adopted by the Municipality via its own ordinance.</p>

The Union contends that had “early retirees” been subject to a cap of “fifteen percent ... in total cost of living increases, as the Municipality asserts, then it never would have been necessary to adjust the annual COLA depending on years of service,” as had happened.

First, the Union characterizes this case as one of estoppel; that is, basic contract law would prohibit a municipality from evading a contractual obligation because its own action or inaction may have prevented a condition precedent to fulfill the obligation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The Union then notes that Act 205 places upon the municipality the responsibility for obtaining complete and accurate cost estimates for any changes to a pension plan. <em>See </em>Union’s Brief, citing 53 P.S. § 895.305. The Union thus argues that equity requires the Municipality to live up to its contractual obligation: a COLA cap of 90% of the final average monthly wage for all participants, including early retirees (aside, of course, from those officers hired after January 11, 2004, whose pensions are governed by Act 600). The Union cites the hypothetical example of an officer retiring at age 50 under the terms of a pension plan, but then required either to return to service or forfeit her or his pension because the municipality had provided the wrong information to the actuary doing the Act 205 cost study and, as a result, the officer’s early retirement had not been considered in the study.</p>

Here, the Union contends that the present matter has no similarity to the issue before this Court in <em>Ellwood City v.

And while the Per Curiam Opinion posits that the appropriate remedy here is to remand the matter to secure a complete and accurate cost study in support of the Union’s proffered view of the Plan, doing so would not satisfy the requirements of Act 205, unless the Plan itself is invalidated. This is so because Act 205 requires a complete and accurate cost study to be secured “Prior to the adoption of any benefit plan modification!,]” so as to inform the governing body, prior to such adoption, as to “the impact of the proposed ... modification on the future financial requirements of the pension plan and the future minimum obligation of the municipality.” 53 P.S. § 895.305 (emphasis added). Anything less than that fails to satisfy Act 205. The courts are not authorized to manipulate the facts to ensure a windfall contrary to the legislative command. Requiring the Municipality to abide by a plan modification illegally adopted without being informed by a complete and accurate cost study, which the Per Curiam Opinion apparently does in the name of enforcing Act 205, simply does not satisfy Act 205’s requirement of a “prior” cost <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>study.

That is a very sweet deal. The Municipality not only disagrees with this reading, but never secured a cost study to support it. Therefore, if the 2000 plan modification is as understood by the Union and as insisted upon by the Per Curiam Opinion here, then the plan modification was illegally adopted in 2000 in violation of Act 205, and must be invalidated in order to give effect to Act 205’s controlling requirements.

Here, however, the Municipality does not invoke Act 205 to avoid the consequences of its own understanding of the Plan provisions at issue, but does so to avoid the consequences of the Union’s proffered contrary understanding. Furthermore, restoration of the bargaining <em>status quo ante </em>apparently works to the detriment of the Union because upon returning to the bargaining <em>status quo ante, </em>the Union stands to forfeit not only the disputed uncapped COLA increases for its early retirees, but also the entire bargained-for COLA for all retirees, at least arguably retroactive to 2000. The ramifications of the forfeiture of this nearly fifteen-year-old bargained-for benefit may not be fully appreciable at this stage in proceedings. Certainly, the Union <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>and individual officers have not requested this result, and presumably would find such “relief’ to be undesirable. Nevertheless, the Commission’s findings are clear that the parties to the relevant negotiations “did not specifically discuss how the COLA provision would apply to the Early Retirement Benefit[, and, as a result,] the 2000 Plan contains no language describing how, if at all, the COLA provision should be applied to retirees who elect the Early Retirement Benefit option.” Commission F.F.

For one, it is not desirable that we permit parties to unilaterally reap the unintended benefits of unforeseen and unaccounted-for circumstances. Further, our task may involve an obligation to protect parties from a mutual mistake in the bargaining process concerning core employment matters. Here, perhaps, the Union will insist that it made no mistake in the bargaining process and that it fully intended a plan modification that would include a significantly greater COLA for Union members who retire after a mere seven years than that which is payable to Union members who toil in public service more than three times as long. Leaving aside the obvious facial implausibility of that position, the inconvenient fact remains that the Union failed to verify that the requisite cost study reflected their understanding of how the proposed modification would apply to this scenario, which the parties never specifically discussed. I believe the approach of the Commonwealth Court below best reconciles Act 205’s mandatory requirements with our obligation to protect the parties from their mistake in failing to specifically negotiate concerning a cap on COLA increases for early retirees.</p>

      <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>Viewing the larger picture presented in this case: (1) the Union wanted a COLA for retirees; (2) the Municipality agreed to the COLA, calculated at a rate which would cap COLAs at a 15% increase for normal retirees, without any discussion of an alternate cap in increases for early retirees— leaving the parties without a meeting of the minds concerning the latter; (3) the Municipality secured a cost study as required by law in order to proceed with a plan modification adding the COLA; (4) the cost study is accurate and complete if the agreed-upon modification is as it is understood by the Municipality, but inaccurate and incomplete if the modification is as it is understood by the Union; (5) the Municipality and Union proceeded with the plan modification, adding a COLA; (6) if the Union’s understanding is correct, the COLA modification is unsupported by a complete and accurate cost study and is, therefore, invalid; (7) consequently, all of the Union’s retirees (early and otherwise) forfeit their bargained-for COLA under the Union’s understanding of the plan modification. While securing a complete and accurate cost study concerning the proposed modification as written was the responsibility of the Municipality, the Municipality apparently stands to benefit from having failed to do so by escaping the COLA payment burden, having acted in good faith. Rather than invalidate the plan modification which included the COLA benefit, the Commonwealth Court appropriately, in my view, looked to give the Union the benefit of its bargain to the extent permissible under Act 205, <em>ie., </em>a plan modification to include a COLA for retirees with increases for all participants capped as calculated in the requisite cost estimate. Under the parameters established by Act 205, there was no other means by which the Commonwealth Court could allow the Union to retain the bargained-for COLA. Considering the Municipality’s understanding of the plan modification and the Union’s proffered interpretation of the same, the only understanding which could possibly survive scrutiny under Act 205 was the Municipality’s interpretation, the only interpretation possibly supported by a complete and accurate cost study secured prior to approval of the plan modification.</p>

Under the circumstances, therefore, rather than invalidate the plan modification and strip the Union of its bargained-for COLA provisions, causing the parties to grapple with the ramifications and uncertainty that comes along with invalidating a modification some fifteen years after the fact, I would affirm the Commonwealth Court’s decision, and leave the parties to bargain to resolve their misunderstanding going forward. The Commonwealth Court was correct that, as between the two proffered interpretations, only one was lawful under Act 205. The interpretation that would award a windfall, and one that is of comparative absurdity (given the greater service of those employees who do not retire early), cannot stand.</p>

The Per Curiam Opinion does recite a trial court conclusion that there was not substantial evidence to support the Commission’s finding that Ms. Taylor interpreted the Plan in good faith, since — in the opinion of the trial judge — her calculation was not an interpretation of the Plan, but an assumption on her part by which she ignored the clear language of "the Plan," and since — again in the opinion of the trial judge — her testimony on this point was neither relevant nor appropriate since the language of the Plan is unambiguous. This conclusion by the trial court erroneously disregards and mischaracterizes the findings of the Commission. In the first place, the Commission did not find that the information Ms. Taylor submitted to the actuary was based on a good faith "interpretation” of "the Plan.” What the Commission actually found was that her actions in requesting the initial cost study and in administering the Plan were based on her good faith belief, not an interpretation of "the Plan.” And while the trial court held out the finalized and adopted Plan as the end-all with respect to Ms. Taylor's actions in securing the initial cost study, such that none of her testimony is relevant concerning whether her actions were taken in good faith, the Per Curiam Opinion’s summary of the trial court's conclusion neglects to acknowledge that at the time of her actions in requesting the initial cost study, there was no finalized and adopted Plan, but merely a proposed plan based on negotiations in which Ms. Taylor participated, for submission to the Commission for an approval decision informed by the requisite cost study she was requesting. In other words, when Ms. Taylor submitted information to the actuary to secure the requisite cost study, there was no controlling Plan or Plan language, because the Plan had yet to be adopted, and was necessarily, therefore, subject to change. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 895.305(a) and (e). The windfall approved by the Court today derives from this initial judicial error, deriving from a misapprehension of the limits of judicial review here.</p>
