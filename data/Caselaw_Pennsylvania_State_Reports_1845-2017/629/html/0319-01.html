Stat. § 6 (West 2014) (“UWOA”) considering the UWOA is not a “substitute for consideration,” nor is it intended to “rectify a lack of consideration” as the Superior Court asserts, but instead, is a statute that merely prevents a party to a written agreement in which the party expresses an <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>intention to be legally bound from later challenging that validity of the contract based upon lack of consideration?</blockquote>
