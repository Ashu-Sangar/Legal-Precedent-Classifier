The issue presented does not concern liability. Rather, the appeal presents a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the $500,000 statutory limit available in tort from a local agency such as Pennsbury. The lower courts, consistently with governing law from this Court, denied the challenges to the damages cap. We are now asked to reconsider our prior decisions, in light of a series of constitutional arguments forwarded by appellant. After due consideration of those claims, we affirm.</p>

At the time of the accident, Pennsbury had $11 million in liability and excess insurance coverage. But, Pennsbury maintained that its liability was limited to $500,000, the statutory limit on damages recoverable against a local government agency under the Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 8501-8564 (the “Act”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Under Section 8501 of the Act, a “local agency” is defined as a government unit other than the Commonwealth government and includes “an intermediate unit” and “municipalities cooperating in the exercise or performance of governmental functions, powers or responsibilities ____” There is no dispute that the definition of “local agency” includes a public school district such as Pennsbury.</p>

This “statutory cap” or “damages cap” is codified at Section 8553 of the Act: “Damages arising from the same cause of action or transaction or occurrence or series of causes of action or transactions or occurrences shall not exceed $500,000 in the aggregate.” <em>Id. </em>§ 8553(b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

In response to Penns<a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>bury’s motion, appellant argued that the statutory damages cap is unconstitutional on several grounds, but the trial court, while opining that the circumstances of the case directed “an unfair and unjust result,” followed precedent upholding the damages cap as constitutional, molded the verdict, and entered judgment for $502,661.63, which amount included delay damages.</p>

According to appellant, she has been denied the equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment, and also the enjoyment of a civil right under Article I, Section 26, simply because she happened to be seriously injured by a public entity; under the damages cap she is entitled only to a fraction of the jury verdict another individual — injured by a private tortfeasor — might recover in its entirety. Appellant argues that her equal protection rights are further violated because someone injured by a private tortfeasor would be entitled to recover the proceeds of applicable insurance, where she is not so entitled. Appellant asserts that Pennsbury could easily have contracted with a private school bus company, as many school districts do, because transporting students is not a core activity of education that must be performed by public employees. Thus, according to appellant, the discrimination here, founded only on the identity of the <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>tortfeasor, is unfair and her right to compensation should instead be equal to that of other tort victims, especially where insurance coverage exists, and where Pennsbury may budget for any premium increases caused by elimination of the damages cap.</p>

Pa. Const, art. I, § 11. Appellant notes that Section 11 is included in Article I, the constitutional Declaration of Rights which generally limits the power of state government to restrict rights reserved to the people, and this confirms “that the open courts provision represents a specific reservation of individual rights at government’s expense.” Appellant’s Brief at 43 (citing <em>Robinson Twp., </em><a href="/pa/623/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="83 A.3d 901" data-case-ids="4344715,7264422" data-case-paths="/pa/623/0564-01,/a3d/83/0901-01">83 A.3d at 947-48</a>).

Appellant reviews the history of governmental immunity as it arose in Pennsylvania decisional law, and argues that the <em>Ayala </em>Court correctly abolished such immunity in a case with similar facts to those now before the Court, involving serious injury to a public school student, on the basis that “the rule of governmental immunity for tort is an anachronism, without rational basis, and has existed only by the force of inertia.” <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%20877" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="305 A.2d 877">305 A.2d at 883</a>.

Thus, according to appellant, <em>Ayala </em>is still entitled to deference, especially “against a stark backdrop of catastrophic injury caused by a defendant’s admitted negligence.” Appellant’s Brief at 23. Appellant argues that <em>Ayala </em>should apply at least to the extent necessary to allow appellant to recover the $11 million liability limit in insurance coverage voluntarily purchased by Pennsbury, and further that immunity should not apply at all where local agencies are free to purchase insurance or insure themselves. In appellant’s view, unlimited tort liability against governmental agencies promotes accountability and accident-prevention.</p>

The PAJ echoes appellant’s reliance upon <em>Ayala </em>for the proposition that governmental immunity has no rational basis. The PAJ also asserts that a local government unit is a better loss-distributing agency than innocent injured victims, and complains that the General Assembly enacted the statutory cap in spite of this Court’s guidance in <em>Ayala. </em>According to the PAJ, the Court in <em>Smith </em>supposedly ignored its own precedent and <em>stare decisis </em>in favor of a presumption of constitutionality. The PAJ then argues that the statutory classification at issue here is based on the arbitrary status of the defendant as a public or a private entity. Separately, the PAJ points out that the amount of the damages cap has not been increased in thirty-six years, although the cost of living has tripled since then, and that, in any event, Pennsbury should be deemed to have affirmatively waived application of the cap when it purchased insurance. The AAJ argues that governmental immunity has no constitutional status; rather, immunity once existed as a matter of the common law, arising from judicial decisions, but it is now found in legislation that must conform to constitu<a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>tional limitations. According to the AAJ, the classification based on whether the tortfeasor is a public or private entity is irrational; in AAJ’s view, where a public school district is an employer competing in a commercial industry, nothing distinguishes it from a private employer in terms of responsibility for an employee’s negligence. Moreover, argues the AAJ, endangerment of the public fisc does not justify the classification.</p>

Pennsbury states that the <em>Smith </em>Court applied intermediate scrutiny to the statutory cap to analyze whether an important government interest — preservation of the public treasury against the possibility of large recoveries in tort cases — was closely related to the classification established by the statutory scheme, and determined that it was so related. <em>Id. </em>at 311. Moreover, argues Pennsbury, this Court is not the appropriate forum to address appellant’s policy arguments regarding the consequences of a damages cap, such as the culture of complacency or lack of accountability on the part of local agencies that appellant alleges is engendered by the cap, or whether busing students to school ought to be protected as a core function of a public school district; such policy issues are better left to the Legislature, according to Pennsbury.</p>

Pennsbury further argues that its purchase of insurance to protect against liabilities not subject to the Act and its damages cap does not affect <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>the analysis of whether the cap passes constitutional muster. For example, the Act’s statutory cap does not apply to liability for violations of federal law, or liability for zoning or eminent domain challenges. <em>See Dunaj v. Selective Ins.

Pennsbury asserts that the availability of insurance coverage is almost always irrelevant as a matter of law in a tort action, and appellant’s arguments on this point should likewise be rejected. The availability of insurance coverage has nothing to do with the propriety of a statutory classification under an equal protection analysis, according to Pennsbury. Pennsbury argues that the law is clear that the Act “in no manner evinces a legislative intent to waive the damages limitation upon purchase of liability insurance by a local agency.” <em>Spisak v.

Finally, Pennsbury argues that the damages cap does not violate appellant’s right to a jury trial.

The Commonwealth argues that it is untenable to claim that legislation expressly authorized by the Constitution — pursuant to Article I, Section 11— violates that same Constitution. With regard to appellant’s equal protection claim, the Commonwealth notes that the classification about which appellant complains was created by the Constitution itself, and this Court need not even reach the question of the proper scope of review. But, the Common<a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>wealth notes that federal courts have analyzed immunity provisions under a rational basis paradigm. <em>See Miller v.

The Commonwealth also notes that appellant’s reliance on <em>Ayala </em>is misplaced because that case did not involve an equal protection challenge; the question there was only whether a judicially-created common law immunity should be abandoned. Respecting appellant’s argument regarding the right to a jury trial, the Commonwealth notes that, because Section 11 allows the General Assembly to direct the procedure for resolving suits against the Commonwealth, and — in theory — the General Assembly could thus eliminate jury trials in this area altogether, the less drastic damages cap is certainly constitutional. Finally, the Commonwealth notes that the cap is a legislative device and not a remittitur, so there is no separation of powers problem.</p>

What is most important is that the right to a jury trial “must not be burdened by the imposition of onerous conditions, restrictions or regulations which would make the right practically unavailable.” <em>Application of Smith, </em><a href="/pa/381/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="208" data-cite="381 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="1258918" data-case-paths="/pa/381/0223-01">381 Pa. 223</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.2d%20625" class="citation" data-index="209" data-cite="112 A.2d 625">112 A.2d 625</a>, 629 (1955) (Court upheld statutory scheme which mandated compulsory arbitration for certain minor cases, and then allowed jury trial upon appeal from decision of arbitrators; Court found that statute did not create “onerous” burden on right to jury trial).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> Appellant relies on the reference in <em>Application of Smith </em>to <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>“onerous” conditions and argues that the statutory damages cap places just such a condition and restriction on her right to a jury trial, making the right practically unavailable to her. But, this is simply not so. The damages cap does not present a condition or restriction on appellant’s right to have a jury hear her case; rather, the burden lies in the limited amount of recovery allowed, and that is obviously not the same thing. Successful plaintiffs are often limited in their ability to recover the full amount of a jury’s award for many different reasons— a defendant may simply be judgment-proof, for example — but this practical reality has nothing to do with the plaintiffs right to seek to have the merits of her cause determined by a jury, rather than some other process. This Court has struck down onerous procedural barriers to the exercise of the jury trial right, but that is quite a different matter from a substantive limit on the damages ultimately recovered — following a full-blown jury trial. <em>See, e.g., Mattos v.

I write separately because I can envision a scenario where a personal injury victim is able to prove that the $500,000 statutory cap on damages, which has not been increased since its enactment in 1978, violates the right to a jury trial as guaranteed by Article I, Section 6 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The majority holds that Article I, Section 6 precludes the imposition of “onerous procedural barriers” on the exercise of the jury trial right but that the statutory damages cap at issue herein affects a different matter, <em>i.e., </em>a substantive limit on the damages ultimately recovered after a full jury trial. Op. at 61-62, 104 A.3d at 1132. Although I agree with the majority that the jury trial Appellant demanded and received was not impaired in the instant case, it appears to me that through a properly developed record, a victim may be able to establish that the statutory damages cap constitutes an <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>onerous procedural barrier to the jury trial right in violation of Article I, Section 6.</p>

The statute afforded a right to appeal the arbitrators’ decision to the trial court where a jury trial could be conducted, but required that the party appealing the arbitration award pay the arbitrators’ fee. The petitioner argued that the statutory requirement that the appellant pay the fee constituted an onerous and unconstitutional restriction upon the right to present his case to a jury.</p>

This becomes relevant when one considers the practicalities of litigating a catastrophic injury case against a political subdivision. While there is no evidentiary record concerning the costs and fees incurred to prosecute the instant litigation, I believe that a victim of a political subdivision’s negligence in a complicated case may be able to establish that the costs and fees of litigating the claim precluded counsel from accepting the case, thereby denying the victim the right to present the case to a jury.</p>

These are often used in opening statements and closing arguments, as well as during trial, necessitating complex and careful development to ensure admissibility, and requiring an operator to coordinate the audio-visual display as counsel presents the case. There are also enormous sums expended for discovery and mediations, which each cost thousands or tens of thousands of dollars, as well as the inevitable miscellaneous expenditures for travel, lodging, meals and the like, which aggregate throughout all complex litigation. All of these expenses are without consideration of the contingent fees and general overhead every lawyer must charge and consider before accepting a case.</p>

Counsel also cannot accept a case where required costs are disproportionate to a potential fee. It would simply be “bad business,” notwithstanding the empathy the lawyer would feel for an injured client, to risk tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs in light of the statutorily imposed cap on recovery.</p>
    <p id="b103-4" data-blocks='[["BL_103.4",103,[140,819,1153,738]]]'>It is obvious that money in 2014 does not spend as it did in 1978. Notably, that year the Governor of Pennsylvania earned somewhere around $70,000. Today his salary exceeds $180,000. In 1978, a member of the General Assembly, which passed the cap under scrutiny herein, earned $25,000 a year. Today a legislator earns approximately $84,000. Notwithstanding this clear evidence of inflation, the cap remains the same. In accord with the <em>Smith </em>analysis, assuming an evidentiary proffer that $500,000 would not cover costs and fees incurred in pursuing complex personal injury litigation, it would appear that the statutory cap presents an “onerous procedural barrier” to an injured plaintiffs guaranteed right to a jury, and, thus, violates Article I, Section 6.

I would like to think that the failure to raise the cap has been inadvertent on its part. In its wisdom, it decided to create these causes of action against government subdivisions to protect our citizenry against the tyranny of injury without compensation. As evidenced by the record in this case and discussed below, many political subdivisions are able to purchase affordable insurance equal to a reasonable cap. It is my hope that the Legislature will become cognizant of its oversight through this case, raise the cap to a level that is obviously constitutional, and thereby protect the people it serves while safeguarding governmental entities by allowing for or, indeed, mandating reasonable insurance to protect them in an amount equivalent to the statutory damages cap.</p>

The record herein does not indicate what it would cost to extend this insurance to the operation of motor vehicles by the school district, but I suspect that the cost would be a relatively small percentage of an overall school district budget. Moreover, it is significant that the Public Utility Commission has provided that to the extent school districts contract with private carriers to shuttle students, those contractors must carry at least $5 million in liability insurance. <em>See </em>52 Pa.Code § 32.11(d) (requiring a common carrier of passengers on a motor vehicle capable of transporting more than 28 passengers to carry at least $5 million in liability insurance).</p>
