The issues, as stated by Petitioner, are:\n(1) Whether, in response to a police request for chemical testing arising out of a D.U.I. arrest, a motorist has a statutory right to request alternative chemical testing under section 1547(i) of the Motor Vehicle Code (75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1547(i))?\n(2) If a motorist has a statutory right to request alternative chemical testing under section 1547(i) of the Motor Vehicle Code when arrested for a D.U.I., does section 1547 require that any such request be conditioned upon the motorist having a medical condition preventing him from undergoing the chemical test requested by the police?\n(3) Whether, in response to a police request for chemical testing arising out of a D.U.I. arrest, a motorist\u2019s request for alternative chemical testing, without more, constitutes a refusal to undergo chemical testing under 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1547(b)(1)?",
