        "text": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nThe Commonwealth appeals from the order granting a stay of execution, vacating appellee\u2019s death sentence, and awarding a new penalty hearing under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546. We vacate the stay of execution and the grant of a new penalty phase, and reinstate the sentence of death.\nAppellee was sentenced to death after being convicted of the robbery and murder of Amos Norwood February 3, 1986, his second murder conviction. A detailed account of the crime is set forth in our opinion on direct appeal. See Commonwealth v. Williams, 524 Pa. 218, 570 A.2d 75, 77-79 (1990). Suffice it to say, appellee and his co-conspirator, Marc Draper, took Norwood to a graveyard, tied him with his own clothes, and beat him to death with a tire iron \u2014 appellee returned the next day and set fire to the corpse. At trial, appellee testified that Draper and another individual committed the crime; he claimed he was elsewhere at the time and uninvolved. He testified he did not know the victim, had never seen him before, and had no reason to be angry with him or wish to harm him. This Court affirmed the judgment of sentence February 8,1990, id., at 84, and appellee did not seek certiorari. He filed a timely PCRA petition March 24,1995.\nAt the 1998 PCRA hearing, now represented by the Federal Community Defenders Office (FCDO), appellee abandoned his trial testimony and argued Norwood engaged in homosexual acts with him, and as set forth below, presented evidence supporting this claim. The PCRA court denied relief, and this Court affirmed. Commonwealth v. Williams, 581 Pa. 57, 863 A.2d 505, 523 (2004). Appellee filed a second PCRA petition February 18, 2005, which was dismissed as untimely. This Court affirmed. Commonwealth v. Williams, 589 Pa. 355, 909 A.2d 297 (2006) (per curiam). Appellee filed a third PCRA petition June 1, 2005, which was dismissed as untimely, and we affirmed. Commonwealth v. Williams, 599 Pa. 495, 962 A.2d 609 (2009) (per curiam).\nWhile that PCRA appeal was pending before this Court, appellee filed a federal habeas corpus petition December 19, 2005, which was denied. The Third Circuit affirmed. Williams v. Beard, 637 F.3d 195, 238 (3d Cir.2011). In his federal appeal, appellee contended trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidence he was psychologically damaged by years of sexual abuse, which infused him with rage toward men who made sexual advances toward him; appellee argued Norwood was one of these men and had been sexually abusing him since the age of 13. Appellee petitioned the United States Supreme Court for certiorari, which was denied. Williams v. Wetzel, \u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 65, 183 L.Ed.2d 711 (2012) (per curiam).\nOn January 9, 2012, the FCDO visited Draper, who was serving a life sentence at SCI-Frackville. That same day, Draper signed an affidavit declaring he told detectives and the prosecution prior to trial that Norwood was a homosexual and was in a relationship with appellee. The affidavit also claimed the prosecution \u201cwanted the motive to be a robbery and kept coming back to that. That\u2019s how they wanted me to testify, that it was a robbery.\u201d Draper\u2019s Affidavit, 1/9/12, at 4. The FCDO revisited Draper March 1, 2012, obtaining another affidavit with similar declarations.\nAppellee then filed this facially untimely PCRA petition March 9, 2012, his fourth state petition for collateral review. On July 27, 2012, he filed a \u201cSupplemental Petition for Post Conviction Relief and Notice of Filing Additional Evidence in Support of Stay of Execution,\u201d although no execution warrant had been signed. An execution warrant was subsequently issued August 8, 2012, setting the execution for October 3, 2012. Appellee filed a \u201cRenewed Motion for Stay of Execution\u201d August 28, 2012, and the Commonwealth filed a response September 7, 2012. On September 6, 2012, appellee filed a motion for discovery, requesting the production of exculpatory information from the Commonwealth \u201cas well as any reports or notes made concerning Norwood\u2019s sexual relationship or sexual abuse of [appellee] or any other child under the age of 18.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Motion for Discovery, 9/6/12, at 5-6.\nOn September 10, 2012, the PCRA court heard argument on the pleadings to determine whether the petition warranted an evidentiary hearing. The court gave appellee time to obtain and submit additional information from Draper, which led to his third affidavit, dated September 11, 2012. On September 14, the court heard additional argument and ordered an evidentiary hearing, which began September 20; only Draper and the trial prosecutor testified. On Saturday, September 22, the court ordered the Commonwealth to produce trial files and Philadelphia Police Department files and allowed both parties to review those files. On September 24, documents from these files were offered and admitted into evidence, and the PCRA court entered 11 exhibits sua sponte. See Exhibit List, 9/20/12. The court then directed appellee to amend his PCRA petition; on September 28, appellee filed an \u201cAmendment and Supplement to Petition for Post-Conviction Relief,\u201d requesting relief because the Commonwealth had given \u201csanitized\u201d witness statements to the defense. The same afternoon, the court ruled there was a Brady , violation because that which was missing from original discovery suggested Norwood may have been a \u201chomosexual ephebophiliac.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion, 11/27/12, at 12-13 (citations omitted).\nThe PCRA court also concluded appellee\u2019s fourth PCRA petition met the \u201cgovernmental interference\u201d exception to the PCRA\u2019s timeliness requirement, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(i), though it did not meet the \u201cnewly-discovered evidence\u201d exception, id., \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(h). The court ordered a stay of execution pursuant to \u00a7 9545(c)(2), finding appellee exceeded the \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d threshold and demonstrated actual success on the merits of his claim regarding the penalty phase. The court held the Commonwealth violated Brady and found appellee identified a specific claim, Norwood\u2019s homosexual ephebophilia, which he was unable to discover or develop due to interference by the Commonwealth. The interference consisted of withholding or \u201csanitizing\u201d three specific pieces of evidence: a statement by Norwood\u2019s wife, a statement by the pastor of appellee\u2019s church, and notes made by the prosecutor.\nThe first statement involved a story Norwood\u2019s wife told police, which was omitted from the 1984 police activity sheet. She said Norwood once woke her at 2 a.m. and asked her for money while a young male stood in the hall outside their bedroom. She saw Norwood load stereo equipment into his car and drive away with the young male. She told police she believed this to be a kidnapping; when Norwood returned home around 9 a.m., he said he was abducted but escaped by using psychology on his captors. When his wife tried to call the police, Norwood asked her to avoid their involvement.\nThe second statement was from appellee\u2019s pastor, who was also a friend of Norwood. The pastor told police Norwood worked with and counseled young males in the church for many years. Omitted from the 1984 activity sheet was the pastor\u2019s suspicion that Norwood may have been a homosexual, and that five years earlier, the pastor received a complaint from a mother alleging Norwood propositioned her 17-year-old son for sex. The pastor also repeated for police the \u201ckidnapping\u201d story told by Norwood\u2019s wife \u2014 this was included with the pastor\u2019s statements in the 1984 police activity sheet, which had been disclosed to the defense.\nThe court also found the Commonwealth failed to disclose handwritten notes by the trial prosecutor, purportedly recounting an instance of Norwood\u2019s behavior toward a teenage male, which would establish the prosecution\u2019s awareness of Norwood\u2019s homosexual proclivities. The court stated, had such evidence been disclosed to the defense, trial counsel would have been able to challenge the Commonwealth\u2019s sympathetic portrayal of Norwood. The court concluded the inability to portray an unsympathetic victim was enough to undermine one\u2019s confidence the jury would have returned the same verdict of death.\nFinding appellee exercised due diligence, the court concluded he did not know this evidence existed until his co-conspirator executed an affidavit in January, 2012, declaring a possible motive for the crime, ie., rage over being sexually abused by Norwood. Appellee timely filed his PCRA petition within 60 days of learning the substance of Draper\u2019s affidavit. Furthermore, the court noted appellee could not have known the Commonwealth interfered with his ability to present evidence of Norwood\u2019s homosexual ephebophilia until the underlying evidence was uncovered during the hearing held as a result of Draper\u2019s affidavit; therefore, appellee timely filed the amendment and supplement to his PCRA petition in order to particularize his Brady claim just three days after government files were opened. Accordingly, the court concluded appellee met his burden under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(i), and subsection (b)(2), so it had jurisdiction to grant relief. Finding appellee established his Brady claim, the court held he was entitled to a new penalty hearing. The court denied relief regarding the guilt phase. The Commonwealth filed this appeal, raising two issues for our review regarding the timeliness of appellee\u2019s fourth PCRA petition and the merits of his Brady claim.\nOur standard of review of the PCRA court\u2019s grant of relief is clear: we examine whether the court\u2019s findings are supported by the record and whether its conclusions of law are free from legal error. Commonwealth v. Colavita, 606 Pa. 1, 993 A.2d 874, 886 (2010). All PCRA petitions, \u201cincluding a second or subsequent petition, shall be filed within one year of the date the judgment becomes final\u201d unless an exception to timeliness applies. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1). \u201cThe PCRA\u2019s time restrictions are jurisdictional in nature. Thus, [i]f a PCRA petition is untimely, neither this Court nor the [PCRA] court has jurisdiction over the petition. Without jurisdiction, we simply do not have the legal authority to address the substantive claims.\u201d Commonwealth v. Chester, 586 Pa. 468, 895 A.2d 520, 522 (2006) (first alteration in original) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). As timeliness is distinct from the merits of the underlying claims, we must first determine whether appellee\u2019s PCRA petition was timely filed in order to decide whether this Court has legal authority to address its substantive claims. See Commonwealth v. Stokes, 598 Pa. 574, 959 A.2d 806, 310 (2008) (consideration of Brady claim separate from consideration of its timeliness).\nThis, appellee\u2019s fourth PCRA petition, was untimely on its face, as it was filed over 20 years after his judgment of sentence became final. The PCRA petitioner has the burden of proving an untimely petition falls within an exception outlined in \u00a7 9545(b)(1). See Commonwealth v. Hawkins, 598 Pa. 85, 953 A.2d 1248, 1253 (2008) (\u201c[I]t is the [petitionerj\u2019s burden to allege and prove that one of the timeliness exceptions applies.\u201d (citation omitted)). Furthermore, any PCRA petition filed under a timeliness exception must be filed within 60 days of when the petition could have first been presented. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(2). \u201c \u2018[T]he 60-day rule requires a petitioner to plead and prove that the information on which he relies could not have been obtained earlier, despite the exercise of due diligence.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 606 Pa. 64, 994 A.2d 1091, 1094 (2010) (quoting Stokes, at 310).\nAlthough a Brady violation might fall within the \u201cgovernmental interference\u201d exception, \u00a7 9545(b)(1)\u00a9 nonetheless requires a petitioner to plead and prove: (1) the failure to previously raise the claim was the result of interference by government officials and (2) the information on which he relies could not have been obtained earlier with the exercise of due diligence. Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, 596 Pa. 219, 941 A.2d 1263, 1268 (2008) (citation omitted). The merits of a Brady claim need not be addressed until it is established that the instant petition was timely filed. Stokes, at 310. Thus, the proper questions for our review are whether the Commonwealth interfered with appellee\u2019s ability to present a claim that Norwood was a homosexual with a sexual attraction to teenage males, and whether appellee was duly diligent in obtaining such information.\nThe PCRA court held it had jurisdiction under the \u201cgovernmental interference\u201d exception to the PCRA\u2019s time-bar, concluding the alleged Brady violations posited by appellee met the requirements of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(f). The Commonwealth contends appellee\u2019s PCRA petition failed to establish this exception, as appellee would have known well before trial of any sexual relationship or abuse between Norwood and himself. In fact, the Commonwealth argues, if anyone knew about Norwood\u2019s homosexual proclivities toward teenage males, it was appellee himself. The Commonwealth points to the evidence of appellee\u2019s statements during the murder, taunting Norwood for \u201cliking boys,\u201d and appellee\u2019s plan to extort Norwood by threatening to expose his homosexual activity.\nFurther, the Commonwealth contends appellee not only could have presented evidence of ephebophilia much sooner, but points out appellee did present just such a claim during his first PCRA proceedings in 1998, where he offered testimony from several witnesses alleging Norwood sexually abused him. The Commonwealth also posits that appellee\u2019s instant PCRA petition admitted he knew about Norwood\u2019s homosexual tendencies years before the murder. Since appellee already knew about this alleged material evidence, the Commonwealth contends any \u201csanitization\u201d of evidence by the prosecution does not amount to a Brady violation. Accordingly, the Commonwealth asserts, appellee did not prove the timeliness exception applies, and the PCRA court was without jurisdiction to rule on appellee\u2019s petition, much less grant a stay of execution and a new penalty phase.\nThe Commonwealth also suggests the PCRA court attempted to circumvent a valid death sentence and undermine the integrity of this Court\u2019s ruling in appellee\u2019s first PCRA appeal. The Commonwealth refers to the ordering of what amounted to additional discovery to supplement appellee\u2019s inadequate petition, the court\u2019s lengthy examination of the trial prosecutor after PCRA counsel finished his examination, and the admission of \u201ccourt exhibits\u201d sua sponte, later basing its \u201cgovernmental interference\u201d decision on one of its own exhibits. In sum, the Commonwealth contends the PCRA court \u201cwent to great lengths to expand the record, to reshape [appellee]\u2019s claim, and to limit the Commonwealth.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Reply to Defendant\u2019s Response to Emergency Application to Lift Illegal Stay of Execution, 10/2/12, at 12. The Commonwealth, therefore, requests we vacate the stay of execution and the grant of a new penalty phase.\nAppellee argues the PCRA court\u2019s timeliness findings were supported by the record and devoid of legal error. While appellee admits he had prior knowledge of Norwood\u2019s sexual orientation, he contends such prior knowledge is critically different from evidence of homosexual ephebophilia and sexual abuse of other teenage males. He distinguishes the failure to present the defense of rage at trial, his 1998 ineffectiveness claim, from the inability to present Norwood as unsympathetic, and repeats that knowledge of homosexuality is not the same as knowledge of homosexual ephebophilia, insofar as it relates to the ability to paint an unsympathetic picture of Norwood.\nAppellee argues he met \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(i)\u2019s exception because the Commonwealth interfered with his ability to proffer this particular Brady claim, and that he exercised due diligence by presenting the claim within 60 days of obtaining the facts on which the claim was based. Further, appellee asserts a PCRA petitioner\u2019s previous knowledge of a fact applies only to \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(ii)\u2019s newly-discovered evidence exception, not \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(f), alleging the Commonwealth is required to disclose evidence in its possession even if the defense has previous knowledge or other information about that fact, and the failure to disclose such evidence violates Brady, constituting governmental interference with the ability to present a Brady claim.\nOur examination of the three omissions alleged leads to the inescapable conclusion that appellee is not entitled to relief. The missing reports were found to be relevant to Norwood\u2019s character, but the failure to explore or exploit that character was not a result of governmental interference\u2014 there is abundant evidence appellee knew of Norwood\u2019s homosexuality and conduct with teenage boys well before trial, sufficient to present him as unsympathetic before the jury. Appellee himself was a teenage male admittedly engaged in homosexual acts with Norwood. Although he denied any involvement in the crime at trial, evidence included his plan to extort Norwood by threating to expose him for being a homosexual, and statements in which Draper and appellee taunted Norwood for \u201cliking boys\u201d while they were beating him. N.T. Trial, 1/22/86, at 667-68; N.T. Trial, 1/23/86, at 813-14; see also N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/20/12, at 219; N.T. PCRA Hearing Vol. 2, 9/24/12, at 13. Draper testified at trial that appellee told him Norwood was a homosexual. N.T. Trial, 1/23/86, at 814. We agree with the courts that have previously considered appellee\u2019s claims based on sexual orientation \u2014 there is no reasonable conclusion that the result of a trial for this horrific crime would have been different had the missing information been provided as appellee would have liked.\nFurther, evidence offered at appellee\u2019s first PCRA hearing in 1998 demonstrated the extent of available knowledge of Norwood\u2019s sexual appetites. At that proceeding, counsel offered three expert witnesses, all of whom testified appellee and Norwood were in a homosexual relationship in which appellee was abused by Norwood; they suggested the murder was an \u201cenraged killing\u201d in response to the sexual abuse. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 4/8/98, at 106, 115, 156-59, 186; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 4/9/98, at 360-61, 375-76; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 4/13/98, at 540, 542-44, 551-54, 569-70. Additionally, appellee\u2019s high school teacher, who was also a private psychotherapist, testified Norwood molested young boys, including appellee, and he learned this information from several people in early 1997. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 4/8/98, at 226-33. Appellee\u2019s friend, Donald Fisher, who was. also in a homosexual relationship with appellee for approximately five years, testified appellee and Norwood began a homosexual relationship when appellee was approximately 15 years old, which lasted a few years, and Norwood was abusive, liked to inflict pain, and enjoyed having sex with teenage males. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 4/13/98, at 597, 602-05, 617. Fisher also testified appellee would engage in homosexual acts with Norwood for money, alcohol, and other gifts. Id., at 617-18. Fisher learned this information not only from observing the relationship between appellee and Norwood but also because appellee told Fisher. Id. Additionally, the defense stated throughout the hearings that its mitigation witnesses were offered to show Norwood molested young males and to demonstrate trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in investigating the homosexual relationship between appellee and Norwood and the abuse involved in that relationship. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 4/8/98, at 235-37; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 4/13/98, at 603.\nAppellee\u2019s prior knowledge was also evident at his federal habeas corpus proceeding, during which he alleged Norwood was a closeted homosexual from whom he could extort cash by threatening to expose Norwood\u2019s secret to his wife. Williams, 637 F.3d at 200. Analyzing the record from appellee\u2019s first PCRA proceeding, the Third Circuit noted appellee and Nor-wood began their homosexual relationship when appellee was approximately 13 years old. Id., at 229. The court stated Norwood was physically abusive toward appellee, once allegedly beating him with a belt. Id., at 229-30. The federal district court also elicited testimony from appellee\u2019s first PCRA proceeding showing Norwood was a homosexual with whom appellee had sex in exchange for money, drugs, and gifts. See Williams v. Beard, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41310, at *106 n. 32 (E.D.Pa. May 8, 2007).\nThe PCRA court itself acknowledged appellee\u2019s arguments from the 1998 PCRA hearing supported his prior knowledge, stating appellee \u201celicited evidence from [ ] Fisher that [ ] Norwood was very degrading and he liked to have sex with kids. However, the current claim does not rest solely upon that evidence.\u201d See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/28/12, at 21. The court also noted the defense, at the time of trial, indeed had information suggesting Norwood was a homosexual \u2014 a statement from a witness disclosing appellee told him Norwood \u201c Vas a homosexual and was the type to pay people.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 27-28. Appellee\u2019s PCRA counsel also referenced his prior knowledge at the hearings. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/10/12, at 24 (\u201c[W]e tried to present in prior proceedings evidence about the sexual abuse by [ ] Norwood of [appellee.]\u201d).\nAnd quite tellingly, Draper\u2019s affidavits established he knew appellee and Norwood were in a homosexual relationship\u2014 \u201c[appellee] had also told me that Norwood was gay\u201d and during the murder, \u201c[appellee] was yelling \u2018so you like boys, so you like boys\u2019 as he hit Norwood\u201d \u2014 and appellee told Draper the murder was about the homosexual relationship. Draper\u2019s Affidavit, 9/11/12, at 2-4. Draper confirmed appellee\u2019s prior knowledge of Norwood\u2019s homosexual proclivities repeatedly in his PCRA testimony. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/20/12, at 219; N.T. PCRA Hearing Vol. 1, 9/24/12, at 88, 98, 96; N.T. PCRA Hearing Vol. 2, 9/24/12, at 12-13.\nThe evidence alleged to comprise the Brady violation does not include information unknown to appellee, or information he would have been unable to find on his own. The \u201ckidnapping\u201d story told by Norwood\u2019s wife indicates that a probably untruthful story was told to her, but nothing more. The PCRA court apparently read between the lines and presumed the story was a lie to hide Norwood\u2019s homosexuality from his wife. And although this story was omitted from the wife\u2019s statements in the 1984 police activity sheet, it was disclosed with the pastor\u2019s statements in the same sheet. That is, appellee was already aware of this story, whatever its value, through other means. See Reverend\u2019s Disclosed Statement, Exhibit C-2, PCRA Hearing, 9/20/12, at 5. Since appellee had it, the government did not interfere with his ability to obtain it.\nThe pastor\u2019s suggestion that he suspected Norwood may have been a homosexual would hardly have surprised appellee, who knew that for years. The government did not keep appellee from ferreting out the reverend, even if his opinion might have been admissible. The pastor\u2019s report that he once received a complaint alleging Norwood propositioned a teenage male would have been equally unsurprising. These allegations confirmed what appellee already knew \u2014 Norwood was a homosexual with attraction toward teenage males, like himself. There simply is no surprise in this revelation, no new information or insinuation that only now suggests Norwood might be made to look \u201cunsympathetic.\u201d\nThe third \u201cinterference\u201d involves nondisclosure of handwritten notes of the trial prosecutor; the PCRA court concluded they recounted a specific instance of homosexual ephebophilia. In toto, the notes read, \u201c[N]ot true \u2014 Mrs. House \u2014 son in play \u2014 Ronald\u201416 yrs.[sic] \u2014 touched on privates \u2014 I don\u2019t do that \u2014 nobody wd [sic] have to know \u2014 brought boy home [and] asked him not to say anything @ [sic] the \u2014 he stopped coming to church \u2014 disappeared\u2014never verified it \u2014 29 yrs. [sic] \u2014 1st X[sic] \u2014 never heard from others @ [sic] possible incidents.\u201d See Exhibit Court-2, PCRA Hearing, 9/20/12, at 2. The court sua sponte admitted these cryptic notes into evidence and used them to question the trial prosecutor.\nThese murky notes, if decipherable with any degree of confidence, do not indicate the origin or veracity of their content; they do not indicate whether the notes were written during a witness interview, much less who was being interviewed. Indeed, they start with the notation \u201cnot true.\u201d They do not mention Norwood, whose connection to the notes we are asked to insinuate. One could infer they involve the incident omitted from the pastor\u2019s statements in the 1984 police activity sheet, where a mother told of Norwood\u2019s propositioning her teenage son. However, next to appellee\u2019s own evidence at the 1998 hearing, it adds little or nothing whatsoever to the information available and already presented. The ability to pursue the mitigating tactic of making Norwood appear unsympathetic was not created by these notes.\nLastly, we note a measure of bootstrapping in appellee\u2019s argument. It is difficult to conclude appellee learned something new from Draper\u2019s latest affidavit, as Draper\u2019s information was derived from appellee\u2019s own statements to Draper prior to and at the time of the murder. Further, Draper\u2019s suggestion that appellee was enraged at the time of the murder depends on Norwood\u2019s prior abuse of appellee, which necessarily establishes appellee\u2019s knowledge of Norwood\u2019s proclivities before trial. Thus, any failure to previously raise this claim was not the result of governmental interference. See Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 813 A.2d 726, 730 (2002) (\u201c[N]o Brady violation occurs where parties had equal access to the information or if the defendant knew or could have uncovered such evidence with reasonable diligence.\u201d (citation omitted)); see also Commonwealth v. Morris, 573 Pa. 157, 822 A.2d 684, 696-97 (2003).\nLike appellee\u2019s failed effort to establish a timeliness exception, his Brady claim provides no grounds for PCRA relief because the claim is inapposite to the necessary materiality inquiry. The United States Supreme Court has never held Brady materiality is measured in terms of \u201ceffects on the defense strategy.\u201d See Commonwealth v. Weiss, 622 Pa. 663, 81 A.3d 767, 810-11 (2013) (Castille, C.J., concurring, joined by Eakin, J.). Further, Brady does not permit a defendant to shield himself from his prior perjury at trial. See id., at 811-13.\nAppellee\u2019s Brady theory suggested that had he received additional information about Norwood\u2019s homosexual proclivities, his defense would have learned his actual motive for the murder, i.e., rage over being sexually abused by Norwood, which, in turn, would possibly lead to a new strategy where appellee does not perjure himself and Norwood is portrayed unsympathetically. Yet, at the time of trial, appellee was aware of potential witnesses and information that would establish Norwood\u2019s homosexual attraction to teenage males. Appellee could have used his prior knowledge and his counsel\u2019s due diligence to obtain additional information and witnesses to support a different trial theory than that presented. He could have argued Norwood\u2019s homosexual proclivities developed into sexual abuse, leading to rage and ultimate murder of Nor-wood. He could also have created a portrait of Norwood consistent with that now proffered. However, appellee chose not to do so.\nInstead, appellee perjured himself at trial, testifying he did not know the victim, had never seen him before, took no part in the murder, and had no reason to be angry with him or wish to harm him. The defense he chose to present disclaimed knowledge of Norwood, which is antithetical to what he knew and could have presented \u2014 evidence that showed Norwood as a molester, which may have led to establishing a motive of rage, or evidence allowing him to depict Norwood as an unsavory character and sexual predator. Given the choice of defense, such strategies were not relevant. Given the details of appellee\u2019s crime, showing the jury the victim was \u201cunsympathetic\u201d was not a plan that was likely to cause reciprocal sympathy for the man who bludgeoned him and incinerated his body. Regardless, this alleged \u201csanitized information\u201d claim, coupled with the possible effect on appellee\u2019s defense strategy, lacks any basis under Brady, as it is neither exculpatory nor material. See Weiss, at 810-13 (Castille, C.J., concurring, joined by Eakin, J.). In sum, the Commonwealth did not obstruct appellee\u2019s ability to present Norwood as unsympathetic. Appellee had prior knowledge of the information on which he based his Brady claim, and could have presented the claim much sooner \u2014 prior to trial or at any time over the last 20 years. Because appellee\u2019s theory was built on perjury, and the information on which he relied was not exculpatory, the PCRA court erred in finding his claim material under Brady. Accordingly, the record does not support the PCRA court\u2019s finding appellee established his burden of proof regarding the \u201cgovernmental interference\u201d exception. See Abvr-Jamal, at 1268 (citation omitted). Because the PCRA court was thus without jurisdiction to consider the merits of this petition, see Hawkins, at 1252 (citations omitted), we vacate the court\u2019s order, dismiss this petition as time-barred, and reinstate the judgment of sentence of death. The Prothonotary is directed to transmit the complete record in this case to the Governor pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(i).\nOrder vacated; petition dismissed; judgment of sentence reinstated.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices BAER and STEVENS join the opinion.\nChief Justice CASTILLE files a concurring opinion.\nJustices SAYLOR and TODD concur in the result.\n. The court's order included files for both the Norwood murder and the murder of Herbert Hamilton. Both murders had the same trial prosecutor, the same defendant (appellee), and the same key witness (Draper). In the Hamilton murder, appellee was receiving money from Hamilton in exchange for sex; appellee murdered Hamilton when he threatened to expose this relationship. Although the charge was first degree murder, the jury convicted appellee of third degree murder, about one year before the Norwood trial.\n. Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).\n. The PCRA court defined \"homosexual ephebophilia\u201d as a psychological term for the attraction to \u201cyoung men,\u201d both adults and adolescents. See id., at 13 n. 32.\n. Subsection (b)(l)(i) provides an untimely PCRA petition falls within an exception if the petitioner proves: \"the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States!-]\u201d Id.\n. Subsection (b)(l)(ii) provides an exception for an untimely PCRA petition if the petitioner proves: \u201cthe facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence!.]\u201d Id.\n. Subsection (c)(2) states no stay may be issued unless a PCRA petition meeting all requirements of this subchapter of the PCRA has been filed and is pending, and the petitioner makes \u201ca strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits.\u201d Id., \u00a7 9545(c)(2).\n. The court also stated the Commonwealth interfered with appellee\u2019s Brady claim by \"disput[ing] the existence of information in [its] files about [] Norwood\u2019s homosexual ephebophilia\u201d when the Commonwealth represented to the 1998 PCRA court that the only evidence involved in the case was appellee\u2019s knowledge that Norwood was a homosexual and his plan to extort money from Norwood but mentioned nothing about the additional \"homosexual ephebophilia\u201d evidence. PCRA Court Opinion, 11/27/12, at 15-17. The court added a supplemental opinion to its PCRA opinion, describing additional instances that led it to conclude the prosecution exhibited \"gamesmanship.\u201d See id. app., at 1-15.\n. The Commonwealth\u2019s issues, set forth verbatim, are:\nI. Was [appellee]'s fourth PCRA petition, in which he alleged a violation of Brady[] based on the non-disclosure of information he had known since before trial, untimely?\nII. In any event, was [appellee]\u2019s Brady claim meritless where the information in question would not have been reasonably likely to change the outcome, had no apparent exculpatory value, and had been known all along by [him]?\nCommonwealth's Brief, at 3.\n. The reverend refused to make these statements in writing but related them to police in confidence. He stated, \"[H]e himself handled the matter internally and the complaint never went any further than that.\u201d See Police Activity Sheet, Exhibit P-24, PCRA Hearing, 9/20/12.\n. Although the Commonwealth contends the PCRA court violated Pa.R.Crim.P. 902(E)(1) in the \"Statement of the Case\u201d section of its brief, see Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 19, the Commonwealth does not raise a discovery issue on appeal; thus, we will not address discovery matters. See Pa.R.A.P. 302(a).\n. Trial counsel indicated at a hearing on appellee's post-sentence motions that he was left with using appellee's youth as a potential mitigating factor \u2014 since appellee provided him little, if any, assistance, he was frustrated in efforts to present a compelling group of character witnesses on his behalf.

        "text": "Chief Justice CASTILLE,\nconcurring.\nI join the Majority Opinion. Indeed, in my view, both the Brady claim appellee initially raised, and the Brady claim later uncovered by the PCRA court and upon which the court granted relief, are time-barred and frivolous. I write separately to expand upon the Majority discussion, and to address the important responsibilities of the PCRA trial courts in serial capital PCRA matters, an issue brought into stark relief by the extraordinary, and unauthorized, measures undertaken by the PCRA court in this case.\nPreliminarily, with respect to the latter concern, I note that this is a case involving a fourth PCRA petition filed by federal lawyers only after appellee was denied federal habeas corpus relief. The fourth petition was time-barred on its face\u2014 offering a new, recanting witness (a friend and cohort of appellee) for the same \u201cfacts\u201d and theory appellee had long-known and already litigated \u2014 and was blatantly frivolous, filed by the FCDO in a transparent effort to induce further delay. Rather than decide the claim actually presented in the efficient manner this sort of last-ditch capital litigation requires, the court below unfortunately strayed from its institutional duties. In the process, the PCRA court: ignored the strictures of PCRA jurisdiction and the appropriate parameters for discovery procedures and evidentiary hearings in serial petition matters; misapprehended what Brady discovery encompasses; misapprehended the substantive law concerning Brady materiality; and, most troubling, lost sight of its role as a neutral judicial officer. As a result, a warrant of execution was enjoined by a trial judge for no valid reason, on the basis of a frivolous fourth PCRA petition, leaving insufficient time for this Court to timely review the judge\u2019s injunction of the Governor\u2019s warrant.\nThe PCRA court per the Honorable Teresa Sarmina, justified its actions based on what it viewed as gamesmanship by the Commonwealth in allegedly withholding relevant information from appellee. If trial level prosecutorial \u201cgamesmanship\u201d is revealed and is relevant, it obviously warrants notation and condemnation. But, to be relevant in a case involving a fourth PCRA petition raising a Brady claim, the petition would have to be proven timely (to vest jurisdiction), and the uncovered Brady claim would need to possess merit, which both the claim raised in this petition, and the different claim found by the PCRA court, do not. Furthermore, in the Brady arena, before condemning officers of the court, the tribunal should be aware of the substantive status of Brady law both at the relevant time and today. And, just as a preview: Brady does not authorize searching through the government\u2019s files\u2014 not at trial, not on collateral attack, and especially not on a fourth PCRA petition. This case presents a supervisory issue concerning the manner in which trial courts handle serial petitions in capital cases that I believe requires highlighting and disapproval.\nAs noted, I will write also to expand upon why the claim raised by appellee, as well as the different claim discovered by the PCRA court, misconceives Brady.\nI. The FCDO Agenda as Necessary Prologue\nAs I noted in a recent case involving a retroactive Atkins claim raised by the FCDO: The FCDO\u2019s significant federal resources, \u201crepresented by its cadre of lawyers and roster of experts, are deployed throughout the Commonwealth; individual trial courts, and county prosecutors for that matter, who see only the occasional capital case, may be unaware of the bigger picture, and the strategy at work. This extraordinary shadow capability of the FCDO, and its demonstrated tactics, give me additional pause____\u201d Commonwealth v. Hackett, 626 Pa. 567, 99 A.3d 11, 40-41 (2014) (Castille, C.J., concurring). It has only recently emerged just how pervasive a presence the FCDO has made itself in Pennsylvania capital cases. Almost invariably without legitimate court appointment, and without any Pennsylvania authority\u2019s approval or role of oversight, this \u201cprivate\u201d group of federal lawyers pursuing an obstructionist anti-death penalty agenda have essentially anointed themselves as a statewide, due facto capital defender\u2019s office. Common tactics of the FCDO include multiple attempts to delay and obstruct cases, as well as attempts to unsettle and undermine Pennsylvania law. See generally Commonwealth v. Spotz, 627 Pa. 257, 99 A.3d 866 (2014) (Single Justice Opinion on Post-Decisional Motions by Castille, C.J.) (collecting cases and tactics).\nOne common tactic is that, immediately after one round of review fails, the FCDO \u201cdiscovers\u201d a new claim and initiates a new round of delay-inducing review. See, e.g., id.; Commonwealth v. Porter, 613 Pa. 510, 35 A.3d 4 (2012); Commonwealth v. Abdul-Salaam, 606 Pa. 214, 996 A.2d 482 (2010). In this case, that is exactly what the FCDO did. Appellee already had a full direct appeal, three rounds of PCRA review and appeal, and a full round of federal habeas corpus review and appeal when the FCDO happened upon \u201cnew\u201d evidence and filed this fourth PCRA petition which, in fact, merely reiterated the same evidence and a theory it had already litigated and which was found to be meritless. The PCRA court below should have decided the claim actually presented to it, while maintaining a proper perspective. And, it has become apparent that PCRA courts throughout Pennsylvania need to be vigilant and circumspect when it comes to the activities of this particular advocacy group, to ensure that the FCDO does not turn PCRA proceedings, and in particular serial proceedings, into a circus where FCDO lawyers are the ringmasters, with their parrots and puppets as a sideshow.\nII. The Brady Issue Raised by the FCDO was Time-Barred and Frivolous\nThis fourth PCRA petition was filed by the FCDO in March of 2012, immediately after appellee\u2019s federal habeas attack on his conviction failed. Appellee\u2019s final appropriate prospect for relief was through mercy: the clemency process. The FCDO was appointed to represent appellee for purposes of pursuing state clemency. Nevertheless, the FCDO proceeded to file yet another PCRA petition.\nThe FCDO alleged prosecutorial suppression of information allegedly provided to the police and the prosecutor during witness preparation sessions by appellee\u2019s friend and cohort-in-murder Marc Draper \u2014 who was convicted for his own role in the murder and is serving life in prison, who testified contrarily at appellee\u2019s trial, and has nothing to lose by now lying for his friend \u2014 and the Reverend Charles Poindexter. Draper claimed that he had told the arresting officers, as well as the prosecutor, that the victim, Amos Norwood, was a homosexual, that Norwood and appellee were involved in a sexual relationship, and that the murder was about that relationship. What was obfuscated by Draper and the FCDO was that this information could only have been learned through appellee\u2019s own communications with Draper, since appellee obviously knew his \u201ctrue\u201d motivation; or else it was just Draper\u2019s irrelevant opinion. Draper further claimed that police told him to testify that the motive for the murder was robbery. Appellee also included a \u201cdeclaration\u201d from Poindexter (who had testified for the Commonwealth at the guilt phase of trial), claiming he had learned from police that the victim would sometimes meet gay men in a house or an apartment.\nFrom this information, the FCDO constructed a claim that the Commonwealth suppressed \u201cexculpatory\u201d evidence of the relationship between appellee and the victim and appellee\u2019s supposed \u201ctrue\u201d motivation for the murder \u2014 again, as if appellee himself did not know his own true motivation \u2014 which could have been used to rebut elements of first-degree murder and to undermine the death penalty. The argument was akin to a \u201cbad faith\u201d argument, i.e., the Commonwealth had argued that a churchgoing man was robbed and murdered by appellee and Draper, despite knowing that appellee may have had a different relationship with the victim, and a different motivation that he was keeping to himself.\nAs the Majority explains, the information alleged in this fourth petition not only was obviously known to appellee, but it also was irrelevant to the trial proceedings (the focus of Brady) because the defense \u2014 offered through appellee\u2019s testimony \u2014 was one of innocence and non-involvement. In short, appellee chose to lie. In addition, the Draper and Poindexter statements \u2014 conveniently secured by the FCDO only after losing in federal court \u2014 rehashed the same information concerning the victim\u2019s character and appellee\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d motivation for the murder already litigated in the first PCRA proceeding. Thus, the FCDO\u2019s last-ditch Brady claim consisted of evidence already known to appellee, a claim already litigated by appellee, and a contrary defense theory springing from an admission that appellee perjured himself at trial. The PCRA court should have taken the frivolous issue as the FCDO presented it and dismissed it as time-barred. The court inexplicably did not; and instead, the frivolous issue now before this Court is a different Brady claim never raised by appellee until prompted to do so by the PCRA court, after the issue was uncovered by the PCRA court itself only by losing sight of fundamental precepts, including its role as neutral arbiter.\nIII. PCRA Court\u2019s \u201cDiscovery\u201d\nA PCRA court is without jurisdiction when a serial petition is filed (assuming it is filed more than one year from the date the judgment of sentence became final, as it was here) unless it falls within one of three limited exceptions. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545. In all PCRA petitions, the burden is on the PCRA petitioner to establish an exception to the one-year jurisdictional time-bar, before the court can act. Moreover, the rules governing discovery in PCRA matters explicitly state that no discovery is permitted for first counseled petitions except \u201cupon leave of court after a showing of good cause,\u201d Pa. R.Crim.P. 902(E)(2); while in serial cases such as this one, discovery is not permitted \u201cexcept upon leave of court after a showing of exceptional circumstances.\u201d Rule 902(E)(1). These are this Court\u2019s Rules: not niceties to be done away with perhaps because of some unease with capital cases.\nNothing in the Rules authorizes a PCRA court to demand the government\u2019s thirty-year-old files and for the court itself to go searching for information and new claims \u2014 all without jurisdiction being established. This is true whether the case is a capital case or not \u2014 the difference of a death sentence does not create jurisdiction, or derivative power, where it does not exist.\nThese Rules are neither arbitrary nor mere aspirations. The PCRA Rules square with Brady, which does not command an open-file policy, or a \u201csporting system\u201d of discovery. See Brady, 373 U.S. at 90-91, 83 S.Ct. 1194. Thus, even where, unlike here, serial petition jurisdiction is established and the petitioner demonstrates exceptional circumstances to warrant some form of discovery, such orders do not properly encompass simply seizing and rummaging about in the government\u2019s files.\n[T]he [U.S. Supreme] Court has noted that the duty imposed upon the prosecution under Brady is a limited one. See, e.g., Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U.S. 545, 559, 97 S.Ct. 837, 846, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977) (\u201c[t]here is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, and Brady did not create one\u201d); see also Kyles, 514 U.S. at 436-37, 115 S.Ct. at 1567 (\u201c[T]he Constitution is not violated every time the government fails or chooses not to disclose evidence that might prove helpful to the defense----We have never held that the Constitution demands an open file policy....\u201d). This Court has also recognized Brady\u2019s limited requirements, and has noted that Brady does not grant a criminal defendant unfettered access to the Commonwealth\u2019s files. See Commonwealth v. Edmiston, 578 Pa. 284, 851 A.2d 883, 887 n. 3 (2004) (defendant has no general right under the Constitution or Brady to search Commonwealth files); Commonwealth v. Williams, 557 Pa. 207, 732 A.2d 1167, 1176 (1999) (\u201c[T]he Commonwealth is, in the first instance, the judge of what information must be disclosed .... \u2018Defense counsel has no constitutional right to conduct his own search of the State\u2019s files to argue relevance.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 59, 107 S.Ct. 989, 1002, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987)); Commonwealth v. Counterman, 553 Pa. 370, 719 A.2d 284, 297 (1998), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 836, 120 S.Ct. 97, 145 L.Ed.2d 82 (1999) (Brady is not a general rule of discovery in criminal cases).\nCommonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa. 461, 884 A.2d 848, 854 (2005).\nThis Court\u2019s Rules, likewise and for similar good reason, do not empower a PCRA judge to hold evidentiary hearings in a serial petition case in advance of a demonstration of jurisdiction. Appellee already had five full rounds of review. Hearings are appropriate \u2014 after jurisdiction is established \u2014 only if there has already been an actual demonstration of a genuine issue concerning any material fact. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 908(A)(2), 909(b)(2). A new and different Brady claim discovered by the PCRA judge\u2019s own unauthorized, and unlimited, \u201cinvestigation\u201d \u2014 conducted after a serial PCRA petition is filed and not yet assessed for jurisdiction \u2014 cannot operate to render the petition timely when filed. Likewise, information obtained from the government\u2019s files after the PCRA court improperly ordered seizure of the information without foundation cannot retroactively operate to validate the improper serial petition \u201cdiscovery\u201d order (or \u201cseizure\u201d order, in this case) in the first instance.\nDuring one of the earliest hearings after an execution date was set in this matter, the PCRA court recognized that Draper\u2019s affidavit was insufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing. Nevertheless, the court essentially directed appellee to procure a third affidavit from Draper to see whether appellee could establish a strong showing of success on the merits which, in the mind of the court, was necessary in order to warrant an evidentiary hearing with a death warrant pending. N.T., 9/10/12, at 86-87. Following submission of the third affidavit, the court then ordered an evidentiary hearing to receive testimony from Draper and the trial prosecutor (who was no longer with the District Attorney\u2019s Office). Prior to this hearing, the court entered an order prohibiting the parties from communicating about the case with Draper or the trial prosecutor and further ordered the trial prosecutor to bring any documents in her possession related to the case to the evidentiary hearing. The court then ordered the prosecutor\u2019s office to give access to the case files to the trial prosecutor, via an e-mail the judge sent to the parties.\nA subsequent e-mail from the court took the even more lawless step of essentially opening the prosecutor\u2019s files to appellee\u2019s counsel, as the judge directed that appellee was permitted to review any of the documents reviewed by the trial prosecutor. Then, in another e-mail sent on Saturday, September 22, 2012, the court\u2019s clerk directed the Commonwealth to secure the police department\u2019s homicide files in this case and the Herbert Hamilton murder case because \u201cthe judge wants to review everything in the possession of the police department about these two cases.\u201d See Attachment to \u201cCommonwealth\u2019s Motion to Complete the Record,\u201d filed 10/26/12. The PCRA court\u2019s examination of these files provided the basis for the examination of the witnesses at the evidentiary hearing, including an extended cross-examination by Judge Sarmina herself.\nIgnoring the jurisdictional time-bar and the rules of procedure, and all in a truncated death warrant time-frame leaving little time for appellate review in two court systems, the PCRA court essentially seized the files of the Commonwealth and the police for no legitimate reason (and certainly not based upon the required actual defense showing of exceptional circumstances), independently reviewed the materials, and then used that which was uncovered by the court to examine witnesses at an evidentiary hearing again scheduled for no legitimate reason. The court also entered some of the documents into the record on its own without any motion or prompting by appellee. Only thereafter, during the September 25th hearing, did appellee ask permission to amend the fourth PCRA petition to include the new allegations raised by the documents the judge had found, and the court immediately granted the request, reasoning that Chapter 900 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure \u2014 the same chapter containing the Rules respecting discovery and evidentiary hearings that were of no concern to the judge \u2014 supposedly indicated that there should be a liberal ability to amend, \u201ceven if it is at this late stage.\u201d N.T., 9/25/12, at 78.\nUnfortunately, the PCRA court apparently allowed itself to be compromised by the fact that this was a capital case that was proceeding under an execution warrant. But, that is what happens, thirty years on, after a condemned capital petitioner has already exhausted five full rounds of review, and his federal lawyers try another longshot at delaying the case. Also, in taking these extreme, activist measures, the court cited a belief \u2014 proper enough in some spheres, and thus recognized in specific doctrines \u2014 that \u201cdeath is different.\u201d The judge added: \u201cThis is not any regular, old PCRA, including in a non-capital case.\u201d N.T., 9/14/12, at 69. No, it was not an ordinary case, but not for the reason cited by the court: it was a last-ditch fourth state collateral petition, filed by the FCDO no less, after federal review had concluded, rehashing old claims that just happened to involve a two-time murderer finally facing the execution of his sentence.\nThis case demonstrates that the \u201cdifference of death\u201d when reduced to an unmoored slogan causes mischief. The slogan does not create PCRA jurisdiction, and jurisdiction must be proven before the PCRA court can act. The difference of death is not a ground for ignoring this Court\u2019s Rules of Procedure, which specifically apply to \u2014 and in many instances exist specifically because of \u2014 capital cases. The difference of death also does not alter a trial court\u2019s crucial role as a neutral arbiter to pass upon the timeliness, and if timely, the merits of the claims that a serial PCRA petition actually raises. Five Ninth Circuit jurists recently commented on the abuse of the \u201cdeath is different\u201d notion in a dissent, explaining that the rule of law must be paramount:\nWhatever they are, motivations are beside the point. We should follow the law. Instead, we lay flame to orderly case-processing rules, comity due to state court judgments, and principles of finality. \u201c[Fire\u2019s] real beauty is that it destroys responsibility and consequences. A problem gets too burdensome, then into the fire with it.\u201d Ray Bradbury, Farenheit J+51 109 (Simon & Schuster 2012). We should be more cautious.\nHenry v. Ryan, 766 F.3d 1059, 1072 (9th Cir.2014) (Tallman, J., dissenting, joined by O\u2019Scannlain, Callahan, Bea, & Ikuta) (dissenting from grant of en banc review in case where time for Circuit reargument had long passed, and U.S. Supreme Court had already denied certiorari). Ultimately, the PCRA court here lost sight of its limited, albeit crucial, role.\nAs a consequence, the PCRA court steered its own course away from the actual Brady claim presented in this time-barred serial petition; and the Brady claim forming the basis for the penalty phase relief the PCRA court granted could not retroactively establish jurisdiction so as to justify the lawless discovery and evidentiary hearing that had already occurred per the court\u2019s sua sponte directives. To make matters even worse, the claim the court discovered on its own was simply a different, frivolous Brady claim.\nIV. Brady Law\nThe 1984 murder here was appellee\u2019s second murder. His first murder victim, Herbert Hamilton, was another man with whom he had a sexual relationship, a relationship appellee denied. At the trial in this case, appellee testified to his absolute innocence, claiming he did not even know the victim. As all now agree, this sworn testimony was a lie since appellee not only knew the victim, but he had an ongoing homosexual relationship with him. But, it is the story appellee elected to tell the jury in the hopes, however desperate, of an acquittal. It is not the first time a criminal defense was premised upon a lie, but it is a defendant\u2019s right to pursue the defense he chooses (even if it risks a subsequent perjury prosecution, which is hardly a disincentive to a serial murderer in appellee\u2019s circumstances).\nThe new Brady claim discovered by the PCRA court\u2019s efforts involved \u201cdirt\u201d about the victim: that he was a \u201chomosexual ephebophiliac\u201d who had sexual encounters with male teenagers. Specifically, as explained by the Majority, the claim was that information that the victim was a homosexual ephebophiliac could have been employed to paint an unsympathetic picture of the victim at the penalty phase. Majority op. at 550-51, 105 A.3d at 1244-45. Nothing in the death penalty statute, however, makes slander about a victim a relevant consideration. The death penalty statute does not recognize an exception if the murder victim was a sexual deviant, or even a convicted sex offender; and smearing the victim\u2019s character would not rebut the two aggravators the jury found: the commission of a felony (robbery) along with the murder, and the significant history of violent felony convictions, which included the murder of Hamilton, and a Christmas Eve, home invasion gunpoint robbery of an older couple\u2014 where appellee pressed a rifle to the woman\u2019s neck and threatened to blow \u201cher fucking head\u201d off, and then fired multiple shots into the wall. Nor would such evidence be probative of a mitigating circumstance. See Commonwealth v. May, 587 Pa. 184, 898 A.2d 559, 566 (2006) (testimony designed only to smear murder victim\u2019s character not relevant; noting as \u201capt\u201d trial court\u2019s analysis that: \u201cit\u2019s just as illegal to kill the devil as it is to kill a saint\u201d). And, when the defendant takes the stand and swears he had nothing to do with killing the victim, and did not even know him, it clearly limits his penalty phase options respecting mitigation arising from \u201cthe circumstances of the offense.\u201d\nThe linking assumption depends upon a pet Brady theory the FCDO has been raising recently, i.e., that Brady is violated by non-disclosures which, though involving information neither exculpatory nor material in and of itself, in hindsight might have been used by trial counsel to keep the defendant from testifying and perjuring himself, thereby altering the focus of the necessary Brady materiality inquiry. See Commonwealth v. Weiss, 622 Pa. 663, 81 A.3d 767 (2013) (Castille, C.J., concurring, joined by Eakin J.) (further discussed and quoted infra). In the iteration posed here, the theory goes something like this: had additional information about the victim been disclosed, the defense would have learned appellee\u2019s \u201creal\u201d motive for murder (again, as if appellee did not know his motive), and perhaps trial counsel could have convinced appellee not to take the stand and lie, thus opening the door to an attack-the-victim defense at the penalty phase. Even setting aside the irrelevancy of bad character information about a murder victim, Brady does not embrace this sort of perversity, a theory that rewards the defendant\u2019s trial perjury.\nFurthermore, even if the PCRA court found something \u201cunsporting\u201d about the government\u2019s conduct revealed in the government\u2019s files that the court seized, and even if evidence of poor \u201csportsmanship\u201d in discovery angered the judge, that is not the basis for a Brady claim. What matters is the legal point, made by the Majority, that there was nothing exculpatory or material in this information. Appellee always knew of the victim\u2019s supposed proclivities; again, the current claim is just another version of the claim raised and litigated by the FCDO fifteen years ago. Nevertheless, the PCRA court drew a legal conclusion that the evidence respecting the victim was subject to Brady disclosure before the 1986 trial; and, if only the prosecution had disclosed non-exculpatory information already known to appellee about the victim\u2019s character, it may have changed appellee\u2019s guilt phase decision to testify; and, the theory goes on in speculation, may have altered the outcome of the penalty proceeding. See Appellee\u2019s Brief, at 29-30 (quoting PCRA court opinion). The notion that this sort of evidence, in the context of a trial where appellee testified and denied any involvement, warrants Brady-based penalty phase relief, is ludicrous.\nAs the Majority notes, the U.S. Supreme Court has never held that Brady materiality is measured by the FCDO\u2019s effect-on-the-defense-trial-strategy theory; and a serial collateral attack is not the proper place to establish such constitutionally innovative new rules. Moreover, it would be absurd to grant Brady relief upon a claim that would involve rewarding a defendant for his own deliberate perjury at trial. I explained the error in this theory in my Concurring Opinion in Weiss:\nThe Brady analysis argued by appellant is erroneous for several reasons. First, the U.S. Supreme Court has never embraced his interpretation. Indeed, appellant\u2019s claim to the contrary is premised upon a mischaracterization of United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). Appellant states the following proposition as if it were black-letter law: \u201cThe proper Brady inquiry asks what \u2018course that the defense and the trial would have taken had the defense not been misled\u2019 and what impact the misconduct had on \u2018the preparation or present\u00e1tion of the defendant\u2019s case.\u2019 Bagley, 473 U.S. at 683, 105 S.Ct. 3375.\u201d ... From his assertion that mere effects upon defense preparation, rather than hard evidence, is the measure of Brady materiality, appellant argues his more radical extended rule that he may shield himself from his own prior testimony.\nHowever, Bagley supports neither appellant\u2019s \u201cdefense effects\u201d root rule, nor his testimonial immunity extension of the rule. Appellant\u2019s [FCDO] counsel neglect to note that the Bagley language they cite and quote as governing black-letter law in fact represented the views of only two Justices in Bagley. It is not governing law. I examined and explained the non-precedential effect of this language at some length in my concurring opinion in Commonwealth v. Willis, 616 Pa. 48, 46 A.3d 648 (2012), a direct appeal case. See id. at 674-84 (Castille, C.J., concurring, joined by Eakin and McCaffery, JJ.) (addressing Court\u2019s erroneous apprehension of Brady materiality in Commonwealth v. Green, 536 Pa. 599, 640 A.2d 1242, 1245 (1994)).\nMoreover, nothing in the logic of Brady materiality suggests a design to shield a defendant from his prior testimony or perjury. The test for Brady materiality is the same as the test for Strickland [v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) ] prejudice: whether there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. See Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 433-35, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (U.S.1995) (noting that Bagley adopted Strickland formulation for Brady claims). The test, whether for Brady or Strickland, looks to the proceeding that actually occurred and attempts to assess its underlying fairness. See id. at 451, 115 S.Ct. 1555; see also Bagley, 473 U.S. at 678, 105 S.Ct. 3375. The High Court has never held that courts, charged with assessing Brady materiality by re-examining the trial that occurred in light of previously suppressed evidence, are obliged to diminish the record at that trial. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s theory is a non-starter. The expansion, if there is to be one, should come from the High Court.\nSecond and relatedly, this is a PCRA appeal. An assessment of the fairness of appellant\u2019s trial \u2014 whether he poses a Brady claim, a Strickland claim, or any other claim \u2014 is not measured by minority views in prior decisions or by hopeful predictions of where federal decisional law might someday go; it is measured by the existing law that governs. The only federal decisional law that governs in Pennsylvania is that commanded by the U.S. Supreme Court.... And, errors in such predictions [of where the law might develop] favoring the defense run the risk of arbitrarily releasing murderers.\nFinally, I believe it is extremely unlikely that the U.S. Supreme Court would adopt a Brady materiality extension ... which would immunize a defendant against the effects of his own trial testimony, much less his own false trial testimony. To borrow from the Strickland jurisprudence from which Brady materiality derives:\nIt is true that while the Strickland test provides sufficient guidance for resolving virtually all ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, there are situations in which the overriding focus on fundamental fairness may affect the analysis. Thus, on the one hand, as Strickland itself explained, there are a few situations in which prejudice may be presumed.... And, on the other hand, there are also situations in which it would be unjust to characterize the likelihood of a different outcome as legitimate \u201cprejudice.\u201d Even if a defendant\u2019s false testimony might have persuaded the jury to acquit him, it is not fundamentally unfair to conclude that he was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s interference with his intended perjury. Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157, 175-176, 106 S.Ct. 988, 89 L.Ed.2d 128 (1986).\nSimilarly, in [Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 113 S.Ct. 838, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993)], we concluded that, given the overriding interest in fundamental fairness, the likelihood of a different outcome attributable to an incorrect interpretation of the law should be regarded as a potential \u201cwindfall\u201d to the defendant rather than the legitimate \u201cprejudice\u201d contemplated by our opinion in Strickland Because the ineffectiveness of Fretwell\u2019s counsel had not deprived him of any substantive or procedural right to which the law entitled him, we held that his claim did not satisfy the \u201cprejudice\u201d component of the Strickland test.\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 391-93, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (citations and footnotes omitted). Cf. Commonwealth v. Cox, 581 Pa. 107, 863 A.2d 536, 556-57 (2004) (Castille, J., concurring) (strong argument to be made that heightened prejudice standard under Lockhart should be applied to ineffectiveness claims with \u201cfundamental substantive issues that would have to be resolved in defendant\u2019s favor before relief could be granted\u201d); United States v. Day, 285 F.3d 1167, 1171 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cBecause a defendant does not have a \u2018right\u2019 to commit perjury -without suffering the consequences, the fact that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness gave [defendant] an opportunity to commit perjury does not constitute deprivation of a right; accordingly, this portion of the sentence does not satisfy the prejudice component of Strickland.\u201d). Again, in explicating both Brady and Strickland, the High Court has stressed the overriding concern of whether the defendant has received a fair trial. Fairness works two ways, the High Court teaches. When the defendant takes the stand and elects to testify, and then testifies absurdly or untruthfully, I doubt that the U.S. Supreme Court would hold that Brady requires courts to pretend that his testimony never existed.\nWeiss, 81 A.3d at 810-13 (Castille, C.J., concurring, joined by Eakin, J.) (footnotes omitted).\nFor these specific reasons, in addition to those set forth by the Majority on the time-bar and the merits, the new Brady claim fashioned by the PCRA court here provides no grounds for serial petition jurisdiction, much less PCRA relief.\nV. Conclusion\nThe FCDO\u2019s agenda and tactics by now should be predictable: this group has been aptly described, by a federal judge, as \u201cgaming a system and erecting roadblocks in aid of a singular goal \u2014 keeping [the defendant] from being put to death.\u201d See Abdul Salaam v. Beard, 16 F.Supp.3d 420, 511 (M.D.Pa.2014). That gaming is bad enough; but, what is disheartening here is that the PCRA court became unmoored from its lawful duty. Trial courts faced with serial petitions in capital cases must be vigilant to protect against frivolous claims, and must be aware of their own actual duties; the PCRA judge here was not.\n. Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).\n. Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546.\n. Federal Community Defender's Office.\n. Appellee cross-appealed the order below, presumably to the extent the PCRA court denied his other claims, but later discontinued that appeal by praecipe. See 673 CAP.\n. To the extent the alleged non-disclosures here involved matters found when the PCRA court searched police files, it should be stressed that the investigation and prosecution (murder in 1984; conviction in 1986) preceded, by many years, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995), which first held that the prosecution\u2019s Brady obligation extends to exculpatory materials known to others acting on the relevant government\u2019s behalf, including the police. Prior to Kyles, in Pennsylvania, the law was that prosecutors were not responsible for the content in police files. See Commonwealth v. Burke, 566 Pa. 402, 781 A.2d 1136 (2001) (abrogating prior cases). The consequent distortions in this case are not unusual in this unique area of law where cases continue to be litigated decades after trial, and federal lawyers contend that new rules or innovative rules govern collateral attacks on old cases. Any finding of misconduct respecting this nearly thirty-year old case, then \u2014 and I do not dispute the concern, even if there was zero exculpatory material to support a viable Brady claim \u2014 must be tempered by awareness of the governing law at the relevant times, as well as the fact that the Brady focus is not on any evidence, but only on exculpatory evidence and materiality.\n. Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002).\n. Herbert Hamilton, another older man with whom appellee had a sexual relationship, was the first person appellee murdered.\n. In concisely summarizing why the PCRA court erred in finding that appellee\u2019s reconfigured-by-the-PCRA-court claim did not qualify under the governmental interference exception, based upon information appellee himself had known before trial, and supplemental information which he secured for use in a prior PCRA petition over fifteen years before, the Commonwealth succinctly explains:\nWhen, at trial, defendant considered it in his interest to deny any sexual relationship with his victims so as to distance himself from their deaths, he made the strategic decision, independent of any information in the government\u2019s possession, to do so. And when that did not work, and he decided it was in his interest to instead claim in his first PCRA petition that he killed the victims [both here and in the Hamilton case] because they sexually abused him, he had no difficulty marshalling evidence outside the government\u2019s possession to support that version of events. At no point was his ability to defend against the charges, or to present any claim, constrained by the actions of the trial prosecutor or any other government official. Consequently, his untimely fourth PCRA petition, which he filed more than twenty years after his judgments of sentence became final, did not satisfy the governmental-interference exception to the one-year filing deadline. His petition was time-barred, and the PCRA court\u2019s order purporting to grant relief was a jurisdictional nullity that should be reversed.\nCommonwealth\u2019s Brief as Appellant, 34 (emphasis original).\n. In point of fact, appellee never so much as offered to prove that, but for the alleged non-disclosure, he would have presented evidence detailing his ongoing, prior sexual relationship with the victim, and then claimed that the relationship was why he murdered the victim. Furthermore, the decision to testify was defendant\u2019s alone; his trial counsel's role was limited to consultation. In this regard, it is notable that, in the prior PCRA proceeding, where appellee litigated the same basic claim, trial counsel testified that he had negotiated a plea deal where appellee would receive life in prison \u2014 the best possible circumstance where appellee faced the death penalty, had substantial aggravators, and the fact of the robbery meant that his best, realistic prospect was a conviction for second-degree murder, which carries a mandatory life sentence. Counsel consulted with appellee. But, counsel testified, appellee was adamant that he was not willing to exchange his prayer of a hope for an outright acquittal for a term of life imprisonment. Appellee told counsel he would rather be executed than spend his life in jail. No claim but innocence could lead to acquittal, and appellee decided to go that route by then perjuring himself.",
