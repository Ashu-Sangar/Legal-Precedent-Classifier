        "text": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nThis appeal by Fred Charles Moran challenges the sufficiency of the evidence in support of his conviction for bribery in official and political matters, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4701. It also raises the question of whether this is a strict liability crime, and if not, requires us to determine the appropriate mens rea for such offense. We hold \u00a7 4701 is not a strict liability crime; the mens rea for this offense is the Crimes Code\u2019s \u201cdefault\u201d culpability provision, id., \u00a7 302(c). As such, there was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction. We further hold that while the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury regarding intent, such error was harmless here. Accordingly, we affirm.\nIn 2003, appellant was an elected member of the Board of Commissioners of Haverford Township, Delaware County. The board decided to sell a 209-acre parcel of land on which the former Haverford State Mental Hospital was located. Appellant and Commissioner George Twardy comprised the \u201cliaison committee\u201d authorized to negotiate with potential buyers on behalf of the township. The firm of Goldenberg-Pohlig (GP) entered a preliminary sales agreement with the board, pursuant to which GP would pay $30.65 million for 61 acres of the parcel, on which it would develop residential properties and build six ball fields; GP paid a refundable $5 million deposit to the township.\nIn 2004, appellant and Twardy were removed from the liaison committee. One of their replacements, Commissioner Andrew Lewis, believed the agreement with GP was unworkable; he learned GP intended to develop an additional 15 acres beyond what it paid for, and the ball fields could not be constructed due to steep topography. The board formally rescinded the prior preliminary sales agreement and authorized the continuation of negotiations with GP.\nIn November, 2005, the parties reached a new agreement; GP would pay $17 million for 38 acres, on which it would develop \u201cage-restricted\u201d condominiums and carriage houses, along with single-family homes. The parties subsequently verbally altered its terms, such that GP would donate an additional $500,000 to the township for construction of a nature center or walking trails on the parcel; in exchange, the condominiums and carriage houses were more loosely designated as \u201cage-targeted\u201d and GP was no longer obligated to construct single-family homes. The board formally approved these new terms and authorized preparation of a written final sales agreement.\nOn December 19, 2005, the board held a special public meeting to address a looming revenue shortfall for the upcoming year. During the meeting, as Lewis recalled in his trial testimony, appellant proposed accelerating the collection of real estate taxes as a way to raise revenue; particularly, he suggested having GP pre-pay $500,000 of the 2006 realty taxes on the 38-acre parcel. See N.T. Trial, 11/19/07, at 104. When another commissioner asked appellant why GP would consider pre-paying these taxes, appellant responded, \u201c[W]ell, maybe they want to accelerate this process, get it moving.\u201d Id. Appellant expressed displeasure with the prospect of budget cuts and stated the township \u201cshould have income coming in from [the parcel].\u201d Id. Lewis suggested he and appellant call a representative of GP so appellant could present his proposal. Id.\nThe next day, Lewis and appellant had a phone conversation \u25a0with Michael Lawry, a principal with GP. Lewis informed Lawry the board was addressing a budgetary shortfall and told him appellant had a proposal. Appellant then said to Lawry, \u201c[C]all it extortion, call it what you will. We need $500,000, and we\u2019ll accelerate the zoning. We\u2019ll get you the zoning approvals you need and accelerate the process.\u201d Id., at 112. Lewis recalled Lawry asked whether the $500,000 was included in the $17.5 million, and appellant indicated it would be added to the purchase price. See N.T. Trial, 11/20/07, at 93. Lawry responded he was not in a position to answer but would discuss the matter with others at GP and get back in touch with appellant and Lewis. A few minutes later, Lewis called Lawry back and told him, \u201cI want no part of that conversation. Haverford Township is not in the business of selling zoning.\u201d N.T. Trial, 11/19/07, at 113. Lewis testified he called appellant the next day and essentially told him the same thing. Id.\nNo one from GP took any formal action in response to appellant\u2019s offer, and the parcel\u2019s sale price remained unchanged. The parties did not finalize a contract of sale until April, 2007, which the board formally approved in May, 2007.\nIn April, 2007, appellant was charged with three counts of bribery, one for each of the three subsections of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4701, which provides:\n(a) Offenses defined. \u2014 A person is guilty of bribery, a felony of the third degree, if he offers, confers or agrees to confer upon another, or solicits, accepts or agrees to accept from another:\n(1) any pecuniary benefit as consideration for the decision, opinion, recommendation, vote or other exercise of discretion as a public servant, party official or voter by the recipient;\n(2) any benefit as consideration for the decision, vote, recommendation or other exercise of official discretion by the recipient in a judicial, administrative or legislative proceeding; or\n(3) any benefit as consideration for a violation of a known legal duty as public servant or party official.\nId., \u00a7 4701(a).\nAt trial, appellant requested the trial court instruct the jury it could convict him only upon proof of the mens rea prescribed in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(c), which provides general culpability requirements apply when a criminal statute does not include an explicit mens rea. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s request, concluding in light of the language of \u00a7 4701 and the compelling evidence of appellant\u2019s intent, an instruction regarding \u00a7 302(c) was unnecessary. Over appellant\u2019s objection, the trial court gave a jury charge on bribery that tracked the language of \u00a7 4701(a) and was substantially similar to Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Jury Instruction 15.4701B. During deliberation, the jury twice requested the trial court repeat the definition of bribery; the trial court reread its initial charge both times, and appellant objected each time. The jury convicted appellant of all three counts of bribery, and he was sentenced to an aggregate term of six months probation and a $10,000 fine.\nFollowing the denial of his post-sentence motions, appellant appealed to the Superior Court, arguing the evidence was insufficient to establish he acted with the intent to gain an unlawful benefit because he would not have received any direct or personal benefit from the $500,000 he solicited from GP and Lawry. Appellant further claimed the trial court abused its discretion in denying his requested jury charge regarding culpability as defined in \u00a7 302(c).\nThe Superior Court rejected appellant\u2019s sufficiency claim and found no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury in conformity with \u00a7 302(c). Commonwealth v. Moran, 5 A.3d 273, 275 (Pa.Super.2010). In rejecting appellant\u2019s sufficiency claim, the court first noted while \u00a7 4701(a)(1) premises a conviction on receipt of \u201cpecuniary benefit,\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4701(a)(1), the definition offers no discussion of the extent to which a bribe must benefit a defendant directly, and \u201csubsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) require only a \u2018benefit,\u2019 which need not be pecuniary[.]\u201d Moran, at 279. Because the definition of \u201cbenefit\u201d encompasses indirect gain, it was irrelevant that appellant would receive no personal enrichment from the transaction he proposed; the court found no ambiguity in \u00a7 4701 regarding the prohibited conduct or the recipient of the benefit:\nPlainly put, no person in public service may solicit a benefit as a quid pro quo for his exercise of the official discretion he holds. Although that prohibition extends, as [appellant] concedes, to those who would enrich themselves, it extends no less to those who, under color of government authority, extract a benefit payable to others.\nMoran, at 280 (internal citations omitted). Accordingly, the court concluded appellant\u2019s attempt to secure half a million dollars to enrich the township in exchange for his exercise of official discretion in expediting the zoning approval for GP fell within the ambit of conduct proscribed by \u00a7 4701. Id., at 280-81.\nTurning to the issue of culpability, the court noted the level of intent was arguably implicit in the statute; the use of the phrase \u201csolicits, accepts or agrees to accept,\u201d which are inherently volitional terms, indicated culpability \u201cdepends upon evidence of a conscious mind, actively engaged in retaining the prohibited benefit.\u201d Id., at 281. The court acknowledged, however, it previously held the bribery statute does not specify the required level of culpability, and therefore, \u00a7 302(c)\u2019s general culpability standard was the applicable mens rea for \u00a7 4701. Id., at 281-82 (quoting Commonwealth v. Parmar, 448 Pa.Super. 470, 672 A.2d 314, 318 (1996)). Thus, the court applied \u00a7 302(c)\u2019s measure of culpability, as adopted in Par-mar, and concluded the \u201ccircumstances coupled with [appellant\u2019s own blunt and forceful language ma[d]e his intent abundantly clear\u201d and the evidence was sufficient to sustain his conviction. Moran, at 282.\nBased on the language appellant used in the conversation and the circumstances surrounding it, the court further concluded the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury regarding the applicability of \u00a7 302(c)\u2019s culpability provision was harmless error. Id., at 283 (citation omitted). While noting under Parmar, \u201ccourts are well-advised to instruct the jury in accordance -with [\u00a7 302(c) ] in prosecutions for bribery[,]\u201d the court held \u00a7 4701\u2019s language suggested a conviction must be based on evidence of consciously engaging in retaining the prohibited benefit; therefore, \u201c[a] level of intent so implied in the substantive elements of [\u00a7 ] 4701, which exceeds the threshold enunciated by [\u00a7 ] 302, obviously satisfies [\u00a7 ] 302.\u201d Id. Because appellant\u2019s conduct was \u201cflagrantly intentional,\u201d the court concluded the absence of an instruction on \u00a7 302 did not affect the verdict; the trial court\u2019s repeated instructions on the elements of the crime, using both \u00a7 4701 (defining bribery) and \u00a7 4501 (defining benefit), were ample to guide the jury\u2019s deliberation. Id. Therefore, any error in refusing to charge the jury specifically on \u00a7 302(c)\u2019s mens rea was harmless, and appellant was not entitled to a new trial. Id. (citation omitted). Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment of sentence.\nJudge Kelly dissented from the conclusion that refusal to instruct on \u00a7 302(c)\u2019s mens rea was harmless error. Relying on Commonwealth v. Woosnam, 819 A.2d 1198, 1206-07 (Pa.Super.2003) (holding failure to instruct jury on 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(b)(4)\u2019s mens rea requirement of negligence, as applicable to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3742, was reversible error warranting new trial), the dissent noted the jury twice asked the trial court to repeat the definition of bribery and appellant\u2019s counsel argued the jury may have been confused by the lack of a culpability requirement in the bribery instruction given. Moran, at 284 (Kelly, J., dissenting). Thus, the dissent could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury regarding \u00a7 302(c)\u2019s culpability requirement did not contribute to the verdict; Judge Kelly would have remanded for a new trial. Id. (citation omitted).\nWe granted allocatur to address the following issues raised by appellant:\n(1) Did the trial judge abuse his discretion in refusing to grant [appellant\u2019s request that the jury be instructed that [appellant] cannot be convicted of bribery unless the Commonwealth proves that [appellant] acted with criminal intent? Could such an error be harmless in a case where the sole issue was whether [appellant] acted with criminal intent?\n(2) Was the evidence sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [appellant] was guilty of bribery under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4701 in the respect that there was inadequate proof that [appellant] acted with criminal intent?\nCommonwealth v. Moran, 610 Pa. 3, 17 A.3d 918 (2011) (per curiam).\nI. SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE\nWe will first address the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to the requisite intent under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4701. Appellant argues the evidence was insufficient because although he \u201cunwisely spoke of expediting the zoning process,\u201d he did not do so with a corrupt intent or the desire to gain an unlawful benefit. Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 8. Appellant avers he engaged in no criminal solicitation since he was merely attempting to persuade GP to raise the purchase price it would pay for the parcel, and he neither requested nor received any personal pecuniary benefit from GP. Appellant discounts the trial court\u2019s finding he would have received a benefit in the form of an enhanced political advantage in the eyes of township voters, reasoning such \u201cvoter reaction analysis\u201d is purely speculative and could, in fact, trample on his constitutional rights to free speech and political association. Id., at 10-11.\nAppellant posits the Superior Court\u2019s decision will create tremendous uncertainty among governmental officials, as well as entities and individuals with legitimate business interests before governmental bodies, since it allows any discretionary act by officials in exchange for action by an entity or individual, such as having a land developer install a park or improvements in exchange for the municipality\u2019s waiver of an ordinance, to result in a criminal prosecution for bribery. Appellant asks this Court, as a matter of policy, to rule a public official should not be prosecuted for bribery simply because he used his public position to enhance the amount of money received by the political entity that elected him. Appellant contends the legislature did not enact \u00a7 4701 to punish aggressive politicians but, rather, to protect the public from elected officials seeking to achieve pecuniary or personal gain for themselves or their political allies.\nThe Commonwealth responds that, under the plain meaning of \u00a7 4701\u2019s language and \u00a7 4501\u2019s definition of benefit, a person who offers to exercise official discretion in exchange for a benefit need not receive the benefit personally to be guilty; in this view, a person may be convicted as long as he is interested in promoting the welfare of a beneficiary on whose behalf he is soliciting the benefit. The Commonwealth contends the evidence proved appellant specifically linked the township\u2019s expeditious zoning approval to the payment of extra monies by GP; the township, an entity in which appellant was interested as a politically elected official, a public servant, and a taxpayer, would receive an extra $500,000 if appellant\u2019s solicitation was successful. The Commonwealth echoes the trial court\u2019s position that appellant would also receive a personal benefit in the form of esteem in the eyes of the community and fellow board members, as well as the enhancement of future political aspirations. The Commonwealth claims these personal rewards comport with \u00a7 4501\u2019s definition of benefit, which includes \u201c \u2018anything regarded by the beneficiary as gain or advantage.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 25 (emphasis omitted) (quoting 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4501).\nThe Commonwealth additionally maintains appellant\u2019s position would create an affirmative \u201cpublic servant\u201d defense to the crime of bribery, exempting public officials if the value they want in return for their action benefits a political entity or the public. The Commonwealth argues such a defense would contravene the purpose of the statute, which it perceives as the prohibition of \u201c \u2018selling political endorsement or special influence.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 27 (emphasis omitted) (quoting 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4701 cmt.). The Commonwealth finds support for this assertion from the comment to \u00a7 240.1 of the Model Penal Code (MPC), upon which \u00a7 4701 was based, which provides, \u201c[P]ayments in order K to respond to extortionate threats by public officials are within the prohibition [of the bribery statute.]\u201d MPC \u00a7 240.1 cmt. The Commonwealth views the exception appellant proposes as harmful to the public welfare since it creates the likelihood that favorable governmental action could be lawfully conditioned on the payment of money into the public treasury; this would present significant constitutional concerns, offending principles of equality, impartiality, and integrity, which have been the traditional hallmark of governmental decision making.\nFinally, the Commonwealth rejects the notion that appellant should be excused simply because he subjectively believed he was acting only to promote the township\u2019s best interests. The Commonwealth contends such subjective belief is irrelevant under \u00a7 4701 since the statute does not require proof appellant acted with a corrupt purpose; rather, in the Commonwealth\u2019s assessment, all it must demonstrate is \u201cthe defendant\u2019s intentional, knowing, reckless, or negligent conduct \u2018with respect to each material element of the offense.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 31-32 (quoting 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(a)).\nIn his reply brief, appellant disputes the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that a conviction for bribery is proper where the benefits sought are for the public and not an individual. Appellant notes the legislature exempted from \u00a7 4501\u2019s definition of benefit \u201c \u2018advantages [sic] promised generally to a group or class of voters as a consequence of public measures which a candidate engages to support or oppose.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief, at 10 (quoting 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4501). Appellant suggests \u201cbalancing of the Township\u2019s budget and the ability to avoid the need for a tax increase certainly fits within this category.\u201d Id. Appellant further contends the Commonwealth\u2019s construction of benefit disregards the principle that penal statutes are to be strictly construed. Appellant points out municipal officials are duty bound \u201cto govern in a manner that maximizes the interests, safety and welfare of the public^]\u201d id., at 11 (citing 53 P.S. \u00a7 65607); thus, appellant reasons, every discretionary action an elected official takes in furtherance of this duty may be viewed as enhancing political capital under the Commonwealth\u2019s view, constituting conferral of a benefit, and hence criminal liability for the offense of bribery.\nAppellant\u2019s sufficiency challenge is comprised of two basic claims: (1) he lacked the criminal intent required by \u00a7 4701 to be convicted of bribery since he did not act with corrupt motive in seeking to obtain extra money for the township in the sale of the parcel; and (2) the $500,000 increase in the purchase price did not constitute a benefit within the meaning of \u00a7 4501, since it would not have been received by him personally, but would instead have gone to the township.\nDisposition of appellant\u2019s claims requires us to interpret \u00a7\u00a7 4501 and 4701 to determine whether corrupt motive and personal benefit are required to sustain a bribery conviction under \u00a7 4701. \u201cBecause statutory interpretation is a question of law, our standard of review is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary. In matters of statutory interpretation, the General Assembly\u2019s intent is paramount.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hacker, 609 Pa. 108, 15 A.3d 333, 335 (2011) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted) (citing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a)). Generally, such \u201cintent is best expressed through the plain language of the statute.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hart, 611 Pa. 531, 28 A.3d 898, 908 (2011) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, \u201c[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). \u201cEvery statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.\u201d Id., \u00a7 1921(a). In construing or applying a statute\u2019s language, we may consult official comments that were published or generally available to the legislature prior to the statute\u2019s enactment, to the extent such comments are consistent with the statute\u2019s text. See id., \u00a7 1939. Finally, as \u00a7\u00a7 4501 and 4701 are penal statutes, they are to be strictly construed, id., \u00a7 1928(b)(1), with any ambiguity being interpreted in favor of appellant, see Commonwealth v. Clegg, 611 Pa. 468, 27 A.3d 1266, 1269 (2011) (citation omitted). However, we are not required to give the words of penal statutes their narrowest possible meaning or to disregard their common, approved usage; penal statutes are to be read in accordance with the \u201cfair import\u201d of their terms. Hart, at 908 (citations omitted).\nTurning to appellant\u2019s claim that the Commonwealth was required to prove he acted with a corrupt motive, we find no such requirement in \u00a7 4701\u2019s language. As previously noted, see n. 6, supra, \u00a7 4701 almost entirely mirrors MPC \u00a7 240.1; thus, we consider the official comments to \u00a7 240.1, which had existed for nearly a decade at the time the legislature drafted \u00a7 4701. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1939.\nThe early version of \u00a7 240.1 originally defined bribery as the purposeful attempt to \u201cinfluence corruptly\u201d a public official. MPC \u00a7 208.10(l)(a) (Tentative Draft No. 8 1958). However, the comments to the final version of \u00a7 240.1 indicate the term \u201ccorruptly\u201d was not included in the final version because the drafters believed this would obscure the section\u2019s scope of coverage \u2014 for example, by incorrectly suggesting one who justifies his conduct by claiming he only sought to counter opposing offers or to influence an official into making the right decision would not be guilty of bribery. See MPC \u00a7 240.1 cmt. at 196 (Proposed Official Draft 1962). Thus, because our General Assembly chose to adopt the MPC\u2019s formulation of bribery, which specifically deleted the limiting term \u201ccorruptly,\u201d we may presume the legislature endorsed the MPC\u2019s dispensation with the requirement of corrupt motive as an element of bribery. Since the legislature has chosen not to include such requirement, we will not rewrite \u00a7 4701 to supply it. See Commonwealth v. Mazzetti, 615 Pa. 555, 44 A.3d 58, 67 (2012) (\u201cThis Court may not supply omissions in a statute, especially where it appears that the matter may have been intentionally omitted.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s contention that his bribery conviction cannot be sustained because he lacked a corrupt motive.\nRegarding appellant\u2019s contention that he did not solicit a pecuniary or other benefit within the meaning of \u00a7 4501 because the money he solicited was to be paid to the township, not to him personally, the lower courts recognized \u00a7 4501 defines \u201cbenefit\u201d broadly, so as to include situations where a public servant solicits money, gain, or advantage for \u201cany other person or entity in whose welfare he is interested[.]\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4501 (emphasis added). The definition covering solicitation on behalf of a third party, such as a family member or spouse, is obviously included in the ambit of the statute. In such situations, the public servant is still deemed the beneficiary, even though the benefit is received by a third party.\nHere, the question is whether the township is an \u201centity in whose welfare [appellant] is interested[.]\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4501. Appellant\u2019s argument that his motive was solely to benefit the township clearly shows a considered interest, but neither \u00a7 4501 nor any other portion of the Crimes Code explicitly defines \u201centity,\u201d \u201cinterested,\u201d or \u201cwelfare.\u201d The parties advance conflicting yet viable interpretations of \u00a7 4701 as applied here, such that a latent ambiguity exists, requiring us to resort to principles of statutory construction for its resolution. See Commonwealth v. McCoy, 599 Pa. 599, 962 A.2d 1160, 1167 (2009) (principles of construction are implicated where neither party\u2019s argument regarding interpretation of phrase in statute is so weak or implausible that statute can be called unambiguous). To ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent, we may consider: the occasion and necessity for the statute; the mischief it remedies; the object to be attained; the former law, including other statutes regarding the same or similar subjects; and the consequences of a particular interpretation. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(1), (3)-(6).\nIn examining \u00a7 4701\u2019s background, we find its official comment to be of particular significance. The comment establishes the General Assembly deliberately expanded the scope of the definition of benefit beyond conduct proscribed by \u00a7 4701\u2019s predecessor statute, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4303 (repealed), to include \u201cevery possible type of offer made or designed to influence official action.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4701 cmt. The comment further emphasizes \u201cthis section is intended to prohibit selling political endorsement or special influence.\u201d Id.\nThere could be no clearer indication of legislative intent: the conduct \u00a7 4701 was intended to address is the exchange of privileged treatment in any governmental process for something of value. To ensure equality and impartiality in the legislative, judicial, and administrative processes, public servants are prohibited from exercising their influence more favorably for any person or entity willing to pay something of value, regardless of whether that value inures to the benefit of the public servant or the entity served. The statute\u2019s aim is to prevent the purchase of special influence and to ensure public servants retain the integrity in dealing that their position of public trust requires. Thus, payment to a governmental entity \u2014 such as the township \u2014 in exchange for the promise of special treatment \u2014 such as expediting the zoning process\u2014 by public servants who are officers or employees of that same body falls within \u00a7 4701\u2019s purview.\nWe emphasize our holding applies only to situations where a public servant seeks or receives a benefit on behalf of a governmental entity from a third party in exchange for the promise to exercise special influence in the governmental process. We do not read \u00a7 4701 as applying to situations where public servants seek benefits for the governmental entity through the regular conduct of governmental affairs. It only becomes criminal where there is some offer of special treatment in exchange for something of value given to the official or the government entity he represents. From the standpoint of the public, and in particular the party solicited, it is patently improper for an official to condition successful or expedited completion of a legitimate process on payment of extra money \u2014 that extortionate process is what the bribery statute manifestly addresses. The public should not have the decisions of its officials affected by an applicant\u2019s acceptance or refusal of extra demands appended to the requirements of the lawful process. Neither should an applicant face the dilemma of paying to obtain expeditious approval, or not paying and facing continued uncertainty, non-expeditious treatment, and the potential enmity of the soliciting township officials. While perhaps the product of factors not relevant here, we are compelled to note GP chose not to pay, and finalization of the November, 2005 agreement\u2019s terms was not had for 18 months more.\nPublic servants may negotiate for a higher sales price for an asset owned by the governmental entity, or negotiate restrictions or conditions on the use of public property being sold. They may seek, during the ordinary course of the zoning process, to reserve or acquire property for uses they deem beneficial to the public they represent. Section 4701 does not hamper such negotiating abilities; to the extent the Superior Court\u2019s decision may be read as such, as suggested by appellant and amici, we disavow it. What public servants may not do is condition a \u201cdecision, opinion, recommendation, vote or other exercise of discretion\u201d upon a solicitation for benefits beyond those inherent in the underlying transaction. Negotiating a higher price before agreeing to sell is one thing\u2014 linking a higher price to expeditious approval of zoning matters is quite another. Zoning approval may be a condition of sale, but it cannot be disregarded by the seller in return for money or other benefit.\nApplying these concepts to the instant matter, we conclude it was reasonable for the jury to find appellant\u2019s conduct in soliciting the extra $500,000 from GP was not merely a continuation of the negotiation process or a savvy attempt to drive a hard bargain. Rather, this was a specific promise of preferential treatment to GP in the zoning process, in exchange for half a million dollars in excess of the purchase price. Clearly, the jury was warranted in finding this was an offer to sell a specific zoning process and outcome in exchange for a payment of money to the governmental body, and it was within the type of conduct \u00a7 4701 was intended to prohibit. Perhaps Commissioner Lewis put it best: a township cannot be in the business of selling zoning.\nII. TRIAL COURT\u2019S REFUSAL TO CHARGE JURY ON CRIMINAL INTENT\nA. Applicability of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(c)\u2019s default culpability provision to offense of bribery in official and political matters\nWe turn to appellant\u2019s claim the trial court should have charged the jury that 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(e)\u2019s default culpability requirements apply to \u00a7 4701. Appellant, relying on the Superior Court\u2019s decision in Parmar, argues \u00a7 4701 is not a strict liability statute and, therefore, \u00a7 302(c) applies. He further contends the failure to instruct the jury in this regard gave the jury the false impression that \u00a7 4701 is a strict liability offense and this was not harmless error because his state of mind during his phone conversation with Lawry was a critical issue.\nThe Commonwealth argues \u00a7 4701 does not include a culpable state of mind as an essential element of the offense, contending this signals the legislature\u2019s intent to abandon the traditional mens rea requirement. The Commonwealth points to the official explanatory note to \u00a7 240.1 of the MPC, on which \u00a7 4701 is based, which specifies it \u201cabandons the usual focus upon \u2018corrupt\u2019 agreements or a \u2018corrupt\u2019 intent[.]\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 16 (emphasis omitted) (quoting MPC \u00a7 240.1 explanatory note (2001)). The Commonwealth also notes the Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Jury Instructions do not include a specific statement regarding criminal intent as an element of \u00a7 4701. See Pa. SSJI (Crim) 15.4701A, 15.4701B. The Commonwealth further notes only a plurality in Parmar agreed \u00a7 302(c)\u2019s default culpability provisions apply to \u00a7 4701, and thus, appellant\u2019s reliance on that decision is misplaced. In the alternative, the Commonwealth contends any error in the omission of an instruction on intent was harmless because it did not alter the outcome of the trial; the record, including appellant\u2019s own characterization that his actions might comprise extortion, contains irresistible evidence appellant\u2019s statements to Lawry were undertaken with the specific purpose of extracting additional money in exchange for preferential treatment in the zoning process, ie., with criminal intent.\nTo determine the propriety of the trial court\u2019s jury instruction, we must address the threshold issue of whether a mens rea is required by \u00a7 4701, and if so, which level. This is a question of law; thus, our standard of review is de novo and scope of review is plenary. Commonwealth v. Roebuck, 612 Pa. 642, 32 A.3d 613, 615 (2011) (citation omitted). We note absolute liability criminal offenses are \u201cgenerally disfavored,\u201d and, absent indicia of legislative intent to dispense with a mens rea, a statute will not be held to impose strict liability. See Commonwealth v. Mayfield, 574 Pa. 460, 832 A.2d 418, 426-27 (2003) (citations omitted). Although the imposition of strict liability is generally disfavored, this Court has recognized the legislature may create statutory offenses dispensing with a mens rea in fields that are essentially non-criminal in order \u201cto utilize the machinery of criminal administration as an enforcing arm for social regulations of a purely civil nature, with the punishment totally unrelated to questions of moral wrongdoing or guilt.\u201d Commonwealth v. Koczwara, 397 Pa. 575, 155 A.2d 825, 827-28 (1959). The penalty for such offenses concerning the public welfare is generally relatively light. Id., at 827.\nAlthough \u00a7 4701 does not contain an express culpability requirement, this does not mean the legislature intended to dispense with the element of criminal intent. See Commonwealth v. Gallagher, 592 Pa. 262, 924 A.2d 636, 638-39 (2007) (mere absence of express mens rea requirement in statutory crime is not indicative of legislative intent to impose strict liability (citations omitted)). Rather, \u201cthere is a long-standing tradition, which is reflected in the plain language of [\u00a7 ] 302, that criminal liability is not to be imposed absent some level of culpability.\u201d Id., at 639. Additionally, \u00a7 4701 is not a regulatory measure aimed at safeguarding the public welfare and health, nor is its penalty light, as is often the case with strict liability offenses; rather, it is a third degree felony punishable by up to three years imprisonment. Accordingly, we conclude \u00a7 4701 is not a strict liability offense; it requires proof of a mens rea.\nRegarding the level of mens rea required to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 4701, we have repeatedly held \u00a7 302 provides the default level of culpability where a criminal statute does not include an express mens rea. See, e.g., id. (holding where offense of luring child into motor vehicle does not express any mens rea requirement with regard to victim\u2019s age, \u00a7 302(c) prescribes default culpability requirement); Com monwealth v. Ludwig, 583 Pa. 6, 874 A.2d 623, 630 (2005) (observing generally where criminal statute does not expressly provide mens rea, General Assembly has provided default culpability provision in \u00a7 302(c), which determines appropriate element of culpability); Mayfield, at 427 (holding where relevant Crimes Code provision omits mens rea, \u00a7 302(c) supplies culpability). The comment to \u00a7 302 also supports this conclusion, providing:\nThe purpose of this section is to clearly define the various mental states upon which criminal liability is to be based. Under existing law the words \u201cwilfully\u201d or \u201cmaliciously\u201d are used in many cases. However, these words have no settled meaning. In some instances there is no expressed requirement concerning the existence of mens rea. These defects in existing law are remedied by this section which sets forth and defines the culpability requirements and eliminates the obscurity of the terms \u201cmalice\u201d and \u201cwilful.\u201d\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302 cmt. (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).\nThus, \u00a7 302 applies when a criminal statute does not express a specific mens rea. Section 4701 contains no language regarding mental state, and it is precisely this \u201cdefect[ ] in existing law\u201d that \u00a7 302(c) was intended to remedy, see 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302 cmt. We do not believe it was the legislature\u2019s intent that mental state be intuited from the language of the statute; absent summary offenses or absolute liability crimes, if there is no express wording indicative of a discrete mental state, \u00a7 302(c) applies. Accordingly, as \u00a7 4701 includes no express culpability requirement, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the public official was at least reckless in engaging in the conduct proscribed by the statute.\nBecause \u00a7 4701 is not a strict liability offense and requires intentional conduct, appellant was entitled to have the jury instructed regarding the applicable mens rea for the offense, which is provided by \u00a7 302(c). Therefore, the trial court erred in refusing to include such along with its instruction regarding \u00a7 4701\u2019s elements. See Commonwealth v. Mason, 474 Pa. 308, 378 A.2d 807, 808 (1977) (holding refusal to instruct jury concerning element of intent necessary to convict defendant of voluntary manslaughter was error).\nB. Harmless error\nHaving determined the trial court erred in its refusal to instruct the jury regarding the applicable mens rea, we must address whether such error was harmless. See Commonwealth v. Bullock, 590 Pa. 480, 913 A.2d 207, 217 (2006). \u201c[U]nder the harmless error doctrine, the judgment of sentence will be affirmed in spite of the error only where the reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\u201d Id., at 218 (citation omitted).\nHere, the trial court\u2019s jury charge tracked the language of \u00a7 4701(a) and the Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Jury Instructions. The jury was apprised that, in order to convict appellant, it had to find he solicited money as consideration for his proposed action as a public official. That is, the jury was instructed that a conviction required it to find he acted with the conscious objective of securing an additional payment from GP to the township in exchange for his exercise of official discretion in favor of GP. Such an instruction encompasses the definition of \u201cintentional\u201d within \u00a7 302; a fortiori, it encompasses knowing or reckless conduct. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(e). Indeed, there was no argument here that the call and its content were other than intentional, as described herein. It is only appellant\u2019s lack of a deliberately corrupt motivation that was at issue, and as noted above, motivation is not an element of the crime. If the solicitation was less than intentional or knowingly made, this might have been error, but the solicitation itself simply cannot be described as unintentional or unknowing.\nThus, the jury was advised appellant had to have acted intentionally to be convicted. Although the jury twice asked for the trial court to repeat its instruction, the reasons therefore are but speculation. There was nothing in the instructions given that could have led the jury to convict appellant of bribery on the basis of strict liability; all of the scenarios described as sufficient by the trial court required appellant to have acted with conscious objective toward each element of the statute, which elements we reiterate do not include a personal motive. See n. 2, supra. Therefore, under these circumstances where the jury was not given the misimpression that \u00a7 4701 is a strict liability offense, and was made aware it had to find appellant acted intentionally in order to be guilty, we cannot find the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury regarding \u00a7 302(c) contributed to the verdict.\nOrder affirmed; jurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justice STEVENS join the opinion.\nJustice TODD files a concurring opinion.\nJustice BAER files a concurring and dissenting opinion, the dissenting portion of which is joined by Justice SAYLOR.\n. Specifically, \u00a7 302(c) provides: \"When the culpability sufficient to establish a material element of an offense is not prescribed by law, such element is established if a person acts intentionally, knowingly or recklessly with respect thereto.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\n. The trial court charged the jury:\nLadies and gentlemen, you\u2019ve been told here, and told again, that the Defendant, Fred Moran, has been charged with Bribery. In order to find him guilty of this offense[,] you must find the elements have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. First, that the Defendant solicited from Michael Lawry the sum of $500,000 as additional payment for the purchase of township real estate, and also that the money was solicited as consideration for the decision, opinion or recommendation, vote or exercise of discretion in land or zoning approvals of the Defendant as a public servant. That [sic] is a Haverford Township commissioner. Or, also, the Defendant solicit[ed] from Michael Lawry the sum of $500,000 as additional payment for the purchase of township real estate, and also that the money was solicited as consideration for the decision, vote, recommendation, exercise of official discretion in land development and/or zoning approvals of the Defendant, the administration [sic] or a legislative proceeding. Or also the Defendant solicited from Michael Lawry the sum of $500,000 as additional payment for the purchase of real estate, and that the money was solicited as consideration for a violation by the Defendant of the known legal duty as a public servant. Specifically, a Haverford Township commissioner. Under Pennsylvania law, a Haverford Township commissioner has a duty to faithfully discharge the duties of this office, and to refrain from receiving, directly or indirectly, any money or other value [sic] thing in the performance or nonperformance of any act or duty. The term benefits means a gain, or advantage or anything regarded by the Defendant as gain or advantage. The benefit did [not] have to be a direct benefit to the Defendant. The term benefit includes a benefit to any other person, political party or entity in whose welfare the Defendant was interested. The term public servant includes any Haverford Township commissioner. Public proceedings and votes on resolutions and ordinances concerning land development and zoning are conducted by the Haverford Township Board of Commissioners, and are there for [sic] administrative and legislative proceedings. If[,] after considering all of the evidence^] you are satisfied that the elements of Bribery have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, then you should find the Defendant guilty of Bribery. Otherwise, you must find the Defendant not guilty of this charge.\nN.T. Trial, 11/20/07, at 236-39.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4501 defines \"pecuniary benefit\u201d as: \"Benefit in the form of money, property, commercial interests or anything else the primary significance of which is economic gain.\u201d Id.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4501 defines \"benefit\u201d as: \"Gain or advantage, or anything regarded by the beneficiary as gain or advantage, including benefit to any other person or entity in whose welfare he is interested.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\n. On appeal to this Court, the Superior Court\u2019s decision was affirmed by an evenly divided Court. Commonwealth v. Parmar, 551 Pa. 318, 710 A.2d 1083 (1998). The Superior Court did not reference or discuss this Court's Parmar decision.\n. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4701 cmt. (specifying that statute was derived from MPC \u00a7 240.1). Model Penal Code \u00a7 240.1 differs only in that its subsection 2 does not cover legislative proceedings, as does \u00a7 4701(a)(2), and the placement of the word \"recipient\u201d is different in its subsection 1 than in \u00a7 4701(a)(1).\n. Although in this portion of its brief, the Commonwealth seemingly endorses the Superior Court\u2019s view, expressed in Parmar, that \u00a7 4701 incorporates the default culpability requirement of \u00a7 302(c), this position is at odds with its argument, infra, which rejects the incorporation of \u00a7 302(c)'s default culpability requirements into \u00a7 4701.\n. The Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Risk Management Association and the Pennsylvania State Association of Boroughs (amici) have filed an amicus brief on behalf of appellant, challenging the Superior Court's statement that \" 'no person in public service may solicit a benefit as a quid pro quo for his exercise of the official discretion he holds.\u2019 \u201d Amicus Brief, at 13 (quoting Moran, at 280). Amici contend this is an overly broad interpretation of \u00a7 4701, and echo appellant\u2019s claim this violates the principle of strict construction of criminal statutes. Amici further contend that, if the Superior Court\u2019s decision is left to stand, it \u201cwould improperly criminalize legitimate negotiation, deliberation and decision-making by local governmental officials.\u201d Id. They argue the term \"interested\u201d as used in \u00a7 4501\u2019s definition of benefit \u2014 \"any other person or entity in whose welfare [the beneficiary] is interested\u201d\u2014 should be construed to mean a benefit provided to third parties or businesses in which a public official or a member of the official\u2019s family has an interest. They contend this interpretation is consonant with the definition of \"conflict of interest\u201d contained in the State Ethics Act, see 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102, which amici aver should be read in pari materia with the bribery statute.\nAmici also discuss general due process principles, noting a criminal statute that is not sufficiently definite in its terms and does not give persons of ordinary intelligence fair warning may be void for vagueness; amici seemingly suggest the Superior Court's interpretation of the bribery statute may implicate these concerns. Appellant alludes to this concern as well. See Appellant's Reply Brief, at 13. However, since appellant failed to raise any constitutional challenge to \u00a7 4701 below, we will not address such constitutional questions. See Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (issues not raised in lower court are waived and cannot be raised for first time on appeal).\n. Appellant\u2019s argument that he lacked corrupt motive loses much of its force when one considers his comment during the conversation\u2014 \u201d[C]alI it extortion, call it what you will.\u201d N.T. Trial, 11/19/07, at 112. A public official's offer to trade special treatment for money may be considered inherently corrupt, and appellant\u2019s words bespeak clear awareness of the extortionate nature of his solicitation. These words also evoke the unspoken other side of the coin \u2014 the undeniable implication that if the party solicited does not pay, there will be no zoning approval, much less an accelerated process.\n. See, e.g., MPC \u00a7 240.1 revised cmt. at 24, 26 (1980) (explaining \"benefit\u201d is defined comprehensively in order to \"reach every kind of offer to influence official or political action by extraneous incentives [such as] an offer to admit the child of a judge to a particular school, college, or private club in exchange for favorable action on a case[,]\u201d and further explaining an offer of money to a wife or relative of a public official is punished \"on the same terms as ... an offer directly to that official\u201d).\n. The former bribery statute prohibited the payment, delivery, or alienation of any \u201cmoney, goods or other thing\u201d to a class of enumerated government officials: \"any member of the General Assembly, or any officer or employe of this Commonwealth, or of any political subdivision thereof, or any judge, juror, justice, referee or arbitrator^]\u201d Id.\n. We reject amici's contention that the description of \"benefit\u201d found in the State Ethics Act's definition of \"conflict of interest\u201d is controlling. See 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102. The Ethics Act imposes a civil, not criminal, penalty and, unlike \u00a7 4701, specifically limits the type of benefit prohibited (pecuniary) and the category of recipient (the official, his immediate family, or a business to which he or an immediate family member belongs).\n. Section 4701(b) provides, \"It is no defense to prosecution under this section that a person whom the actor sought to influence was not qualified to act in the desired way whether because he had not yet assumed office, had left office, or lacked jurisdiction, or for any other reason.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4701(b). Thus, it is not an affirmative defense that the defendant lacked actual power to carry out the promised action.\n. Furthermore, the explanatory note to \u00a7 2.02(3) of the MPC, on which \u00a7 302(c) is based, see id. (\u201cThis section is derived from Section 2.02 of the Model Penal Code.\u201d), provides when the General Assembly intends intent, knowledge, or recklessness to suffice for the establishment of culpability for a particular offense, \"the draftsmen need make no provision for culpability; it will be supplied by this subsection.\u201d MPC \u00a7 2.02 explanatory note (2001). Accordingly, the legislature\u2019s refraining from providing an express culpability requirement in \u00a7 4701 indicates its intent that \u00a7 302(c)'s default mens rea apply.\n. It is true that only a plurality of this Court in Parmar concluded \u00a7 302(c) provides the mens rea for \u00a7 4701. Three Justices would have affirmed the Superior Court (Justice Newman, then-Chief Justice Flaherty, and then-Justice Castille). The three Justices in (continued ...) support of reversal (Justices Zappala, Cappy, and Nigro) expressed no opinion regarding the applicability of \u00a7 302(c), as the main question in Parmar was whether the Commonwealth could prosecute a public official under \u00a7 4701, a general statute, instead of under the specific provisions of the State Adverse Interest Act and State Ethics Act. Therefore, while Parmar is not controlling, it is instructive. As this Court was evenly divided in Parmar, the Superior Court\u2019s decision was affirmed, holding \u00a7 302(c) supplied the culpability level for \u00a7 4701; therefore, at the time of appellant's trial, \u00a7 302(c) was the applicable mens rea, and the jury should have been so instructed.",

        "text": "Justice TODD,\nconcurring.\nI join Part I of the Majority Opinion because I agree the evidence was sufficient as a matter of law to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant\u2019s conduct of soliciting from the representative of the developer \u2014 Michael Lawry \u2014 a $500,000 increase in the purchase price of the parcel owned by Haverford Township in exchange for Appellant\u2019s promise to expedite the zoning approval process and to get Lawry the zoning approvals that he needed, constituted an unlawful solicitation of a pecuniary benefit for an entity in whose welfare Appellant was interested \u2014 the Township \u2014 within the meaning of 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4501 and 4701.\nRegarding Part II.A of the Majority Opinion, I also agree with the majority that Section 4701 is not a strict liability statute, as there is no evidence the legislature intended it to operate in such a fashion; however, I cannot join the majority\u2019s conclusion that the default culpability requirements of 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 302(c) (\u201cSection 302\u201d) must be utilized in order to supply the requisite mens rea for this offense. Neither the plain language of Section 302, nor our prior caselaw, requires the automatic application of Section 302\u2019s default culpability requirements in every situation where a criminal statute does not expressly state a requisite level of culpability for the conduct it seeks to penalize, and there is no other indication the legislature intended to make the offense one of strict liability. Rather, Section 302 has a narrower application: it applies only where the \u201cculpability sufficient to establish a material element of an offense is not prescribed by law.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 302 (emphasis added). Consequently, in Commonwealth v. Ludwig, 583 Pa. 6, 874 A.2d 623 (2005), even though the statute establishing the offense of drug delivery resulting in death did not contain an express culpability standard, we refused to apply Section 302(c) as the default culpability requirement. Our refusal was based on the fact that the statute defined the crime as \u201cthird-degree murder.\u201d We deemed the legislature\u2019s choice of those specific words, coupled with our prior case law designating malice as the proper mental state for third-degree murder, to reflect its intent to incorporate the mens rea for third-degree murder into the statute.\nOur holding in Ludwig, considered in conjunction with the official comment to Section 302, which explains that it is intended to remedy statutory defects concerning the required mental state and where \u201cthere is no expressed requirement concerning the existence of mens rea,\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 302, cmt., indicates that, before Section 302 may be applied, the plain meaning of all of the words of the statute must be examined to determine whether they evidence a legislative intent to establish a particular threshold level of culpability. Accordingly, even when the legislature does not use specific culpability standards of intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently in a non-strict liability criminal statute, if a legislative intent to establish a minimum level of culpability can, nonetheless, be discerned from the legislature\u2019s utilization of other language indicating a particular mens rea, resort to Section 302 is unnecessary. Therefore, where, as here, the plain meaning of the words used by the legislature in defining the criminal offense include an implied culpability standard which requires that an actor engage in intentional conduct, we are not free to disregard such language.\nIn relevant part, under Section 4701, a public servant is guilty of bribery if he \u201coffers, confers or agrees to confer upon another, or solicits, accepts or agrees to accept from another\u201d a benefit \u201cas consideration for\u201d his official decision, the exercise of his official discretion, or a violation of a duty. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4701. Giving these words their common, ordinary meaning, they plainly prohibit a public servant from consciously seeking or accepting a benefit from another in exchange for the public servant\u2019s official act. That is, the quid pro quo which is at the heart of Section 4701 requires an intentional act by the public servant. Thus, by its terms, Section 4701 establishes a requirement that a public official must act intentionally in order to be convicted thereunder. See 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 302(b)(l)(i) (specifying that a person \u201cacts intentionally with respect to a material element of an offense when ... the element involves the nature of his conduct or a result thereof, [and] it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result\u201d).\nSignificantly, the official comments to Section 240.1 of the Model Penal Code (\u201cMPC\u201d), upon which Section 4701 is based, support the proposition that Section 4701 was intended to criminalize only intentional acts. These comments indicate that Section 240.1 was intended to reflect \u201cthe more conventional formula in bribery legislation,\u201d and to distinguish bribery from other crimes of public corruption, it sets forth the gravamen of this offense as one of purposeful action by a public official to accomplish a quid pro quo exchange, since it explicitly requires that any benefit sought or accepted by the public official be \u201c \u2018in consideration\u2019 of the official action or agreement therefor.\u201d See MPC \u00a7 240.1, comment at 197 (1962). The revised comments to the MPC, issued in 1980, also confirm that Section 240.1 requires intentional conduct. Relevant to the conduct at issue in the case at bar \u2014 a public servant\u2019s solicitation of a pecuniary or other benefit \u2014 the revised comments state: \u201cThe solicitation aspect of the offense is thus, in effect, a crime of purpose; the actor must have as his conscious objective the receipt of a benefit as consideration for official conduct on his part.\u201d See MPC \u00a7 240.1, revised comment at 18 (1980). Accordingly, I would conclude that Section 4701 has a culpability element, which requires that a person act intentionally with respect to all material elements of this offense.\nBecause, in my view, Section 4701 requires intentional conduct, I consider it error for the trial court not to have expressly instructed the jury that Section 4701 includes a mens rea of intentional conduct, and, also, in failing to define for the jury what constitutes intentional conduct. Whenever the language of a criminal statute requires a defendant to have committed an intentional or voluntary act in order to be convicted, it is error not to provide the jury with an explanation of what constitutes criminal intent. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Mason, 474 Pa. 308, 378 A.2d 807, 808 (1977) (holding that because the offense of \u201cvoluntary manslaughter contemplates a voluntary act of killing by the defendant\u201d the court\u2019s refusal to charge the jury concerning the element of intent was error).\nNevertheless, I join Part II.B of the Majority Opinion because I agree the Commonwealth has demonstrated, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the trial court\u2019s error did not alter the outcome of Appellant\u2019s trial, inasmuch as the record, which includes Appellant\u2019s own characterization of the actions he was taking as extortion, contains overwhelming evidence that Appellant\u2019s statements to Lawry in December 2005 were undertaken with criminal intent, i.e., that he made them knowingly, and for the specific purpose of extracting an additional $500,000 from the developer in exchange for his seeing to it that the Township\u2019s zoning process was expedited.\nAccordingly, for all of these reasons, I concur in the result reached by the majority to affirm Appellant\u2019s conviction.\n. \"Confer\u201d at the time of the legislature\u2019s enactment of Section 4701 in 1972 meant: \u201cto grant or bestow.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 475 (1971). \"Agree\u201d meant: \u201cto indicate willingness\u201d or \"consent.\u201d Id. at 43. \"Solicit\u201d meant: \u201cto move to action\u201d or \"to strongly urge.\u201d Id. at 2169. \"Accept\u201d meant: \"to receive with consent\u201d (something given or offered). Id. at 10. \"In consideration of\u201d meant \"as payment or recompense for.\u201d Id. at 484.\n. As the majority notes, Section 4701 almost entirely mirrors MPC \u00a7 240.1; thus, the official comments authored by the drafters of the MPC may be considered in interpreting Section 4701, since they had been in existence for nearly a decade at the time our General Assembly enacted Section 4701. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1939 (\"The comments or report of the ... entity which drafted a statute may be consulted in the construction or application of the original provisions of the statute if such comments or report were published or otherwise generally available prior to the consideration of the statute by the General Assembly.\u201d)",

        "text": "Justice BAER,\nconcurring and dissenting.\nI agree with the Majority\u2019s holding that the evidence was sufficient under the bribery provision of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4701, to sustain Appellant\u2019s conviction. I further agree that the default culpability provision of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(c) applies to the offense of bribery in official and public matters, that Section 4701 is not a strict liability offense, and that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury regarding the applicable mens rea. Where I part with the Majority is its holding that the trial court\u2019s erroneous jury instruction was harmless. Because I cannot conclude that the error was harmless, I would vacate the conviction and remand for a new trial.\nWe have explained that \u201cthere is a long-standing tradition, which is reflected in the plain language of Section 302, that criminal liability is not to be imposed absent some level of culpability.\u201d Commonwealth v. Gallagher, 592 Pa. 262, 924 A.2d 636, 639 (2007). Consequently, like the Majority, I would hold that Appellant was entitled to an instruction under Section 302(c) that the jury could not convict unless the Commonwealth established beyond a reasonable doubt that he had acted intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. Such an instruction would have been consistent with governing law, as the Superior Court had already held that Section 302(c) supplied the level of culpability for a conviction for bribery under Section 4701. Commonwealth v. Parmar, 448 Pa.Super. 470, 672 A.2d 314, 318 (1996) (\u201cAs applied here, the bribery statute does not specify the level of culpability applicable to the material elements of this offense. Consequently, it is sufficient to show that a person acted intentionally, knowingly or recklessly with respect to the material elements of the crime. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(c) ...\u201d), aff'd 551 Pa. 318, 710 A.2d 1083 (1998) (plurality). Upon Appellant\u2019s request for an instruction in accord with Section 302(c), the trial court had no basis not to comply.\nAs we have explained, \u201cwhen reviewing the adequacy of a jury instruction, we must consider the charge in its entirety to determine if it is fair and complete. The trial court has broad discretion in phrasing the charge and the instruction will not be found in error if, taken as a whole, it adequately and accurately set forth the applicable law.\u201d Commonwealth v. Daniels, 600 Pa. 1, 963 A.2d 409, 430 (2009). Under the harmless error doctrine, we will affirm the judgment of sentence in spite of error by the trial court if we conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the jury\u2019s verdict. Commonwealth v. Wright, 560 Pa. 34, 742 A.2d 661 (1999).\nThe trial court\u2019s instruction in this case mirrored the language of Section 4701, which omitted any reference to an express level of culpability. Accordingly, I cannot agree with the Majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\u2019s failure to apprise the jury of the mens rea necessary for a conviction was harmless error. The record indicates that, after the jury began deliberating, it twice asked the trial court to repeat the definition of bribery. Under such circumstances, I agree with Appellant that this demonstrates that the jury may have been confused by the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct them regarding the level of requisite culpability. Without direction from the trial court, jurors could have concluded that although Appellant\u2019s conduct and comments did not rise to the level of recklessness (the minimum level of culpability in accord with Section 302(c)), they could convict him on the basis of strict liability. Because I cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court\u2019s error did not contribute to the jury\u2019s verdict, see Wright, 560 Pa. 34, 742 A.2d 661, I would vacate the judgment of sentence and remand for a new trial.\nJustice SAYLOR joins the dissenting portion of this concurring and dissenting opinion.\n. \u201cBribery in official and political matters\u201d is defined in relevant part as follows:\n(a) Offenses defined. \u2014 A person is guilty of bribery, a felony of the third degree, if he offers, confers or agrees to confer upon another, or solicits, accepts or agrees to accept from another:\n(1) any pecuniary benefit as consideration for the decision, opinion, recommendation, vote or other exercise of discretion as a public servant, party official or voter by the recipient;\n(2) any benefit as consideration for the decision, vote, recommendation or other exercise of official discretion by the recipient in a judicial, administrative or legislative proceeding; or\n(3) any benefit as consideration for a violation of a known legal duty as public servant or party official.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4701(a).\n. This default culpability provision provides, in relevant part:\n(c) Culpability required unless otherwise provided. \u2014 When the culpability sufficient to establish a material element of an offense is not prescribed by law, such element is established if a person acts intentionally, knowingly or recklessly with respect thereto.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(c).\n. Section 302(b)(3) provides as follows:\nA person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and intent of the actor's conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(b)(3).",
