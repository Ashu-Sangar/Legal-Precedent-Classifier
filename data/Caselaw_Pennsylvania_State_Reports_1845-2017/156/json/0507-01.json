Pittsburgh Bridge Co.\nTaxation \u2014 Manufacturing corporations \u2014 \u2022 Exemption from, taxation\u2014 Bridge companies \u2014 Acts of April 29, 1874, and June 1,1889.\nUpon an appeal from a tax settlement against a corporation organized under the general corporation act of April 29, 1874, the court found upon sufficient evidence the following facts:\n\u201c During the said year the defendant was engaged exclusively in making and selling iron and steel bridges, roofs, girders and buildings. The process is as follows: It buys from others in a rough and unfinished form all the necessary lumber, iron, steel and other metals; finishes, shapes, fram es, designs and makes suitable for use the said material at its own shops in the city of Pittsburgh; sells the finished material for such use as may be intended or appropriate; and often frames, puts together and erects the said material into bridges, roofs and buildings.\u201d\nHeld that the company was organized exclusively for manufacturing purposes, and was exempt from taxation.\nArgued May 30, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 16, May T., 1893, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. Dauphin Co., March T., 1892, No. 109, in favor of defendant on appeal from tax settlement.\nBefore Sterkett, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell, Dean and Thompson, JJ.\nAppeal from tax settlement.\nThe opinion of the court below was as follows, by McPherson, J.:\n\u201cThis case was tried without a jury under the provisions of the act of 1874. We find the facts to be as follows:\n\u201c1. The defendant is a corporation of this commonwealth, chartered in July, 1882, under the general corporation act of 1874, for the purpose of \u201cthe manufacture of articles of commerce from iron and steel, and the building of bridges and roofs of all kinds from iron and steel and wood, or either of them\u201d (P. L. of 1883, p. 314). It has a capital stock of \u00ab100,000.\n\u201c 2. During the tax year ending the first Monday of November, 1890, it declared a dividend of six per cent, whereupon a tax of three mills was levied upon its capital stock by the settlement now in question under the twenty-first section of the revenue act of 1889.\n\u201c 3. During the said year the defendant was' engaged exclusively in making and selling iron and steel bridges, roofs, girders and buildings. The process is as follows: It buys from others in a rough and unfinished form all the necessary lumber, iron, steel and other metals; finishes, shapes, frames, designs and makes suitable for use the said material at its own shops in the city of Pittsburgh; sells the finished material for such use as may be intended or appropriate; and often frames, puts together and erects the said material into bridges, roofs and buildings.\n\u201c 4. It is not engaged in brewing or distilling spirits or malt liquors, and does not enjoy and exercise the right of eminent domain.\n\u201c CONCLUSIONS ON LAW.\n\u201c There is no essential difference between the charter of the defendant and the charter of the Keystone Bridge Company, which we have just considered in an'opinion filed to No. 292, January term, 1893, Dauphin C. P. We refer to the reasons there given, without repeating them here, as justifying the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s charter is that of an exclusively manufacturing corporation, and that the power to \u2018 build \u2019 bridges and roofs neither takes away nor modifies this charter.\n\u201c The fact that the defendant was organized under the general corporation act of 1874 does not impair the argument or change the result. That act simply gathers together many previous statutes upon this subject, and permits incorporation for any purpose which those statutes regarded as a manufacturing purpose. The test prescribed by Com. v. North. El. L. & P. Co., 145 Pa. 118, is to be applied to all corporations claiming exemption, whether chartered before or after the act of 1874. Is the corporation a member of the statutory class of manufacturing companies, built up under the act of 1849, and the later enactments on this subject? If so, we may safely disregard the definitions in the dictionaries, and must assume that when the legislature in 1885 and 1889 used the name by which the class had come to be known, it intended to embrace the whole class, although some of its members might perhaps be exercising implied or incidental powers which a lexicographer would not admit to be manufacturing.\n\u201c In our opinion the legislation on this subject has treated the power to build bridges as necessarily implied in the power to manufacture (no example of a purely building corporation has been brought to our notice) ; and has regarded companies like the defendant as exclusively manufacturing corporations, although they \u2018 built \u2019 such structures as well as \u2018 manufactured? their constituent parts.\n\u201cOur conclusions are:\n\u201c 1. The defendant is a corporation organized exclusively for manufacturing purposes, and actually carrying on manufacturing within the state.\n\u201c 2. Its capital stock is exempt from taxation by the final proviso of the twenty-first section of the act of 1889.\n\u201c We direct judgment to be entered for the defendant if exceptions are not filed according to law.\u201d\nExceptions similar to those of the preceding case were overruled and judgment entered. Plaintiff appealed.\nJSrrors assigned were overruling exceptions, quoting them.\nJas. A. Stranahan, deputy attorney general, W. U. Uensel, attorney general, with him, for appellant.\nRobert S. Frazer, George D. Riddle with him, for appellee.\nJuly 19, 1893:"
