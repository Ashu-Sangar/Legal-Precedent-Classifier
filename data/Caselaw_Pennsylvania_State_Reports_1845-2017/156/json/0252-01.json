G. \u2014 Exceptions\u2014Railroads\u2014Land damages.\nOn an appeal from a judgment in condemnation proceedings, plaintiff\u2019s only assignment of error was \u201c the action of the learned judge at the trial, after the jury had been sworn, in calling before him one of the counsel for appellant and the counsel'of said company respondent and saying to them: \u2018 I will not allow a verdict in this case for more than $4,000 to stand.\u2019 \u201d Nothing was printed in appellant\u2019s paper book except the names of the parties, the history of the case, the assignment of error, and argument. In appellee\u2019s paper book it was stated that no bill of exceptions had been sealed in the case, and that the language of the trial judge had been misstated.

Under the heading of \u201c The Names of the Parties and Nature of Proceedings \u201d appeared the following statement: \u201c The proceedings were upon petition of the railroad company to condemn land belonging to her [plaintiff] and from the award of the jury of view; she appealed.

Plaintiff appealed.\nHrror assigned was \u201cthe action of the learned judge at the trial, after the jury had been sworn, in calling before him one of the counsel for appellant and the counsel of said company respondent, and saying to them : 41 will not allow a verdict in this case for more than $4,000 to stand.\u2019 \u201d\nHenry G.
