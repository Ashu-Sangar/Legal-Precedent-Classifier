C. Dauphin Co., sustaining exceptions to report of auditor on exceptions to and distribution of account of executor of Joseph Hoffer, deceased.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell, Dean and Thompson, JJ.\nExceptions to report of auditor on exceptions to executor\u2019s account, and on distribution.\nThe account was referred to William II. Middleton, Esq., as auditor, who refused to allow credit for two notes made by decedent and payable to accountant. One note was for $266.67 and the other for $300. Both notes were overdue at the date of decedent\u2019s death. There was evidence that the notes were in possession of accountant\u2019s wife immediately after decedent\u2019s death, and were handed over by her to accountant.\nThe auditor also refused a credit of $1,042.43, claimed to be due accountant under the circumstances stated in the opinion of the court below.\nThe auditor also refused to allow accountant\u2019s claimoof $450 \u2022 for commissions.\nExceptions to the auditor\u2019s report were sustained by the court, in the following opinion by McPherson, J.:\n\u201cWe think that the auditor erred in rejecting the two notes of $266.67 and $300, respectively. It is undoubtedly true that these notes, being overdue obligations of the decedent, might have been paid b}r him and been found among his papers by the executor. The executor is also the payee, and therefore as his possession might be either in his own right or merely as executor he was bound to show clearly that he held the notes by a hostile title : McCreary\u2019s Ap., 5 Cent. R. 855 ; McMahon\u2019s Est., 132 Pa. 179. This he undertook to do by offering to prove that these notes were in the custody of his wife immediately after his father\u2019s death, and were handed over to him by her. If true, and we find the fact to be as just stated, this explained the otherwise ambiguous character of his possession, and showed that he held them as an individual and not by virtue of his ex-ecutorship. No doubt the auditor would have reached the same conclusion if he had considered Mrs. Hoffer\u2019s testimony, but he rejected it as incompetent, apparently overlooking the cases of R'othrock v. Gallaher, 91 Pa. 108, Stephens v. Cotterell, 99 Pa. 188; Foster v. Collner, 107 Pa. 305; Adams v. Edwards, 115 Pa. 211; Porter v. Nelson, 121 Pa. 628; Patterson v. Dushane, 137 Pa. 23, which distinctly hold that a witness may testify to a fact existing or an act occurring after the decedent\u2019s death, although the evidence may in its effect tend to prove that the same fact existed prior to his death. As the accountant himself could have testified to his wife\u2019s custody of these notes after his father\u2019s death, the case of Bitner v. Boone, 128 Pa. 567, does not apply. These credits of $412.44 and $396 must be restored.\n\u201c.Upon the next subject of dispute there are no findings of facts, the auditor believing that the order recommitting the report gave him no power to consider the evidence offered. We therefore find the facts to be as follows :\n\u201c In March, 1884, Aaron J. Hoffer, the accountant, gave to his father, Joseph Hoffer, the decedent, a mortgage for $5,300 on the upper or Cumbler farm, in Lower Swatara township. In 1887 $1,000 was paid, and the remainder was due as follows : $500 on April 1,1889; $500 on April 1,1890; $500 on April 1, 1891; $500 on April 1, 1892; $500 on April 1, 1893; $500 on April 1, 1894; $500 on April 1, 1895 ; $500 on April 1, 1896.\n\u201c These installments did not bear interest until after the respective dates of maturity. In January, 1888, the decedent desired to buy a farm from Eshelman & Ebersole, and in order to raise the necessary money proposed that if Aaron would make immediate payment of the principal he would afterwards pay the interest which Aaron would thus lose. Aaron accepted the proposition and paid the money, and the mortgage was satisfied, but the decedent never paid the interest in fulfillment of his-promise.\n\u201c There was another mortgage for $7,000, given in February, 1881, upon a different farm, similarly securing deferred payments (from 1889 to 1900), without interest, which was satisfied in April, 1883, five years before the transaction now in question. By a mistake, which is averred to be due to the confusion of these two similar transactions, the accountant claimed credit for interest on the deferred payments of this mortgage,, instead of claiming it, as was intended, upon the deferred payments of the mortgage on the upper farm. The credit of $2,041.48 in the account is therefore admitted to be wrong, and the claim is restated as $909.93, with interest from April 1,. 1888, to May 6, 1890, $114.50, or a total of $1,024.43.\n\u201c The credit originally claimed was rejected by the auditor under an erroneous view of the testimony. The contract is not made out merely by proof of Joseph Hoffer\u2019s declarations. The unsatisfactory character of this form of testimony is conceded as declared in the authorities cited by the auditor, but there is much more here than admissions. John Eshelman is a witness, who was present when the contract was made; if he is believed \u2014 and there is no ground for rejecting his testimony \u2014lie saw the parties face to face, and heard them agree on the terms. The only declaration or admission is that which Joseph Holier made afterwards, namely, that Aaron had paid the money; and this admission is about a fact which we do not understand to be denied, and which indeed is also proved by the satisfaction of the mortgage. We are of opinion therefore that under the facts above stated a credit of $1,024.43 ought to be allowed.\n\u201c The remaining question is as to the accountant\u2019s commissions and the costs of the audit. The auditor\u2019s disposition of this matter was of course based upon his view of the whole case, but as we have not been able to adopt his findings entirely, we have been obliged to consider the question from a different standpoint. An unfaithful trustee is not to be allowed commissions, but his unfaithfulness must first be established. In the case before us there is nothing upon which to rest such a charge except the single fact that the accountant asked for a credit in respect of the wrong mortgage. Of course, if this credit had been taken fraudulently, with intent to cheat the estate out of more than a thousand dollars, no further proof of unfaithfulness would be required ; but a consideration of the whole case satisfies us that there was nothing more serious than carelessness and a consequent confusion of two mortgages which in many respects were similar. An examination of the record would have shown the accountant that the mortgage for $7,000 had been satisfied in 1883, and therefore could not be the mortgage in question, although it must be admitted that none on either side seems to have thought of making this examination until after the auditor\u2019s first report had been presented to the court. The accountant\u2019s neglect in this matter, in connection with the two other mistakes in the account, properly subjects him to the costs of the audit so far as his carelessness has caused them to be incurred, but we see no reason why he should be deprived of commissions. So far as we can discover, his administration of the trust has been honest. All his claims against the estate have been established except one, and nothing exists upon which a charge of fraud or dishonest}' can be successfully based: Price\u2019s Est., 81 Pa. 263; Merkel\u2019s Est., 131 Pa. 613. The commissions are too large, however, having been calculated in part upon the accountant\u2019s own debt to the estate, which cannot be allowed (Landis v. Scott, 32 Pa. 504; Bedell\u2019s Ap., 85 Pa. 398; Muth\u2019s Est., 6 Pa. C. C. R. 597), and must be reduced to $400.\n\u201cWe direct that the accountant pay two thirds of the costs of both audits, as reported by the auditor, and the other one third be deducted from the fund.\u201d\nErrors assigned were in allowing (1, 2)'credits on the notes; (3) on the bonds ; (4) commissions ; (5) costs.\nJohn E.
