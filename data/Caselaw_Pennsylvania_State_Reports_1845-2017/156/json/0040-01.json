    "head_matter": "Cremer\u2019s Estate. Smeltzer\u2019s Appeal.\nIntestate laws \u2014 Distribution\u2014First cousins \u2014 Act of June 3, 1885.\nUnder the act of June 30, 1885, P. L. 251, if the only persons entitled to take the estate of an intestate are first cousins, children of deceased uncles and aunts, distribution must be made per capita and not per stirpes.\nArgued May 18, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 29, July T., 1893, by Blanche Smeltzer et ah, heirs, from decree of O. C. York Co., dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report in estate of Henry W. Cremer, deceased.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nExceptions to report of auditor distributing decedent\u2019s estate.\nThe auditor, Edward Chapin, Esq., reported as follows :\n\u201c Prom the evidence it appears that Henry W. Cremer died unmarried and without issue, intestate, leaving neither father, mother, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew nor niece living, but the following heirs, being children of deceased uncles and aunts both on the maternal and on the paternal side, viz.: [naming them.]\n\u201cNo evidence was produced before your auditor of any second cousins or cousins once removed living. And therefore there is no question as to whom the estate descends and among whom it is to be distributed. But there is a question raised as to the method of distribution, whether it is per stirpes or per capita ? The legal question was fully and ably argued by counsel representing the parties interested.\n\u201c Under the intestate laws of the commonwealth as enacted in 1883 and approved April 8, 1833, P. L. 318, first cousins inherited as next of kin and not as a class of collateral heirs, and they took per capita: \u00a7 7, act of 1833 ; \u00a7 14, act of 1833 ; Hayes\u2019s Appeal, 89 Pa. 256.\n\u201c The act of April 27, 1855, constituted them an additional class of collateral heirs, as contradistinguished from next of kin, and directed in explicit terms that they should inherit and take by representation, taking among them such share as their parents would have taken had they been living : Hayes\u2019s Appeal, supra; JBrenneman\u2019s Appeal, 40 Pa. 115.\n\u201c After the passage of this act of 1855, grandnephews and grandnieces, and first cousins, alone of all relatives of an intestate, where all stood in the same degree of consanguinity to intestate, took and distributed such intestate\u2019s estate per stirpes; it was the one exception to the law as laid down and enacted in the 14th section of the act of 1833. It was enacted after the act of 1833, and therefore changed the rule there provided.\n\u201c Brenneman\u2019s Appeal and Hayes\u2019s Appeal and the act of 1855 would govern this distribution and make it a per stirpes distribution, were it not that the legislature enacted in 1885 an act which was approved the 30th day of June, 1885, P. L. 251, which provided as follows: \u2018 Section 1. Be it enacted, etc., That whenever, by the intestate laws of this commonwealth, it is directed that the real and personal estate shall descend to, or be distributed among, several persons, whether lineal or collateral heirs or kindred standing in the same degree of consanguinity to the intestate, if there shall be only one of such degree he shall take the whole of such estate, and if there be more than one they shall take in equal shares, and if real estate, shall hold the same as tenants in common.\n\u201c \u2018 Section 2. All acts or parts of acts inconsistent herewith be and the same are hereby repealed.\u2019\n\u201c This is but the re-enactment of the 14th section of the act of 1833, in lisec verba, and operates on the act of 1855 as an express repeal of the provision of the act of 1855, in so far as it prescribes the method of distribution. And further the act of 1885 has the same effect on distributions made under acts passed since 1833 as the 14th section of the act of 1833 had on distributions under the law as it stood prior to its passage, and under it.\n\u201c The act of 1885 thus harmonizes the entire intestate system in so far that it again places all heirs, whether lineal or collateral, when in the same degree of consanguinity to the intestate, on the same and equal footing, and provides in all such cases, be they all children, all grandchildren, all great-grandchildren, etc., all brothers and sisters, all nephews and nieces, all uncles and aunts, or all first cousins, that they shall take per capita.\n\u201c Your auditor therefore distributes the balance, after deducting the claims allowed, the credits granted the administrator and the expenses of audit, to and among the sixteen first cousins per capita, giving and awarding to each one full equal sixteenth part of such balance.\n\u201c It had been strenuously argued that the case reported as Estate of Mary Rogers deceased, 131 Pa. 382, governs this distribution, and that under it the distribution should be per stirpes. True it is that this case has been decided since the approval of the act of 1885. But the only question raised before the court below or the Supreme Court was whether second cousins, or cousins once removed, were entitled to participate where there were first cousins living. And that question was decided; although the opinion does say \u2018 that the rule of distribution is per stirpes and not per capita: \u2019 but it will be noticed that the attention of the court was not directed nor called to the act of 1885 by counsel for either of the litigants; nor is any mention made of the act of 1885 in the per curiam opinion filed in the case. The above case does not in the least change our opinion as to the proper and legal distribution to be made in this case.\u201d\nExceptions to auditor\u2019s report by appellants, whose shares were reduced by the per capita distribution, were dismissed b}' the court, Latimer, P. J.\nErrors assigned were dismissal of exceptions, quoting them.\nN. M. Wanner, George S. Schmidt and Charles E. Ehrehart with him, for appellants,\ncited : Acts of April 8,1833, \u00a7 7, P.
