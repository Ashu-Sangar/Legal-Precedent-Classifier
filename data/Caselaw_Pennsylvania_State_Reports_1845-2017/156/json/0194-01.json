        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mitchell,\nIt is conceded that the share of the residuary bequest left to testator\u2019s sister Ellen having lapsed by her death during his lifetime, he died intestate as to that, and it goes to his next of kin and not to the other residuary legatees. The only question therefore is whether the share of Edward follows the same course. Is there any substantial difference in regard to its effect, between a lapsed or a void residuary bequest, and one expressly revoked?\nThe English cases apply the same rule to both. Thus in Cresswell v. Cheslyn, 2 Eden, 123, the testator appointed his daughter Mary one of the residuary legatees, but afterwards by a codicil revoked that appointment. The other residuary legatees claimed that their shares were thereby increased, and the argument was expressly made that a codicil is a republication of the will, which should be construed as if then rewritten with the revoked legacy omitted. Logically it is difficult to escape this conclusion, but Lord Chancellor Northing-ton held that it could not prevail, saying, \u201cthe testator has made no new devise, by the codicil, of the share which he has revoked from his daughter Mary, and therefore the sons can have no greater interest than they had by the original will.\u201d This decision met with criticism, but does not seem ever to have been modified. On the contrary in Skrymsher v. Northcote, 1 Swanst. 566, where there was also an express revocation by codicil of part of the residuary bequest, Sir Thomas Plumer, M. R., held that the revoked share went to the next of kin, and in his opinion, after stating the rule, using the general word \u201c fails \u201d in connection with the disposition, he gives an illustration of a lapse, without taking any notice of a distinction between a lapse and an express revocation, which was the ease before him. The rule, as he expresses it, is that \u201c part of the residue of which the disposition fails -will not accrue in augmentation of the remaining parts, as a residue of a residue, but instead of resuming the nature of residue, devolves as undisposed of.\u201d And this whether the failure arises because the gift is void, or lapsed, or revoked.\nThe English rule, as we said in Gray\u2019s Estate, 147 Pa. 67, does-not commend itself to sound reasoning, or to the preservation of the testator\u2019s actual intent, but we found it recognized and accepted in our own cases before these particulars in its application arose, and we felt ourselves bound by it. The distinction between lapse and revocation, though logically clear, is thin, and especially so in the present case where the lapse is expressly assigned by the testator as the reason for the revocation. It has little practical bearing on what should be the only object of testamentary construction, the actual intent of the testator. As we said in Gray\u2019s Estate, supra, we think it better not to draw subtle distinctions but to let the rule stand entire, as it was left by our predecessors.\nDecree affirmed.",

Vaux\u2019s Appeal.\nWill \u2014 Revocation of legacy \u2014 Distribution\u2014-Intestacy.\nWhere part of a residuary legacy is revoked without a substitutionary gift, the amount passes to the next of kin, and not to the other residuary legatees.\nTestator in his will left the residue to his sisters and his brother Edward. By a codicil he directed: \u201cI revoke my bequest to my brother Edward as he is not living.\u201d Held, that the amount of the legacy revoked should be distributed to testator\u2019s next of kin and not to the other residuary legatees.\nArgued March 28,1898.\nAppeal, No. 282, Jan. T., 1898, by Mary W. Vaux, late Wain, et al., from decree of O. C. Phila. Co., April T., 1892, No. 379, distributing estate of Henry Lisle Wain, deceased.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAdjudication of executor\u2019s account.\nFrom the adjudication of Hanna, P. J., it appeared that Henry Lisle Wain died April 8, 1891, having made his will dated April 7, 1882, which, after certain legacies, provided: \u201c The rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real and personal, I devise and bequeath to my sisters Mary, Sallie, Ellen and Annie, and my brother Edward, in equal shares.\u201d He had then no other brothers or sisters living. Ellen died May 26, 1887, unmarried and without issue. Edward died in October, 1887, leaving several children surviving him. Testator on January, 1890, made a codicil as follows: \u201c I revoke my bequest to my brother Edward, as he is not living.\u201d The fund in question is that part of testator\u2019s residuary estate which would have passed under the residuary clause to Edward had lie lived. The auditing judge awarded it to his surviving sisters. Edward\u2019s children claimed that one fourth of it should have been awarded to them. The3r oxceptod to the adjudication, and thereupon the orphans\u2019 court sustained their exceptions and decreed one fourth to them, in an opinion by Hanna, P. J., 2 Dist. R. 102.\nEdward\u2019s surviving sisters thereupon took this appeal.\nErrors assigned were (1-6) in sustaining exception to adjudication, quoting them.\nCreo. L. Orawford, Henry O. Eoughlin with him, for appellants.\nA codicil express^ revoking a gift of a share of the residue, for the expressed reason of the death of the object of it, does so amend the residuary clause as of the date of the codicil, as if the lapsed gift had never been written in the residuary clause: Williams v. Neff, 52 Pa. 326 ; Gray\u2019s Est., 29 W. N. 219; Cresswell v. Cheslyn, 2 Eden, 123 : Skrymsher v. Northcote, 1 Swauston, 565 ; Harris v. Davis, 1 Coll. Ch. 416 ; Jarman on Wills, *171.\nRichard O. Dale, Roland Evans with him, for appellees.\nBjt tiie codicil there is shown merely an intention to revoke the gift. Being thus left undisposed of, and the gift a specific share of the residue, testator died intestate as to this share, and the next of kin are entitled to take: Gray\u2019s Est., 147 Pa. 67 : Act of May, 1844, \u00a7 2, Purd. 1711, P.
