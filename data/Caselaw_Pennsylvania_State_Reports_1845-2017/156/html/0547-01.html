When the owner’s agent entered into the agreement as to the price, he lsnew that the land was to be used as an approach for and overhead bridge across the street. The owner also owned the land on the opposite side of the street, by a different title to the land on the south side. The street was a dividing line between two wards. <em>Held, </em>by a divided court, that the agreement as to price, between the landowner .and the city, as to the land actually appropriated did not estop or prevent fhe owner from recovering consequential damages for the injury done to his land on the north side of the street by the construction of the bridge.</p>

As suggested by counsel on the argument, even if the matters here claimed might have been included in the agreement and former action, if the parties had so desired, they were not so included in fact; and the claim was made by the action of both parties, severed and made a separate claim. The report of the city solicitor, which is made part of the case stated, shows that the agreement upon which the former action was brought was definitely concerned with the purchase and sale of a piece of ground forty feet in width and five hundred and eighty feet in length, contiguous to the southern line of Mulberry street, and nothing whatever is said therein as to the damages to the remaining property of the plaintiff, even on the south side of Mulberry street, resulting from the erection of the bridge; and while the agreement would probably preclude any claim for damages on the tract on the south side of the bridge, from which the strip in question was sold, we are unable to see how it could be construed to affect the right to claim damages for such erection to the land on the north side of the bridge and of Mulberry street, as originally laid out. Therefore without further elaboration, as we are, in the language of the case stated, ‘ of the opinion that the plaintiff is not by reason of the agreement and the settlement made on January 26th, 1891, as set forth in the case stated, estopped and precluded from recovering in this case,’ judgment is directed to be entered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of one thousand dollars.”</p>
