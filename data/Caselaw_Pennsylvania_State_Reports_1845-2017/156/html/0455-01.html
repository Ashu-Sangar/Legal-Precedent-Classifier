Phoenix Iron Co., 1 Pears. 383 : ‘ In order to properly understand and construe our tax laws, we are obliged to look into their origin and history.’ If, acting on this suggestion, we look into the history of the tax on capital stock to be found in the several taxing acts, and the decisions of the courts, we shall find that its construction has been settled for nearly or altogether half a century. The act of June 11,1840, P. L. 612, provided that the capital stock paid in of all corporations ‘ on which a dividend or profit of one per cent per annum is made or declared shall .... pay for the use of the ■commonwealth a tax of one half mill on every dollar of the value thereof, and an additional half mill on every dollar of the value thereof for every additional one per cent per annum of dividend or profit, made or declared on said capital stock.’ This act imposed no tax where no dividend was made, and, therefore, of course, made no provision, nor was there any necessity for an appraisement or assessment of the tax in any other manner than according to the rate per cent of the dividend. It was superseded by the act of April 29,1844, § 83 of which provided ‘ that the amount of tax chargeable on the capital stock of all banks, institutions and companies .... on which a dividend or profit of six per cent per annum or more shall be made and declared, shall be at the rate of one half mill on each one per cent of such dividend or profit, and the same shall be assessed as provided in the act oí June 11,1840 ; ’ and, as the mode of assessment provided by the latter act was an assessment according to the rate per cent of dividend, this was, in effect, enacting that this mode must be adopted, where the dividend equaled or exceeded six per cent. Then the act of 1844 further provided for an appraisement, where less than six per cent or no dividend was made or declared, thus determining clearly when the rate was to be one half mill for each one per cent of dividend, and when it was to be three mills on the appraised value, but leaving no case in which the question whether it should be one or the other was to be determined by any other fact than the rate per cent of dividend made and declared.</p>

The first section of the act of April 12, 1859, also imposed the tax on the capital stock, but changed the act of 1844 so far as, instead of a valuation of the stock when the dividend fell below six per cent, to require payment of the tax at the rate of a half mill for each one per cent of dividend made or declared, and provided for the valuation of the stock according to the act of 1844, only when the corporation failed to make or declare any dividend.’</p>

Justice Coulter said : ‘ The dividend is not the subject taxed; it is the capital stock paid in which is taxed; the dividend only furnished the rule by which the amount of the tax shall be measured and that is one half mill on the capital stock; where the profit or dividend is one per cent per annum, an additional half mill on the capital stock for every one per cent that is made by the institution from and after January 1, 1841; but it was made and declared before that period, and for profits accruing before that date. It is, therefore, not within the purview of the statute. If any part of the profits had accrued after January 1, 1841, and the directors had mingled them with profits which accrued before, and then made a dividend, the case would have been different; because, in that event, the institution would voluntarily have run its head into a noose. We think the tax did not accrue in this case, and cannot be measured by a dividend, all of which accrued, and which was made and declared previous to 1st January, 1841.’</p>

Therefore, when the same rule was prescribed in the act of April 29,1844, for cases <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>where the dividend equaled or exceeded six per cent, it was well understood. And as this act for the first time imposed the tax, where no dividend was made or declared, it also first provided for an appraisement, but this was to be made only when the dividend did not amount to six per cent, and the construction, therefore, was as stated by Judge Pearson in Commonwealth v. Phcenix Iron Co., 1 Pears. 383, that ‘ the tax was to be measured by the amount of dividends declared when they exceeded six per cent, and by an appraisement of the stock when they fell short of that sum; ’ or as stated by Agnew, C.

By whomsoever the stock is held the measure of the tax is upon the dividend declared, and no such thing as partial dividends is ever to be presumed. When a dividend is declared, that gives the measure and furnishes the rule for the tax. Dividends were declared for all the years to which the settlements apply, and the basis of the settlement in the auditor general’s office was faultless.’ And in Commonwealth v. Pittsburgh, Ft. Wayne &amp; Chicago Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/74/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="74 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1034741" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0083-01">74 Pa. 83</a>, Agnew, C.

Thus, if a profit upon the actual capital or investment be either made or passed over to the stockholders without a declaration of dividend, or if a dividend be declared to them, the sum so made or so declared becomes the measure of the tax. ... If a dividend be declared and set apart to the shareholders, the stock is taxable on the basis of this declaration, of which it makes return by <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>law to the auditor general.

The late Chief Justice said, in the last case, the only question was whether the court below erred in regarding the returns as the evidence of what dividends were declared as the basis of the auditor general’s statement. He remarked, “ She (the commonwealth) is dealing with her own corporation, and acting solely on the evidence of its doings in regard to the subject of its liability to taxes, viz.: dividends made or declared. This is shown by its proper officer, the treasurer, in his return to the auditor general; and the basis of that taxation is the dividends declared and paid.” ’ And in Commonwealth v. Reno Real Estate Co., 2 W. N. 181, the court say: ‘ This is not a case where no dividends were declared, the consequence of which is a valuation of the stock as the means of measuring the tax. Where a dividend is declared, that becomes the measure of the tax. The fact that the dividend is appropriated to the shareholders of that part of the capital which is called preferred stock, does not change the criterion of taxation, which the commonwealth herself established, to wit, the dividend declared.’ Columbia Conduit Co. v. Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=90%20Pa.%20807" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="90 Pa. 807">90 Pa. 807</a>, is an instructive case on this subject. Judge Pearson found as a fact that although dividends amounting to two hundred thousand dollars had been made and declared during the year the earnings were only 1110,570.42, the differences having been occasioned by losses by fire, and the question was as stated by him : ‘ Can the court allow a credit for that loss, or, under the words of the statute, must we tax the capital stock according to the “ dividends made or declared by the company ? ” ’ And in answering this question he said: ‘ If the tax were imposed on the net profits there would be no difficulty. The sum which the stockholders were obliged to pay would be deducted. The profit to them is lessened by that much. Such is not the form of the assessment or the words of the statute. It is not even a tax on dividend, but on the capital stock, measured by the amount of dividend made or declared. . . . The dividends in the case under consideration were actually made and declared and this fixes the tax on the capital stock.’ This case was affirmed by the Supreme Court on Judge Peabson’s opinion. <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>And in Matson’s Ford Bridge Co. v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/117/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="117 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="555837" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0265-01">117 Pa. 265</a>, Mr. Justice Clark says, on page 276 : ‘ The value for taxation is to be fixed by the aggregate of the dividends of profits made or declared during the fiscal year. ... A profit made or passed to the stockholders becomes the measure of the state tax. The formal declaration of a dividend is conclusive; the company is estopped by it whether the dividend be earned or not.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b486-4" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[276,795,1169,1258]]]'>“ The cases above referred to and many others which might be cited show that it is not the theory of the tax on capital stock measured by the dividends, that all the money divided was earned during the year in which the dividend is declared. On the contrary, the theory, as is distinctly shown by the Bridge Company case, is that it was not all earned during such year, and proof of that fact is not needed, or, if made, does not alter the rate or change the valuation. When an unusually large dividend is made either in cash or stock, it is assumed to be, and, in fact, always is, a distribution among the shareholders of earnings or profits, which have been accumulating for years, in respect to which no adequate tax has heretofore been assessed, and, therefore, it is proper it should furnish the measure of the tax when divided. True, the possession of the fund thus divided may to some extent have influenced the valuation of the capital stock in previous years, when no dividend, or less than six per cent was divided, and the capital stock was taxed at the rate of three mills upon its appraised value; but experience has shown that a comparatively low valuation is put upon capital stock which pays none or very small dividends, and a comparison of the appraised value upon the stock of this defendant during the years in which it made no dividends, with the value which would be indicated by the amount of profits claimed to have been made during those years, will show such to have been the case in this instance.</p>

He found, among other things, that defendant company was incorporated in October, 1887, for the purpose of purchasing, holding, leasing, improving, selling and otherwise dealing in real estate, with a capital of $100,000, divided into shares of $50.00 each.</p>
    <p id="b492-17" data-blocks='[["BL_492.25",492,[266,2116,1174,298]],["BL_493.1",493,[221,372,1172,858]]]'>Prior to the tax year, ending first Monday of November, 1891, the company was actively engaged in several branches of said business, but having reinvested the proceeds thereof in street improvements, buildings, etc., no dividends were declared in 1889 and 1890. During those years its capital stock was appraised at $150 per share and taxed three mills on that valu<a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>ation. During the tax year of 1891, it received from rents and sale of real estate $85,000, being 85 per cent of the par value of its paid up stock, which it distributed among its stockholders in proportion to their respective holdings. This distribution was reported to the auditor general by the company’s treasurer, as required by law. He also reported that the average market value of the stock during that year was $95.00 per share; but, in same report, he averred that owing to the nature of the business the gross earnings and net earnings “ cannot be estimated.” Shortly afterwards he made affidavit which was treated as testimony, in which he undertook to furnish an estimate of said earnings. Passing upon that conflicting testimony the learned judge found as a fact, that the nature of the business in which defendant company was engaged precluded the possibility of estimating either gross or net earnings with any reasonable degree of accuracy, and hence the treasurer’s averment in his report to the auditor general was correct.</p>
    <p id="b493-3" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[227,1239,1164,451]]]'>On the basis of that report, the settlement, for state tax on capital stock under the acts of June 7, 1879, and June 1, 1889, was made against defendant, charging it with 42|- mills, or, in the language of the act of 1889, “ at the rate of one half mill upon the capital stock for each one per centum of dividend so made or declared.” From that settlement it appealed to the common pleas and specified only three objections thereto. Two of these, relating to matters of fact, are fully disposed of by the learned judge’s findings of fact.</p>
    <p id="b493-4" data-blocks='[["BL_493.5",493,[228,1698,1165,346]]]'>The remaining objection to the settlement involves the questions, whether the sums divided among the shareholders are to be regarded as dividends within the meaning of the act of 1889, and, if so, whether, for the year in which they were declared and paid, the defendant is taxable at the rate of one half mill for each one per cent of dividend, or at the rate of three mills on the appraised value of its-mapital stock.</p>
    <p id="b493-5" data-blocks='[["BL_493.6",493,[228,2053,1166,340]],["BL_494.1",494,[253,377,1169,145]]]'>The court was clearly right in holding that the sums distributed, during the tax year in question, were dividends. It cannot be pretended that they were part of the company’s $100,000 capital. That remained intact, as is conclusively shown by the undisputed fact that the market value of the stock was $95.00 per share, nearly double its par value. The only rational conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the sums <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>distributed were earnings of the company divided among its shareholders in proportion to their respective holdings, and therefore dividends within the meaning of the law.</p>
    <p id="b494-4" data-blocks='[["BL_494.5",494,[254,530,1172,1008]]]'>The learned judge was also right in disposing of the next question as he did. He could not have ruled otherwise without ignoring the plain and explicit language of the act of June 1, 1889, P. L. 428. The 20th section requires the secretary or treasurer of every corporation, taxable under the provisions of the act, to report in writing to the auditor general annually the amount of its capital stock, and the amount, date and rate per cent of all dividends made or declared during the year ; and the 21st section declares that every such corporation “ shall be subject to pay .... annually a tax to be computed as follows, namely: If the dividend or dividends made or declared by such corporation .... during any year ended with the first Monday of November, amount to six or more than six per centum upon the par value of its capital stock, then the tax to be at the rate of one half mill upon the capital stock for each one per centum of dividends so made or declared.” It further provides, that if no dividend or one of less than six per centum be made or declared, the capital stock is to be appraised and “ then the tax to be at the rate of three mills upon each dollar of a valuation of the said capital stock.”</p>
    <p id="b494-5" data-blocks='[["BL_494.6",494,[253,1547,1177,500]]]'>It will be observed that when the dividend made or declared equals or exceeds six per centum of the par value of the stock, the act in unequivocal terms fixes the rate as well as the mode of assessing the tax. In such cases, there is no provision for an appraisement of the capital stock or for assessing the tax at any other rate. It is only when no dividend is made or declared, or when that made or declared is less than six per centum, that a valuation of the stock is resorted to as a basis for taxation. When it is six per centum or more the amount becomes1 an essential factor in determining the tax to be paid.</p>
    <p id="b494-6" data-blocks='[["BL_494.7",494,[252,2056,1173,245]]]'>An examination of the record discloses no error in the learned judge’s findings of fact, nor in the legal conclusions drawn therefrom. The subject has been so fully and ably considered by him that elaboration of the questions involved is unnecessary. Neither of the assignments of error is sustained.</p>
    <p id="b494-7" data-blocks='[["BL_494.8",494,[296,2309,355,42]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
