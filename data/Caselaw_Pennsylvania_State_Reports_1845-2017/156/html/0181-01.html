The company was to do the conveyancing. To secure possession of the Moms street house, she paid to the solicitor of the company the portion of the purchase money which she was to pay in cash. The company, in settling with the vendor, did not apply the cash thus received by the solicitor, but used the money applied for on the Thompson street application. Subsequently the solicitor notified the treasurer of the building and loan association to come for settlement, and, when he did so, gave him fifty cents and requested him to go to the recorder’s office and satisfy the mortgage of the association. When this was done, the solicitor gave the treasurer his personal check, aud requested him to hold it for three days before presenting it, which was done. When the cheek was presented, there were no funds to meet it. On a hill in equity for the cancellation of the entry of satisfaction: <em>Held, </em>(1) that a court of equity had jurisdiction, notwithstanding the additional remedy at law by assumpsit; (2) that the action of plaintiff’s treasurer in accepting the solicitor’s personal check and holding it for three days did not, under the circumstances, discharge the title company from liability; (3) that the solicitor was acting within the apparent scope of his duties in the transaction, and (f) that plaintiff was entitled to the relief sought.</p>

It need but to be stated to be conceded that the defendant company’s officers may bind it in all their acts within the scope of their authority, and if it is to be believed, as testified to by Mrs. Wilson, that she was directed by Mr. Henkles, one of the company’s officers, to pay to Mr. Thompson the $950, which I find as a fact was the case, then the defendant company from that moment was bound to see that the $950 was applied only to that purpose which it was paid for, namely, as purchase money on the Morris street property.

On this point the only direct testimony is the testimony of Mr. Gourley himself, who testifies that he went to the office of the defendant company, and was told by Mr. Thompson to go to the recorder’s office and satisfy the mortgage, and that he, Thompson, would give him the money on his return. Now, considerable stress <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>was laid on the personal pronoun ; that11 ’ meant Mr. Thompson would give him the money. The master is of the opinion that Mr. Thompson would, under all and any circumstances, as the agent of the company, use this pronoun in referring to himself as the person who would on behalf of the company pay out money. While, on the other hand, every inference is against the fact that Mr. Thompson acted in his individual capacity in giving his check to Mr. Gourley, the treasurer of the complainant, as Mr. Thompson had no interest in having the mortgage of complainant satisfied; the money he had in his possession was the money paid to him as the solicitor of the company, and should have been applied to the settlement of the Morris street property, while the money that the defendant company should have applied to the satisfaction of the complainant’s mortgage had already been appropriated by it wrongfully, and from the consequence of that act it could not escape. And as between the defendant company and the Wilsons, the defendant company was bound to see that the complainant’s mortgage was satisfied, for it had agreed to advance the money for that purpose, and took the Wilsons’ bond and mortgage and placed the same on record to secure the money so advanced ; and any act Mr. Thompson did to relieve the defendant company from the responsibility it was already under to see that the complainant’s mortgage was satisfied, he did it clearly as the agent of the defendant company, and the complainant had a right to believe he was so acting as the agent of the defendant company, as he was their solicitor and was occupying the office of the defendant company when Mr. Gourley received the check.</p>

Where any transaction is tainted with fraud, a court of equity is always open to the injured party, and has concurrent jurisdiction with the courts of law. That Mr. Thompson perpetrated a fraud on Mr. Gourley, the treasurer of the complainant, there can be no doubt, for he asked Mr. Gourley to go to the recorder’s office and return and get his money; this Mr. Gourley did, with the exception that when he returned to the defendant’s office he would receive the money, but when he got there Mr. Thompson had already committed his fraud and gotten said mortgage satisfied, and the remaining step was only to ask Mr. Gourley to hold his check till Saturday, not because he intended that it should be paid at that time, for, on the contrary, he had money in bank when he gave the check, but only to give him a chance to carry his fraud to its fullest limit, and enable him to do just precisely what he did do — flee the jurisdiction a defaulter in a very large amount.

Of this Mrs. Wilson was informed, for she not only saw him at the company’s office, but was referred to him by the application clerk. She had made two applications to the appellant for loans of money, the first to be secured by mortgage on her Thompson street property, and to be used chiefly to pay off the plaintiff’s mortgage, the second to be secured by mortgage on the Morris street house, and to be used as part of the purchase money for it. The appellant was not only to lend the money, but also to do the conveyancing of both operations, and its solicitor, Thompson, was the officer to whom Mrs. Wilson was referred for that purpose. To get possession of the Morris street house, for which she was urgent, Mrs. Wilson paid the appellant $950 which were to he used in the settlement with the vendor. This was paid by direction of the application clerk, to Thompson; who unquestionably received it as an officer and agent of the appellant. When however that transaction was closed with the vendor, the appellant did not apply the $950 to it, but settled with the money it was to loan on the other application, leaving the $950 of Mrs. Wilson’s money in Thompson’s hands. But the money to be advanced on the other application was specifically understood to be for the pay<a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>ment of plaintiff’s mortgage, which is marked in the application as to be paid off, and it must necessarily have been so to maleo appellant’s mortgage safe. Thompson who thus mixed up the two transactions was the officer of the appellant, and did it in that capacity. Further, in the same capacity he notified the plaintiff’s treasurer to come for settlement, and directed him to take the preliminary step by entering satisfaction on the plaintiff’s mortgage, whereupon he would receive the money. All this the appellant was bound to know, and whether it knew in fact or not, it was liable, because Thompson’s acts were done as its officer, and it was his position as such that gave him the opportunity. It is clear therefore that not only the Wilsons, but the plaintiff, had an equity against the appellant to make good to them any loss from Thompson’s misapplication of that fund.</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.4",214,[250,1154,1176,1256]],["BL_215.1",215,[186,377,1177,1870]]]'>This brings us to the second branch of the case, whether the act of Gourley, the plaintiff’s treasurer, in taking Thompson’s check, and by Thompson’s request holding it for three days, was an acceptance of Thompson’s individual obligation which discharged the appellant from liability. This question is not free from difficulty. In theory the payment of the money and the satisfaction of the mortgage are dependent parts of the same transaction and should be contemporaneous. But the court is entitled to take notice that in cases like the present of replacing an old mortgage by a new one to a different party, the acts in practical business seldom are contemporaneous. The plaintiff’s mortgage was the first incumbrance; until it was actually satisfied of record, the appellant could not get a clear search showing the priority of its own mortgage, to go among its title papers, and such requirement, if not the uniform custom of Philadelphia conveyancing, is at least frequent enough to relieve compliance with it from any prima facies of being out of the ordinary course of business. The act of Gourley therefore in satisfying plaintiff’s mortgage before the receipt of the money was not a substitution of Thompson’s personal liability for that of appellant. Nor was the acceptance of Thompson’s personal check. For the purposes of this transaction Thompson was the appellant, the officer who was authorized to represent it, and the only one with whom the plaintiff had anything to do. The transaction itself was a loan of fourteen hundred dollars <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>to Mrs. Wilson, but the money was not handed to her, the company itself took charge of the application of it, one thousand and odd dollars to pay off the plaintiff’s prior mortgage, the rest for the expenses of searches, conveyancing, etc., and then the balance to Mrs. Wilson. Thompson was the officer of the company who handled this sum for these purposes, and when he gave Gourley half a dollar to pay for the entry of satisfaction on the mortgage Gourley was not bound to ask him if that was his own or the company’s money, he was entitled to presume it was the company’s, and the same presumption fairly attaches to the check for the amount of the mortgage, although 'in form it was the personal check of Thompson. The same view applies to the compliance with Thompson’s request to hold the check until Saturday. This result might be reached summarily on the familiar ground that where one of two innocent parties must suffer by the fraud of another, the one who afforded the opportunity must bear the loss. This request of Thompson was clearly part of his fraudulent scheme, and it was his position as appellant’s officer that enabled him to carry it out. But beyond this we are of opinion, though we have not reached it without some hesitation, that the compliance with the request to hold the check was not so far out of the usual course of business as to amount to a discharge of appellant. Transactions of this kind usually occupy some time. There are papers to be prepared and executed, searches to be procured, interest and expenses to be calculated, and the money to be got for the balance on final settlement. This particular loan had in fact been pending since the previous December. During all that time it had been in Thompson’s hands, though it was the company’s matter, with which he had no personal concern, but was acting as the company’s officer. Gourley might fairly suppose the delay requested was on the part of the company, for reasons connected with the settlement; such belief on his part would be a natural result of the action of the company in giving Thompson entire authority, actual or apparent, over the matter, and its admitted pendency for more than six months.</p>

The bill was for the cancellation of the entry of satisfaction on complainant’s mortgage, and its reinstatement as a prior lien to <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>appellant’s mortgage, on the ground that the entry had been procured by the fraud of appellant’s agent, and although an action of assumpsit might have been brought on the agent’s promise, or for money had and received for plaintiff’s use, yet relief in a clear subject of equity jurisdiction is not barred by the existence of a remedy at law, even if, in view of the triangular nature of the contest here, between the rights of the plaintiff, the appellant and Mrs. Wilson, that remedy could be considered adequate.</p>

We have considered the case on the’ facts found by the master, because careful perusal of the evidence has failed to satisfy us that those found are not correct, or that those omitted in the findings would change the result. The case is one of hardship in anjr aspect, for it involves loss through the fraud of a person trusted by all parties, but the general conclusion is unavoidable that Thompson was the agent of appellant, with actual authority as to a large part of the transactions, and with such apparent authority throughout, as to make it answerable for his action.</p>
