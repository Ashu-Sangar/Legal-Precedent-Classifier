Upon this point no facts at all are averted ; we do not know when or with what material the street was originally paved, or by whom'the cost was borne. Nothing is stated except that ‘ the paving referred to in the claim filed, was not an original paving of Walnut street; ’ and this is merely the defendant’s opinion, the correctness of which (as he gives no facts) we are not able to review.

We are not informed by whom the misrepresentations were made or the fraud was committed, or what connection the city’s officers or agents or the contractor had therewith. The affidavit avers that when the petition was signed the defendant ‘ expected ’ that the asphalt blocks would be laid upon a foundation of sand on the pavement, but it does not give the reason for this expectation. If the reason is to be inferred from the further averment that ‘ it was represented ’ that the blocks would be thus laid, we do not find this to be of much help, for we are not advised by whom or to whom these representations were made. It is then averred that, while the pavement, if laid <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>upon sand, would have been cheaper than sheet asphalt, it was in fact laid upon an expensive base of hydraulic cement concrete, ‘ made more expensive by 30 cents per square yard than sheet asphaltum, and was made so much higher in price than that petitioned for by the defendant and the majority of the signers to said petition as to be a fraud upon the petitioners,’ etc. If the defendant had also told us who committed these alleged fraudulent acts, it would have been much to the point, but he did not see proper to do so. These are examples of the vague and general language of the affidavit, and may sufficiently show that the allegations of fraud are fatally lacking in precision.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b551-5" data-blocks='[["BL_551.4",551,[222,947,1171,813]]]'>“ The third ground of defence is a written protest, of which the following is a brief account. The petitioners asked councils to pave the street with ‘asphalt block,’ leaving details to the discretion of the municipal authorities. There seems to be several methods of laying asphalt block, and councils adopted the one which requires a base of hydraulic cement. Upon learning this fact and before councils had finally ratified the contract (although it had already been awarded by the highway commissioners), the defendant and certain other petitioners signed and presented to select council a paper in which they declared: (We) ‘ do respectfully protest against placing the blocks on a concrete base. When we signed the petition to your honorable bodies asking that the street be paved with blocks, we did not know that such a base was necessary, and do not now believe the same to be necessaiy. If the pavement is laid upon a concrete base we pledge ourselves to resist the payment thereof.’</p>

The signers still desire to have the pavement; they make no effort to withdraw their names from the original petition; they merely declare that on this question of method they do not agree with the city, and that they will resist payment if their view is not followed. This, however, laid no obligation upon the city. The petition had already given to councils jurisdiction to lay an ‘ asphalt block ’ pavement, and this necessarily included the power to choose the method of putting it down, even if the method chosen was not the usual one. This jurisdiction and power the protest does not even attempt to avoid, and it seems clear therefore that, as the good faith of the councils has not been successfully questioned, their choice of methods <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>was a lawful exercise of discretion, and binds the defendant in spite of his protest. These details must necessarily be left to the municipal authorities.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.5",552,[251,545,1182,966]]]'>“ This leaves for consideration the fourth ground of defence, namely: Defective workmanship. It is averred that the blocks were to be of the best kind in the market, made of'first-class material, in the best planner; whereas the contractor laid the pavements of blocks, ‘ such as are termed thirds, far inferior to ‘ the best of asphaltum block,’ and at a difference in price of which ‘ the affiant has not been advised, although considerable.’ If the affiant knows that the difference is considerable, one would suppose that he would state it approximately at least; but passing this point, there are two other objections to this defence: First, it does not inform us in what the inferiority of quality consists, but simply gives us the defendant’s opinion without the facts upon which it is founded. And second, it does not aver that the pavement in front of the defendant’s property, for which alone he is called upon to pay, is in any respect defective or unsatisfactory. This was held to be important at least, if not essential, in Erie City v.
