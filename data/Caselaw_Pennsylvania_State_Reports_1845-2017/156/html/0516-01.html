Mr. Cook demurred at the size of the commission, but, after being told that the business could not be had on any other terms, and that it would be taken elsewhere if the terms were not accepted, and after consultation with the advertising manager, accepted the proposition.

The duty of the commonwealth’s officers was to obtain this advertising at the lowest price, not exceeding the usual rates charged to private customers, and in no event exceeding thirty cents per line for four insertions. Instead of making an honest effort, however, or indeed, so far as appears, any effort at all to discover what was the lowest price for which the work could be done, they or some of them agreed to pay the maximum price fixed by the act, although by the very agreement itself they were informed that the work could be done for at least forty per cent less. ' This of itself was a gross violation of duty which would support an action in tort for damages j and if we add to this the fact that they, or some of them, put into their own pockets the money which they could have saved for the state and which was in their power and possession as actual cash, it is not easy to speak accurately of their conduct without calling it embezzlement; and at all events it is certain that they could not have retained this money as against the commonwealth suing in assumpsit to recover.</p>

But Mr. Cook denies that he had any knowledge of the kind just described, and we do not dispute the accuracy of the denial. We accept the view that, in haste and without sufficient reflection, he dealt with these offers as if they had been the ordinary offers of private business, and that he did not draw the inferences which lie so near the surface of these interviews that a very <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>brief consideration would surely have brought them to his conscious notice. Nevertheless we believe the defendant to be liable, and we will briefly give our reasons :</p>

The publication was manifestly official and could not possibly be mistaken for an item of private business. So much we may confidently affirm, and if Mr. Cook had gone on to think further about the proposition we have as little doubt that he would have taken the mental steps which must now appear so obvious. [Being an official publication, no private individual would have any occasion to publish the list, and no one but the proper public officer would be at all likely to have any business with the rates to be charged for such publication.] [7] Moreover, this was clearly not a simple preliminary inquiry about rates; it was a distinct offer to sell for a specified price the order to do this advertising, and presumably, therefore, must come from the person who alone was able to sell, namely, the proper public officer. If after this the character of the agent still remained doubtful, all doubt would naturally disappear when he produced the very order which he was offering to sell, or when that order came shortly afterwards to the defendant’s hand. [The inevitable conclusion from all these facts would be, that both Graffen and Bell were acting not for themselves but for some public officer in control of this matter; and the fact that Mr. Cook did not draw this conclusion is only to be explained if (as appears to be the case) he did not think about the interviews at all. Under the circumstances this was culpable neg<a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>ligence. Mr. Cook was certainly put upon inquiry by the significant facts we have detailed, and upon familiar principles must be held to have known what inquiry would have disclosed.] [8]</p>

This delivery also of the money was as secret as the nature of the case would admit, and showed a desire to leave as few traces as possible. Putting all the facts together, no other object than unlawful private gain can be conceived, and this object would certainly have been seen then if the matter had received proper attention.</p>

It would be the ordinary case of a public officer agreeing to award a contract on condition of being paid a share of the profits — or, in other words, the ordinary case of a bribe given and taken — if it were not for the fact that Mr. Cook seems to have thought so little about the transaction as not to be aware that he was actually doing what we do not doubt he has since been shocked to recognize as bribing, lacking only the intention to bribe. [But the fact of his ignorance does not relieve the defendant of liability, if under the circumstances he ought to have known. In our opinion he was put upon notice; he ought to have inquired and is therefore legally chargeable with the knowledge he would thus have gained.] [10]</p>

Whether, or not, recovery may <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>be had from the corrupt or negligent participant in the wrong does not appear to have been decided in America; but the right to recover is supported by a recent decision in England (Mayor of Salford v. Lever, 25 Q. B. Div. 363), and seems to rest safely upon considerations of sound public policy. Courts ought to amplify their remedies so as to reach every possible variety of wrongdoing, either willful or negligent, and so as to enforce every degree of legal and public duty.</p>

The summons is in assumpsit, but the statement would probably serve as well if the action had been in tort. No objection was made to the action or to the statement, and we refer to the record only because the measure of damages requires us to notice it. The case was tried upon its merits, and if it is desired that the record be amended so as to conform to this decision, the proper order will be made. In our opinion, the facts proved make trespass and not assumpsit the proper form of action. The defendant does not have in its possession any money belonging to the commonwealth; it did have such money in its hands for a moment, but only for a moment, and we think the - true cause of action is that which is stated above, namely: such negligent conduct as must be held to be the legal equivalent of guilty conduct, although as we have already found there was no guilty conduct in fact.</p>
