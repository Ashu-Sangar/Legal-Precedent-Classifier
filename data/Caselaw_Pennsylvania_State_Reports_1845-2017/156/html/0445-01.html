      <em>John </em>Eittel died July 11, 1871. At his death he was the owner of personalty to the value of about $5,000, and of a valuable farm. He left five children ; to two of these, Catharine and George, he devised the farm, subject to the payment of a legacy of $3,000 to each of his three daughters, Mary, Emma, and Loretta. R. A. McDonald, the husband of Loretta, took out-letters c. t. a. on his estate, and settled his account on July 4, 1873, which was confirmed absolutely. On October 4, 1875, all the heirs and legatees joined in a petition to the orphans’ court for an order of sale of the land for payment of the legacies, averring an inability on part of the two devisees, Catharine and George, to hold the land and make the payments charged upon it. Thereupon the court directed an order to Robert A. McDonald, administrator, to make sale as prayed for in the petition. At the same time his bond, with Daniel Logan, George I. Pittman and James Cooper as sureties, was approved and filed. McDonald sold the farm to B. M. Lodge for $11,600, and on return being made the court approved the sale. Of the purchase money, $600 remained a lien upon the land during the minority of two grandchildren, legatees under the will; the balance, $11,000, was paid to McDonald who, after deducting proper expenses, paid to all of the legatees except his wife, their respective shares, and took from them receipts and releases. The share of his wife on April 1, 1876, after he had received the whole of the purchase money payable to him from Lodge, was $2,987.78. Nothing further was done by him until December 10, 1887, when he filed his account as trustee. In this he charged himself with the net proceeds of sale, $10,656.78, with interest from April 1, 1876, and noted in the account his payments to all the other legatees, and ended with this statement :</p>

The appellant, Loretta J. McDonald, is the wife of Robert A. McDonald; by her father’s will, she, on April 1,1876, was entitled to a legacy of $2,987.78, out of a fund of $10,656.78 in the hands of an officer of the orphans’ court. She had a right to demand payment from him; the other legatees entitled to share in the fund were paid; her money was not in fact paid her then or after-wards in the sense of a handing of it over by the trustee and a receiving of it by her as legatee. From that time up to the filing of his accounts in 1887, a period of eleven years, she did not attempt to enforce payment by legal proceedings. The trustee was her husband; he was a prominent and apparently prosperous man at the time he was appointed trustee, and for some years afterwards was possessed of considerable property; then became intemperate, and bankruptcy soon followed. The payment of this money now by him individually is altogether hopeless.</p>
    <p id="b472-9" data-blocks='[["BL_472.9",472,[246,2018,1170,397]],["BL_473.1",473,[222,403,1164,297]]]'>These undisputed facts warrant no inference of any understanding or agreement between him and his wife that he owed her no duty as trustee; certainly the mere fact of the marital relation .worked no change in the legal relation. He had received her money, not as her agent, but as the court’s; so far as appears, her consent was not asked; it was his duty in the performance of the trust to pay his wife her money just the same as he paid the other legatees theirs; that he was married <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>to the legatee gave him no right to withhold it. The mistake made in the argument of the appellees and by the court below is, in not distinguishing between the husband and the trustee ; the rights of a wife where her husband has received her money, and the right of a legatee where a trustee of the orphans’ court has received and ought to pay over her legacy.</p>

There is not the semblance of reason for holding that such indulgence is any more prejudicial to the claim of a wife who happens to be a legatee.</p>
    <p id="b473-5" data-blocks='[["BL_473.5",473,[216,1167,1166,553]]]'>It has never been held that mere delay in enforcing a legal demand against a negligent, unfaithful trustee, released him from his official duty or liability. The most natural explanation of delay here is afforded by the fact of the domestic relation between the trustee and legatee. A husband inclined to wrong his wife, and who at the same time as trustee owes her money, is in a most favorable situation for indulging his inclinations ; as trustee he can hold hack his legatee’s money; as husband he can mar domestic peace if the wife objects; such a legatee is not likely to go to law with the trustee, or even to make threatening demands to enforce her rights.</p>

This was convoyed to the husband April 14, 1878, at the price of $8,500, and the purchase money was all paid in less than a year thereafter, two years before McDonald received any of the money now in dispute. He had received, before this, her share of the personal estate, amounting to $859, and may have appro' <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>priated this in part payment; but whatever bearing that might have in explanation of her declarations, it is irrelevant for any other purpose, as the sole contention here is the legacy charged upon the land. On the undisputed facts, the auditor was bound to find as he did, that no matter what declarations the wife may have made as to her money being in the property, no part of this legacy was paid by her husband for the purchase of it.</p>

      <em>We </em>have no doubt, from a careful scrutiny of the evidence and the conduct of the parties, he repeatedly promised to convey her this property in satisfaction of her legacy; and we have just as little doubt that she expected him to do so. All the evidence is clearly reconcilable on this theoiy, and some of it is inconsistent with any other. But what significance is this fact entitled to ? It was no more than a promise to pay the legatee with a house and lot instead of money. The promise was not kept; it was broken. Violated promises cannot discharge a trustee from an official obligation. If he had repeatedly promised to pay her in money, and had repeatedly broken his promise, it would scarcely be argued that her forbearance during the time he was placating her with promises, was such an agreement on her part as turned the trustee into a common debtor, whom she must now sue in another court. The promise to pay in land which he never conveyed, even though she were willing to accept it, did not discharge him from his official accountability. Nor did she do anj^thing of which the sureties have any right to complain. She did not bring suit against her husband, yet the testimony of exceptants shows that otherwise she did about all a wife could do to get her legacy. She importuned him; this not seldom resulted in quarrels, with bitter reproaches on her part and such unmanly retorts on his, as, if made to other than his wife, would have immediately resulted in a prompt legal accounting.</p>

It was their duty, as well as interest, to see that he faithfully executed the trust. There is no evidence they gave the matter any attention until the husband’s ability to pay became doubtful, then one of them, Mr. Pittman, testifies he several times urged the husband, it will be noted, not to pay his wife, but to get a formal release from her. He says the husband made light of it, and said, “ That will be all right.” If the party wronged had so acted and spoken, instead of the wrongdoer, the surety might with some show of reason urge that he had been lured into inaction ; as it stands, his own testimony shows, that, as early as 1883, four years before the final accounting, he was conscious of his peril, and urged the defaulting principal to obtain a legal acquittance from the wife, not because she had been paid, but to save the surety from being called on for payment.</p>

These bondsmen were not in any true sense of the words, “innocent and confiding strangers,” as termed by the learned judge of the court below. They are men who nominally appeared in the orphans’ court with McDonald, and in substance said, “We know this man, trust him ; he is honest, capable, and faithful; will pay over to those entitled to it the money that comes into his hands; if he do not do so, we will.” The court took them at their word, and put into his custody a dead man’s estate to be paid over to his legatees. This wife did not undertake to make good his default; these sureties did, and it is but simple justice to hold them to their bargain.</p>

The reason for the rule, is <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>to relieve from the necessity for accounts, which in the ordinary conduct of domestic affairs would be so difficult of determination. Hence, in settlements between husband and wife, in the absence of proof to the contrary, equitjr presumes that interest money on the wife’s separate estate, which has been received by the husband, has been expended by him with her consent, for the support of herself and family. The rule is directly the reverse of this as to the principal. Neither the statute of 1848 nor that of 1887 has worked any change in this particular. As the reason grows out of the duties incident to the domestic relation, so long as these remain unchanged, unless there be express statutory enactment, the presumption will continue: Mellinger v.

The evidence shows he received it from the devisees of the land, without objection by her, before he was appointed trustee; the presumption is, he continued to receive it from himself as trustee, afterwards. He expended it, for the evidence shows he provided a liberal support for his wife and family. She, in all her complaints and indignant statements of her wrongs, never claimed any interest. She expected, and he doubtless promised her, the house, but she expected no more, as her due. At most, the value of this was but little more than the legacy, and did not equal the share of personalty and the legacy together. The whole evidence shows that the interest was consumed in the support of herself and the family, with no intention on her part to make her husband a debtor for the amount of it.</p>
