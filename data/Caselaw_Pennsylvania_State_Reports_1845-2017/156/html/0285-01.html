The limitation to the heirs general of the issue, with the superadded words of distributive modification, clearly shows that by ‘issue’ the testator meant children, and intended that they should take the remainder as purchasers and not as heirs by descent.”</p>

That such is the general rule is beyond doubt, and it is not denied by the complainants.”</p>

Milligan, <a href="/citations/?q=45%20Pa.%20180" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="45 Pa. 180">45 Pa. 180</a>, it is said: “The devise of the remainder was to his lawful issue, child or children then living, or to the lawful issue of such child or children, as may be then (at the first taker’s decease) dead, share and share alike. The gift was with words of distributive modification, and it was not to all the issue of the devisee for life. The language is descriptive of persons rather than of the character in which the remaindermen are to take ; and the testatrix defined what she meant by the equivocal term ‘ lawful issue ’ by using as synonymous with it the words ‘ child or children.’ By pointing to those who might be living at the decease of the first taker, and by directing distribution, she manifested an intent to use the word issue as meaning child or children, rather than to use the latter words as words of limitation.”</p>

He described them by an apt word of purchase, i. e. children, and therefore the first taker had only an estate for life.”</p>

      <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>As the word “ issue ” was clearly intended by the testator in his will to mean children, they take as purchasers, and the daughter and sons as a consequence took only a life estate in the farm: Bool v. Mix, 17 Wendell, 119.</p>
    <p id="b315-5" data-blocks='[["BL_315.6",315,[253,587,1161,1207]]]'>While they thus took a life estate there was given them the power, in case they should desire to do so, to sell the farm. It is alleged in the affidavit that in the exercise of this power of sale conveyances were made with the assent of the sister and of the two brothers, and that subsequently, by the wills of the sister and that of the brother, the title thus passed to the appellee. The conveyances thus admitted by the appellant to have been made under the power, it is contended, were sufficient to pass the title to the appellee. It may be that such is the case, because the will contemplates the execution of the power of sale, and these transfers seem to meet its requisition : Leightner v. Leightuer, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20Pa.%20148" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="87 Pa. 148">87 Pa, 148</a>. Whether this be so or not it is unnecessary to determine in the view taken of this case. In this will it is provided that in case the daughter and sons desire to sell and convey they are authorized to do so. As this power was given to them and as they were made executors, thus combining the authority and the power together, it was intended that the children should possess it, and in the event of the death of any of them, it passed to the survivor or survivors. As they were the executors it is clear that the power was to be executed by them as sucli. It would therefore follow that as John alone survives, he has, as such survivor, the power under the will to make sale of the farm and to make a good title to the same.</p>
