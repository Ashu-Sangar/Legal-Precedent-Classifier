    <p class="summary" id="b533-6" data-blocks='[["BL_533.6",533,[221,534,1171,963]]]'>“ The defendant’s charter contains two distinct powers, namely : to manufacture, and also to buy, sell and deal as a merchant. These are not incident to each other, or so necessarily connected, that the grant of one carries with.it a grant of the other. The power to manufacture, of course, implies a power to sell the article thus produced ; but the power, both to buy and to sell, to buy goods in order to sell them afterwards, and to do this habitually and as a business, thus becoming a merchant or dealer, is not a necessary incident to the business of manufacturing. Manufacturers constitute a separate class from merchants or dealers (Com. v. Campbell, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20Pa.%20385" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="88 Pa. 385">88 Pa. 385</a>; Com. v. Natural Gas Co., 2 Lane. L. Eev. 41), and although the two characters may be united in one person they do not merge. If the defendant, therefore, is legally authorized by its charter to be both a manufacturer and a merchant, it cannot be said to be ‘ organized exclusively for manufacturing purposes ’ (Com v. Mann Co., <a href="/pa/150/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="150 Pa. 64" data-case-ids="834390" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0064-01">150 Pa. 64</a>; Com. v. Westinghouse Electric Co., <a href="/pa/151/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="151 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="836690" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0265-01">151 Pa. 265</a>), and must be held to be taxable on the basis adopted by the accounting officers.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b533-7" data-blocks='[["BL_533.7",533,[216,1506,1172,746]]]'>“Fortunately for the defendant, however, the mercantile clause in its charter gives it no lawful authority, and being simply void must be treated as if it did not exist. No act of assembly authorizes the incorporation of merchants or dealers, and, therefore, the apparent grant of power to carry on the business of dealing or of buying and selling is apparent only, and not real. It needs no argument or citation of authority to support the proposition, that a valid corporate power thus to carry on the business can only be given by virtue of a statute. It follows of necessity that the mercantile words drop out of the charter, and the defendant is left with the single power to manufacture. The case is thus on all fours with Commonwealth v. Mann Co., and, as in that instance, so here, the defendant is taxable only on such of its capital stock as was invested in its mercantile business.</p>
