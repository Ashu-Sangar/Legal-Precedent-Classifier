The sale was regular and fairly conducted, and the property struck down to the highest bidder.] [1] [There was no impropriety in giving notice of the existence of the mortgage on the property, as it was nothing more than what the record showed. The allegation of the inadequacy of the price, in itself, is insufficient to set aside the sale, as long as the sale is in all respects regular and no fraud is shown to have been practiced.] [2] For these reasons the rule to set aside the sheriff’s sale is discharged at the costs of petitioner.”</p>
