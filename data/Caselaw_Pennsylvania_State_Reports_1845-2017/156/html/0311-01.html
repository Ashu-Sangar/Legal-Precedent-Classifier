L. 509, “ relating to county rates and levies and township rates and levies,” it was the right and duty of the supervisors and overseers of the poor of every township to appoint, at an annual meeting called for the purpose, some suitable inhabitant of the township to be collector of the township rates and levies.</p>

    <p id="b335-5" data-blocks='[["BL_335.4",335,[228,546,1164,807]]]'>When the special law for the counties of Warren, McKean and Venango, was passed, on April 8, 1844, P. L. 230, creating-the office of commissioners of roads, and directing them to take charge of all roads and bridges in those counties, those officers became clothed with the functions of the supervisors and overseers in all matters relating to the levying and collecting of all taxes for road and bridge purposes. By the 7th section of this act the road commissioners were required to issue their warrant to the constable of the township, for the collection of the money due from the taxables, and the constables were required to execute such warrant by collecting the taxes, for which service compensation was provided. There was no necessity for requiring that the constables should give bonds for the collection of these taxes, as their official bonds would be security for the performance of this as of all their other duties, and no new bond was provided for by the act.</p>

No provision was made for any bond to be given by the road masters.</p>

    <p id="b335-9" data-blocks='[["BL_335.8",335,[224,2330,1160,82]]]'>The road masters of the township thus became the tax collectors.</p>

Now, the 32d section of the act of 1834 required that “ every person appointed collector of township rates and levies shall give a bond with surety, or a bond with mortgage of real estate to the satisfaction of the supervisors and overseers of the poor of the respective townships.” When road masters were directed by the acts of 1848 and 1869 to collect the roád taxes, they became collectors of township rates and levies, and when road masters were appointed by the road commissioners of the townships of these counties, under the 5th section of the act of 1844, they filled the description of the 32d section of the act of 1834, as being persons appointed collectors of township rates and levies. The office was general, and to it was attached the duty of giving bond. The acts of 1844,1848 and 1869 simply changed the appointing power from supervisors and overseers to road commissioners, but the appointees necessarily fulfilled the functions of collectors of township rates and levies. As such they should give bonds precisely as the same functionaries under the act of 1834 were obliged to do. All of this is substantially decided in the case of Township of Ridgway v. Wheeler, <a href="/pa/90/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="90 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="1065588" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0450-01">90 Pa. 450</a>, in which a constable having refused to collect certain road and sidewalk taxes, the supervisors appointed one of their own number to be collector, who gave a bond with surety upon which the action was brought. Defence was made on the ground that the bond was void because there was no authority to make the appointment. But we held that the collector was <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>de facto collector and lie could not be heard to deny the validity of his appointment, and also that the appointment was good ex necessitate. And we further held that the 31st section of the act of 1834, authorizing appointments of collectors, was a general law which was applicable unless it was displaced by the special laws relating to the townships, which it was not, and that it was sufficient to supply a easus omissus in the special laws. Under any of these points the bond given in tbe present case can be sustained, but we think it was a valid bond for tbe reasons hereinbefore stated. We therefore sustain the assignments of error.</p>
    <p id="b337-3" data-blocks='[["BL_337.4",337,[242,969,1165,196]]]'>The judgment of the court below is reversed, and judgment is now entered here in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants for one hundred and ninety-one <em>-fia </em>dollars, with interest from April 1, 1892, and with costs of suit.</p>
