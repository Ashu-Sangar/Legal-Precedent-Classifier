The sheriff levied on personal property found in possession of Nelson Vanderpool on both writs at the same time. Warren Hall, Eunice Hall, his wife, and John Holmes claimed all the property. The sheriff sold the property on the Orimmins writ as the property of Warren Hall, defendant and claimant, to John Crimmins for $274.48, and delivered the same to the purchase]1. He adjourned the sale as to Nelson Vanderpool. The court ordered a feigned issue; that Warren and Eunice Hall be plaintiffs and Martin Vanderpool defendant; that plaintiffs file a bond in the sum of $1,000 and a declaration ; and that defendant plead, etc. Plaintiffs filed no bond. The court then ordered the sheriff to proceed and sell the property and bring the money into court, and that plaintiffs be barred from any action against him. On tlie same day plaintiffs filed a declaration. Tlie sheriff sold Nelson Vanderpool’s interest in the property to Martin Vanderpool for $2.30, and applied the money on costs. A plea was filed and tlie case put on the trial list. Plaintiffs then asked and procured a rule to show cause why they should not be allowed to discontinue the case, because (1) they claimed no interest in the fund, (2) they claimed no title to the property when tlie sheriff sold it to raise the fund. The court discharged this rule. [1]</p>

The Crimmins writ -was a fifth pluries fi. fa. (not yiits fi. fa. as the local usage seems incorrectly to call it), and it was charged that these successive executions had been issued and held open without levy for nearly two years, not in good faith but to protect the debtor’s property from other creditors. If that was established, then the defendant’s writ though later in date would have taken precedence, as the learned judge charged in his answer to plaintiff’s first point.</p>

It was thus stated by Chief Justice Thompson, in Frick v. Barbour, <a href="/pa/64/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="64 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="1021267" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0120-01">64 Pa. 120</a>: The evidence in a case “often consists in what is not proved as well as what is proved. Where withholding testimony raises a violent presumption that a fact not clearly proved or disproved exists, it is not error to allude to the fact of withholding, as a circumstance strengthening the proof.” Fully expressed, it is this: where evidence which would properly be part of a case, is within the control of the party whose interest it would naturally be to produce it, and, without satisfactory explanation, he fails to do so, the jury may draw an inference that it would be unfavorable to him. It is an inference of fact, not a presumption of law. But though the learned judge used the word presumption, we do not think it wras intended to be a binding instruction or that the jury could have so considered it. Presumption, it will be observed. <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>was the word that Chief Justice Thompson used in stating the rule, but the context shows in his opinion, as the circumstances do in the learned judge’s charge here, that it was used in the sense of' an inference which the jury were at liberty to draw. The plaintiff, Mrs. Hall, was a daughter of Nelson Vanderpool, and was claiming the property levied on as hers by transfer from her father; the defendant was a creditor of Nelson Vanderpool, who was resisting the claim on the ground that the alleged transfer was not made at the time it professed to have been, and was fraudulent in law if hot in fact. Under those circumstances Vanderpool was of course a most iinportant witness, and the judge might well feel called upon to draw the jury’s attention to the omission to call him in support of the alleged transfer. The terms in which he did so were forcible, but we do not think they could have misled the jury. The latter must have understood, as the learned judge intended, that the matter was left to them on the whole evidence, including the inference from testimony that ought naturally to have been put in the case but was not.</p>
