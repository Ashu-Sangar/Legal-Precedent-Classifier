But the only question raised before the court below or the Supreme Court was whether second cousins, or cousins once removed, were entitled to participate where there were first cousins living. And that question was decided; although the opinion does say ‘ that the rule of distribution is per stirpes and not per capita: ’ but it will be noticed that the attention of the court was not directed nor called to the act of 1885 by counsel for either of the litigants; nor is any mention made of the act of 1885 in the per curiam opinion filed in the case.
