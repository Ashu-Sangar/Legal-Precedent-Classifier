Upon the death of the last survivor, if any surplus was left it was to be divided equally among her other children. She further directed as follows : “ I also direct my executor by and with the advice, consent and approval of my said named daughters and legatees, if he shall see fit at any time after my decease, to sell, either by public or private sale, any and all the real estate I may die seized of, and to convey and make title by deed to the purchaser or purchasers of the same, and pay over the proceeds to my said daughters and legatees above named for their use.” <em>Held, </em>that a deed by the executor and the two surviving daughters named in the will would pass a good title to the real estate.</p>
