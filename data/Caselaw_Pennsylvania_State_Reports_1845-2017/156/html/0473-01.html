It is undoubtedly true that these notes, being overdue obligations of the decedent, might have been paid b}r him and been found among his papers by the executor. The executor is also the payee, and therefore as his possession might be either in his own right or merely as executor he was bound to show clearly that he held the notes by a hostile title : McCreary’s Ap., 5 Cent.

This he undertook to do by offering to prove that these notes were in the custody of his wife immediately after his father’s death, and were handed over to him by her. If true, and we find the fact to be as just stated, this explained the otherwise ambiguous character of his possession, and showed that he held them as an individual and not by virtue of his ex-ecutorship. No doubt the auditor would have reached the same conclusion if he had considered Mrs. Hoffer’s testimony, but he rejected it as incompetent, apparently overlooking the cases of R'othrock v. Gallaher, <a href="/pa/91/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="91 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="487570" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0108-01">91 Pa. 108</a>, Stephens v.

In 1887 $1,000 was paid, and the remainder was due as follows : $500 on April 1,1889; $500 on April 1,1890; $500 on April 1, 1891; $500 on April 1, 1892; $500 on April 1, 1893; $500 on April 1, 1894; $500 on April 1, 1895 ; $500 on April 1, 1896.</p>

In January, 1888, the decedent desired to buy a farm from Eshelman &amp; Ebersole, and in order to raise the necessary money proposed that if Aaron would make immediate payment of the principal he would afterwards pay the interest which Aaron would thus lose. Aaron accepted the proposition and paid the money, and the mortgage was satisfied, but the decedent never paid the interest in fulfillment of his-promise.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b497-6" data-blocks='[["BL_497.6",497,[256,1099,1174,604]]]'>“ There was another mortgage for $7,000, given in February, 1881, upon a different farm, similarly securing deferred payments (from 1889 to 1900), without interest, which was satisfied in April, 1883, five years before the transaction now in question. By a mistake, which is averred to be due to the confusion of these two similar transactions, the accountant claimed credit for interest on the deferred payments of this mortgage,, instead of claiming it, as was intended, upon the deferred payments of the mortgage on the upper farm. The credit of $2,041.48 in the account is therefore admitted to be wrong, and the claim is restated as $909.93, with interest from April 1,. 1888, to May 6, 1890, $114.50, or a total of $1,024.43.</p>

The contract is not made out merely by proof of Joseph Hoffer’s declarations. The unsatisfactory character of this form of testimony is conceded as declared in the authorities cited by the auditor, but there is much more here than admissions. John Eshelman is a witness, who was present when the contract was made; if he is believed — and there is no ground for rejecting his testimony —lie saw the parties face to face, and heard them agree on the terms. The only declaration or admission is that which Joseph Holier made afterwards, namely, that Aaron had paid the money; and this admission is about a fact which we do not understand to be denied, and which indeed is also proved by the satisfaction of the mortgage. We are of opinion therefore that <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>under the facts above stated a credit of $1,024.43 ought to be allowed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b498-4" data-blocks='[["BL_498.5",498,[231,482,1175,1770]]]'>“ The remaining question is as to the accountant’s commissions and the costs of the audit. The auditor’s disposition of this matter was of course based upon his view of the whole case, but as we have not been able to adopt his findings entirely, we have been obliged to consider the question from a different standpoint. An unfaithful trustee is not to be allowed commissions, but his unfaithfulness must first be established. In the case before us there is nothing upon which to rest such a charge except the single fact that the accountant asked for a credit in respect of the wrong mortgage. Of course, if this credit had been taken fraudulently, with intent to cheat the estate out of more than a thousand dollars, no further proof of unfaithfulness would be required ; but a consideration of the whole case satisfies us that there was nothing more serious than carelessness and a consequent confusion of two mortgages which in many respects were similar. An examination of the record would have shown the accountant that the mortgage for $7,000 had been satisfied in 1883, and therefore could not be the mortgage in question, although it must be admitted that none on either side seems to have thought of making this examination until after the auditor’s first report had been presented to the court. The accountant’s neglect in this matter, in connection with the two other mistakes in the account, properly subjects him to the costs of the audit so far as his carelessness has caused them to be incurred, but we see no reason why he should be deprived of commissions. So far as we can discover, his administration of the trust has been honest. All his claims against the estate have been established except one, and nothing exists upon which a charge of fraud or dishonest}' can be successfully based: Price’s Est., <a href="/pa/81/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="81 Pa. 263" data-case-ids="1044136" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0263-01">81 Pa. 263</a>; Merkel’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=131%20Pa.%20613" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="131 Pa. 613">131 Pa. 613</a>.
