The burden of proving this fact rests on the plaintiff. It is his duty to make it clear to you by the weight or preponderance of the evidence. If he has failed to do this, he can recover nothing. If he has shown that he obtained a bona fide customer, that is, one able and willing to pay more than $215,000, and informed Judge Dean of that fact before his authority to sell was revoked, he would be entitled to recover from the defendant one half of the excess over $215,000, together with interest from time of demand, provided — I was going to say — that the defendant authorized or ratified the written agreements on which the suit is based; but his counsel have conceded that he did authorize Judge Dean to make these agreements, or at least ratified them after they were made, and it is not necessary to discuss that question farther.] [1]</p>

Neither the defendant nor Judge Dean agreed, in the writings declared upon, to pajr the plaintiff anything unless he actually made a sale at a price exceeding $215,000. He undertook to sell the land on a contingent commission; he took his chances and, without some other contract than that set forth in these agreements — and there is none other before you — all the risks would be his. If, on the principle of ‘ Nothing risked, nothing won,’ he spent his time and money on a mere speculation, he, of course, could not make the defendant repay his losses. Every day men make such contracts; some of them gain and some of them lose. Doing business in this way, while legitimate enough, is still somewhat of a lottery; and the man who goes into it must take his chances.] [2] [In the present case the landowners were incurring no liability whatever, as they could revoke the plaintiff’s authority at any time before he had found a pur-, chaser. If the plaintiff desired to protect himself more fully, he could have provided in the contract that the property should not be withdrawn from his hands before a certain period had expired; then, if his authority, before the time given had run out, was taken from him, he might recover for time, labor and money expended. That is, he would be entitled to a reasonable compensation. Since he did not provide for this, since he chose to take the chances of getting nothing or making a big profit, as he seems, according to his testimony, to have expected, he cannot hold these men, or either of them, responsible for money expended in developing that land, for time spent in trying to find a purchaser, or for the money spent in New York or elsewhere or otherwise. That was his own affair, and neither of them would be bound to compensate him. The evidence bearing on the plaintiff’s expenditures and efforts in faying to sell the- land is, under the pleadings in this case, only admissible and to be considered as bearing upon the question whether or not he found a purchaser.] [3] ....</p>

The solution of it will, be found in the pleadings and the evidence. The original statement filed in 1888 contained common counts for goods sold and delivered, for work and labor done, for money advanced and laid out, for money bad and received for use of appellant, and for money due on an account stated. An amendment was filed, and set forth that in 1881 J udge Dean and appellee were joint owners of a tract of coal land consisting of 3168 acres, and desiring to sell this tract they employed appellant to act as agent for negotiating a sale, and for his compensation for the work and labor of effecting the sale, agreed to give him any sum above the price of $200,000 for which he might sell it. That this agreement, together with one amending it as to certain timber on tbe lands and increasing tbe price to $215,000, was signed by Judge Dean for himself and appellee. That upon the faith of this agreement ho expended money and advertised tbe same; that in order to make a market be projected a railroad to the tract, and expended large sums of money in its organization and in raising money to build it; that while he was thus actively engaged in making a sale, with every prospect of success, the appellee and his co-owner, without notice to appellant, sold the lands to a coal company for a sum exceeding $815,000; that Judge Dean paid to appellant his share of the compensation due to him, amounting to $26,000, and that appellee has refused to pay his share of such compensation. Subsequently he filed another amended statement in which he avers that appellee received for the land an amount exceeding $838,333.10 for his share ; that previous to the revocation of the authority to sell he had procured a purchaser at the price of $350,000, and avers his damages to be tbe one half difference between $215,000 and the $350,000, or if the court be of opinion that tbe price at which the purchaser was to take the lands is not the measure of damages, he then avers his damages to be computed for his time, trouble, and expense, and specifying the length of time and the amount he has expended.</p>

With the pleadings so amended this was error. If these facts had been found by a jury, and there was evidence from which they might so have found, under these pleadings the appellant would have been entitled to a recovery. The owners of the property employed appellant to sell their lands. J udge Dean testified: “ The first one employed to sell the land was appellant; it was a verbal arrangement, and they gave appellant authority to dispose of the land; that he demanded a paper because as he alleged parties doubted his authority to sell, and what had existed in parol before that was reduced to writing after consultation with 'Mr. Caldwell, the appelLee.” The appellant testified: “ That Judge Dean wanted him to sell the land and that he went to New York to do so, and upon his return he went to Judge Dean and said to him: ‘I can’t do anything down there, I have nothing to show that I am authorized to sell the land,’ and the reply was, ‘ We will remedy that right straight,’ and the agreement was given.” This agreement, dated August 20,1881, first recites: “ We agree that appellant shall sell our coal lands,” and is distinctly an authority to sell, aird “he is to pay to us the sum of $200,000 without regard to the price he sells for; on payment of such sum we are to execute a good and sufficient deed.”</p>

It was an agreement making him an agent with full authority to sell, and fixing the basis of compensation. No time was fixed for the consummation of the sale, and the appellant began to devote his entire time to his employment, going back and forth from New York, and advertising in different papers. That up to April, 1886, whenever appellant was at home, which was at least once a month, appellee called upon him to inquire what appellant was doing in regard to the sale. Appellant employed men to open the mine, and on one occasion took ap<a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>■pellee to see the work.

When he returned home for the purpose of having a deed'executed he learned from Judge Dean that the authority to sell was revoked. Judge Dean said afterwards so far as he was concerned he would settle with him, and accordingly paid him the sum of $26,000 in full settlement of any claim on this account which appellant had against him. Judge Dean testified : “ That Caldwell knew about appellant’s efforts to make the sale. That when he came to him in July, 1886, and stated he had made a sale, he then told him he and appellee would take the matter out of his hands. It was then he notified him his authority to sell was revoked.” It is clear that this agreement contained a continuous authority to sell until revoked in July, 1886, and that on the faith of it appellant went on expending money up to that date, when he says he had secured a purchaser for the land. He was thus encouraged to spend his money and labor, and had therefore a right to assume that no revocation of his authority to sell would occur. If the appellee and his co-owner permitted appellant to go on expending the time, labor and money necessary to the accomplishment of his object, and suddenly, while he was so engaged, revoked his authority, he is entitled to be reimbursed for his outlay and to be paid for his labor and time.</p>

R. 731, it is said by Coleridge, Chief Justice, referring to Prickett and Badger: “ In that ease the plaintiff was employed as the defendant’s agent to sell land for commission at a given price. He succeeded in finding a purchaser at the stipulated price, but the principal declined to sell, and rescinded the agent’s authority.

If the jury believed these facts to be established, then according to Planche v. Colburn, 8 Bingh. 14, (1 M. &amp; Sc. 51,) and other authorities in conformity therewith, the plaintiff was entitled to abandon the special contract and resort to an action founded upon the promise which the law would infer from such a state of facts.”</p>

The interest of the agent was only in his compensation for selling, and without a sale this is not earned. A revocation could not injure him. If he had expended money, time, or labor, or all, upon the business intrusted to him, the power itself was a request to do so, and on a revocation would leave the principal liable to him on his implied assumpsit.”</p>
