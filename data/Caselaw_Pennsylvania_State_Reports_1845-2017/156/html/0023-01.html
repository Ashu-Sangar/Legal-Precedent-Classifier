Nor that the defendants claim that, at the time of the passage of the resolution of Dec. 5, 1892, the plaintiff represented that it had the right to construct and operate its railway over and upon the streets of the village of Waverly in the state of New York, one of the proposed termini of said railway, that on or about Dec. 20, 1892, it was refused the right to lay its tracks in the said village of Waverly, thereby cutting off an important part of the proposed line desired by the defendants. And the further fact, as claimed by the defendants, that all the expenditures on the part of the plaintiff were made after the resolution of Dec. 5, 1892, was rescinded, and with full knowledge of all the facts. Because, under my view of the law, the only question to be considered is, have the local authorities of the borough of Sayre given consent to the plaintiff company to locate, construct and operate its railway over and upon the streets of said borough ? If they have, the fact that the plaintiff has spent large sums of money <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>adds nothing to it. If consent has not been given the expenditure of money cannot cure the want of it. The plaintiff’s charter gave the company a legal existence, clothed it with corporate power, placing it in a position to undertake the purposes for which it was organized, and to solicit the privilege of entering upon the streets in question to construct their road ; but their right so to do was expressly conditioned upon the action of the council to that effect. Until they obtain that right, they cannot be said to suffer any special damage or irreparable injury, which would call for the intervention of equity: <a href="/pa/137/0533-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="137 Pa. 533" data-case-ids="821496" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0533-01">137 Pa. 533</a>, Larimer Railway Co. v.
