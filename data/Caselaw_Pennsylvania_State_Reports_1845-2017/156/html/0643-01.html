Prior to 1843, a wooden sleeper bridge spanned the creek at this point, and formed a part of the roadway laid out and opened in 1760. In that year (1843), an extraordinary freshet washed that bridge away and injured the stone abutment on the Aston side. In the same year, or in 1844, the bridge was replaced by another wooden structure, which, however, was lengthened about 60 feet on the Aston side, and which rested on two stone abutments and four stone piers, leaving an open space between the abutments of 140 feet throngh which the waters of the creek might flow unobstructed, save only by the stone supporting piers, some rocks or boulders, and some bushes and trees that had grown up in the bed of the stream. This bridge falling into decay was replaced by the present iron bridge in 1884. It was erected upon the same ground as the bridge removed had occupied, and upon the roadway as laid out in 1790. The Middletown abutment, built of solid masonry, was, however, extended out into the bed of the stream 60 feet, leaving a space between the two abutments of 80 feet, which was spanned by <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>an iron superstructure from 10 to 11 feet above the water beneath, at its ordinary stages. In 1878 or 1879 the breast of the McCready dam, which stood about 50 feet above the bridge and opposite to the lower end of mill No. 2, and which had been purchased by Mr. Riddle, was removed. In 1881, Mr. Riddle erected the brick mill, about two thirds of which was located in the bed of the McCready dam and the stream below. About the same time Mr. Riddle built a stone wall five feet thick and averaging in height about six feet, from the waste way of the head-race down to the upper corner, nearest the creek, of the brick mill. This wall was all built in what was formerly the bed of the McCready dam, and was filled in behind so as to increase the yard room of the mills and protect them from flooding. In 1884, Mr. Riddle placed a turbine water wheel between the brick mill and the blacksmith shop, conducting the water by a large iron flume from the head-race just below mill No. 2, to the wheel, and thence by a tail-race dug between the first pier and the Middletown abutment, of the old bridge, down to the stream below the bridge.</p>

If these allegations be true, the county must answer in damages for the loss which it has entailed upon the plaintiffs; for it was the duty of the county, in the construction of its bridge, to leave an opening or openings sufficiently large to afford passage for all the water that might reasonably be expected to flow through such a stream as Chester creek; taking into consideration the character and topography of the country through which it flows, the extent of country it drains, the size of the stream, the height of its banks and the usual freshets to which it was known or might reasonably be expected to be subject. The county, however, was not required to anticipate or provide against extraordinary or unusual freshets, nor against every possible or remote con tingency, such as cloud bursts or the breaking of dams above. <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>They are visitations of providence, and the destruction they bring must be borne by those on whom they happen to fall. It is not questioned but that the span of 80 feet is ample, and more than ample, for the free passage of all the water of this stream in its ordinary stages, but the important question for your serious consideration and determination is — is it sufficient to vent the stream when swollen by the unusual spring and fall freshets to which the creek is subject, or does it, in such freshets, by reason of its extended Middletown abutment and contracted span, dam up the water to such a height as to flood the plaintiff’s mills and property ?

Said injury is alleged to have been caused by the erection of a county bridge over Chester <a id="p651" href="#p651" data-label="651" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*651</a>creek, whereby the channel of that stream was obstructed and the waters thereof so backed up, during freshets, that the mills, and surrounding lands appurtenant thereto, were flooded and said mill property greatly damaged and depreciated in value. The first of these suits was brought by the executors of Samuel Riddle, who died February 19,1888, and the second by his said sons, devisees under his will. The court held that no action could be maintained by said devisees, because the injury, if any, having been done in the lifetime of their devisor, was permanent and the consequent depreciation of value, if any, had taken place before they acquired title. A verdict for the defendant in that case was accordingly directed, and in the other, now before us on this appeal, the entire subject of damages was adjudicated.</p>
    <p id="b673-3" data-blocks='[["BL_673.4",673,[211,1104,1166,401]]]'>The facts, necessary to a proper understanding of the case, are so fully and accurately presented, in the learned judge’s charge and answers to points, that extended reference to them is now unnecessary. The subjects of complaint in the first ten specifications of error, are to admission and rejection of testimony. The remaining eleven specifications are to alleged errors in the learned judge’s charge and answers to points submitted by counsel.</p>
    <p id="b673-4" data-blocks='[["BL_673.5",673,[209,1514,1166,914]],["BL_674.1",674,[253,381,1169,394]]]'>When the appeal of the present defendant from decree enjoining the erection of said new bridge, etc., was before us, Mr. Chief Justice Paxson, in the opinion reversing said decree, said: “ It needs no authority to show that the county commissioners cannot be controlled, in their discretion in building a county bridge, on the application of a private citizen. This cannot be done either in the size of the bridge, its plan, the location of its piers or abutments. The master finds that this bridge is located wholly on the old roadbed and within its lines. It does not touch the land of the complainant. If it causes injury to the latter by interfering with his water rights, he has his remedy by an action on the case: ” Delaware County’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/119/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="119 Pa. 159" data-case-ids="558124" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0159-01">119 Pa. 159</a>. Recognizing that case as definitively settling the legal relation of the county to their testator, the executors brought this action on the case, and the trial proceeded for the recovery of damages, not for the wrongful or improper erection of the bridge, but for the injury sustained by reason of its interference with his water rights. Their <a id="p652" href="#p652" data-label="652" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*652</a>claim is based upon the settled principle that the measure of damages is the difference in value of the mill property before and after the erection of the bridge. With special reference to this, we have considered the first ten specifications, the last of which relates to the exclusion of defendant’s offer to prove the matters therein stated, and the others to the admission of plaintiffs’ several offers, and are not satisfied that there is any substantial error in either of them.</p>
    <p id="b674-4" data-blocks='[["BL_674.4",674,[255,792,1169,505]]]'>The only doubt we have, as to any of them, is in regard to the relevancy of the question recited in the fourth specification. At first sight, that would appear to be irrelevant, but when considered in connection with the general scope of Mr. Davis’s testimony, including his answer to the question complained of, we think it is neither, incompetent nor irrelevant. The substance of his testimony on that subject is that, in time of freshets, the abutment etc. of the bridge seriously obstructs the ventage of the water, and thus interferes with the plaintiffs’ water rights.</p>
    <p id="b674-5" data-blocks='[["BL_674.5",674,[256,1304,1180,454]]]'>In that portion of his charge recited in the eleventh specification, we think the learned judge rightly instructed the jury that if, under the circumstances, a larger span would have obviated the damming up and flooding, then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, for the injuries sustained, because Mr. Riddle had a perfect right to raise his dam breast and erect his wall and mill where he did, and as it was all completed before the bridge was commenced it was the duty of the commissioners in. building the bridge to provide for the then existing conditions.</p>
    <p id="b674-6" data-blocks='[["BL_674.6",674,[255,1765,1179,401]]]'>There was no .error in affirming plaintiffs’ sixth and eleventh points, nor in the answer to their ninth point. In the latter the learned judge said: “If the commissioners in the construction of the bridge have failed or neglected to provide for the free flow of the waters of the stream in times of the usual or-ordinary freshets to which it is subject, and damage has resulted to the plaintiffs by reason of such failure or neglect, the defendant is liable in damages for the injury done.”</p>
    <p id="b674-7" data-blocks='[["BL_674.7",674,[257,2173,1171,238]]]'>There was no error in refusing to affirm defendant’s third point; nor in the court’s answers to either its fourth, fifth or sixth points.
