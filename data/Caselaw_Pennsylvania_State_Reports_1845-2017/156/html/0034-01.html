We use 3 in. wide and 4 in. wide and sometimes 6 in. wide bars, principally 3 in. and 4 in. We want also a good quality for bolts, and by the term good we mean first quality — a quality that will bend double cold in the bolt rod without showing a sign of fracture, well boiled, fibrous iron, free from red shortness, or any crystalline structure. But our requirements for rivet stock are exacting. We must have the very best quality for this purpose, and we should want it right along all the time of the same quality, if we found it satisfactory. The market is always low for boiler rivets, and we should have to buy at a low price in order to compete with other makers. What are called ‘ good ’ muck bars, as ordinarily understood, we find would not answer our purpose for rivets. Will you be kind enough to consider this inquiry and advise us what you could do ?
