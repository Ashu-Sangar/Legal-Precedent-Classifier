The-act further directed that any part of said buildings, when completed, should be occupied by such branches of the municipal government as they were intended for, and the present buildings on Independence Square, except Independence Hall, as soon-as the public buildings were entirely completed, should be removed. Further, it was made the duty of all branches of the city government to do and perform all such acts in aid of the intent and purpose of the act as the commission might, from, time to time, require.</p>

Exasperating delay on the part of the commission is alleged; extravagance, mismanagement and dishonesty are more than insinuated. It is averred, it has so conducted the work as to arouse the hostility of the citjq and prompt a practically unanimous demand for the repeal of the commission, which demand was responded to by the act of 24th May, 1893, now before us. The plaintiffs aver this is unconstitutional, and must be so pronounced, and they ask that any interference by the city with the commission in charge of the work be restrained. The defendant, the city, affirms the constitutionality of the act, and, as a consequence, alleges that, from the date of its approval by the governor, the commission ceased to exist, and the city, in resuming possession of the public building, did so in accordance with law.</p>

But the contention here is not determined by either the right to repeal or the duty to repeal. Is the act of 24th May, 1893, a lawful repeal of the <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>special act of 5th of August, 1870, or is it itself a special act violative of the constitution ? It does not purport to be an act for the repeal of the act of 1870. It is entitled, “An act to abolish,” not the “ commission,” the warrant or authority by which they exercised power, but the “ commissioners,” those who exercised the authority, “ and to place all public buildings heretofore under the control of such commissioners, under the control of the department of public works in cities of the first class.” Its declared purpose is the removal of the commissioners and the transfer of their-authority to the department of public works. The title of an act is part of it; it limits its scope, and is properly used in interpreting its words : Pa. R. R. Co. v. Riblet, <a href="/pa/66/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="66 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="432510" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0164-01">66 Pa. 164</a>.

The same section then goes on to say: “And the erection, completion, construction, repair, removal and protection of all public buildings heretofore under the control of such commissioners in said cities, shall be under the direction, control and administration of the department of public works.”</p>

Section 1, article 4, of the Bullitt Bill provides, that: “The department of public works shall be under the charge of one director, who shall be the head thereof.” Then article 12 of section 1 of the same bill enacts, that, among other officers: “ The mayor shall nominate, and, by and with the advice and consent of select council, appoint the director of public works.” The vacancy <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>thus created by the removal of the commissioners, is thus filled by an officer appointed by the mayor, with the consent of select council.</p>

    <p id="b581-5" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[222,947,1175,1473]],["BL_582.1",582,[248,396,1171,142]]]'>Certainly, it needs no argument to show that the special powers enumerated in the act of 5th August, 1870, when conferred on any officer, is a violation of section 20, article 3, of the constitution : “ The general assembly shall not delegate to any special commission .... any power to make, supervise or interfere with any municipal improvement, money, property or effects .... or perform any municipal function whatever.” The special commission which, by the general assembly of 1870, was delegated to certain commissioners, was, by the general assembly of 1893, simply withdrawn from them and delegated to the head of the department of public works, another commissioner. The fact is not material that the new commissioner was already by general law an officer of the city; the special and unusual power given him, to be exercised in a special manner, with reference to one particular building, constituted the special commission delegated to him. The first section, then, which fulfills the promise of the title, creates a vacancy in the office of commissioner, and fills it with the nominee of the general assembly. The authority of the general assembly of 1870, under the constitution of 1838, to delegate such power to a special commission, was clear; that of the general assembly of 1893, under the constitution of 1874, was peremptorily forbidden. This is not an act increasing the duties and enlarging the powers of the head of the department of public works in cities of the first class, but an act abolishing commissioners of public buildings, and transferring their powers to another in such cities. There is just one city of the first class, Philadelphia ; just one set of commissioners to erect public buildings for the use of the courts and municipal purposes, created by any <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>special act of assembly; so there can be no doubt as to the specialty of the commission delegated, nor of the nature of the powers conferred.</p>

If the city decided to proceed with the work of building, the direction of the actual labor would have fallen, by virtue of the subdivision of executive powers of the city, upon this department. But the act of 1893 proceeded to gather up carefully all the powers of the old commission, and deposit them, not with the city, but in the lap of the director of public works. By a repeal, the extraordinary powers of the commission would have ended with its own life; the ordinary powers would have fallen back upon the city to be exercised in the ordinary manner; the department of public works would have performed such work and onty such as councils, in the exercise of their paramount “ direction, control and administration” of municipal affairs, might have seen fit to direct. Under the Bullitt bill the department of public works can only take through the city; if the powers of the commission had passed to the city, the department, as such, would have taken nothing; the direction of the actual labor would have been with it, by virtue of being one of the nine subdivisions of the executive power of the city. But under the act of 1893 this department is named as the sole legislative donee of the powers of the commission. It takes not from or through the city, but independently of it, and directly from the commonwealth. Its title is subject to no condition or trust, but is absolute and independent; as much so as that of the old commission.</p>

(2) Repeals the proviso to section 1, article 4, of the general act of 1st of June, 1885, saving the act of 5th August, 1870, from repeal. (3) Saves from repeal the act of 6th of March, 1867, appropriating grounds <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>for public purposes in the city of Philadelphia. All three are subjects different from that announced in the title. The purpose of legislative action as stated in the title, is to remove commissioners of public buildings, and transfer their powers and control to another; this purpose, as we have seen, is fully carried out by the language of the first section. But then, another subject is taken up; the act creating the commission is repealed, and a proviso inserted saving from repeal the act of 26th of March, 1867, creating the Fairmount Park Commission and placing in its control the property and public buildings of the Park. Neither of these subjects is hinted at in the title, and both are distinct from the subject announced in the title, and at variance with the purpose there disclosed. The title, in substance, professes to abolish the commissioners and keep alive the commission. So far as words can do this, it is done in the first section. But then the legislative mind changes and the second section strikes down the one commission and saves another. Therefore, the bill contains more than one subject and cannot stand as a whole, because of section 3, article 3, of the constitution: “No bill shall be passed containing more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in the title.”</p>

This act is nominally general ; applies in terms to cities of the first class; abolishes commissioners of public buildings for the use of courts and municipal purposes in such cities, created by special acts of assembly, and places all buildings heretofore under their control in the control of the department of public works. At the date of its passage there was just one city, one set of commissioners, one special act of assembly, one public building, to which it could apply ; from the very nature of the case, there never could be another city in the first class to which the.act could apply, for it transfers to the department of public works buildings heretofore under the control of such commissioners ; no matter how many cities come into this class, nor how soon they reach it, this act cannot apply to them, for their affairs have not heretofore been regulated by the special provisions of airy such act as that of 1870.</p>

We answer, certainly it can, if that be the real end in view, The very same article 3, section 7, which forbids local and special legislation, points the way so plainly, that, of all forms of legislation, it is subject to the least uncertainty. ' It says, after enumerating what laws shall not be passed: “ But laws repealing local or special laws may be passed.” Under this express constitutional authority, an act of a dozen lines, repealing the act of 5th of August, 1870, would have ousted the commissioners and obliterated the commission. All the rights of the city over its own property, with the control of its own purse, would at once have been resumed. Then, through councils, the direct representatives of the people, by ordinances, City Hall could have been completed, the old buildings on Independence Square removed, in a time and way and at such cost as to the city seemed proper.

But the matter to be determined is purely judicial; a spirit of comity can only impel us to a careful consideration of the question; it cannot determine the answer; that must be found in the language of the act, and the manifest intent of the constitution. If this act be sustained, the same sort of legislation can regulate the affairs of the most insignificant borough in the commonwealth, and we may expect a flood of the same vicious local laws which preceded the adoption of the constitution of 1874. It is certainly not forgotten, that the well-nigh unanimous demand which brought the convention of 1873 into existence, was prompted by the evils springing from local and special legislation. That convention, direct from the people, composed of the ablest and most experienced citizens of the commonwealth, framed this article 3 on legislation. Assuming, what was the settled law, that the general assembly had all legislative power not expressly withheld from it in the organic law, they set about embodying in that law prohibitions which«hould, in the future, effectually prevent the evils the people complained of. Article 3 is almost wholly prohibitory; it enjoins very few duties, but the “ thou shalt nots ” number more than sixty, among them sections 3, 7 and 20, which we here decide to be transgressed by this act. That constitution, with this article the most prominent feature of it, was adopted by an unprecedented majority on a direct vote, indicating a settled determined purpose on part of the people to hold back from the legislature the power to enact local and special laws. Every department of the government is bound by its provisions, but especially is this court, for on it is the duty of judicially determining any violation of it. The state as a whole is subject to it; the largest municipality as well as the'smallest township. Yet it is a fact that, notwithstanding the respect which, as citizens of a free commonwealth, we all have for the fundamental law, since 1874 more than three hundred bills have been passed by the legisl a<a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>ture, which four governors have vetoed because they were unconstitutional; nearly one hundred of thesebecause they violated section 7, article 3, prohibiting local and special laws. In the same time, thirty-three, which received executive-approval, have been pronounced unconstitutional by this court, most of them because violative of the same section 7, article 3. When we consider that no special duty of judicial ascertainment of the constitutionality of legislation is imposed on the executive department, we must assume, these vetoed bills were so palpably unconstitutional that, under the oath taken by the head of that department, he could not conscientiously affix his signature to them ; and the correctness of that assumption is all the more probable from the fact, that more than one third of the members of the general assembly must have concurred in his objections, for, so far as we can discover, in no instance were any of them passed over his veto. During the session at which this bill was passed seventy-three were vetoed; thirty-seven or more than one half were refused signature because violative of the constitution; of these thirty-seven, twelve transgressed section 7, of article 3, against local and special legislation, and most of the others, sections 3, 18 and 20 of the same article. Why such a fact exists, of course, must be in a great degree conjectural. Mr. Buckalew, in his excellent work on the constitution of 1874, noticing that for the- legislative session of 1879, Governor Hoyt had vetoed thirteen bills because clearly violative of prohibitory clauses in article 3, suggests, as the reason, that the old habits of special legislation prior to 1874 were “ thrown off with difficulty and often with reluctance.” But this explanation does injustice to the legislative branch. . The general assembly of the commonwealth is just as devoted to the constitution as either of the other departments of the government. In no like period, since the foundation of the commonwealth, as since 1874, has the material and intellectual advancement of the whole people been stimulated and fostered by so many wise and beneficent laws. But the legislature being quickly responsive to local public sentiment, and having no duty of determining purely judicial questions, honestly attempts legislative advancement of local interests or legislative relief from local evils. Bills framed to accomplish such purposes are often met and stricken down by a constitution highly restrictive, and bristling with specific prohibitions.</p>

But the question presents itself to us in a different shape; we do not believe the intelligent public sentiment of the greatest city of the commonwealth demands the accomplishment of a lawful purpose by unlawful means ; unconstitutional statutes are the very essence of lawlessness. Even if the unanimous public sentiment of the city demanded the enforcement of this act, we could not heed it. Public sentiment, properly, may move courts, in matters wholly discretionary, such as the adoption of rules to speed causes, afford quick relief to suitors, and eradicate abuses in the administration of justice; but such sentiment can have no place in the interpretation of a constitution; the public sentiment expressed in that instrument is the only sentiment of which a court can take notice; it contains the deliberate,- emphatically expressed sentiment of the whole people; they, and they alone, can change ox amend it in the way provided in it, but even they cannot trample upon it.

The evidence that notice has been published is to be exhibited to the general assembly; it is not directed to be entered on the journals.

If these objections are substantial, then no matter how well meant and desirable the purpose, it must fail. That is the penalty of living under the present constitution, pervaded as it is by a profound distrust of the legislature. In the impatience of the people with some of the evils of special legislation, they have rushed to the other extreme, and so hedged about and bound up the legislative arm of the government that legitimate and necessary powers can be exercised only with difficulty if at all. Article 3, On Legislation, contains, as our brother Dean has pointed out, sixty specific prohibitions, besides other restrictions and regulations not absolutely prohibitory. It is a barbed wire fence around all legislative action; bristling with points of danger even to the most honest, and desirable, and essential laws.

The creation of a new commission, consisting of the Department of Public Works, does not seem to me the necessary result of the act. It is no part of the general intent, which is to abolish the commission created by the act of 1870 and transfer its powers to the city of Philadelphia. The designation of the Department of Public Works is merely the naming of that branch of the city government to which the act of 1885 would commit the subject, had the present act briefly repealed the act of 1870 without more. The transfer of the powers of the old commission to the Department of Public Works, is a transfer to the office, not to the incumbent, and is therefore really to the city of whose government the office is a part. The naming of the agent instead of the principal is not material, because the whole scope of the act shows that it is not a grant of power to the agent individually, but to him as agent and representing the principal. This conclusion is plain from the fact that if all this part of the statute had been omitted, the result would have been exactly the same. The existing law, the act of 1885, would in that case’ have transferred the power to the same place where this act expressly puts it, namely, the Department of Public Works.

Nor do I find the objection that section second contains more than one subject insuperable. The only real subject is the repeal of the act of 1870, and having expressly enacted that, the section proceeds to repeal a section of the act of 1885 which had preserved <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>the commission under the act of 1870, and therefore might be thought to conflict with the present act.

After providing for their establishment, it enacts: “ Councils shall by general ordinances provide for the proper and efficient conduct of the officers of the city, by the .mayor and the several departments.” It is manifest that while this act, when it was passed, was in fact <em>then </em>intended to be applicable to but one city, it nevertheless contemplated the creation of a general class for legislation. Classification by the general assembly has for its purpose general legislation, and, under the constitution, is a legislative method resorted to in order to accomplish it. The title to the act in this contention is “ An. act to abolish commissioners .... in cities of the first class,” and indicates its clearly defined purpose to be legislation for a general class. Its enacting clauses provide for the abolition of commissioners, created by <em>any </em>special act of assembly, for the charge, direction and control of public buildings of cities of the first class by the departments of public works, and for the repeal of the proviso in the general act which continued the commissioners. This language very clearly marks out legislation for a class, and as such constitutes general legislation. Its dominating object is the repeal of <em>any </em>act creating building commissioners in cities bf the first class. As a repealing statute, it would not fall within the limits of the prohibited class of local or special laws. While the constitution prohibits the direct or indirect enactment of such laws, it does not place the same inhibition upon statutes intended for their repeal.. It has not done so because their repeal doubtless in some instances may become necessary in order to effectuate general legislation. The'present statute repeals any act creating commissioners,' and strikes down theixs <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>functions which, without the act creating them, would have been inherent in the designated department. Its entire scope covers this object, and this legislative intent is expressed by no uncertain or doubtful language. Standing as a repealing act, it is not prohibited by the fundamental law.</p>
    <p id="b595-5" data-blocks='[["BL_595.5",595,[225,633,1160,1267]]]'>But this conclusion is resisted because, it is contended, the act overlaps repeal with affirmative legislation. A repeal alone, would, without doubt, have placed the public buildings of a member of the first class of cities in the charge, control and under the direction of the department of public works, for the act organizing the government of such cities provides, “ the construction, protection and repair of public buildings,” shall be “under the direction, control and administration of the department of public works.” The present act, after abolishing commissioners, provides that all public buildings heretofore under the control of commissioners in said cities, “shall be under the direction, control and administration of the department of public works.” These words are thus identical with those used in the governing act, and therefore cannot be said to constitute new or additional legislation. With or without the words in question the effect of the repeal would have been the same. Their use was unnecessary, but doubtless the legislature by using them with the words of repeal intended .an iteration of the absolute extinction of building commissioners in a manner more clear and emphatic than would have been indicated by a simple repeal. The proposition that the act as a repealing statute is brought within the inhibition of the constitution, because in addition to repeal it contains a substantial iteration of it, would seem like refinement run mad, and, if subtle, would appear to be beyond ordinary comprehension.</p>

The history of legislation in this state will attest that the promotion of the public welfare has been best accomplished by a resort to classification, and the exercise of this power for such purpose has never been questioned. Where the popula<a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>tion in a city or cities has become very .great, classification, which has its basis in population, must necessarily constitute an exceedingly limited number of the first class, because their necessities and requirements, in consequence of their great size, are peculiarly distinctive. The limitation in numbers reducing the class even to a minimum can have no effect upon the general character of the legislation in regard to such class. While, therefore, all legislation relating to cities of the first class is necessarily applicable to the city of Philadelphia, as it is the only member of that class, it does not follow that because such is the case the legislation is as a consequence a violation of the constitution.</p>

Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20Pa.%20349" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="77 Pa. 349">77 Pa. 349</a>, it is said by Mr. 'Justice Paxson : “ But it is contended that even if the right to classify exists, the exercise of it by the legislature in this instance is in violation of the constitution for the reason that there is but one city in the state with a population exceeding three hundred thousand, that to form a class containing but one is in point of fact legislating for that one city to the exclusion of ali others and constitutes local and special legislation prohibited by the constitution. The argument is plausible but unsound.” Again, he says: “ In the mean time is the classification as to the cities of the first class bad because there is only one of the class? We think not. Classification does not depend upon numbei’s.” Again: “ If the classification of cities is in violation of the constitution, it follows, of necessity, that Philadelphia as a city of the first class must be denied the legislation necessary to its present prosperity and future development, or that small cities must be burdened with legislation unsuited to their needs. For if the constitution means, what the complainants aver that it does, Philadelphia can have no legislation that is not common to all other cities of the state.” Again: “ Must the legislation for a great commercial and manufacturing city with a population approaching one million be regulated by the wants and necessities of an inland city of ten thousand ? If the constitution answers this question in the affirmative, we are bound by it, however we might question its wisdom. But no such construction is to be gathered from its terms and we will not presume the framers of that instrument, or the people who ratified it, intended that the machinery of <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>their state government should be so bolted and riveted down by the fundamental law as to be unable to perform its necessary functions.”</p>

In Weinman v. Passenger Railway Company, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20Pa.%20203" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="118 Pa. 203">118 Pa. 203</a>, Mr. Justice Williams says: “ For the purpose of local government, the state is subdivided into counties, township and other municipal and quasi-municipal corporations. Each class of these subdivisions has purposes to subserve that are peculiar to it and need to be invested with the powers necessary to that end. Generally speaking, all the members of each class have some local function to perform. Classification therefore upon this basis has been recognized and a statute relating to all the townships, all the school districts, or all the members of any particular class of the municipal divisions of the state has been held to be constitutional. It has been found desirable to divide cities into classes upon the basis of their population. The needs of a great city with a hall’ of a million or more of people are somewhat different in many respects from the needs of a city with ten thousand. The organization of their local governments and the management of their municipal affairs will be quite unlike. Each requires legislation peculiar to itself.” In Ruan Street, <a href="/pa/132/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="132 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="970573" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0257-01">132 Pa. 257</a>, it is said by Mr. Justice Williams, in delivering the opinion of the court: “ The force of the argument in support of classification in Wheeler v. Philadelphia, and it is the only line of argument by which it can be sustained, lies in the evident necessity for the possession and exercise of other and somewhat different corporate powers by the city on the seaboard from those required by the inland city — by the city with the population of one million from those required by the city of ten thousand. These great differences in population render it necessary that there should be corresponding differences in the number, character, powers, and duties of the officers by whom municipal <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>governments are to be conducted and the municipal'necessities provided for, and classification was sustained as a necessary means for enabling the legislature to make provisions adapted to secure each class of cities, the corporate powers and the number, character, powers and duties of the officers best adapted to secure its needs without an infraction of the constitution.” The constitutional mandate restricting legislation to defined limits has for its object the passage of wise and uniform laws beneficial to the masses of the people, and the prevention of vicious and injudicious enactments advantageous to few persons, and was not intended to defeat or prevent legislation for greatly concentrated population, whose necessities springing from such concentration concern quarantine, health, trade, public buildings, political divisions and finances, and require distinctive legislation. The legislature, confronted with conditions arising from such necessities, has therefore passed laws relating to them as applicable to a class, although existing in a single locality, and has founded such' classification upon needs imperatively deman ding legislation. The statute in the present controversy relates to a class, whose locality is restricted, and. concerns the erection, completion, construction upon and protection of public buildings, a subject that pertains to municipal government so designated in the general act governing cities of the first class, and as essentially so as any object of municipal administration. As it is thus made applicable to a general class and intended for a municipal p.urpose, the contention that it is special, as the class contains but one member, cannot be successfully maintained, because it .has the constituents of general legislation, namely, the class and the purpose. This general character, thus manifested, cannot be modified by the allegation that the motive of the legislature in its enactment was to accomplish a special purpose. The judiciary has nothing to do with the moving causes of legislation, and will always presume that a co-ordinate branch of government is impelled by proper motives and is controlled by a due regard for constitutional mandate. The presumption, that general legislation' was intended should therefore prevail, and is in harmony with judicial opinion that legislation, with classification as its basis, is .general. In Ayars’ Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20Pa.%20281" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="122 Pa. 281">122 Pa. 281</a>, the present Chief Justice says : “ Laws enacted in pursuance of such classifica<a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>tion and for such purposes are properly speaking neither local nor special. They are general, because they apply alike to all that are similarly situated as to their peculiar necessities. All legislation is necessarily based upon a classification of its subjects, and when such classification is fairly made, laws enacted in conformity thereto cannot be properly characterized as either local or special.”</p>

The act, under which its government is organized, creates a department of public works and places under its direction, control and administration and in charge of its director “the construction, protection and repair of public buildings.” If when it was passed the proviso excepting the act creating the commissioners had not been incorporated in it, the performance of their functions would have devolved upon that department, and if the commission by its repeal should cease to exist, the same result would necessarily follow. This act, then, in designating a department to which the performance of the functions belong by law, does not thereby create for it any new duty or establish any new commission, body, or department to perform it. It is not an attempt to trench upon the rights of the people to control local administration, but is a general law, having for its object the removal of all restrictions upon such control in cities of the first class, and springs from an imperative demand that the public buildings necessary for their business shall be under the direction of municipal administration. As the city would thus <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>resume its charge of these public buildings, and in doing so perform that which by law it is required to do, an act which, by repeal, removes any restriction upon its performance and thus leaves it to perform a duty cast upon it by law, is not one regulating its affairs or making any new transfer of its public-buildings.</p>
    <p id="b600-5" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[260,728,1182,1621]]]'>It is said that this act transgresses the article of the constitution which prohibits the enactment of any law containing* more than one subject, and requires the one subject to be clearly expressed in the title, but an examination will demonstrate that, it in fact contains but one subject and that which is germane to it. The first section provides for the abolition of the commissioners and follows it with the buildings, the erection, completion, repair, removal and protection of which, had been in their control, shall be under the direction and control of the-department of public works. The second section provides for the repeal of the laws creating the commissioners. The title expresses clearly the subject of the legislation. The words of the act designating the department of public works to have control, direction and administration of these buildings, upon the abolition of the commissioners, do not express any new or distinctive subject of legislation. They indicate, as shown,, only the department of the city upon which would devolve the duty of their control, direction and administration upon the abolition of the commissioners. The warrant for a judicial annulment of a law upon the grounds of its unconstitutionality should be found in a clearly expressed prohibition or one necessarily implied. And a doubt should always resolve in favor of its constitutionality. To apply the constitutional prohibition to this abt, is to extend it beyond reasonable limits and those of judicial determination.
