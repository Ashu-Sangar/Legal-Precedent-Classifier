Plaintiff offered in evidence a lease to Kemp from Stewart, plaintiff’s predecessor in title and patentee from the commonwealth. Defendant introduced evidence tending to show that when the lease was given Kemp was in possession of the land and executed the lease not for the purpose of creating the relation of landlord and tenant with Stewart, but to prevent Kemp’s creditors from taking <em>the </em>land in execution. The whole case was submitted to the jury, and a verdict was rendered for defendant. <em>Held, </em>that a judgment on the verdict should be affirmed.</p>

After Kemp’s death, the defendants, his heirs, continued in possession. Plaintiffs offered in evidence a lease from Stewart to Kemp executed in 1840.
