He put it upon a shelf in that vault, and some time during the morning went to that package of notes and handled it, and saw and knew that it was there at that time. Some hours later, when he entered the vault, the package was gone. The precise time that it was taken nobody knew; how it was taken nobody saw. They do, however, declare that, at an hour when the clerical force at. the bank is the most reduced, at a time when there were but two clerks in the bank, a man came into the office of the bank, with tread so noiseless upon the hard tile flooring in that institution as to lead them to believe that he had on felt shoes or shoes with rubber soles.</p>

Neither of the bank clerks saw him afterward when he left the bank.</p>

In the meantime the teller started to count the money, which w'as inclosed with a paper band, upon which, in ink, were the figures ‘ $80,’ and said to that individual, ‘ There are not $80 here.’</p>

While these two <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>men were engaged in conversation with the two clerks, a customer of the bank, Mr. Mayer, came in;] [7] and, as he came into the door, he says', a man came toward him, his coat was buttoned up and was puffed out, and as he got near the door leading to the street he gave a little cough, upon which the other two men turned from the desks at which they were engaged in conversation with the clerks, and they all went out.</p>

I say that, if you believe the commonwealth’s testimony that these three men that were in that bank that morning, apparently strangers, there each for a different purpose, were the three men who met upon the road between here and Bath, and who were brought to Easton in the same conveyance, who went to the bank separately, and who afterward met again and were driven out of town; and if you believe they were the men. who took the cars together at Treichler’s Station, I say you are almost led to the irresistible conclusion that they were the men who perpetrated the crime, if you believe the crime was committed.] [8]----</p>
