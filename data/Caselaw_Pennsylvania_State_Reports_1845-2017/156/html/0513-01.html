During the tax year ending the first Monday of November, 1890, the defendant was a corporation of this commonwealth, chartered on Feb. 23, 1885, and having a paid up capital stock of #1,000,000. Of this amount #700,000 was employed within the state in the printing and publishing of periodicals and books for the purpose of sale, in the making of stationery and in the making and binding of blank books, also for the purpose of sale; and three hundred thousand dollars was employed in the purchase and sale of books and other articles manufactured by other persons. It is not engaged in the brewing and distilling of spirituous or malt liquors and it does not enjoy and exercise the right of eminent domain.</p>

The capital stock of the company was appraised Nov. 5, 1890, by its treasurer and president at #1,000,000, which was its true value at that date.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.4",536,[256,503,1176,455]]]'>“ Under the act of 1885, section 20, we decided that the defendant was not liable to tax upon the $700,000 of capital stock invested in its manufacturing business. But for reasons to be found in Com. v. William Mann Co., No. 385 Jan. T., 1892, [1 Dist. B. 345, reversed <a href="/pa/150/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="150 Pa. 64" data-case-ids="834390" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0064-01">150 Pa. 64</a>,] we are obliged to hold that the act of 1889 does not continue that exemption in favor of the defendant. We refer to that case for the reasoning-which supports our present conclusions with the same effect as-if it was here repeated.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b536-5" data-blocks='[["BL_536.5",536,[255,966,1174,289]]]'>“ We conclude that the defendant is a manufacturing corporation actually carrying on manufacturing within the state,, but during the tax-year of 1890 it was not a corporation organized exclusively for manufacturing purposes, and therefore that its whole capital stock is taxable and taxed by section 21 of the revenue act of 1889.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b536-6" data-blocks='[["BL_536.6",536,[256,1272,1174,247]]]'>“ Since the opinion in this case was written, the Supreme-Court has decided that the question, whether or not a given corporation is organized exclusively for manufacturing purposes, is to be determined by inspecting its charter and not by considering the business which it is actually doing.</p>

We reached the same conclusion by taking the defendant’s business as the test and finding that it was actually exercising both the powers which are apparently given by its charter. But we did not then consider a new question which has since been raised in other cases, namely, whether the power to ‘ deal ’ could lawfully be given. We have recently decided the point, however, in Com. v. Thackara Mfg. Co., 352 Jan. T., 1892, Dauphin C. P. [the pre<a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>ceding case], holding that the power is not lawfully given, because no statute authorizes the grant to a corporation of the power to deal as a merchant. Following that decision, we now hold that the apparent power to deal, found in the charter before us, is void, and, therefore, that the defendant is exclusively organized for manufacturing purposes.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b537-3" data-blocks='[["BL_537.4",537,[240,706,1162,249]]]'>“ The case is thus identical with Com. v. Wm.

As the sum due upon this account has been already paid, we now direct judgment to be entered for the defendant.”</p>
