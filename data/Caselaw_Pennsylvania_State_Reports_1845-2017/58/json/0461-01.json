A special verdict must find facts and not the evidence from which facts may be inferred: if defective in this respect a venire de novo will be awarded.\n3. A scire facias was issued on a judgment more than twenty years old; and before arbitrators the defendant being compelled to testify said: \u201c I did not pay the judgment in money; I consider it paid by lapse of time.\u201d On appeal, this testimony was submitted for the opinion of the court in a case stated, as to whether it was sufficient to rebut the presumption of payment. The court entered judgment for the plaintiff. The judgment was reversed, the case stated dismissed, and procedendo awarded.\nMay 11th 1869.\nBefore Thompson, C. J., Agnew and Sharswood, JJ. Strong and Read, JJ., absent.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland county:\nOf May Term 1868, No. 3.\nA scire facias was issued May 1st 1866 by A. Coyle and Scott Coyle, trading as A. & S. Coyle, against Jacob Kinsley, Jr., on a judgment for $99.10, to January Term 1837. The case was referred to arbitrators, who awarded for the plaintiff. The defendant appealed; he afterwards died and his executrix was substituted.\nA case was stated showing the following additional facts.
