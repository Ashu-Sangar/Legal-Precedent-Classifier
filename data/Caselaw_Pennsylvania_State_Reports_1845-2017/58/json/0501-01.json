If the goods are such as would be liable to distress, in case the rent were due, the landlord can claim this proportion of his rent out of the proceeds of the sale upon the execution: West v. Sink, 2 Yeates 274; Binns v. Hudson, 5 Binn. 505; Morgan v. Moody, 6 W. & S. 333; Anderson\u2019s Appeal, 3 Barr 218; Case v. Davis, 3 Harris 80; Collins\u2019s Appeal, 11 Casey 83. The words \u201c liable to the distress of the landlord\u201d do not mean that the rent must be due and ripe for distress, but have reference to the liability of the goods themselves, as a subject of distress: Morgan v. Moody, supra; Bromley v. Hopewell, 2 Harris 402; Moss\u2019s Appeal, 11 Casey 166. The doctrine of apportionment, as applied to the 83d section of the Act of 1836, has been denied in other cases as unfounded in principle: Prentiss v. Kingsley, 10 Barr 120; Purdy\u2019s Appeal, 11 Harris 97; Bank v. Wise, 3 Watts 394. But the doctrine of stare decisis requires adherence to it in the case before the court.\nJudgment affirmed.",

The words \u201c liable to the distress of the landlord\u201d do not mean that the rent must be ripe for distress; but they refer to the liability of the goods themselves as a subject of distress.\n3.

Read, J., absent.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin county: No. 72, to May Term 1868.\nThis was an amicable action and case stated, filed August 12th 1867, in which J. A. Eyster was plaintiff, and Caspar Wickey was defendant.\nThe agreed facts were, that the plaintiff leased a house and lot in Chambersburg to one Monyer for one year, from the 1st day of April 1867, at the rent of $425, payable quarterly. On the 27th of May 1867, the defendant issued execution against Mon-yer, and on the same day the sheriff levied on Monyer\u2019s goods on the premises leased to him by the plaintiff. The sale of the goods realized $269.84. The plaintiff gave notice to the sheriff that he claimed out of the proceeds of sale $70.82, the amount of rent due at the time of the levy. This ease was stated for the opinion of the court whether the plaintiff was entitled to receive his claim from the sheriff.\nThe court entered judgment for $70.82, and on a writ of error by the defendant he assigned the entering of judgment for error.\nL. S. Clark, for plaintiff in error,\nreferred to Act of June 16th 1836, \u00a7 83, Pamph. L. 777, Purd. 438, pl. 47; West v. Sink, 2 Yeates 274; Binns v. Hudson, 5 Binn. 505; Lichtenthaler v.
