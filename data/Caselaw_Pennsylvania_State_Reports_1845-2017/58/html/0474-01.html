Frank Chorpenning was agent of the defendant on the western end of the line, “ to attend to the transportation of the mail, and his other business at the Salt Lake end of the route; to provide horses, provisions for horses and men, and other necessaries at the several stations at the eastern end of the route, to employ and discharge men, keep the books, and act as agent generally in regard to everything connected necessarily with the defendant’s business.” The plaintiff was employed by Frank Chorpenning. On January 1st 1869 the defendant entered into an agreement with D. M. Taft in relation to the sale of goods in California, and on the same day gave him a letter of instructions, saying, amongst other things, “ on your arrival in California you will, at the earliest moment, call on my brother, Dr. Frank Chorpenning, and place in his hands the package directed to him and in your possession. If satisfactory negotiations are made with the drafts sent to him, you will assist him in making the purchases of goods, wagons, &amp;c., after which you will repair with the goods, <em>&amp;c., </em>to Los Angelos in company with the doctor or such person as he may send with you, and then purchase mules,” &amp;c. * * “In all your expenditures you will furnish the clerk or assistant such necessary vouchers or insight as will enable him to make correct and proper entries of the same. This you will also do in- making sales of the goods on the way out.” * * * “ After all shall have been disposed of, the original investment shall be drawn out. All expenses attending the purchase, transportation, &amp;c., paid, and the net profits divided equally between us.”</p>

It was not offered as independent evidence of the plaintiff’s claim, as it contains a stipulation for an extraordinary rate of interest without any evidence of the agent’s authority to make such a contract. If there had been no such stipulation in regard to interest it would have been competent evidence to establish the plaintiff’s demand, as it then would have been within the scope of the agent’s power as proven by Mr. Schell, and as might properly he inferred from the character of the agent’s duties; but as it is, it can only amount to a circumstance which in connection with other facts will enable you to arrive at the true amount the plaintiff is entitled to recover. It ought not, we think, to exceed the amount of-the note and legal interest thereon.”</p>

The note given by Frank for George Ohorpenning to the plaintiff below, related to the business within Frank’s agency, and was given in course of it. It was not received in evidence by the court as a note for the payment of money, but as a circumstance with the other evidence to show the fact and extent of George Chorpenning’s indebtedness to the plaintiff, and was so submitted to the jury. There was no error in this. It was clearly in connection with the other evidence an acknowledgment in writing made in the due course of Frank Chorpenning’s agency of the amount coming to the plaintiff for the services which he proved that he had performed by the direction of the agent. We are not able to discover any difference between a written and a verbal statement made by an authorized agent in the due course of the business of his employer to show the amount coming to a party entitled to be paid by him in that business^ Though a note in form, this was the only effect given to the paper by the court.</p>
