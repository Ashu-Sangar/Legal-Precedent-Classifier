The sale of the goods realized $269.84. The plaintiff gave notice to the sheriff that he claimed out of the proceeds of sale $70.82, the amount of rent due at the time of the levy.

The words “ liable to the distress of the landlord” do not mean that the rent must be due and ripe for distress, but have reference to the liability of the goods themselves, as a subject of distress: Morgan v. Moody, <em>supra; </em>Bromley v. Hopewell, 2 Harris 402; Moss’s Appeal, 11 Casey 166. The doctrine of apportionment, as applied to the 83d section of the Act of 1836, has been denied in other cases as unfounded in principle: Prentiss <em>v. </em>Kingsley, 10 Barr 120; Purdy’s Appeal, 11 Harris 97; Bank v.
