Benners, survivor of the firm of Isaac R. Benners &amp; Co., defendant. The claim was for a balance due by defendant on an invoice of fruit, contracted for in England and shipped to defendant to New York. The whole amount of the shipment was $2967.85, which was reduced to $896.95 by quercitron bark shipped to plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed to recover this balance at gold prices with interest from December 17th 1863. The only question in the case was whether it was to be paid on that basis.</p>

In the absence of any understanding to the contrary the balance was due and payable there. This being so, it was payable in the legal currency of the country, denominated pounds, shillings and pence, and the representative of gold. Of course, as any payment obtained here would be payable in legal tender notes, the value of the gold in legal tenders, with interest, would be what in amount the judgment should be. The <em>lex loci contractus </em>must control in interpreting the contract: Allshouse <em>v. </em>Ramsay, <a href="/whart/6/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Whart. 331" data-case-ids="1836942" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0331-01">6 Whart. 331</a>; Watson <em>v. </em>Brewster, 1 Barr 381, and authorities cited by the defendant in error.
