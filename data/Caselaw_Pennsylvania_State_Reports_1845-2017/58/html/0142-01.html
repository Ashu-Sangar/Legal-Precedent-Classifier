Mapother, minor children of John Mapother, deceased. The minors, together with another child, were the owners of real estate on Ilarrowgate lane, Philadelphia, subject to the interest of their mother, the widow of the decedent. On the distribution of the father’s personal estate in June of the same year, the guardian received 16 shares of Girard Bank stock and $420 of the loan of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company, as the share of each of his wards. This stock and loan, although their income was charged in the guardian’s accounts as being in his hands, had been sold by him shortly after he received it. The real estate was rented for five years by the mother and the guardian: the mother kept a school and afterwards a store, neither of which was prosperous.</p>

Another mortgage was afterwards given to a Mr.' Shoemaker, from the proceeds of which the first mortgage was satisfied. The accounts of the guardian were carried down to the time they were filed.</p>

His interference in many of their domestic concerns may have been disastrous in its results and even injudicious, but while there was evidence of great trouble incurred, there was none of fraudulent intent or action, except in the instance of securities. Disputes certainly existed between the guardian and the wards and their mother, but they seem to have been of comparatively recent date and to have arisen since the failure of the hydropathic institution. *********</p>

The grounds of exception were, that such matters were not properly chargeable to the wards, and that the board especially could not be allowed, as the wards always resided with their mother, who made, on the one hand, no such demand on them, while the children, on the other hand, assisted her in household duties and in keeping the school and the store.</p>

This course may subject him to a charge of negligence, but it will not prevent a reasonable allowance on the grounds stated, if no culpable or fraudulent intent be shown.</p>

This was intended to apply to items in the present accounts, supposed to belong to the store in Frankford.

This state of things gave rise to a protracted contest before the auditor. Almost every item of credit claimed by the guardian was disputed by the wards, and proof demanded of the handwriting of every receipt for the smallest sums. As the parties now live in Frankford, or its vicinity, and Mrs. Mapother and her daughters had resided at one time in Germantown, the witnesses had to be brought from a comparative distance, and this occasioned trouble and delay. Other causes combined to protract the proceedings, and it was not, indeed, until after the close of the regular meetings that one of the most important facts of the case was discovered. This was the sale by the guardian of the Girard Bank stock and Lehigh Loan, at a very early period of his trust. As already stated, the two wards derived from the personal estate of their father thirty-two shares of Girard Bank stock and $840 of the loan of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company. The bank stock was transferred to Dr. Lamb, individually, on the 13th of June 1837, and the Lehigh loan, on the 16th of June 1838, was transferred apparently to a purchaser. The guardian charges himself with the dividends on the bank stock from July 1837 to October 1841, and from October 1849 to the time of filing his account. Interest is also charged as received from the Lehigh Company. In one place the interest for eight years is charged in one sum, ‘ less twenty per cent, to cash,’ and in another place two years’ interest is also charged in one sum, less five per cent. The particularity of these entries was well calculated to mislead and, indeed, the heavy discount claimed, as was alleged on the orders for coal, which were at one time commonly received for interest on Lehigh loan, was made a subject of direct exception. Upon an investigation by the auditor, it was found that nearly all of these entries were purely fictitious. Except, perhaps, at the very first, Dr. Lamb never received either dividend from the bank, or interest from the company. On the contrary, he sold both stock and loan within about a year after they were transferred to him, and some of the bank stock almost as soon as it came into his possession.”</p>
