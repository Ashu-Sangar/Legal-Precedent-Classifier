The arguments by the counsel in the case took a much wider range, in which it is neither our duty nor inclination to follow them. With the wisdom of legislation a court of equity has no inore to do than a court of -la,w. It would be to usurp the province of another department of the government. The legislature have seen fit by the Act of April 23d 1861 (Pamph. L. 410), to allow any railroad company to purchase and hold the stock of any other railroad company, without limit, and it follows that by becoming the owners of a majority of the stock one railroad company may legitimately control the operations of another. Whether a court of equity will not interpose in this state under its broad powers “ for the supervision and control of corporations ” to prevent such control from being exercised for the benefit of the controlling body in utter disregard of the rights and interests of the other stockholders, is a question which does not arise in this case. The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company are the lawful owners of seven thousand three hundred and seventeen shares of the stock of the East Pennsylvania Railroad Company. They stand before this court with as strong an equity to call upon it to protect them in their rights as stockholders, as if they were that many individual stockholders. If a court of equity can stretch out the strong arm of injunction to prevent regulations and management looking solely to the benefit of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Qompany, to the injury and destruction of the East Pennsylvania Railroad Company, that object cannot be effected by suffering the minority of the stockholders to elect the board of directors and thus usurp the entire control and management themselves.</p>

One of the terms was “that interest at the rate of six per cent, shall be paid semi-annually, on the first day of January and July, on all instalments paid, until the completion of the extension.” According to this stipulation, the holder of a share of the new stock, besides his proportion of the annual profits upon his instalments paid up, will be entitled to receive an additional' sum as interest. Thus if the dividend should be ten per cent, on the capital he would receive sixteen per cent., while the original stockholder would receive only ten per cent.; and this difference is to continue not merely to the period when the full amount shall be paid in on the new stock, but <em>“ </em>until the completion of said extension;” making it evidently the interest of the new stockholders, holding a majority of the stock, that it should never be fully completed. It was urged, indeed, on the part of the plaintiffs, that the profits of the road must be divided equally to all the shares of stock, and not by a percentage upon the amounts paid in. That, however, would be too gross an inequality and monstrous an injustice to be ever tolerated in a court of law or equity. But upon the only fair and reasonable construction which can be given to the terms of the charter and of the subscription, it cannot be denied that the holders of the new stock have a real and valuable advantage or preference over the old. The stock so issued does not stand, as the Act of 1865 contemplates, in all respects upon the footing of the original stock. The resolution of the stóckholders authorizing an increase of the capital stock evidently intended no such preference, and the Act of 1867, in conferring on the president and directors power to determine “ in what manner and by whom the same shall be subscribed,” certainly did not authorize them under such a general resolution of the stockholders to create a preferred stock.</p>

But this cannot avail. The question presented on this appeal is whether the subscribers were entitled to vote at the election of January 13th 1868. If the stock was unlawful then, it would not help them even if it could now be legalized by such a waiver. The decree awarding the preliminary injunction was right and must be affirmed. We are not now called on to make a final decree, or to grant or refuse the prayer#of the bill that the said issue of twenty thousand shares of stock may be decreed to be illegal, null and void, and that the certificates thereof may be delivered up and cancelled.</p>
