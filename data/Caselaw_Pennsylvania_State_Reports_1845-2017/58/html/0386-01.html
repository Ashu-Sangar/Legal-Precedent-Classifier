Both parties claim to hold title under Samuel Kohr. The testimony proves that in 1856 he was possessed of the house nowin dispute; that in the year 1857 he conveyed it to Abraham B. Landis, who afterwards transferred the same to Maria Kohr, the wife of Samuel Kohr. On the part of the plaintiff it is alleged that this sale of Kohr to Landis, and by him to his sister, was a fraudulent transaction, and void as to the creditors of Samuel Kohr. In order to have a proper understanding of this case, it will be necessary to refer to the facts, which may be calculated to throw light upon the subject before us. Especially is this neeessai'y in a case like this, when there is an allegation of fraud; because to establish a charge of that kind, and make out a complete chain, to carry conviction to the minds of the jury, it frequently depends upon a number of links. I shall therefore refer to some of those facts.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b388-14" data-blocks='[["BL_388.14",388,[290,2246,1162,173]],["BL_389.1",389,[195,426,1163,347]]]'>[“ On the 30th of March 1846, Jacob Bard conveyed to Samuel Kohr in consideration of $1400, 5 acres of land in East Hemp-field township, in this county, and on the 1st April 1857, Samuel Kohr conveyed the property to George Beimsderfer in considera<a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>tion of $2800. The defendant, for the purpose of showing that Samuel Kohr had money in his hands belonging to his wife Maria Kohr, gave evidence that at the time the property was purchased from Bard, the purchase-money was furnished by the father of Mrs. Kohr, amounting to $1400, that it was expressly agreed, and so declared by her father to be an advancement to her, that she was to have the property, and that it was to be held for her by her husband.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b389-6" data-blocks='[["BL_389.6",389,[196,769,1163,263]]]'>“ Now if this was the case, if this is clearly established to your satisfaction, then a resulting trust, vested in the wife, and such resulting trust, or if the property was sold afterwards, the proceeds of such sale, would belong to the wife, and she would have a right to claim the proceeds of her husband and ask him to secure her for the same.]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b389-7" data-blocks='[["BL_389.7",389,[196,1032,1167,1280]]]'>
      <em>“ </em>But it is said that there were such circumstances connected with this sale, as furnish unmistakeable badges of fraud, and go to show that this property of Bard was not purchased for the use of the wife, and in support of this it is stated that the title was made to Samuel Kohr, that he had occupied or had the use of the same, that when it came to be sold it was advertised as the property of Samuel Kohr, and that she received a fee for signing the deed, made to Beimsderfer, and that if any money was paid by her father at the time of the purchase it was a gift to the daughter. Now if you are satisfied of the facts, and that it was a gift made to the daughter and the husband received it as such, the wife could not, as the law stood at that time, reclaim it from her husband. But if the property was bought for the use of the daughter, with money received from her father for that purpose, and her husband held the same in trust for her, she would be entitled not only to that property, as I stated before, but also to any advance made out of the same. As the law stands now, all money received by the wife belongs to her; she can hold it independently of her husband and he cannot take it from her. But even before the existence of the Married Woman’s Law, property could be purchased for a married woman by a friend with her money, and if that was the case here and the husband had the title made to him, she would have the use of it. I shall now also refer to the other conveyances, given in evidence in this case, and particularly to the conveyance made by Henry Kurtz to Samuel Kohr in 1856 : this was before the sale made to Beimsderfer of the Bard property yhich was on the 1st April 1857 ; this conveyance of Kurtz to Kohr was in his own name; whether he held this property in trust for her or not, it appears to me is not material in the present aspect of the case.</p>

    <p id="b392-6" data-blocks='[["BL_392.6",392,[274,658,1155,206]]]'>The plaintiff in his cross-examination of Kohr does not appear to have put any questions to him relative to his interest growing out of his supposed connection with the indemnity-bond given by his brother, but to have relied on his exception to the ruling of the court.</p>
    <p id="Agl" data-blocks='[["BL_392.7",392,[274,874,1156,206]]]'>The next is to the testimony given by Kohr in ■ relation “ to conversations and agreements between himself and his wife during the existence of the married relation.” The exception was taken to the offer by the defendant to prove by the witness the facts stated in it.</p>
    <p id="b392-8" data-blocks='[["BL_392.8",392,[273,1090,1158,642]]]'>The offer was to prove an advancement by his father-in-law to his daughter, the wife of the witness, he at the same time promising to hold it for <em>her; </em>that in the sjoring of <em>1857 he and his wife </em>conveyed this property for $2800 ; that this conveyance was made with the consent of Mrs. Kohr upon the witness promising to hold for her and secure the amount of the purchase-money; that in 1856 Mrs. Kohr received from the estate of her then deceased father over $1100, and that her mother gave her as an advancement over $500, both of which sums she also placed in the hands of her husband, Samuel Kohr, upon the promise to secure and repay her; that all those sums were expended in the purchase and improvement of the property in dispute; and that the conveyance of the 4th April 1857, to A. B. Landis, was in'trust, and the conveyance of A. B. Landis June 6th 1857, was in performance of his engagement to his wife.</p>
    <p id="b392-9" data-blocks='[["BL_392.9",392,[274,1731,1156,342]]]'>Now out of the whole of this offer, the only portions which could have been communications between man and wife are the promises to secure the advancement and its proceeds and the subsequent sums of the wife’s property, received after her father’s death' for her. All the rest is a simple statement of facts. No part of the offer bears any mark of a confidential communication never to be disclosed by either husband or wife although the marriage relation be dissolved by the death of either.</p>
    <p id="b392-10" data-blocks='[["BL_392.10",392,[274,2072,1157,292]]]'>“The prohibition,” says Judge Rogers, in Cornell-v. Vanartsdalen, 4 Barr 374, “where she is a competent witness, being divested of all interest, extends to confidential communications, or such as come to her knowledge from her domestic relation. In the case in hand it is difficult to imagine in what respects any confidential communication is divulged or any domestic confidence abused.”</p>

In Hitner’s Appeal the evidence excluded was cohabitation, a matter entirely confined to the husband and wife, and upon this point two of my brethren. dissented, and I am certainly not willing to extend it to the present case. ’ There is nothing in the 1st error assigned, nor in any of the errors not already noticed. Judgment affirmed.</p>
