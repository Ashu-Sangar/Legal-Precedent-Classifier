Her dower and her share of the personal estate thus taken are paramount and prior to the will, which in such case only operates upon the real estate subject to her dower and upon the personal estate left after her share is taken out. In case therefore of a deficiency of the remaining personal estate to pay all the legacies, there must be an abatement of all the general legacies proportionally, unless some priority is established, the onus being upon any one claiming it. The claim of dower settles itself, and the case most nearly resembling that relating to the personal estate is the provision made by the 15th section of the Act of the 18th April 1833, in the case of a widow married or a child born after a will made and not provided for in such will, in regard to whom such testator shall be deemed and construed to die intestate, and such <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>widow shall be entitled to such purparts, shares and dividends of the estate, real and personal, of the deceased as if he had actually died without any will.</p>

In Pennsylvania there is no such provision in relation to the payment to the widow electing to take her share under the intestate law, instead of the bequests or devises under the will of her husband. The legacies to the three daughters must therefore be paid out of the personal estate, and there being a deficiency of it caused by the election of the widow, the question raised by these appeals is whether these legacies have a priority of other dispositions of that fund, and must be first paid in- full, without any abatement, which is the position assumed by them, and upon which ground they ask a reversal of the decree of the Orphans’ Court so far as regards their legacies.</p>
