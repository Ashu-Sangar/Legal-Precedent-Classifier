It is too plain for argument that the stockholder of a corporation cannot maintain an action against either directors or other persons for a wrong to the corporation. There is no privity to sustain <em>the </em>action. The creditor of a corporation might as well do so. Indeed he would have a better right, for the damages suffered by the corporation ought to be applied, when recovered, to the payment of its debts before being divided or distributed among the stockholders. It seems hardly necessary to cite cases for so plain a proposition. Yet in the struggles of injured stockholders for redress, this has been attempted and failed: Smith <em>v. </em>Hurd, <a href="/mass/53/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="12 Met. 371" data-case-ids="1976768" data-case-paths="/mass/53/0371-01">12 Met. 371</a>; Allen <em>v. </em>Curtis, <a href="/conn/26/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="26 Conn. 456" data-case-ids="525382" data-case-paths="/conn/26/0456-01">26 Conn. 456</a>; Hersey <em>v. </em>Yeazie, <a href="/me/24/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="24 Me. 9" data-case-ids="663095" data-case-paths="/me/24/0009-01">24 Maine 9</a>. The plaintiff’s counsel have in effect recognised this in the form of <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>their pleading. This action is only sustainable as an action for a deceit against several persons. Nothing in the whole course of the law seems better settled than that to maintain such an action it must appear that plaintiff knew and relied upon the representations alleged to be false and fraudulent. We might cite for this every case from Pasley <em>v. </em>Freeman, 3 T. R. 51, down, but it will be enough to refer to the decisions of our own Supreme Court in Huber <em>v. </em>Wilson, 11 Harris 178; Harris <em>v. </em>Tyson, 12 Id. 347. Justice Wightman, in one of the English cases cited and relied on by plaintiff’s counsel (5 Ell. &amp; B. 867), says of such an action, ‘ All the essentials for an action for false representation are here. The representation is untrue; it is known by the persons making it to be untrue; it is calculated to induce the plaintiff to act; and he believing it, is induced to act accordingly.’ There are authorities, no doubt, to be found to support the position that the representation need not be made directly to the plaintiff: Ger-hard <em>v. </em>Bates, 2 Ell. &amp; B. 476, and the American cases cited in the note to the same case, 75 E. C. L. R. 491; but it must be affirmatively shown to have come to the plaintiff’s knowledge, and to have induced him to give the credit which has resulted in the loss. As Gibson, C. J., expresses it, <em>1 </em>a constructive deceit is a new thing under the sun:’ Bokee <em>v. </em>Walker, 2 Harris 141. There was hpre no evidence whatever that the plaintiff knew of the false and fraudulent representations made by defendants, and if he did not know he could not have been deceived by them. The nearest approach to evidence of knowledge is the certificate of shares. It is argued that the plaintiff may be presumed to know that by the law of its organization, the corporation was forbidden to issue shares for less than their par value, and the certificate on its face, therefore, is a representation of the fact that the company had received the full par for the stock. This is rather a remote inference, and the strong presumption is the other way, from the fact that only four months after the organization of the company he paid but one dollar and twenty-five cents a share for the stock when it called for five dollars. However, the answer is, that there was no evidence that plaintiff ever saw a certificate till after he had bought the stock and it was transferred to him. Before that he could not have seen his own certificate, for it was not in existence. No doubt he inquired of his vendor how much had been called in on the stock, and might have been told in good faith that all that had been paid in was one dollar a share. It is urged, however, that the certificate which was recorded according to law, was a publication to the world of the facts set forth in it, that the plaintiff must be presumed to have consulted the record before he purchased, and therefore to have been deceived. The judge below so charged the jury, having reserved the question. But what was there in the Act of Assembly to raise any presumption that <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>the plaintiff saw and relied on it ? It was plainly intended to give information of the facts, hut its object went no further. If, in truth, representations of the character complained of had come to the plaintiff’s ears, he could not have been precluded from recovering by showing that the recorded certificate contained a statement of the exact truth. It no more raised a presumption either in law or fact of the plaintiff’s knowledge, than would the posting up of the certificate in the company’s office, or on the corners of the streets. Nor was it near so strong in point of fact as would have been the publication of it in a newspaper, proved to have been taken and read by the plaintiff. It would be monstrous to say that such a publication should be evidence against a party to visit him with notice. How, then, could it be evidence for him of knowledge ? It cannot be inferred that a party reads all the contents of any newspaper he may choose to take: Belts-hoover <em>v. </em>Blackstock, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%2026" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Watts 26">3 Watts 26</a>. As experience of the common course of human actions is the mother of all presumptions, it would fall more within it to hold that the plaintiff read the publication in his newspaper than that he sent to Venango county to examine the records. We think there was neither presumption of law nor of fact to be submitted to the jury that there, was any knowledge by plaintiff of the alleged false and fraudulent representations, and if he did not know of them, he, of course^ was ■not deceived.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="AM0" data-blocks='[["BL_130.6",130,[277,1431,1162,986]],["BL_131.1",131,[208,434,1165,1164]]]'>“ I have examined with great care every case which has been •cited to us by the plaintiff’s counsel as sustaining the action. Though there are some dicta in his favor, there is no decision. In Adamson <em>v. </em>Jarvis, 4 Bingh. 66, there was no question of plaintiff’s knowledge. He had, as auctioneer and agent of the defendant, sold the goods of a third person and paid over the money to defendant, and was afterwards mulcted in damages to the party injured. The action for the false and fraudulent representation by defendant of the goods as his was held to be maintainable. The general language of 0. J. Best, which is here relied on, is to be qualified by the facts of the case when he says, ‘ He who affirms either what he does not know to be true or knows to be false, to another’s prejudice and his own gain, is, both in morality and law, guilty of falsehood, and must answer in damages.’ Scott <em>v. </em>Dixon, 1 Ellis •&amp; Ellis 1099, was the case of a false and fraudulent report made to .shareholders, printed for general circulation ; and part of the case was that plaintiff procured one of these reports and bought his stock ■on the faith of it. Gerhard <em>v. </em>Bates, 2 Ell. &amp; Bl. 478, was a ■demurrer to a declaration which alleged certain false and fraudulent representations made in a public advertisement, and that defendants by means thereof induced the plaintiff to purchase his shares. Denton <em>v. </em>The Great Northern Railway Co. 5 Ell. &amp; BI. 860, was an action against the defendants for a false and fraudu<a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>lent representation in their time-table, by which plaintiff had suffered damage. It was a fact in the case that the plaintiff had consulted the time-table before he took his passage. In Wontner <em>v. </em>Shairp, 4 M., Or. &amp; Sc. 404, it is expressly stated, that the plaintiff saw the notice which contained the alleged false representations. Bagshaw <em>v. </em>Seymour, Bagshaw <em>v. </em>Lake, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20C.B.%20903" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="18 C.B. 903">18 C. B. 903</a>; in the House of Lords, 4 C. B. N. S. 873. In consequence of the falsehood of the defendants a committee of the stock exchange inserted the stock in an official list, which was made up from reports by the officers. It is stated expressly that the plaintiff saw the name of the stock inserted on the list, and bought on the faith of it. In Bedford <em>v. </em>Bagshaw, 4 Hurlstone &amp; Norman 537, it appeared that the plaintiff was induced to purchase in consequence of the alleged fraud. Barnes <em>v. </em>Pennell, 2 Clark &amp; Finnelly’s Appeal Cases, N. S. 479, was a Scotch appeal in the House of Lords. It was a proceeding to make the directors of a corporation liable for false and fraudulent representation; and Lord Campbell said, in the course of his opinion, ‘ It must be shown that the purchaser of these shares was induced to purchase them by the deceit of the directors.’ Cazeaux <em>v. </em>Mali, 25 Barbour 578, arose on demurrer to the complaint or declaration. It-alleged that the plaintiff was influenced by the alleged fraud. Judge Mitchell, after having laid down the proposition that ‘ the representation must have been made to deceive the plaintiff and must have produced that effect,’ observes afterwards as to the complaint, ‘He could not have been influenced if they had not been in some way reported to him.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b131-6" data-blocks='[["BL_131.6",131,[203,1597,1159,863]],["BL_132.1",132,[278,411,1157,2016]],["BL_133.1",133,[233,443,1155,87]]]'>“ There are, however, two or three cases particularly relied on, which deserve more special notice. The first of these is Watson <em>v. </em>The Earl of Charlemont <em>et al., </em>12 Ad. &amp; Ell. N. S. 856. It was an action for money had and received, to recover back what had been paid on an alleged false and fraudulent representation. There was a public advertisement, and no evidence that the plaintiff saw it. At pp. 863, 864, there is a colloquy among the judges, which certainly strongly favors the plaintiff’s case. Lord Den-man, C. J.: ‘I think that if an untrue statement is published, which is likely to induce a party to enter into a contract, and he does so, the person who made the false statement is bound independently of any proof that the other was actually induced by it to contract.’ Coleridge, J.: ‘ As at present advised, I am of opinion that if an advertisement is put out to induce parties to enter into a certain contract, and an individual does afterwards enter into such contract, and then comes into court to complain of misrepresentation, it is no part of his case to show that he was cognisant of the advertisement. Primd facie it will be taken that he was influenced by it.’ The other two judges acquiesced. If the law is here correctly stated, then there ought to be judgment <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>for plaintiff on this reserved point. These judges did not think of submitting a question of fact without an evidence upon it to the jury. Prima facies is conclusive till evidence is given in contradiction. Rut after all this the case was decided in favor of the defendant and the plaintiff nonsuited on another ground, that there was no evidence that the defendant had received the money; lord Denman expressly disclaiming to give an opinion upon any other point discussed during the argument. This case then is certainly no authority. The next case is Wheelton <em>et al. v. </em>Hardisty, 8 Ell. &amp; El. 232. That was an action on a life policy, to which the fourth plea was that the declaration in the policy that plaintiff had not any fit since childhood, was untrue. To this plea there was what is termed an equitable replication, setting up that before the policy was entered into, defendants circulated a prospectus whereby they undertook that their policies should be unquestionable except on the grounds of fraud, and that the plaintiffs were induced to enter into the policy on the faith thereof. On the trial it appeared that such a prospectus was issued, but no proof was given that the plaintiffs saw it, or were induced by it to make the policy. There were several rules taken, and among others why a verdict should not be entered for the defendant on this equitable replication to the fourth plea, on the ground of the defect in the evidence. Erie, J., delivered the opinion of the court. On this point he said, £ The evidence of the existence of the prospectus was quite as consistent with the plaintiffs’ not knowing it or not being induced to act upon it, as of their knowing and acting upon it. The plaintiffs may very well have effected the written contract without any reference to the prospectus; and modern cases have established that where the party on whom the onus lies of proving an allegation gives evidence as consistent with one view of the case as with the other, he fails in his proof.’ Lord C. J. Campbell dissented, putting his opinion mainly on the ground that the jury might presume from the circumstances that the plaintiffs had not seen the prospectus. £ I think,’ says he, “the jury might not unreasonably infer that according to the course of business, copies of the prospectus were given to customers coming to the defendants’ place of business, and were posted up in their office so as to be seen by all who dealt with them, the object of the defendants evidently being that the prospectus should be known as generally as possible.’ £ If they saw and read the prospectus, the next inference would almost be inevitable that the plaintiffs were induced to effect the policy with the defendants by the encouraging allegation that it would be unquestionable if they practised no fraud in obtaining it.” Judgment was, however, entered for the defendants on the fourth plea and the equitable replication. The case was removed to the Exchequer Chamber, but on this part of the judgment below that court pronounced no <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>opinion. This then is an authority for the defendant, and not for the plaintiff.</p>

      <em>“ </em>There was another case referred to in the argument, Lang-ridge <em>v. </em>Levy, 2 M. &amp; W. 519. Defendant had sold a gun warranted or represented to he of a particular make. The person who bought it stated at the time that it was for the use of his son. The latter, who suffered an injury from it, brought the action. It is unnecessary to examine the grounds upon which Baron Parke put the decision of that case. It is enough for our present purpose to notice that the plaintiff is stated to have known of the representation. In Thomas <em>v. </em>Winchester, 2 Selden 396, defendant had placed a false label on a bottle containing poison, and it came through several hands to plaintiff. It is plain from the case that the plaintiff saw the label on the bottle before he swallowed its contents. In both these cases the question discussed was whether there was sufficient privity between, the plaintiff and defendant.</p>

Indeed, if every shareholder of stock in an oil company, whose stock has fallen to zero, can maintain an action against the projectors, who have pocketed large gains by the sale of oil territory to the company, and made representations to induce the public to'confide in the stock, which were not true, we may expect a very large crop of such actions. The plaintiff and others in the same situation are not, however, without remedy, and that a simple, complete and full one. An action in the name of the corporation at law will .lie.

This essential was attempted to be supplied by presumptions; one to stand as a postulate, and another as the inference. This is not admissible: Douglass <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 11 Casey 446; and is the substance of the ruling of Erie, C. J., in Common Bench in Wheelton <em>v. </em>Hardisty, 8 El. &amp; Bl. 232. I cannot well conceive of a case where a presumption of fact can ever be drawn from presumptions of the same kind. The practical operation of the theory in this particular case is, that it is to be presumed that the plaintiff must have seen and inspected the certificate of organization of the company, either in the auditor-general’s or recorder’s office, and by its false presentation he is to be presumed to have been induced to purchase the stock in question. Neither one nor other of these propositions asserts a natural or even a very probable result. They are not such presumptions as to induce the belief that it would be most likely that the plaintiff would examine the certificate before purchasing. That would depend on many things — amongst others, the business habits of the man, and his convenient opportunity. The paper itself, if seen, would hardly, if in proper form, have held out any peculiarly lively inducements to buy. A much greater probability is, that the plaintiff purchased the oil stock because such stocks were just then in great demand. In . fact that is the only inference that can reasonably be drawn from the testimoqv of Riddle, his vendor. This shows that he simply wanted oil stock, and he sold him the stock, with some others, without inquiry by him in regard to the character of the company, or how its shares were going in market, or any representation in regard to it whatever. As he asked for Hubert oil stock, and not <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>for Olive Branch, it does not appear that he knew of the existence of that company until that moment. He bought without inquiry. These facts show that the presumption of examination of the organization by plaintiff, if otherwise good for anything, would in this instance be very unreliable. But on this point it is well settled that the representations which will entitle a party to, recover on the groüñd~oi a deceirmust'be'bothmlse and iraiU “witiThis money: Huber <em>v. </em>Wilson, 11 Harris 178; Harris <em>v. </em>Tyson 12 <a href="/mass/40/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="23 Pick. 108" data-case-ids="2044361" data-case-paths="/mass/40/0108-01">Id.</a> 347 Nothing like that was shown.</p>

The notice that our brother Sharswood took of the eases on this point in his opinion in deciding the reserved question, however, is a sufficient vindication of this position. In such cases the instrument., must not only be fraudulent in its representations^ but intended to defraud the plamtlfflir life plamactiorTas this.

If the defendants, acting as agents for the corporation, purchased land at one price, and transferred it for a greater, to the company, this was a fraud on the company which it alone could redress. The allegation and proof of a purchase of the realty by the defendants at $12,500 in cash, and $3000 worth of stock, would not advance the plaintiff’s case. He did not connect his loss with this act, but with another cause, viz., that the land was not oil territory — had no oil on it. It was not on account of the realty as such he bought the stock, but because he presumed its product would make it valuable. In that he was mistaken. He is entitled to his proportion of the capital, and this he must get from the company. It must collect whatever is due to it, or has been wrongfully taken from it, in order to make distribution in winding up. If it can sue for this alleged fraud of its agents, the plaintiff cannot, and that it can admits of no doubt, and needs no authority to prove. Perhaps we ought to say that Mr. McMurray, one of the above-named defendants, was acquitted below of all blame, and any remarks in regard to the alleged fraua on the company by others of the defendants do not apply to- him; nor do we say there was intentional fraud on the part of the others; but if <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>the facts are as stated, their acts operated as a fraud.
