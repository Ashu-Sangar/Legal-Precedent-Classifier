This power is not disputed. What shall be the test of want of constitutional sanction, is a question of more or less difficulty in all cases involving it. It is usual on the part of those who insist on the constitutionality of any given statute, to claim that it must be regarded as constitutional, unless expressly prohibited by some provision in the constitution. In other words, in construing the constitution of the state, whatever is not expressly denied to the legislative power is possessed by it. The opposite of this rule, I may remark, is the rule of construction of the Federal Constitution. I assent to this, but not that the inhibitions of the constitution must be always express. They are equally effective, and not less to he regarded, when they arise by implication, and this is the case when the legis<a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>lative provision is repugnant to some provision of the constitution, <a href="/watts/9/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="9 Watts 200" data-case-ids="1849949" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0200-01">9 Watts 200</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20424" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 424">5 W. &amp; S. 424</a>; 12 S. &amp; R. 330; 3 Casey 444; <em><a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20403" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="5 Wright 403">5 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20403" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="5 Wright 403">Wright 403</a>. To illustrate this idea: The executive power of the state under the constitution is lodged in a governor, and the legislative in a senate and house of representatives. It would be manifestly repugnant to these provisions of the constitution if an Act of Assembly should provide for the election of two executives, or two senates and houses of representatives at the same election; yet it would be unconstitutional only by implication, there being no express prohibition on the subject. So in regard to qualification for office. . An act which should require a residence in the state for ten years, instead of three, or an age of fifty years, or freehold estate, in order to be eligible to the office of representative, would be void for repugnancy, because differing from the qualification expressed in the constitution, and would be so only by necessary implication; necessary to keep legislation within the paramount rules of the constitution. The expression of one thing in the constitution, is necessarily the exclusion of things not expressed. This I regard as especially true of constitutional provisions, declaratory in their nature. The remark of Lord Bacon, “.that, as exceptions strengthen the force of a general law, so enumeration weakens, as to things not enumerated,” expresses a principle of common law applicable to the constitution, which is always to be understood in its plain, untechnical sense: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Clark, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 127" data-case-ids="481758" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0127-01">7 W. &amp; S. 127</a>.</p>

    <p id="b347-6" data-blocks='[["BL_347.6",347,[258,571,1160,936]]]'>For the orderly exercise of the right resulting from these qualifications, it is admitted that the legislature must prescribe necessary regulations, as to the places, mode and manner, and whatever else may be required, to insure its full and free exercise. But this duty and right, inherently imply, that such regulations are to be subordinate to the enjoyment of the right, the exercise of which is regulated. The right must not be impaired by the regulation. It must be regulation purely, not destruction. If this were not an immutable principle, elements essential to the right itself might be invaded, frittered away, or entirely exscinded under the name or pretence of regulation, and thus would the natural order of things be subverted by making the principle subordinate to the accessory. To state is to prove this position. As a corrollary of this, no constitutional qualification of an elector can in the least be abridged, added to, or altered, by legislation or the pretence of legislation. Any such action would necessarily be absolutely void and of no effect. We hold, therefore, what indeed was not expressly denied, that no regulation can be valid which would have the effect to increase the district, or state residence, prior to the time of an offer to exercise the right of an elector, or which would impose other or additional taxation or assessments, than those provided in the constitution.</p>

Before proceeding to this, however, I must remark, that the regulations in the act are materially distinct and different in the other portions of the state from those proposed and intended for this city. I have not time or room in this opinion to point them out. A very cursory reading of the act will suffice to show it. In the city they are more complex, and consequently render the chances of registration, in my opinion, more difficult and precarious. For myself, I think a material diversity of regulation, not the result of locality merely, but of policy, between different parts of the state, is itself, a violation of the guaranty in the bill of rights, that <em>“ </em>elections shall be free and equal” to all those possessed of the designated qualifications. If policy, and not locality or physical necessity, be allowed as reasons for a great diversity of regulation, the political bias of a section might become the pretext for the complication of regulations, in order to enjoy the rights of an elector, so as to be destructive of the right itself. If all the citizens are within the equal protection of the provision quoted, that <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>“ elections shall he free and e,qual,” then they are subject only to such diversities as grow out of locality alone, in my judgment, not to increased trouble and expense in establishing their qualifications or uncertainty in doing it.</p>

We are not prepared to say at this time, that they might not be compelled to assemble and act. It is not likely, however, that they would ever refuse.</p>
    <p id="b348-7" data-blocks='[["BL_348.7",348,[252,926,1151,511]]]'>It is provided in the act, that the board of canvassers in the several districts, shall not be constituted all of one political party. As there is no obligation on any one to adhere for any definite length of time to a professed preference for any political party, the rule or qualification is utterly uncertain in its nature, and, to a great extent, in practice. In times of great excitement and political changes, the rule would exist but in name, while in fact it might not exist at all. It is a proffer of fairness so far as diversity of political sentiment is concerned, without the slightest assurance that it will be so in fact. We cannot, however, correct unwise legislation, and we see nothing in it repugnant to any constitutional provision and it is not expressly prohibited.</p>

When this list shall have been completed, it is to be subscribed and sworn to by the canvassers, or a majority, and three copies made, one to be delivered to the city commissioners, one to the board of aldermen, and the third to be retained by the board of canvassers. This list the city commissioners are, on its receipt, to have immediately printed and posted in at least two places in the district, with a <em>“ </em>notice thereon, that the boards of canvassers will meet at the places of holding the general elections, on the twelfth day preceding the general election day, and for two days then next ensuing, for the purpose <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>of revising, correcting, adding to and subtracting from and completing the list.” It will be observed that in making out the primary list, only those citizens are to be registered who are known to the board to be qualified electors <em>“ </em>who have voted at some preceding election.” How this fact is to become known to the board other than personally, is not provided for, and, of course, is left to them to determine. Doubtless it would naturally be construed as resting in their personal knowledge exclusively, as they are bound to make oath to the list as the list of voters known by them. I see not how any other construction is possible, in the absence of any authority to receive evidence of the fact from any other source. On this construction, and I think it the true one, the primary list would necessarily be small, with every disposition to fairness on the part of the board. The personal knowledge of each member would not be likely to extend to any great number of voters; but when the concurrent knowledge of a majority is required, it is fair to presume, if they be conscientious men, that the primary list, in any district, would be but a small proportion of the actual number of constitutionally qualified voters.</p>

Notwithstanding his name might be on the list, still the act requires assessment in all such cases to complete registration. If that should be wanting the process would not be complete; he would not be entitled to vote as a necessary result. This must be so, or the required assessment of all persons whose names were to be placed on the revised list was intended for an unnecessary, idle ceremony. This we are not to suppose.

The accumulation of affidavits, not oaths merely — the attendance on the board of canvassers, it may be, day after day (for the act contemplates that there may be required three days to revise the list), in hearing applicants for registration, the necessary application by the voter to be assessed, which if made at all cannot be earlier than in the night time of <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>the last of the ten days, after the list shall have been made out; the subjection to the assessment of a tax to complete the process, whether the voter may have previously thereto been assessed, or even paid taxes or not, and the knowledge that after all this, voters will at the polls be subject to be challenged, and all that has been required and proved may have to be proved again — for the fact of registration is conclusive of nothing, it is only its absence which is conclusive, and that against the citizens — are such a succession of embarrassments, if nothing more, as to be equivalent in many cases to a denial of the right of the elector altogether; an overthrow of the guaranty of the constitution, that “ elections .shall be free.” I fully subscribe to what was said by the court in the case of Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Maxwell, 3 Casey 444: “ A law intended to take away, or unnecessarily postpone or <em>embarrass, </em>the right of election would be set aside as unconstitutional. ’ ’ This principle is effected by any unnecessary embarrassment of the rights of the elector. Nor is the evil distinguishable between the consequences of an act intended to embarrass, and one that does embarrass unnecessarily without intending it. In my judgment, this view, if there was nothing else to complain of, ought to set aside this act.</p>

They are: “ The person so claiming to be entitled to vote, shall produce at least one qualified voter of the said division as a witness, of the residence of said claimant in said division for the period of at least ten days next preceding the general election next ensuing.” The witness is to prove a fact which has transpired at the time he subscribes the oath, namely, a residence of ten days. He is not to swear to facts that might raise a presumption that the elector would reside in the district ten days immediately preceding the election, but to depose to his knowledge of actual residence; and that nobody can do unless it has taken place. If, therefore, the witness could affirm to only nine days’ residence in the district when called before the canvassers, the <em>right of registration </em>would not be made out, and although on election day the citizen may have resided nineteen days in the district, he would be deprived of his vote because not on the list.

They assume that the entire law is unconstitutional and void. The general scheme of the act is this: The aldermen of the city are constituted a board for the appointment of three persons called canvassers, who shall not all belong to any one party, for each election division of the city. It is the duty of the canvassers to meet on the first Monday in September in each year, and make out a list of all the qualified electors known to them in their respective divisions. They then subscribe and make oath to these lists. The lists are to be printed and posted in at least ten places in each election division, together with a notice of the next meeting of the canvassers to revise, correct and complete the lists. That meeting is required to be on the twelfth, eleventh and tenth days next preceding the day of the general election, and is to continue from 10 o’clock A. M. until 7 o’clock p. M. of each day. At this meeting it shall be the duty of the canvassers to add to their lists the names of all who claim to be registered as .voters, on proof by one witness, himself a qualified elector, of the residence of the claimant within the division, for a period not [later than ten days before the day of the election; and on the oath of the claimant himself, of the time and place of his nativity, that he is a citizen, and has resided in the state one year, or in case of removal and return, six months previous to the day of the ensuing election; and also that he has not moved into the division for the purpose of voting therein, and <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>has <em>not been </em>registered as a voter elsewhere. Thus the law provides for an impartial commission to register the voters, for ample time and opportunity for each elector to be registered down to the last business hour of the last day, when a voter may move into a district and claim his vote. The list as first made must contain all the known voters, and being made on oath, of course will be taken from proper and legal sources of information, to wit, the last list of voters and former register, and must be finally revised, corrected and completed on proper evidence. The board of aldermen, men generally of standing, and elected from all parties, are not likely to appoint canvassers of bad character. The canvassers being reputable resident citizens, not confined to any one party, and acting under the sanction of an oath to the truth of' their lists, are not likely to fail to make them correctly; and if from accidental causes a few legal yoters should be omitted, it is more than compensated by the multitude of illegal yoters who are excluded. “</p>

It denies to no one any right secured to him by the constitution, and secures to the true electors, first, their own right, and then the value of their ballots, by pre- ■ venting neutralization by means of frauds. If the right of an elector be valuable, surely that system is most just which secures it from depreciation. The majority rule, when believed to be honestly administered, carries with it a moral power far beyond the sway of kings. But as a principle, it depends on the confidence begotten by it. The moment it is thought to be tainted with fraud, and the will of the true majority not faithfully expressed, distrust, dissension, and disturbance will follow. Confidence is lost, the essential principles of free government are endangered, evil passions inflamed, and peace destroyed. The remarks of the late John Sergeant, President of the Constitutional Reform Convention of 1837^ in the debate on the 3d article, are felicitous and to the point: “We could not make a system so perfect that it should do no injustice to any one in the course of its operation; but he believed, under the present system, where one man properly entitled to vote was excluded, ten men voted who were not entitled to. Do you mean to have any limit at all ? Do you intend to draw no line between your resident citizens, and vagrants and transient persons ? If not, then let the judges and inspectors of elections take every vote that is offered, even without any name at all. Let every one go and vote, first in each of the fifteen wards of Philadelphia, and afterwards in Southwark and Spring Garden.” John Sergeant was one of Philadelphia’s ablest and noblest sons.

An outline, like the frame of a house, it is unfit for use until it is built and fitted up by the carpentry of the law. The constitution declares that in elections by the citizens, every white freeman (having the prescribed qualifications) shall enjoy the rights of an elector. But who are the citizens, and how and where shall they vote ? When, in what manner, and by whom shall their citizenship, identity and qualifications be ascertained ? All these are unwritten in the constitution, and are therefore left to legislation. Excepting the day of the general election, and the qualifications of the electors, the whole subject lies absolutely within the domain of legislative power. The entire machinery of elections, and the evidence of the identity and qualifications of electors, are now regulated by law. What is there to prevent the repeal of one system and the substitution of another ? A chief duty under our system of government, is to ascertain who are the qualified electors. It is as clear a breach of the constitution to admit unauthorized persons to vote, as to exclude legal electors. A just registry of the electors is therefore constitutional and necessary, as a proper means of identifying those who offer their votes, and “ calculated to promote peace, order, and celerity in the conduct of elections.” Being within the scope of undoubted legislative power, unless its provisions plainly and palpably (I adopt an approved form of expression) infringe the fundamental law, this court cannot arrest its execution. The nature of this proceeding demands a proper consideration of its true character. We are asked to place a judicial veto upon an entire system. No suitor is before us complaining of any provision in it affecting his own right of suffrage, but we are asked at the instance of private parties, to strangle the whole law, by restraining the board of aldermen from appointing the canvassers. This strikes down the entire system in all its parts. Who asks this to be done ? Not the board of aldermen. They have met, and are ready to proceed to perform their duty, if we will permit them.

In order to state <em>this </em>question fairly and show the groundlessness of this complaint, I shall quote this part of the law: “ Each person so claiming to be entitled to vote therein, shall produce at least one qualified voter of the said division as a witness of the residence of said claimant in the said division for the period of at- least ten days next preceding the general election then next ensuing, which witness shall take and subscribe an affidavit to the facts stated by him, which affidavit shall define clearly the residence of the person so claiming to be a voter; and the person so claiming the right to be registered, shall also take and subscribe an affidavit stating where and when he was born, that he is a citizen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and of the United States, and if a naturalized citizen, he shall also state when, where and by what court he was naturalized, and also present his certificate of naturalization for examination, unless he has been a voter in said election division for five years then next preceding the general election next ensuing ; that he has resided in this Commonwealth one year, or if formerly a citizen therein and has removed therefrom, -that he has resided therein six months next preceding the general election then next following; that he has not moved into the division for the purpose of voting therein, and that he has not been registered as a voter elsewhére; which said affidavits, both of the claimant and his witness, shall be preserved by the canvassers.”</p>
    <p id="b360-6" data-blocks='[["BL_360.6",360,[260,1480,1160,943]],["BL_361.1",361,[184,411,1167,2024]],["BL_362.1",362,[323,402,1160,1285]]]'>A fair-minded man, it seems to me, cannot fail to perceive the meaning of this provision, though awkwardly expressed. The claimant must prove his actual residence in the election division, and this residence must have existed at least ten days (the constitutional limit) before the election which is to ensue. It may be as much more as the party can prove, but it must have commenced at least ten days before the election. The canvassers are required to sit for three days in succession, the last being the tenth day before the election, and to remain in session until seven o’clock in the evening, the latest business hour, and the latest period when any one can be reasonably expected to remove into the district. The claimant has therefore until dusk of the tenth day before the election, to bring his witness, and prove his removal into the district. The purpose of the law in requiring the witness of the residence to state also, that it is for a period not less than ten days before the next election, was no doubt to prevent fraudulent proofs, by adjournment over within the ten days; or by equivocal or general expressions, which would leave the time when the residence commenced, uncertain. A fair survey of the section will show that <em>residence </em>is the subject of proof, the important fact to be clearly ascertained. The language is, “ A witness of the residence of said claimant” — and the affidavit “ shall define clearly <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>the residence of the person so claiming.” <em>The period </em>of residence plainly means the time at which it <em>dates, </em>or begins to run. The witness testifies to a residence of at least ten days previous to the election. The first meaning attributed to this clause by the plaintiffs, to wit, that the claimants shall prove a residence in -the district of ten days previous to taking the oath, is in the teeth of the words themselves, which are, <em>“ </em>For a period of at least ten days <em>next </em>preceding the <em>general election </em>then next ensuing.” How is it possible to say that a period of ten <em>days»next preceding the day </em>of election means a period of ten days <em>previous to talcing the oath. </em>The argument does not pretend to assert that the words read in this way, but that they mean this, because the witness cannot swear to a future period of time. Certainly he cannot; but for this very reason we should construe the law to mean what it evidently intends, to wit, that the residence, which he does swear to, actually existed at least ten days before the election. To assert that the legislature meant to require proof of a residence ten days before taking the oath, when the words do not say so, but do say next preceding the election, is to set up a meaning, it seems to me, and then to strike down the law for having it. No law can stand such a test, and I know no approved rule for thus interpreting statutes. The other meaning attributed to this clause, to wit, that the witness must swear to a residence of ten days between the time of taking his oath and the day of election, is plainly absurd, and therefore not to be adopted by a court, whose duty it is to interpret a law by the rules of common sense, and so as to effectuate the intention of the legislature. No man possessing ordinary intelligence could have penned this clause, with this absurd meaning. He must have known in the first place that the thing is impossible, the time not having expired, and that no witness, unless an idiot, would swear to a fact that had not yet transpired. He must have known, in the next place, that such a provision would nullify the law, and this could not have been his design. -We cannot suppose the legislature meant a thing both impossible and suicidal, especially when a very sensible and obvious meaning is presented by the words themselves. The true meaning is made more evident by the subsequent provision in the 15th section, “ That the only evidence that such person has resided in such election division for ten days preceding such election, shall be <em>the fact that his name is found thereon” </em>— to wit, the register. The fact of registration on the proof of a residence, <em>pre-existing ten days </em>before the election, is thus made conclusive evidence of continued residence in the mean time. Clearly this does not exact harder terms than the constitution requires. It substitutes registration (on the oath of a witness), made twelve, eleven, and not less than ten days before the election, for proof, on the day of election, of a continuous residence commencing ten days before. <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>It thus furnishes a legal presumption, that one having a b’onfi, fide residence in the district from the tenth to the twelfth day before the election, has continued therein until he offers his vote. This is a mere regulation of the evidence of residence, clearly within legislative power. If we follow the light of authority also, we cannot fail to interpret this law according to its true sense. Certainly we ought not to impute absurdity in order to defeat the statute. “ When the intention of the legislature or the law is doubtful, and not $lear, the judges ought to interpret the law to be what is most consonant to equity, and least inconvenient:” <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Dallas%20188" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="1 Dallas 188">1 Dallas 188</a>, citing Vaugh. 28, 285. “As to the construction of statutes, it is certain they are not always to be construed according to the letter: <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Binn.%20356" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="3 Binn. 356">3 Binn. 356</a>. “Or,” has been construed to mean “and:” <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20463" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 463">8 W. &amp; S. 463</a>. “Void,” has been held to mean “ voidable:” <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20280" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 280">2 W. &amp; S. 280</a>. And in this case Justice Sergeant said, “ But for us to hold a law unconstitutional, it must be a <em>plain </em>violation of some provision contained in the constitution.” And thus said Justice Strong, in Huber <em>v. </em>Riley, 3 P. F. Smith 315, “ It is the duty of every court to construe a statute, if possible, so, <em>ut res magis valeat quam pereat, </em>that construction of this act must be adopted, which is in harmony with the acknowledged powers of Congress.” The whole difficulty in reading the act before us, is removed by substituting the preposition “at” for “for,” reading the clause “ <em>at </em>the period of at least ten days next preceding the general election,” instead of “/or the period,” &amp;c. Nothing is more common than the misuse of prepositions and conjunctions, and, indeed, of adverbs, in all kinds of writings, statutes as well as contracts and wills. These parts of speech are the mere links of thought, and we are in the daily habit of changing such minor expressions into their correct forms, <em>ut res magis valeat quam pereat.</em>

If it means that he has resided a year or six months before the date of the oath, it would require a longer residence than the constitution prescribes. Yet the language expresses no such thought, and certainly does not mean it. It merely says, “he <em>has </em>resided one year or six months next preceding the general election,” and means simply, that the period of residence <em>runs hack </em>to a period of one year or six months before the election. The day of election is stated only for the purpose of computing the time <em>backward, </em>not forward. The registration on the tenth or twelfth day before the election, stands, <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>as before stated, for the evidence of continued residence down to the election. Indeed, I do not see how it is possible to miss the meaning of this provision.</p>
    <p id="b363-6" data-blocks='[["BL_363.6",363,[210,533,1162,944]]]'>The next objection scarcely deserves notice. On the completion of the lists of electors, a copy is to be handed to the assessors, “ who thereupon shall immediately <em>assess a tax according to law </em>upon <em>every </em>person whose name is contained in said list, and deliver the same to the city commissioners.” It is thought this will subject to double taxation. This is not correct. This act provides neither for what taxes shall be assessed nor how they shall be collected, leaving the kind of tax, the appeal, the collection and all matters relating to it, to be regulated by the general laws. The assessor is plainly remitted to the general law, to govern himself accordingly. The list is handed to him in the last of September or first of October, after the taxes of the current year have been assessed and gone into collection. He is the same assessor who is to assess the next year’s tax. The assessment is plainly, therefore, a part of the assessment of the same fall for the next year’s tax, and the evident purpose of this act is to secure the proper assessment of each registered voter every fall. It is for this reason <em>every </em>registered person is to be assessed, and the list to be returned to the commissioners, who carry it into the approaching assessment, and must take care that no one is doubly assessed; and if he be, he has his remedy by appeal, at the usual time and place.</p>
    <p id="b363-7" data-blocks='[["BL_363.7",363,[210,1478,1163,600]]]'>It is also objected that the list is handed over to the assessors too late to make the assessment ten days before the election. But as the purpose, as already stated, was to furnish a system for taxing all the electors every year, it is evident this provision was not intended to supply the means of assessment for untaxed electors in time for the ensuing election, and therefore does not supply the old law which exists for this purpose. Those, therefore, who have not paid a tax within two years, can still avail themselves of the old law, and procure themselves to be assessed ten days before the election, and thus entitle themselves to vote as heretofore. It is also to be borne in mind that the assessment is no part of the registry, and that one whose name is registered can therefore vote on any payment of taxes within the constitutional provision.</p>

The injunction should issue against the canvassers only, to restrain them from executing that portion of the law we may deem to be invalid. Clearly they have a right to make out lists, and erase and correct them by proper legal evidence. If they undertake to make witnesses swear to impossibilities, or the party to swear to a future <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>residence, or to do any illegal act, the remedy belongs to the injured party, and lies against the canvassers, and not against the aldermen. The appointment of the canvassers is clearly a valid act, and if disputable, certainly no one but the aldermen themselves can complain of the duty exacted. This is a wholesale proceeding against everybody — aldermen, councils, and city officers — as if the legislature had no power to regulate the subject of elections at all.</p>
