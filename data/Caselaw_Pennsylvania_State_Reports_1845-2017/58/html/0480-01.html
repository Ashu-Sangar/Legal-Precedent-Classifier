We are of opinion, therefore, that the plaintiffs cannot maintain their action on this covenant in the deed.</p>

It was, doubtless, supposed in this, that the insertion of the covenant in the deed fully met the requirements of the articles of agreement, providing that the land should be conveyed clear of encumbrances. There is, however, a very broad distinction between a covenant of general warranty, and a covenant against encumbrances. In the latter, where encumbrances exist, the covenant is broken as soon as entered into ; while in the former, the covenant is broken only by an eviction.</p>

If suits had been brought by the legatees under the will of Jacob Stull, and Reed, the warrantor, had been notified to defend, a judgment thereon, rendered against the plaintiffs, would, on payment thereof, have placed them in a position to maintain this action, as the law would not require them to submit to the ceremony of an actual dispossession ; but having paid the legacies voluntarily and without suit, when it is possible, if an opportunity had been afforded, the covenantor might have been able to show that the encumbrances were discharged, they are within the rule established in Patton <em>v. </em>McFarlane, 3 Penna.

Not indeed that the party need wait to be actually turned out of possession by legal process, for he may surrender when the result is plainly inevitable. In one case it was held that a judgment in ejectment by itself was not sufficient: Paul <em>v. </em>Witman, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 407" data-case-ids="1854563" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0407-01">3 W. &amp; S. 407</a>.

It is different where an action is brought to recover unpaid purchase-money. There the defendant in Pennsylvania has always been allowed to set up as an equitable defence any outstanding better title actually asserted, which would amount to a failure of consideration of the contract of purchase, whatever may be the actual covenants in the deed of conveyance. Such a defence was permitted originally because equity was always a part of the law of this state, and the defendant could avail himself as a defence of whatever matter would entitle him to relief at the hands of a chancellor. That was the principle on which was decided Steinhauer <em>v. </em>Witman, 1 S. &amp; R. 438, and the long train of authorities which have' followed in its wake.</p>

To allow him to settle outstanding claims or encumbrances without notice or suit, and then recover the amount on his covenant, would pla.ce his covenantor at great disadvantage in point of evidence, and otherwise in defending against him instead of the original claimant.</p>
