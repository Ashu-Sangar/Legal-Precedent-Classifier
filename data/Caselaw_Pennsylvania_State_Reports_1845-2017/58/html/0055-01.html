Eor if she had no known heirs or next of kin the estate must have escheated. In point of fact she has no such relations except as she traces them through her mother. The jury must therefore have decided on this question and between the same parties, that within the meaning of this act the relatives of her mother are her next of kin. But looking at the question as <em>res </em>nova, what is the proper construction of this <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>section ? The title of the act declares that its purpose is to remedy ‘ certain defects in the law for the more just transmission of estates,’ and it may aid in discovering the intent of the legislature: Dwarris on Stat. 654. With us where the title to an act is given by the framer of the statute, it may be entitled to greater weight than in England, where it is usually framed by the clerk of the House: Id. 653. Here too the title may be esteemed to have some of the qualities of a preamble, and may therefore ‘ be used as a good means for collecting the intent of the makers.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b57-6" data-blocks='[["BL_57.6",57,[211,816,1165,1630]],["BL_58.1",58,[310,431,1156,1115]]]'>“ The subjects of the several sections are distinct, indicating that the legislature designed a generally remedial statute. It should therefore be largely expounded* according to its equity and spirit, although the case be not within its letter: Brinker <em>v. </em>Brinker, 7 Barr 55; Levering <em>v. </em>Germantown Railroad, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20463" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 463">8 W. &amp; S. 463</a>; Deddrick <em>v. </em>Wood, 3 Harris 12; Dwar. 718. Such statutes may also be extended to other cases, within the same mischief and occasion of the act, though not expressly within the words and to persons besides those expressly named: Dwar. 718, 721. The old law was, that children born out of wedlock could not inherit, for two reasons: one as a penalty for the offence of which <em>they </em>were innocent; the other, as regards the father, on account of the uncertainty of ascertaining who he was. In regard to the mother, no such uncertainty could exist, and the first reason, a cruel and unjust one, alone remained. This was the mischief and it was not a ‘just transmission’ of estates, to give the property of a decedent to the Commonwealth, when there were near relatives who could be ascertained with certainty, simply because the relationship could not be traced through a marriage. The act was passed td provide a remedy for this, and it is contended for the Commonwealth, that the remedy extends no further than to allow the mother and child to take from each other. But would not this be a very partial correction of the defect of the law ? The injustice and unreasonableness of the law would operate as certainly (although more remotely, and less sensibly) on a distant relative, as on a child or a mother, and besides in' the provision for the mother and the exclusion of the other relatives, so far as the idea of penalty is involved, you lay it on the innocent and release the offender. This act, as other acts, is to have such construction as shall suppress the mischief and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for countenance of the mischief and <em>pro privato commodo, </em>and to add force and life to the cure, and remedy according to the true intent of the makers of the Act, <em>pro bono publico: </em>Heydon’s Case, 3 Rep. 7 b, and note B. to Thomas’ edition. In the opinion of the auditor, to limit the transmission of estates to the mother and daughter, would be a ‘ continuance of the mischief,’ partially at least. In support of this, it may be said that the including of the mother, as before <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>referred to, would indicate that the legislature designed mainly, if not solely, to secure certainty in finding the relatives of the decedent, and subject to this, to make no distinctions which had not heretofore been made among legitimates. We have seen that an act may be extended by its equity and spirit to persons and cases not within the words or not expressly named, if within the mischief, and if the reasoning of the auditor be correct, that the relatives of Phebe Jones are within the mischief, does the act expressly or by unavoidable implication exclude them ? The auditor can discover nothing in the act that so operates. The act declares that the mother and daughter shall inherit from each other — that is, each is to take title to the estate of the other as her £heir at law’ — which means lawful heir. Making her the lawful heir would give her not only the capacity to take, but also to transmit as lawful heir, and would determine who were her collateral as well as her lineal heirs. Miller’s Appeal, 2 P. E. Smith 113, although perhaps not strictly this case, it is supposed, goes on the principle, when it is considered that the argument for the Commonwealth (that relatives of such decedent to inherit must take directly from her and cannot take through a deceased mother) would exclude lineals of the deceased mother or daughter as well as collaterals. The auditor thinks that upon the position of the Commonwealth the concluding clause of the section would be meaningless. This clause says £ as respects said real and personal estate so taken and inherited, to transmit the same according to the intestate laws of the state.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b58-6" data-blocks='[["BL_58.6",58,[308,1545,1159,462]]]'>££ Before this act the decedent’s estate would be transmitted under the intestate laws to her own descendants. The act could not enlarge this unless it contemplated a transmission to collaterals. She could have no collateral heirs except through her mother: then if the act does not authorize a transmission through the mother, there is nothing more than before in the way of transmission. It was suggested that this clause, whatever in this respect its effect may be, acts only on the specific estate actually taken; but this seems to be a mere verbal criticism — that the spirit of the clause is to refer it to any estate authorized by it to be so taken and inherited.</p>

The object of the section, as expressed in the title to the act, was to 4 amend certain defects in the law for the more just transmission of estates.’ This object will certainly be attained if we confine the operation of the section to cases falling within its express terms. To provide that illegitimate children shall take their mother’s estate, and she take theirs, in cases of intestacy, is certainly amending a serious 4 defect in the law’ and securing a 4 more just transmission of estates.’ Let it be granted that this does not cure <em>every </em>defect touching the subject to which it relates; yet if the language used be clear, we cannot undertake to extend it, so as to cover other supposed imperfections, because we conceive that they too should have been embraced.- This would render the scope of a statute very uncertain. As was remarked <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>by Chief Justice Tilghman, in Cresoe <em>v. </em>Laidley, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Binn.%20286" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2 Binn. 286">2 Binn. 286</a>, ‘ there will be no end to difficulties if we attempt to supply the supposed omissions of the Acts of Assembly by inserting what we may suppose to have been intended by the legislature.’ But suppose the court at liberty to extend the operation of the section so as to cover <em>all1 </em>defects in the law’ touching the subject to which it relates, still is it clear that the case before us would come within its scope ? In other words, is it a ‘ defect in the law’ that it does not give the estates of illegitimate children to the kindred of the mother ? In our judgment it is not. The intestate laws are based upon the presumed desire of the intestate himself. His property is given to his kindred, commencing with those nearest in degree — ■ not because of the kinship itself, but of the affection which is presumed to have existed between him and them, and the desires and consequences growing out of it. But for this, there would be no more reason why his estate should be given to his kindred than to strangers. Justice demands that the property accumulated by the parent shall pass to his child, because it is deepest in his affections, and to it therefore he would naturally desire his property to go. But all experience attests, that between the kindred of the mother and her <em>bastard </em>child, there is <em>no affection. </em>She has committed a crime (a crime for which society has no charity), and is disgraced beyond hope. By her kindred the act is resented as one bringing shame upon them, as well as upon herself. They cast her off, and the feeling of unkindness extends beyond her to her child, even in a greater degree. <em>It </em>seems to be regarded as an ever-existing reproach,' continually reminding the community of the disgrace its mother brought upon her family. • The truth of this is strikingly illustrated in the case of this very intestate, Edith Jones, whose grandfather sought by means of a trust, to guard against the possibility of any part of his estate ever coming to his daughter’s illegitimate child. We do not therefore believe that to give the property of illegitimate children to the kindred of the mother, would be providing ‘ for a more just transmission of estates.’</p>

The counsel representing the state claims that it. has been done. Although the jury returned that the property has <em>not </em>escheated, he insists that the finding is in favor of the state, because he says the inquest is simply to ascertain the facts, and these were found in favor of his client. If it be true that a finding of the facts upon which an escheat depends, in favor of the state, will establish its title, although the jury may add that the property has <em>not </em>escheated, still we do not think the state can rest upon the return made in the case before us. An escheat occurs where one dies intestate, possessed of <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>property, without heirs or known kindred, or surviving husband or wife.

It is true the 3d section of the Act of September 29th 1787, provides that the jury shall be summoned to inquire whether the deceased left <em>‘ </em>heirs or known kindred.’ But since the Act of April 1853, relative to the same subject, the jury cannot stop at this inquiry; nor do we believe it could before. Necessarily, even in the view taken by the counsel for the state, it must determine <em>all </em>the facts upon which the question of escheat depends. We think therefore the return of the inquest held, cannot in any view that may be taken of it, be regarded as a finding in favor of the state.</p>

If it is conclusive, what becomes of the property ? If the state cannot take further action to establish its title, the court can make no distribution; and the property must remain in the hands of the administrators (supposing our view of the Act of 1855 to be correct). Eor the finding of the inquest cannot govern or influence the Orphans’ Court in determining who is entitled to take as next of kin; in this respect it is wholly unimportant.</p>

To hold that it is, in view of the fact that the jurors in such cases are without knowledge of the law, and that there is no provision for appeal to a tribunal possessing such knowledge, would seem to be unreasonable, as it would leave the state without remedy in cases of the plainest mistake. The finding is not the judgment of a court; but the answer of individuals summoned by the state itself, to inquire of certain facts, about which it desires to be informed. If the answer be favorable to the state, it binds no one in the first instance; a trial must still take place in a court of law, if any one liable to be prejudiced desire it. We do not believe it was contemplated that the finding of the inquest should be binding upon the state, while it is not upon her antagonist.

L. 368, brings the brothers and sisters of her mother or their descendants within the class of “heirs or known kindred.” This section gave capacity to the mother and child respectively to take and inherit from each other as next of kin and heirs, but it did not legitimate the child as was done by the Act of May 1857, Pamph.
