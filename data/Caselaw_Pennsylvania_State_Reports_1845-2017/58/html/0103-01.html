If this were a sale, then the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for the lost tobacco, and at the price of 14 cents per pound, the flood having rendered impossible the performance of the latter part of the agreement, which therefore becomes simply a sale for a fixed price.</p>

The counsel for the defendant, it is true, states that the defendant was the creditor of the plaintiff; if so, it makes the sale more evident, because, if it were not so, the plaintiff would lose the tobacco and still remain liable.to the defendant, supposing the defendant to have been his creditor to the full value of the tobacco, and if it is a bailment or trust, then the plaintiff is still liable for that amount, having lost the very tobacco which would be said, according to the defendant’s theory, to be simply a trust or agency on the part of the defendant.</p>
