The suspension of the work continued until May 25th 1865, when it was resumed and completed. They denied that the track is a nuisance to the property mentioned in the bill, or that it will be injui’ious to business, or diminish the value of the property. They averred that the track is required for their business, and that they cannot avail themselves of their river front without crossing William street. For their power to construct the track, they referred to their act of incorporation of April 4th 1833, with its supplements of April 13th 1846 and Apx-il 12th 1864, and to municipal ordinances of the district of Richmond, March 1st 1854, and of the city of Philadelphia, November 21st 1860; that a plan for crossing William street at grade, and one by trestlework, were submitted to the city surveyor, who made no objection to the crossing at grade. The act of incorporation of April 4th 1833, authorized the defendants to make a road with as many tracks as they may deem necessary, terminating at some suitable point in or near Philadelphia ; also, to enter upon and occupy all land on which the railroad, its depots, &amp;c., may be located, or which may be necessary for engine, water stations, or any other purpose necessary or useful in the construction and repair of the railroad. The Act of April 13th <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>1846 authorized the Pennsylvania Railroad Company to make lateral roads and branches from their main line as they may deem advantageous and suited to promote the interests of the company, and the Act of April 12th 1864 extended these provisions to the defendants.</p>

The ground on which the plaintiffs found their application is, that this track crosses William, Bath and Bank streets at grade, and is a public nuisance from which the plaintiffs suffer special damage not shared by their fellow-citizens. The track complained of is in certain public streets, and not upon' any property of the plaintiffs, and, if a nuisance, is a public one, which could be the subject of a public prosecution, which the Commonwealth have not deemed proper to institute. The plaintiffs are therefore bound to make out two things: 1st, that this is a public nuisance; and, 2d, that the plaintiffs have sustained special damage, which if they do not prove, renders the first question immaterial. We do not think that the plaintiffs have by the single witness examined by them established that they have suffered an injury quite distinct from that of the public, in general (2 Story’s Eq. 924, a, 18 Law Times 126), and of course upon that ground the decree below should be - affirmed. But as the first question whether it is a public nuisance has been discussed at length, we have thought it proper to express our views upon it.</p>
    <p id="b252-8" data-blocks='[["BL_252.10",252,[269,1566,1151,299]]]'>By the Act of 4th April 1838, under which the defendants were incorporated, their railroad might terminate “ at some suitable point in or near the city of Philadelphia,” “ or on the line of the Philadelphia and Columbia, or of the Philadelphia, German-town and Norristown Railroad,” and under these powers they constructed a railroad terminating on the river Delaware at Richmond, near the then city of Philadelphia.</p>
    <p id="b252-9" data-blocks='[["BL_252.11",252,[269,1865,1153,470]]]'>A coal railroad terminating on a navigable river must, in the course of thirty-five years, necessarily increase its wharf accommodation far beyond its original wants, and this must necessarily increase the number of tracks or branches leading from the main stem to its various wharves, where the coal is shipped to all parts of the United States. “ The word <em>‘ </em>railroad’ <em>ex vi termini </em>includes sidings,” and must of necessity include the present track or branch which is complained of by the plaintiffs. The fact that the tonnage has increased to 4,400,000 tons in twenty-two years, shows the propriety of giving such a fair and liberal construction to the chartered powers of the company.</p>
    <p id="b252-10" data-blocks='[["BL_252.12",252,[272,2334,1149,89]],["BL_253.1",253,[245,409,1158,384]]]'>But this would appear to be a branch railroad within the meaning of the 17th section of the Act of 13th April 1846, which <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>has been extended by the Acts of the 12th April 1864, Pamph. L. 396, to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company. This was decided in The Mayor, &amp;c., of Pittsburg <em>v. </em>The Pennsylvania Railroad Company, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%20355" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="12 Wright 355">12 Wright 355</a>, where the branch started from the terminus in Pittsburg, crossed the Monongahela by a bridge and connected their road with the Pittsburg and Steubenville Railroad in South Pittsburg. The approval of the route by the Richmond ordinance of 1854, and by the city ordinance of 1860, makes the two cases identical in their features.</p>
    <p id="b253-5" data-blocks='[["BL_253.6",253,[242,796,1170,516]]]'>The necessity and propriety of this construction are best shown by the statistics of the coal trade at Port Richmond in 1867, in which year from that point 583,444 tons of coal were shipped through the Delaware and Raritan Canal, and by a statement of the Board of Port Wardens, it is shown that the whole number of coastwise vessels which arrived in this port last year was 5233,. of which 4521, or 86 per cent, went to the wharves of Port Richmond for coal, leaving 712 arrivals for other cargoes. The real prosperity of this section of' the city is therefore dependent upon the extension of this valuable trade, which must affect favorably the property of the plaintiffs, whose real interest is that they should fail in their application to this court.</p>
    <p id="b253-6" data-blocks='[["BL_253.7",253,[227,1312,1177,346]]]'>The first attempt to improve Richmond was made about fifty years ago by making it a depot for the rafting and lumber trade of the Delaware, which ruined its original projectors. The same ■ fate would have attended the original purchasers of the Bush Hill estate, if they had not compromised with the owners; and in later years the speculation in League Island proved a failure. And yet all these projects were wise and judicious, except that they were a quarter of a century in advance of the age.</p>
