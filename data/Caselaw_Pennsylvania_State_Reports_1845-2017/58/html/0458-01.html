    <p class="summary" id="b458-13" data-blocks='[["BL_458.15",458,[302,1957,1150,300]]]'>This was an action of trespass <em>de bonis asportatis, </em>by Solomon Helser against William McGrath, who was sheriff of Franklin county. The writ issued August 9th 1862. The case had been in the Supreme Court before, when the judgment was reversed (2 P. F. Smith 531). The plaintiff’s cause of action was levying and selling 450 bushels of rye, which he alleged was his property, under an execution against Jacob Myers and John Zimmerman.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b458-14" data-blocks='[["BL_458.16",458,[305,2254,1145,170]],["BL_459.1",459,[205,430,1149,642]]]'>The property was sold by the sheriff to John Zimmerman; the plaintiff was at the sale and gave notice that it belonged to him. It appeared further, by plaintiff’s witnesses, that the rye had been hauled from his store at Mill Stone Point, in Maryland, to <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>Secrist’s Mill, in Franklin county, Pennsylvania; Myers paid for the hauling. It was moved because a Maryland regiment had possession of the warehouse. On cross-examination one of plaintiff’s witnesses, a clerk in the store, said Myers employed him and fixed his salary; Myers managed and controlled the store; bought and sold as if it belonged to himself; he bought and sold in the name of Helser. There was evidence by plaintiff that in 1855 or 1856, he had bought the store goods of J. Eichelberry, deceased, from his administrator, and moved the goods from Myers’s store to Eichelberry’s, and united the goods with those purchased of the administrator. On cross-examination it appeared that Myers after the purchase, up to 1861, transacted the business at Eichelberry’s store. There was much evidence to show that the store and the rye were Helser’s, and much brought out on cross-examination to show that the business was managed by Myers.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b459-7" data-blocks='[["BL_459.7",459,[208,1326,1148,341]]]'>The defendant offered to prove that the store was conducted by Myers as his own; that he paid his debts out of it, claimed it as his own ; offered to sell it; admitted it was not Helser’s ; also, that Myers had kept store at Mill Stone Point in his own name; that Myers declared in 1860 that he had been doing business under Helser’s name, &amp;e.; the declarations were not made in the presence of Hesler. The plaintiff objected to the offer; it was admitted and a bill of exceptions sealed.</p>

Neither of these objections meets the true position, of the case in hand, under the evidence. If there ever was a combination to cover Myers’s property, it continued and existed at the time the declarations .offered to be proved, were made. This was the defendant’s theory, and the testimony certainly favored it. The connection between Helser and Myers took place in 1854, after an alleged sale by the latter to the former, of a small stock of goods he had at Mill Stone Point, in Maryland, <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>which was united with a stock the plaintiff afterwards purchased from the administrator of Eichelberry, and the two stocks thus united were afterwards kept by Myers in the storehouse of Eichelberry in the name of Helser. Myers was insolvent at the commencement, and so continued. Repeated declarations of Helser were given before and after the offer, which is the subject of the first exception made, to the effect that the store, from the proceeds of which the rye in question was purchased, belonged to Myers; that he (Helser) was trying to help him; that the rye was Myers’s, &amp;c., &amp;c. This cleared the way for Myers’s declarations. There was therefore, we think, sufficient evidence of combination to go to the jury, and .the testimony was receivable. The defendant insisted that the original design, viz.: the protection of Myers against his creditors, still existed, and the combination continued. The testimony was very strong to this effect. The court was therefore entirely right in the admission of the testimony.</p>
    <p id="b461-6" data-blocks='[["BL_461.6",461,[188,1088,1153,217]]]'>Upon the same principle the answer of the court to the plaintiff’s 3d point was faultless, and the same must be said in regard to that portion of the charge of the learned judge which constitutes the 3d assignment of error. The judgment must be affirmed, no error appearing on the record.</p>
