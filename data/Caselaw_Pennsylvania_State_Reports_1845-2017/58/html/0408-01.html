The report was confirmed nisi September 17th 1866. Exceptions filed by the company October 17th 1866, were overruled January 19th 1867, and the report absolutely confirmed by the Court of Common Pleas. The proceedings were removed to the Supreme Court and the judgment of the court below affirmed July 3d 1867. The defendants received from the plaintiff, without prejudice, the amount of the award with interest from the date of the absolute confirmation by the court below. The plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to interest between the confirmation nisi, and the absolute confirmation by the court below. For this the suit was instituted. The Court of Common Pleas (Hayes, A. J.) entered judgment for the plaintiff for $123.57, the amount of his claim.</p>

    <p id="b409-8" data-blocks='[["BL_409.10",409,[191,967,1165,1204]]]'>Shakswood, J. — It is unnecessary, in order to reach the justice of this case, to construe the Act of April 6th 1859, Pamph. L. 381, as applicable to the report of the viewers of damages under the'Act of March 27th 1848, Pamph. L. 273. The Act last named says, merely, that “ execution may issue thereon as in other cases of debt.” It says nothing about interest; if the report is confirmed by the court judgment shall be entered thereon. The Act of Í859 evidently provides for the verdicts of juries in court, in the usual course of the common law. But when the court below confirmed the report of t,he viewers they might and ought to have entered it, as of the time it was filed, <em>nunc pro </em>tunc, and it would then have carried interest from that day. We may consider that as actually done which ought to have been done. It can hardly be made a question that the plaintiff below was entitled to recover interest upon the value of his property taken by the company defendants and appropriated for the purposes of their road, from the time that it was taken. He is in the position of a vendor of land, who has always been held to have a right to interest on the purchase-money where possession has been delivered to the vendee. The viewers, no doubt, allowed him interest up to the date of the report. He has been paid by the company, interest from the time of the final confirmation of it by the court below, including the period during which the cause was delayed by the certiorari from this court. Why shall he not also have interest during the period that the cause was delayed in the court below by the exceptions filed' there ? No good reason has been or can be given. It would be a reproach to the law if the party were without remedy in such a case.</p>
