This must be conceded, and it is but one step further, to impose the cost of erection on the city and county, through which the river passes and empties itself into the Delaware, and across which the bridge is thrown, connecting the east and west banks of the Schuylkill, upon which Philadelphia is built.</p>

This does not appear to admit of argument, for the mere statement of it is sufficient.</p>
    <p id="b325-7" data-blocks='[["BL_325.7",325,[171,1126,1159,1073]]]'>But we are not wanting in direct authority upon this point. In Thomas <em>v. </em>Leland, <a href="/wend/24/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="24 Wend. 65" data-case-ids="2155261" data-case-paths="/wend/24/0065-01">24 Wendell 65</a>, it was held, that an act of the legislature imposing a tax upon a local district of the state, in reference to a public improvement, such as a canal, is valid and constitutional, notwithstanding that previous to the passage of such act, a number of individuals of such district had entered into a bond to the state, by which they bound themselves to pay the whole expense of the improvement. In answer to some objections Mr. Justice Cowen says, <em>“ </em>But the argument proves quite too much. It would go to cut off entirely many acknowledged powers of taxation; such as that which raises money to relieve the poor, or establish and keep on foot common schools, to build bridges, or work the highway. It confounds two distinct legislative powers: a simple power of taxation with the power of taking private property for public use. The former acts upon communities, and may be exerted in favorof any object which the legislature shall deem for the public benefit. A tax to build a lunatic asylum may be mentioned as one instance. If the power to impose such a tax were to be rested on the ground of individual pecuniary benefit to each one who should be called on to contribute, it is quite obvious that it would not be maintained for a moment. Yet who would doubt that sueh might be imposed on a local community, a county or even a town ? I admit that this power of taxation may be abused; but its exercise cannot be judicially restrained-, so long as it is referable to the taxing power.”</p>

J. Bigelow, “of this .general grant of power, was to vest in the legislature a superintending and controlling authority, under and by virtue of which, they might enact all laws, not repugnant to the constitution, of a police and municipal nature, and necessary to the due regulation of the internal affairs of the •Commonwealth. It is obvious, that the exercise of such a power is absolutely indispensable, in a wisely governed and well ordered community; and among the purposes for which it is to be exerted, none is more essential than a wise and careful distribution of certain public burdens or duties. Of these a leading one is the construction, support and maintenance of roads ahid bridges.” Mr. Sedgwick, in his Treatise on Statutory and Constitutional Law, says, p. 554, “ As a general rule the taxing power has been treated by the judiciary as vested in the .absolute discretion of the legislative bodies. This doctrine has been repeatedly declared both by the state and Federal tribunals.” “ So the Supreme Court of the United States have said, that there is no limitation whatever upon the legislative power of the states, as to the amount or objects of taxation.”</p>
