In February 1861, the experiments were suspended to await the developments of their mining operations, but the minds of the partners continued to be devoted to improving the process of refining. In the fall of 1861 the experiments were resumed and conducted by the defendant, with the use of the partnership property, and for their benefit, “ as to the practical result and discoveries ;” on concluding the experiments, the works were carried on the equal right of all to the “ discoveries and information gained being admitted by all,” and they continued to operate the works and use the information and discoveries for the common benefit.

The partners purchased oil-land leases in Yenango and Crawford counties, and the business of mining oil proving unprofitable, the plaintiffs abandoned it. The plaintiffs had no idea before November 1861 of engaging in refining oil, and were ignorant of the method of refining; in 1860 the defendant conceived the idea of making from petroleum a better oil than any in use; erected a small experimental refinery at his own' expense, and succeeded towards the end of that year without any aid from the plaintiffs. He then proposed to them to form a partnership for refining oil as well as boring for it, he to continue his labors at his refinery at his own expense in the purchase of crude oil, and to enjoy its profits ; this resulted in the verbal agreement embodied in the article of January 5th 1861. Having continued to entertain the idea of erecting a large refinery elsewhere with the plaintiffs, or, if they declined, without them, he purchased in October 1860 a large lot in Norristown, and made preparations for erecting a refinery. The plaintiffs having been unsuccessful in oil mining in the West, agreed to join him in the business of refining, and they entered into the agreement of June 1862. The agreement was between the defendant of the first part and the plaintiffs and defendant, “ trading under the name and style of ‘ Slemmer Brothers,’ oil refiners, of the second part.” It recited that the firm had erected on the defendant’s premises “ in and through his name,” works for refining petroleum ; the defendant thereby leased to the firm a lot at the corner of Ford and Egypt streets, Norristown, for fifteen years- from April 1st 1862, at f200 per annum; the parties agreed that the lease might end at any period within fifteen years if the firm should desire it in consequence of closing their business as oil refiners, and at the end of fifteen years or earlier termination of the lease, the defendant should purchase all the buildings, &amp;e., erected on the premises at a price to be agreed upon, or, if <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>they could not agree, the price to be fixed by three arbitrators, “ selected in the usual manner,” and the firm agreed to give up the premises when the lease should terminate, <em>&amp;o. </em>Under this agreement the firm continued the business of refining oil until,.about January 1866, when the plaintiffs planned to get the refining business into their own hands, and dissolve the partnership, which they attempted to carry out by terminating the lease, purchasing other lands on which to erect a refinery for themselves, threatening to take away the machinery of the existing works for their own use, refusing to buy crude oil, voting themselves large salaries out of the firm funds, &amp;c., and doing other things which rendered the continuance of the partnership impossible.</p>

He denied that he acted in trust for them or that they gave him any ideas, &amp;c., or assisted him in the matter in any way; or that the discovery was to accrue for their benefit; averred that by his permission they were to share in the profits as long as the partnership continued, which was the whole extent of their interest. The article patented is a superior article to that made at the refinery, and was not perfected until a few days before his- application and after the plaintiffs had given him notice of the abrogation of all the agreements and of the dissolution of the firm.</p>

But though patent rights arel peculiarly within the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, yet it is undoubtedly true that when they come in ques-1 tion collaterally, their validity may become a subject of inquiry ! in the state courts. Thus in a suit upon a promissory note, iff <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>it is set up as a defence that the consideration was the .sale of a patent right, and that the patent is void, so that there, was in fact no consideration, the state courts constantly exercise jurisdiction: Bliss <em>v.

The jurisdiction is not defeated because the subject-matter of the action concerns the use of a patent right, so long as the question of the validity of the patent is not necessarily involved, but arises only incidentally and by way of defence: Sherman <em>v. </em>The Champlain Transportation Company, 31 Vermont 162; Tomlinson <em>v. </em>Ballet, Law’s Dig. 229. Accordingly the courts of the United States refuse to take cognisance of cases between citizens of the same state where they involve not the infringement of the patent, but controversies growing out of .contracts of which it is merely the subject-matter: Goodyear <em>v. </em>Day, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Blatchf.%20565" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="1 Blatchf. 565">1 Blatchf. 565</a>; Burr <em>v. </em>Gregory, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Paine%20436" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="2 Paine 436">2 Paine 436</a>; Brooks <em>v. </em>Stotley, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20McLean%20523" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="3 McLean 523">3 McLean 523</a>. The result of the authorities, ; then, appears to be that the state' courts are competent, 'either at ■law or in equity, to enforce a contract or a trust, of which a patent right is the subject-matter, where the validity of the patent is not directly in question, and even to pass on that when it arises <em>ex necessitate, </em>as by way of defence in an action on a contract.</p>
    <p id="b164-6" data-blocks='[["BL_164.6",164,[283,1352,1158,1062]],["BL_165.1",165,[227,439,1156,766]]]'>If, then, there could be gathered from the proofs in this case a contract or trust of this patent for the benefit of the plaintiffs, the want of jurisdiction of the court would not be in the way. The plaintiffs do not attack the patent: they admit its validity. But the difficulty of the case is that they claim a trust or ownership on grounds which, if true in fact, show that the patent is void in law. The question is directly involved who was the true and original inventor, and necessarily, therefore, the validity of the patent. The .plaintiffs claim that they are joint inventors with the defendant. “Ajoint invention,” says Mr. Curtis, “maybe a good subject-matter of a patent; for the statute supposes the case of a joint invention, and provides for it; but if an invention, which in point of fact was.made by more than one person, is made the subject of a patent by any one of them, he cannot take the oath required by the statute, declaring himself to be the original and first inventor, or if he does take it, his patent will be void.” Curtis on Patents, sect. 112. In this he is sustained by the authorities : Barrett <em>v. </em>Hall, 1 Mason 472; Stearns <em>v. </em>Barret, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Pick.%20446" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="1 Pick. 446">1 Pick. 446</a>; Moffat <em>v. </em>Soby, <a href="/f-cas/17/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="2 Paine 103" data-case-ids="6613952" data-case-paths="/f-cas/17/0559-01">2 Paine 103</a>; Hotchkiss <em>v. </em>Greenwood, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20McLean%20461" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="4 McLean 461">4 McLean 461</a>; Ransom <em>v. </em>Mayor, &amp;c., of New York, Law’s Dig. 458; Potter <em>v. </em>Wilson, Ibid. 454. It is true that these are all cases, in which a joint patent taken out on the sole invention of one, was held to be void. But the logic, which requires the correlative proposition to be affirmed, is inexorable. The object of the law is to secure to inventors the benefits of their inventions or dis<a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>coveries. If the invention is as it maybe, joint, that object is as much frustrated, if not more so, in the one case as the other. The patentee is not a trustee for the true inventor, either in whole or in part. The true inventor has never been allowed to claim the benefit of a patent granted to one who, had stolen the invention from him. It would be contrary to the whole policy as well as the express provisions of the system. Whatever might be the case, where there appeared to be a contract or trust resulting from the understanding of the parties or the relation of the original inventor to others, a court of equity cannot decree an assignment of a patent on the ground that the patentee is not, but the plaintiff is the true original inventor, in whole or in part. Besides which, for a state court to decide directly that A. is not the sole original inventor, but that A. and B. are jointly the inventors and so entitled to the patent, and to decree an assignment or grant an injunction accordingly, would be to usurp the jurisdiction which has been exclusively vested, as we have seen, in the courts of the United States.</p>
    <p id="b165-6" data-blocks='[["BL_165.6",165,[223,1215,1160,1247]],["BL_166.1",166,[295,437,1163,516]]]'>If, indeed, we had jurisdiction to afford the plaintiffs the specific relief for which they pray, we are by no means satisfied that the allegations of the bill in that aspect are sustained, by the proofs. These allegations are positively denied by the answer, which in this respect is responsive to the bill. The defendant undoubtedly has <em>thñ prima facies </em>in his favor by the grant of the patent. The <em>onus probandi </em>is cast by it on the plaintiffs. All the authorities are'agreed in this: Alden <em>v. </em>Dewey, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Story%20841" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="1 Story 841">1 Story Rep. 841</a>; Pitts <em>v. </em>Hall, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Blatchf.%20565" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="2 Blatchf. 565">2 Blatchf. 565</a>; Hotchkiss <em>v. </em>Greenwood, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20McLean%20461" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="4 McLean 461">4 McLean 461</a>. Mere suggestions or assistance by others will not invalidate the right of the patentee: Curtis on Patents, §§ 47, 48, 49, 2d ed. Suggestions, to be effectual to that end, must furnish <em>all </em>the information necessary to enable the alleged inventor to construct the improvement or use the new process completely and perfectly. If they merely aided him in arriving at the useful result, but fell short of suggesting an arrangement that would constitute a complete machine or a perfect process, and if, after all the suggestions, there was something left for him to devise and work out by his own skill or ingenuity in order to complete the arrangement, then he is in contemplation of law to be regarded as the first and original discoverer: Nelson, J., in Pitts <em>v. </em>Hall, <a href="/f-cas/19/0754-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="2 Blatchf. 229" data-case-ids="6570790" data-case-paths="/f-cas/19/0754-01">2 Blatchf. 229</a>. It must appear that the invention was substantially communicated to the patentee, so that without more inventive power, he could have applied it, in practice. It is not enough that a hint is given, nor on the other hand is it necessary that every minute thing about the invention should be communicated, but the substance must be: Story, J., in Alden <em>v. </em>Dewey, 1 Story’s Rep. 338. It seems necessarily to follow from these principles that in a joint invention, each party should invent or discover something essen<a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>tial to the whole result. In the case before us it is conceded that the defendant was the actual experimenter. In all the correspondence he is spoken of as conducting the experiments. There is no direct evidence of any important suggestion made by either of the plaintiffs, bearing upon “ the new and improved method of producing lubricating oil from the heavy distillate of petroleum.” Indeed, the circular issued by the firm, the manuscript of which, according to the testimony of the printer, was brought to him by one of the plaintiffs in September 1863, seems to be very persuasive, if not conclusive, evidence on this point. It says to the public: “ Our oils are manufactured under the eye of our experienced chemist, <em>by a process of his own.”</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b166-6" data-blocks='[["BL_166.6",166,[293,953,1167,1462]],["BL_167.1",167,[238,409,1162,433]]]'>It must follow that the decree below is erroneous. The master indeed reported as a conclusion of fact “ that the discoveries in refining oil, made by defendant at the experimental refinery, together with the whole process of manufacturing the refined oils as afterwards used by them, were the property of the company.” He failed to make, however, what is a very important distinction between a right or property in the use of a discovery and a right to a patent or exclusive monopoly. The patent right is the reward granted by the public for the skill and ingenuity of- the inventor. By the Constitution of the United States (art. 1, § 8, ¶ 8), power is granted to Congress “ to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.” No one but the inventor can have this exclusive right. He may assign it after the patent has been issued, or perhaps bind himself by contract before to execute such an assignment, which equity would specifically enforce. ' But against the express oath of the defendant we see no sufficient proof of any such <em>contract, </em>express or implied. He may have been present on one or more occasions when it was spoken of as a secret of trade possessed by the firm: that is the amount of the evidence at most. The inventor may however grant the use of his invention, within the limits prescribed by the law before the patent is issued, provided he does not thereby forfeit his right or abandon his discovery to the public. This we conceive to be the extent of the equity of the plaintiffs as made out by the evidence. The defendant indeed admits in his answer that the plaintiffs were by his own permission and acquiescence to share as copartners with him in the profits arising from the manufacture of oil by the said process — he adds, “so long as the copartnership continued.” The whole of this allegation is irresponsive. While there is ample evidence to sustain the equity of the plaintiffs to the use of the discovery, there is nothing to restrict it to the period of the existence of the partnership. The case indeed falls entirely within <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>the principle established in McClurg <em>v. </em>Kingsland, 1 How. (S. C.) 202), in which it was held that if a person employed in the manufactory of another, while receiving wages, makes experiments at the expense of his employer, constructs the article invented and permits his employer to use it, no compensation for the use being paid or demanded, and then obtains a patent, these facts will justify the presumption of a license to use the invention. No limitation to the license was implied in that case, confining it to the period of time that the inventor continued in the employment of the other; neither can any be implied here.</p>
