The defendants contracted for ice with three persons, who used the name of a paving firm, of which two of them were members. As the ice was delivered, drafts were accepted by defendants payable at a bank, and were endorsed to the plaintiff, who was a clerk in the paving firm, and knew the ice firm was using their name; he had loaned beyond the amount of the drafts to the ice firm. One of the drafts was presented and protested, the others were not presented; there were no funds at the bank to meet the drafts during the time they matured. <em>Held, </em>that there were no grounds of suspicion from these facts to require proof of consideration, &amp;c., from the endorsee ; and that damages for the non-fulfilment of the ice contract could not be set off against the drafts.</p>

The proof, however, of the signatures to the bills and endorsements was sufficient. The handwriting was that of David Gore, one of the partners in the firm of Gore, Rose &amp; Co., engaged in the ice business. The existence of this firm independently of the paving firm of Gore, Rose &amp; Co., was abundantly proved, and the fact that the bills arose in the ice business. The statement of David Gore was therefore unimportant whether competent or not.</p>
    <p id="b115-12" data-blocks='[["BL_115.16",115,[202,1734,1156,634]]]'>None of the other assignments of error are supported. The judge informed the jury correctly that there were no circumstances of suspicion that required Fawcett to prove the consideration he gave for the bills or the bona fides of the transaction. The fact that the last three bills were not presented at the bank for payment is clearly accounted for by the failure to place funds there to pay the first and all the subsequent bills. After the first bill had gone to protest, and before the second fell due, we find by the letter of the defendants of September 3d, that the plaintiff had entered into correspondence about it, and that they were refusing payment. There was not the slightest doubt cast upon the solvency of the defendants, as acceptors, to require Fawcett to be very particular to protect the paper with a view to hold his friends the Gores liable to him, while as to them his advance of funds to them made it a debt of honor.</p>

Had the question concerned the liability of the paving firm by the use of their partnership style, this knowledge on Fawcett’s part would have been an important circumstance. But it afforded no possible reason for suspecting the paper given to the ice firm of Gore, Rose &amp; Co., by their own customers: The agreement for the ice</p>
    <p id="b116-6" data-blocks='[["BL_116.6",116,[303,694,1156,258]]]'>was made by Callen &amp; Sherin with Gore, Rose &amp; Co. by that name. The use of that style was no ground to suspect the bills given afterwards upon the delivery of the ice. In fact the bills in suit are entirely sound; the only purpose of the defendants being now to visit upon them the effect of the subsequent breach of the contract for the delivery of the ice.</p>
