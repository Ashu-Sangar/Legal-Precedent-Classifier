The suit is for the recovery of commission by a real estate broker against the vendor of real estate. Two principal factual questions were involved, viz: (a) was the plaintiff the <em>exclusive </em>agent for the seller and (b) if plaintiff was but defendants’ <em>general </em>agent, were the plaintiff’s services the efficient cause of the sale? The verdict of the jury was for the plaintiff. Defendant assigns as error and the reason for a new trial a statement of the trial judge concerning the status of an agent of the <em>buyer. </em>It is maintained that the statement was misleading and prejudicial to defendants. The facts may be summarized as follows:</p>

H. B. McCollum, a broker (a friend of defendant’s late father and the defendants) had been at<a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>tempting, unsuccessfully, to sell the premises since 1938. On July 2, 1945, plaintiff and his salesman, Albert Barnes, called upon defendants seeking to secure an <em>exclusive </em>agency to sell the premises. The plaintiff was informed of defendants’ regard for their agent, Mr. McCollum. Plaintiff suggested that if an exclusive agency was given plaintiff, Mr. McCollum should receive, <em>from defendants, </em>a two and one-half per cent commission, so that bn a sale defendants would pay a total commission of seven and one-half per cent. It was testified that, on behalf of defendants, this suggestion was made by plaintiff to Mr. McCollum, but he rejected it. It was testified by plaintiff, but denied by defendants, that thereafter the defendants granted plaintiff the <em>exclusive </em>agency to sell the real estate.</p>

Herbert Moyer, Comptroller of Franklin- <em>“made some calls through the classified directory and </em>. . . <em>called Marhheim, Chalmers, and Ludington, in addition to many others, (real estate brokers) and Mr. Blotter (an employe of Marhheim, Chalmers, and Ludington) in person came up with this property.” </em>(37a)</p>

Plaintiff testified that his employe, Mr. Barnes, submitted the property to Franklin on <em>July 27,1945. </em>Paul Nichols, one of the defendants, testified that he first heard that Franklin was a prospect on July 31, 1945 <em>from their agent, Mr. Mc-Collum. </em>(49a). Mr. McCollum testified that he had submitted the property to Franklin through their agent (Slotter) on <em>July 27, 1945 </em>(57a) <em>which was the first time he had knowledge that the Franklin Company, acting through Blotter, was interested. </em>(58a). Slotter <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>testified that <em>he </em>submitted the property to Moyer (Comptroller of Franklin) <em>on July 23, 191¡5. </em>(43a).

If there was, the plaintiff is entitled to recover a verdict at your hands. If there was not such an agency, was the plaintiff the person who, so far as the defendants are concerned, discovered and brought this purchaser to them? If he was, the plaintiff can still recover.

      <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>The trial judge also said: (65a) “He [Slotter] was not acting as agent for the defendants. In this whole transaction, by the indisputable evidence, Slotter acted at all times solely and exclusively as agent for the buyer, the Franklin Company, and he had to look to the buyer alone for any commissions he might get for his part in the transaction. Therefore, it cannot be said, legally or fairly, that this property was submitted by Slotter on behalf of the defendants to the Franklin Company.”</p>
    <p id="b51-3" data-blocks='[["BL_51.4",51,[117,760,1150,968]]]'>This was a correct statement. By McCollum’s own testimony, the property was not submitted to Franklin by him <em>(through Slotter) until July 21,19)5, </em>the same day that <em>plaintiff </em>testified he submitted the property to Franklin. <em>Defendants now assert that in view of Slotter’s testimony that Slotter stobmitted the property to Moyer (Comptroller of Franklin) on July 23, 19)5, such submission was a submission by defendant. </em>But on July 23,1945, McCollum did not know that Franklin was interested in the property or that Slotter was looking for a suitable property <em>for Franklin. </em>The court below questioned <em>McCollum </em>respecting his testimony that he first submitted the property to Slotter <em>on July 21,191,5: </em>(58a) “Q. ... was that [i. e. July 27, 1945] the first time you submitted it to the Franklin Company through Slotter? A. The first time I had knowledge that the Franklin Company through Slotter-Q. Was interested? A. Yes.”</p>
    <p id="b51-5" data-blocks='[["BL_51.5",51,[115,1747,1149,264]]]'>From this <em>undisputed </em>testimony, the trial judge correctly stated in his charge <em>“it cannot be said, legally or fairly, that this property was submitted by Slotter on behalf of the defendants to the Franklin </em>Company”, i. e., <em>on July 23,19)5.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b51-6" data-blocks='[["BL_51.6",51,[115,2021,1151,261]],["BL_52.1",52,[264,275,1148,807]]]'>Defendants belatedly contend that the trial judge should have charged that notice to a conceded agent of the buyer was notice to the buyer itself. But at the trial no one questioned this principle and no such request was submitted for charge. Even if it had been included <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>in the charge it would have been surplusage. As stated above, when Slotter, as agent for the buyer, submitted the property to the buyer, on <em>July 23,1945, </em>McCollum, the <em>seller’s agent, </em>did not know that Franklin was interested in the purchase and did not become aware of this fact until <em>July 27, 1945. </em>It follows that any submission of the premises on <em>July 23,1945, </em>could not have been made <em>at the instance of the seller’s agent, </em>who <em>then </em>was unaware of the buyer’s interest. While perhaps it was unnecessary for the trial judge to have dealt with a matter over which there was no dispute, there were so many persons, in varying capacities, who appeared in the trial that in our view no harm resulted to defendants by such reference. The trial judge has committed no prejudicial error.</p>
