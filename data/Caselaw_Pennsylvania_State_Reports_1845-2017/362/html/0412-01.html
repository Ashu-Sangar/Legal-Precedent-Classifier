The facts are not in dispute. On January 1, 1942, by order of the Governor of Pennsylvania and pursuant to Presidential Executive Order No. 8990, dated December 23, 1941 (Code of Federal Regulations of the United States of America, Supplement 1941, Titles 1 to 7, page 327), the Pennsylvania Employment Service, including all of its employes, was <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>transferred from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to the United States Employment Service. At that time, appellant and other petitioners were not employes of either the State Employment Service or the United States Employment Service. <em>Upon the request </em>of the United States Employment Service, and upon the advice of the Attorney General of Pennsylvania (see: Formal Opinion No. 444 of the Department of Justice, under date of January 15, 1943, 1943-1944 Op. Atty. Gen. 1), the State Civil Service Commission agreed to give civil service examinations and render services incidental thereto to the United States Employment Service. On February 3, 1943, after examinations were duly held and pursuant to the State Civil Service Act, supra, the State Civil Service Commission made a written certification of names of persons duly qualified and eligible to the United States Employment Service for consideration for appointment to the position of assistant interviewer. The names of appellant and other petitioners were on this list. These persons were subsequently appointed therefrom by the United States Employment Service to fill positions with that agency of the Federal government. The name of a veteran which appeared on this list was passed over in accordance with the Federal rule. This, however, was contrary to Section 4 of the Veterans’ Preference Act of Pennsylvania, in effect at that time, (Act of Aug. 5, 1941, P. L. 872, 51 PS 491.1 et seq.) which gives veterans priority if their names appear on the certified list.</p>

The minutes of this meeting are made part of this record. It was agreed that these individuals, including appellant, had not acquired civil service status under the State Civil Service Act.

He asserts that the issue considered by the State Civil Service Commission was whether or not the failure on the part of the United States' Employment Service first to appoint a veteran among the certified eligibles (as provided in the State Veterans’ Preference Act, supra) rendered appellant’s appointment illegal. He contends that the court below ignored this issue and only considered the issue whether or not a Federal authority could be an “appointing authority” as defined by the State Civil Service Act. However, the issue considered and answered in the negative by the learned <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>court below was the basic question to be answered. Appellant incorrectly <em>assumes </em>that the United States Employment' Service was an appropriate “appointing authority” under the State Civil Service Act. It is argued that the legality of the appointment cannot now be challenged by the State Civil Service Commission after she had taken a State examination, had been certified as qualified and eligible and <em>had been appointed. </em>She relies on <em>Kassarich v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa-super/139/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="139 Pa. Super. 599" data-case-ids="1024472" data-case-paths="/pa-super/139/0599-01">139 Pa. Superior Ct. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20A.2d%20823" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="12 A.2d 823">12 A. 2d 823</a>. In that case, a new Unemployment Compensation Board attempted to attack the prior appointment of Kassarich to the position of senior interviewer. Said appointment admittedly was made by the appropriate “appointing authority”, to wit, the Secretary of Labor and Industry upon proper certification. It was contended by the new Board, however, that Kassarich’s statements of preliminary qualifications, which the old Board deemed satisfactory, were inadequate. The court there held that Kassarich was appointed by the proper “appointing authority” so that the question relating to preliminary qualifications was immaterial. There, the appointment was made by the appropriate “appointing authority”. The present case is, however, quite different. We must first determine whether appellant was appointed by an appropriate “appointing authority”. The learned court below held that she was not so appointed. We agree with this conclusion.</p>

This latter .agency was created under the Unemployment Compensation Law (Act of Dec. 5, 1936, P. L. (1937) 2897,- as amended, 43 PS 751 et seq.) which Act, by Art. II, Sec. 201, 43 PS 761, places the duty of administering and enforcing its terms on the Department of Labor and Industry. Art.

    <p id="b441-3" data-blocks='[["BL_441.4",441,[134,674,1149,1082]]]'>It appears from the <em>terms </em>of the Act under which the State Employment Service operates that the Secretary of Labor and Industry is the appointing authority with regard to employes of the State Employment Service. He has the power, by law, to make the appointments and he, therefore, is the appropriate “appointing authority” as defined by the State Civil Service Act. Unless a person certified by the Director of the State Civil Service Commission is appointed by the Secretary of Labor and Industry (the appropriate “appointing authority”), the person cannot acquire permanent State Civil Service status under the State Civil Service Act, supra. When appellant was appointed by the United States Employment Service to her position with that agency, she never acquired State Civil Service status. The cases relied on by appellant, such as <em>Kassarieh v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>supra, have no relevant significance in the determination of this appeal because here appellant never was appointed <em>by the appropriate “appointing authority”.</em>

The Federal agency made the appointment because <em>it </em>needed additional help to administer the allocation and distribution of needed man power during the late war. This was a Federal, not a State operation. Appellant can find <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>no support in the opinion rendered by the State Attorney General (Opinion No. 444 dated January 15, 1943, supra) that the State Civil Service Commission could service the United States Employment Service. The Attorney General, however, merely advised “. . . that the State Civil Service Commission may, <em>upon the request of the Federal Government, </em>administer examinations for the State employment service temporarily loaned to the United States Employment Service. . . (Emphasis supplied.) The Attorney General did not advise that it was mandatory on the United States Employment Service to accept the servicing of all applicants by the State Civil Service Commission. In fact the evidence discloses that the United States- Employment Service did <em>not </em>follow State procedure in making appointments. For example, it failed to follow the State Veterans’ Preference Act, supra, which is required by State statute to be followed by all State “appointing authorities”. Moreover, the Bureau of Employment and Unemployment Compensation of the State Department of Labor and Industry did not regard any employe of the United States Employment Service as an employe of the State when the State Service was retransferred. This is revealed when the Secretary of Labor and Industry issued the directive known as Administrative No. 16, in which all employes were given an “interim appointment” until their status could be determined.</p>

While irrelevant to this proceeding, the record discloses that those employes received subsequent appointments by the Secretary of Labor and Industry (the proper “appointing authority”) under Administrative No. 16. By Sec<a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>tion 4 of Administrative No. 16, supra, the Secretary of Labor and Industry disclosed that he recognized that upon the return of the employment service to the State, many employes had been added by the Federal agency. He, therefore, gave all employes “interim appointments” until their status could be ascertained. He directed that each employe be placed, in the State Employment Service, into one of four classifications. Classification number one included all those with “Regular State Civil Service status”. This included employes who had been appointed by the Secretary of Labor and Industry (who were the ones who were actually in the State service before the transfer to the Federal agency). This classification also included employes appointed by the Federal government “from a certified State list of eligibles” in accordance <em>with the State Civil Service Act. </em>Any employe whose qualifications fell within this category would be considered by the Secretary of Labor and Industry as being properly appointed by him. Such “interim appointments”, therefore, were enlarged to permanent appointments. The Secretary of Labor and Industry regarded appellant as not appointed by the Federal government <em>in accordance with State practice </em>and that veterans on the certified list with appellant had not been given preference in accordance with the State Veterans’ Preference Act, supra. For this reason he refused to appoint appellant as a permanent employe. It was proper that he should only appoint those employes who were finally selected in accordance with State law. This situation was disclosed to the State Civil Service Commission by a representative from the office of the Secretary of Labor and Industry, when the Commission met on July 22, 1947. With all the facts before them, the Commission ruled that appellant had not acquired permanent State Civil Service status.</p>
