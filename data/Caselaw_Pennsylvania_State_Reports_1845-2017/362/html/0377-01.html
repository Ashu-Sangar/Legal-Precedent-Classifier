It is established by a multitude of decisions that a tax on the capital stock of a company is a tax on all of its property and assets,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and that a tax on the income from property is likewise a property tax.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Therefore, if the present tax is also a property tax it is not authorized by the 1947 Act and is consequently illegal and void. The School District contends that the tax is not a property tax on the coal but an excise tax on the privilege, business or occupation of mining the coal, and, if this be so, there is no conflict between it and the State taxes: <em>Blauner’s, Inc., v. </em>Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/330/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="330 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="1182999" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0342-01">330 Pa. 342</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%20889" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="198 A. 889">198 A. 889</a>; <em>Philadelphia v.

As the tax on the meters in respect to their ownership or use, is, in effect, a tax on the meters, there is no support for the argument that . . . ‘the tax is limited to the “use”' of said meters by said companies.’ ” Similarly, the phraseology of the Resolution before us makes it impossible to accept the contention that it is an excise or occupation tax.

The court below so recognized, stating: “The Resolution is not well drawn, if intended as a tax on the transaction of mining and removing coal, as contended by counsel for the School District. Nowhere in the resolution does it state that it is a tax levied for the privilege of mining and removing coal, or for the privilege of selling the same. <em>The Resolution on its face purports to he a taoo of five cents per net ton on all coal mined.” </em>Nevertheless, the court below decided that the tax imposed by the Resolution was not a property tax, because “we think that the tax of five cents a- ton on all coal, when mined and removed from the premises, was intended as a tax on the sale of said coal or on the privilege of mining and removing it and thereafter selling it.” Such decision amounts to judicial legislation.

It is true that the levy is one of five cents a ton <em>on all coal mined from property </em>in the Township, but in determining the real character of a tax all the authorities agree that there must be taken into consideration the language of the statute, ordinance or resolution <em>as a whole </em>in order to ascertain the intent of the legislative body, <em>for it is that intent which constitutes the controlling factor. A </em>reading of the present resolution with that objective in mind leads me to the irresistible conclusion that the tax was intended to be imposed, not Upon coal as such, but upon the business or activity of the companies and individuals who mine it. This becomes plain by merely transposing the order of the paragraphs, whereupon it will appear that the tax is to be collected “from all individuals . . . corporations, or any other groups <em>who mine coal </em>from property located in Lawrence Township”; it is to “become due on the last day of each month <em>for all coal mined </em>during the preceding month,” the amount of coal <em>so mined </em>to be furnished the Tax Collector by the companies or individuals <em>mining it, </em>and the tax is to be at the rate of five cents per ton on all coal <em>mined in the Township. </em>It is thus evident that the tax is not imposed on anyone because of <em>ownership or possession </em>of coal, as, for example, on dealers or others who are such owners or possessors, but <em>is confined to those who mine the coal, </em>showing clearly that it is not a <em>property </em>tax. Of course the Board of Directors of the School District might easily have removed the question from the field of controversy had they expressly said in the resolution that they were imposing the tax on the privilege, business or occupation of mining, but, failing that, and even if it were to be conceded that the present phrasing is at all ambiguous and susceptible of two different inter<a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>pretations under one of which it would be valid and under the other null and void, certainly there must be given the interpretation which makes for validity:— (1) because that would unquestionably represent the Board’s intention; and (2) because it is an elementary rule of statutory construction, that, if there be any ambiguity, the construction chosen must be the one which renders the statute, ordinance or resolution valid rather than invalid.</p>

In the former of those cases a tax on gasoline was held to be a property, not an excise, tax, because it was payable, not by those who sold the gasoline but by those who purchased it, thus showing that it could not have been the legislative intention to assess the tax upon the vendors for the privilege of carrying on their business. In the <em>Peoples Natural Gas Co. </em>case the tax was levied on certain public utilities, <em>“in respect to the ownership or use </em>by said companies or individuals of meters or other devices . ..”; these companies and individuals were not manufacturers or vendors of the meters but merely owned and used them, and the court properly held that the tax was á property tax, adopting a quotation from <em>Dawson v.

Here there is no violation of the constitutional requirement of uniformity since the tax is on the privilege of mining and therefore the value of such privilege is properly measured by the extent to which it is exercised, that is, by the amount of coal mined each month; the rate of the tax' is the same as. to all, engaged in the occupation of mining within the territorial limits of the district in which the tax is imposed : cf. <em>Kittanning Coal Co. v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/79/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="79 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="438386" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0100-01">79 Pa. 100</a>.</p>
