At that time defendant Schmeltz agreed to submit the proposal to the other defendants but, substantially conceding that the proceeding before the Board of Governance would result in a vindication of plaintiff, indicated that, because of personal animosities within the Association, defendants would probably insist on an agreement by plaintiff that regardless of the outcome of the.proceeding he would resign his membership in the Patent Law Association.

The text of the letter not only shows a disqualifying state of mind, but, so far as now appears in the record, shows an attitude requiring the exclusion of the defendant members of the board from participation as members of the trial tribunal. If the activity of the board was limited to the purposes of the members among themselves, it was ultra vires to demand plaintiff’s resignation “as a member of the bar of all courts before which you are eligible to practice” etc. In considering disqualification, we next have their threat to institute disciplinary proceedings if plaintiff refused their demand to resign as a member of the bar. What had the defendants then to do with plaintiff’s membership of the bar of this or any other court? Of what relevance was it in their inquiry? If the association was then acting in the public interest to prevent unworthy lawyers from practicing law, its duty in that interest should have required the institution of immediate disbarment proceedings if a proper case was submitted to <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>them. It appears clear to us that the defendant board, in violation of elementary principles, was acting as prosecutor and trial tribunal at the same time. When both functions, in rare cases of necessity, become united in a single person or tribunal, it is not only necessary that there be absolute impartiality but it is necessary that such impartiality appear without possibility of misunderstanding.

Mr. W. Denning Stewart,, who appears in the present case as counsel for defendants, and Mr. Schmeltz, defendant, went to Washington and discussed the case with the commissioner of patents and a Mr. Hall who is said to have participated in the patent cases as counsel opposed to plaintiff. Additional information was secured from a former associate of appellant named Webb. At this same meeting of the board in December, 1948, Mr. Mackey, a member, of the board having resigned, the six remaining members, to fill the vacancy in the board, elected E. W.

The seven defendants participated but kept no minutes. Mr. Schmeltz reported his investigation and submitted certain material secured from Mr. Hall. The result of this meeting was that the letter of January 17th was drafted and after approval by all of the members of the board was sent to the plaintiff. On January 15, 1949, however, Mr. Schmeltz, as president of the board, wrote to each member of the board suggesting “that we seem to be denying the gentleman the right to be heard by our association provided for in the articles óf the association.” He suggested that the board refer to appellant’s right to a hearing and offer him such hearing if he refused to resign. The other members rejected this suggestion. Mr. McCallister is still a member of the board and is one of the defendants and is therefore still engaged in bringing the plaintiff to trial before himself and other defendants. It thus appears that a party who made the first complaint to the board, has since, by the votes of the other members, become a member of the board in succession tea member<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> who resigned after the complaint reached the boárd. Mr. Schmeltz testified that his recollection was that at a meeting with counsel for the appellant, he, Mr. Schmeltz, made “a statement to the éffect that perhaps some of them were prejudiced”, meaning some of the members of the board. At page 90a <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>the following appears in the cross-examination of Mr. Schmeltz: “Q.

He was asked to specify in the affidavit what it was that was submitted to the board as false at the meeting in Mr. McCallister’s office. He ultimately answered as follows: “A. The exact wording of it appearing on page 20, the language [of Blenko’s affidavit] is, ‘that under all the circumstances the said abandonment may properly be said to have occurred through accident and mistake.’ In connection with that I pointed out that in my opinion that was an argumentative conclusion that was intended, and could only have been added for the purpose of intending to mislead the Patent Office as to the circumstances as they existed at that time. Q. But you concede that is what you call an argumentative conclusion and not an assertion of fact? A. To me it appeared to be that.” Later, at page 118a the witness stated that in his opinion and in the opinion of the board “there was something improper in the addition of that conclusion to this affidavit of Blenko’s.” Whatever construction shall ultimately be put upon it, the affidavit was made and filed in the patent office in 1935. At this stage of the record we can not pass on the charge based on the affidavit nor should we now determine the effect of the delay in the <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>proceeding with respect to it; that will be for consideration after defendant association shall have had an opportunity to answer and proceed to final hearing, if that course is taken. s</p>
