Decedent was a widower seventy years of age at the time of the marriage, and.appellant, beauty shop operator and former waitress, was a widow thirty-nine years of age. Following the marriage the parties proceeded to decedent’s winter home at Clearwater, Florida, where they lived together as husband and wife until October 31, 1946, a period of fourteen days, on which date decedent suddenly died.</p>

The bonds were forwarded to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia for transfer on October 25, 1946, through Citizens National Bank of Bradford, but due to an omission to provide the prefix to the name of the assignee, the transfer was not completed until after decedent’s death, and the exchange bonds in appellant’s-name were , not shipped until November 13, 1946. In . the meantime, on November 12,1946, Citizens National Bank of Bradford advised appellant by letter that the bonds would be delivered to her upon receipt, in reply to which the bank received a letter from appellant’s attorney, dated November 14,1946, advising that she would not accept the bonds and taking the position that the antenuptial agreement was not binding upon her. .</p>

While appellant may not have known of exactly what decedent’s estate consisted, she knew that he was a man of large means. In the preamble of the antenuptial agreement it is recited that the decedent is “the owner of both real and personal property having a value at the present time of one million one hundred thousand ($1,100,000.00) dollars.” This figure was based on the annual report of a reputable firm of independent certified public accountants, regularly employed by the decedent, computing his net worth as of December 31, 1945, at $1,112,619.64, and was recited in the preamble on the advice of counsel. The agreement was handed to the appellant by decedent on October 3, 1946, and remained in her sole possession until she returned it duly executed and witnessed the following night. She had ample opportunity to obtain information as to the exact nature and extent of decedent’s estate and the effect of the agreement, if she so desired. As stated by the chancellor, “This was not a child marriage. Mildred Showers, although much younger than Earle C. Emery, was a mature woman, thirty-nine years of age, had been once married, had <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>several years of business experience. There is nothing to indicate that she did not possess at least the average degree of knowledge of the world and keenness of a woman of her age. She surely possessed intelligence enough to know that she had a right to refuse to sign the contract if it was not satisfactory to her.” The preamble also recited that “first party [decedent] has fully informed second party [appellant] of his financial situation and wealth,” and in the last paragraph of the agreement it is stated that, “The parties hereto do hereby declare that they have carefully read this agreement and have discussed the legal effect thereof and further that a full disclosure of the properties of each party has been made to the other.” These solemn admissions of appellant, appearing in the agreement, are affirmative proof that she was not deceived: <em>McCready’s Estate, </em>supra, <em>252; Smith’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/115/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="115 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="551789" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0319-01">115 Pa. 319</a>, 321, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20A.%20582" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="8 A. 582">8 A. 582</a>.</p>

The test of the reasonableness of the provision for the wife is not whether she would receive as much as she would be legally entitled to receive in the absence of the antenuptial agreement, but whether the provision for her is sufficient to enable her to live comfortably after the husband’s death, in substantially the same way as she lived prior to the marriage, considering all the circumstances: <em>Clark’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/303/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="303 Pa. 538" data-case-ids="1130011" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0538-01">303 Pa. 538</a>, 543,<a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.%20919" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="154 A. 919">154 A. 919</a>; <em>McCready’s Estate, </em>supra, 255; <em>Groff’s Estate, </em>supra, 110. Appellant was a waitress from 1929 until 1939, when she began the business of operating a beauty shop, in which business she was engaged at the time of her marriage to decedent, realizing therefrom a net income of approximately $1500 <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>a year. Her total net worth at the time, according to the evidence, was $5,000. As beneficiary of a policy of insurance on the life of decedent, she has received the sum of $9,000, and so far as the record discloses her earning capacity is unimpaired. In the light of these facts, the provision for her cannot be considered unreasonable. Payment to her of the $50,000 under the agreement will obviously improve her financial position as compared to her situation prior to her marriage to decedent of two weeks’ duration. ' .</p>
    <p id="b170-4" data-blocks='[["BL_170.4",170,[254,808,1150,1356]]]'>Having signed the agreement containing an acknowledgment of the receipt of the specified consideration, appellant cannot now deny such receipt for the purpose of defeating the operation of the contract. The rule that a receipt is only prima facie evidence of payment, and may be explained by parol, does not apply when the question involved is not as to the fact of payment but as to the existence of rights springing out of the contract. See <em>Real Estate Company of Pittsburgh v. Rudolph, </em><a href="/pa/301/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="301 Pa. 502" data-case-ids="1126444" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0502-01">301 Pa. 502</a>, 506, <a href="/citations/?q=153%20A.%20438" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="153 A. 438">153 A. 438</a>; <em>Eaton v. New York Life Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa/315/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="315 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1156642" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0068-01">315 Pa. 68</a>, 81, <a href="/citations/?q=172%20A.%20121" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="172 A. 121">172 A. 121</a>. The rule is well stated in Restatement, Contracts, section 243,,as follows: “Where by the terms of an integration a certain fact is essential to the creation or continuance of an obligation and. it is, to the knowledge of the obligor, falsely recited in the integration that the fact" exists, the integrated agreement is not deprived of legal operation unless the existence of the fact is made essential by law independently of any agreement requiring it.” Knowing the meaning of the words in the agreement, appellant nonetheless signed and delivered it, and on the faith of her so doing decedent married her. Now that he is dead, she cannot be heard to contend that the agreement is inoperative as a waiver of her right to set aside his testamentary provisions.</p>
