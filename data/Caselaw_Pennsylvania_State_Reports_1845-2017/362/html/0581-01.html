Even <em>after </em>the acceptance of income under a spendthrift trust provision, a life tenant perhaps may still refuse to accept such income. (Compare Estates Act of 1947, section 3a, supra, which provides: “. . . nothing in this section shall authorize an income beneficiary of a spendthrift trust to release or disclaim his right to such income.”) It is clear that the refusal of a spendthrift income beneficiary to receive the income does not enable the remainderman thereby to terminate the trust.</p>

When, <em>prior to the Act, </em>a beneficiary of income subject to spendthrift trust provisions <em>accepted the gift, </em>this Court consistently held that the beneficiary could not <em>thereafter </em>terminate the trust by releasing, renouncing and disclaiming his interest. The basis for this doctrine rested upon the ancient maxim: <em>Oujus est dare, ejus est </em>disponere: The bestower of a gift has the right to regulate its disposal. Spendthrift trusts are sustained not because of the law’s concern for the donee, but because the testator or donor possessed an individual right of property in the execution of the trust. <em>To permit a termination by agreement or release ivould be an invasion of the donor’s property right.-</em>

The Constitution, however, is <em>not </em>protecting <em>present </em>ownership of property <em>of a decedent. </em>What it does protect is the property right possessed by the testator or donor, <em>to have enforced the limitations and restrictions affixed to the gift.</em>

Even though the life tenant, the spendthrift beneficiary, refuses to accept income, this constitutes no valid reason for terminating the trust. While the life tenant may <em>presently </em>decline spendthrift income (which in the interim may be distributed to others under' the terms of the will or by law), it may subsequently develop that the creator of the trust was wiser than the beneficiary who may thereafter desire to repudiate her release and renunciation and receive <em>future </em>income. See <em>Heyl Estate, </em><a href="/pa/352/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="352 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="464078" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0407-01">352 Pa. 407</a>, 409, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20A.2d%20130" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="43 A.2d 130">43 A. 2d 130</a>. It is a subterfuge, thinly veiled, to permit a life tenant under a spendthrift clause to release and disclaim her interest, thus accelerating the remainder, and then to permit the remainderman to terminate the trust. This is allowing, by indirection, that which this Court has consistently forbidden to be done directly. The Estates Act of 1947 (amending the Act of 1945), supra, prohibits the life tenant to so release and disclaim.</p>

Accordingly the Act expressly stated that it was to apply to releases <em>“heretofore </em>and hereafter delivered”. I agree, therefore, with the majority opinion that the Act is retroactive in its scope. I <em>cannot </em>agree, however, that that makes it unconstitutional as far as spendthrift trusts are concerned. It could be unconstitutional in that regard only if it impaired someone’s property right. Whose property right does it impair? The majority opinion says that it infringes upon the right of a donor or testator to have his property disposed of exactly as he directed; reliance is placed upon the ancient maxim: <em>“Gujus est dare, ejus est </em>disponere,”— the bestowér of a gift has the right to regulate its disposal. With the validity of that principle there cer<a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>tainly can be no quarrel, for the rights of an owner of property undoubtedly include the right to give it to another under such conditions and subject to such restrictions, not incompatible with the law, as he may see fit to impose. But the Act of 1945 does not impair that right which, indeed, the. testator here <em>actually exercised </em>when he made his will and provided therein that his bequests to the life tenants should be subject to spendthrift trust .provisions. By reason of that right on his part the life tenants could take and enjoy his bequests to them only “cum onere,” that is, subject to those spendthrift provisions. But the testator’s conceded right thus to dispose of his property as he saw fit is not incompatible with, and certainly does not destroy, the right of a beneficiary <em>to refuse the gift altogether. </em>That a beneficiary may renounce his legacy, and not be compelled to accept it against his will, was the very thing this Court expressly decided in <em>Bute’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/355/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="355 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="468943" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0170-01">355 Pa. 170</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.2d%20339" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="49 A.2d 339">49 A. 2d 339</a>, and, indeed, would seem so obvious as to preclude the need of discussion.</p>
