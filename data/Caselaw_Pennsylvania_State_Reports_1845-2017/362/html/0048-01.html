    <p id="b71-6" data-blocks='[["BL_71.11",71,[110,965,1152,1139]]]'>The relator, Edward Milewski, appeals from an order of the Superior Court entered September 29, 1948, dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. After entering a plea of not guilty, he was brought to trial on September 12, 1946, in the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Fayette County on an indictment containing several counts, to wit: assault and battery; assault and battery with intent to rob; robbery with accomplice; and robbery with violence. The jury retired on the afternoon of September 13, 1946, and on the same day found the defendant guilty of assault and battery with intent to rob and acquitted him of the other charges. It is alleged that immediately after the trial and before the jury returned its verdict the prisoner was removed from the courtroom to the county jail, where he was continuously detained until October 1, 1946, on which date he was sentenced to a term of from four to eight years in the Western Penitentiary. The records of the court are silent as to the whereabouts of the prisoner at the time the jury returned its verdict. He alleges that he never learned of this verdict until the day of his sentence.</p>
