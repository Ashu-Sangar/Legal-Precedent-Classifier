When, as in this case, the pleadings disclose no dispute of material fact, it is unnecessary to refer the record to the Board of Governance to aid the Court by finding facts and making recommendations. In any case the final disposition is by this Court: see our Rule 17(g), (h) and (i). In <em>Klensin v.

In considering the Attorney General’s charge that respondent violated his oath of office, it is necessary to refer briefly to the trial in the Quarter Sessions in which the challenged conduct occurred. The indictments charged violation by the indicted magistrate of the Magistrates’ Court Act of June 15,1937, P. L. 1743, 42 PS 1101, et seq.: (1) by granting continuances without stating in his docket a reason therefor as required by section 14 of the Act and (2) by reviewing, altering, modifying or remitting any sentence of fine or imprisonment or by altering any official decision in any case heard by him except in the presence of and with the written approval of the prosecutor as required by Section 43(a) of the Act. It was the second trial, the jury having disagreed on the first. The presiding judge and counsel for both sides were therefore familiar with the elements of the case and the probable course to be taken at the trial.</p>
    <p id="b227-5" data-blocks='[["BL_227.5",227,[157,1534,1150,757]],["BL_228.1",228,[264,269,1147,372]]]'>During the trial, the courtroom being crowded, respondent requested that seats be made available for character witnesses he proposed to call. The prosecution objected, at sidebar, to the relevance of character evidence and the entry into the courtroom of “a whole crowd” of witnesses if such evidence would be excluded. The judge sustained the objection stating “[I] direct that counsel shall not call these witnesses.” Respondent objected to the ruling and asked “leave to call the witnesses in the presence of the jury” and^make an offer to prove good reputation in their presence. The judge again ruled, “The request of counsel for the defendant is denied, and he is directed not to call the names of these witnesses, or to call them to the stand.” In spite <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>of that admonition, the following then occurred in the presence of the jury: “MR.

Respondent’s persistence to get before the jury as character witnesses the names of persons holding high office after the court ordered him not to do so was disrespectful and inex<a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>disable, 'He had no right to say, after the court had ruled, “. . .

It wasn’t intended as an affront.” But he again repeated the offense by his next statement, addressed to the same witnesses, “Thank you, gentlemen, very much.” There is no ambiguity about his statements. He understood the court’s ruling, the manifest scope of which was that he should not bring to the attention of the jury the names of the witnesses. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that respondent intentionally violated the express ruling of the court in its most essential implication. In such circumstances, disavowal has been considered of little avail where but one interpretation is possible.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Nor can the possible effect of the offense be excused by respondent’s submission, in his Answer to the Attorney General’s petition, in this court, that the trial judge’s exclusion of character witnesses was erroneous, a point not for decision in this proceeding.</p>

These rules have the force of statute and we must assume respondent’s familiarity with them. Rule 205 provides, “The canons <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> of ethics of the American Bar Association as from time to time existing, shall be and become standards of conduct for attorneys of the court. . . While those canons are declaratory of standards theretofore prevailing in this Commonwealth, their formal incorporation into our rules of civil procedure shows their importance. They provide, among other rules: “A lawyer should not offer evidence, which he knows the Court should reject, in order to get the same before the jury by argument for its admissibility, nor should he address to the Judge arguments upon any point not properly calling for determination by him. Neither should he introduce into an argument, addressed to the court, remarks or statements intended to influence the jury or bystanders.</p>

The responsive disclosure of his client’s whereabouts was misleading.

The Supreme Court of Minnesota said, “A counsel trying the cause of his client has, of course, rights as the representative of a suitor and as an officer of the court which must be respected; but those rights can never extend to disregarding or disobeying the rulings and orders of the court. If that were permitted the trial of a cause might become a mere farce. If he thinks a ruling against him is erroneous, he can do his duty to and save the rights of his client by taking an exception.

A counsel who would intentionally attempt such a mode of conducting a trial, especially after being warned by the court to desist, and that it would consider persistence in it a contempt, would undoubtedly be guilty of a contempt. . . .

It is because this distinction is well recognized that we find it unnecessary to discuss that part of the record stating what followed immediately after the retirement of the jury to deliberate upon its verdict. It appears that the deputy attorney general then called attention to the trial judge’s reference to respondent’s “affront to the court” on the day before; that respondent replied at some length and suggested “that inasmuch as this case is not over and may require further action on the part of defense counsel, especially if the jury would want any further instructions, that any further proceedings along those lines should naturally be postponed until after the verdict in this case. If, however, Your Honor thinks otherwise, I shall be glad to proceed.” The learned trial judge replied, “Gentlemen, I will give this matter consideration.” On the same day the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. The Attorney General, in his petition to this Court alleges that on the day following the verdict, his deputy presented, ex parte, to the trial judge in chambers a “Memorandum for the Court Concerning the Attorney General’s Motion to Have Lemuel B. Schofield, Esquire, adjudged in Contempt.” He avers that after <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>reading the paper the judge replied “that he believed his power to take any action had expired with the recording of the verdict of Not Guilty’ and that he could not take any action in the matter.” He also avers that the judge authorized him to express the judge’s view of the matter to the Supreme Court. In his answer the respondent replied that he was not advised of the proceeding so taken in the court below and challenged their efficacy for any purpose in the present case.. In the circumstances, we have not given them any effect in coming to our conclusion on the main question.</p>

We come now to the other serious charge made against the respondent, which, briefly stated, is that, in his speeches to the jury, he said that the members of the jury were judges of the law as well as the facts and, accordingly, had the <em>right </em>to disregard the trial judge’s instructions on the law, and made numerous statements challenging the law as stated and interpreted by the presiding judge. In this court, counsel for the parties differed as to the meaning of respondent’s opening and closing speeches to the jury and also, if we understand them correctly, as to the law defining the duty of the jury in criminal cases and particularly in this case as urged by respondent. In finding respondent guilty of breach of his obligation to the court and misbehavior in office, we have not taken into account this charge based on his speeches to the jury. We do this because it is apparent from respondent’s answer that he was under some misapprehension of the present authority of <em>Kane v. Common</em>wealth, <a href="/pa/89/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="89 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="1063195" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0522-01">89 Pa. 522</a> (1879).

There is no <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>dispute of fact as to what respondent said; it is the duty of this court to determine the effect of the words in the circumstances. As we understand them, they convict the respondent of attempting to persuade the jury that they had the right to disregard the trial judge’s instructions on the law. While much has been written on this subject<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> we have found no better statement of the rule that juries are not judges of the law than Justice Mitchell’s in the <em>McManus </em>ease from which we quote: “The notion is of modern growth, and arises undoubtedly from a perversion of the history and results of the celebrated contest over the right to return a general verdict, especially in cases of libel, which ended in Fox’s Bill, 32 Geo.

But the distinction between questions of law and fact, and the tribunals for their decision respectively, lies at the foundation of our juridical system, and there was no time when it did not exist. The rule, ad ques<a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>tionem facti non respondent judices, ad questionem juris non respondent juratores, was an ancient maxim in the days of Coke: Coke Litt., 155a; 8 Rep. 155a; 9 Rep. 13a; . . .” After referring at some length to the debates in the convention in which our constitution of 1790 was adopted, he continued: “It is impossible to read these various steps in the formulation of our fundamental law, without seeing that there was never at any time the intention to make or to consider juries as in any sense judges of the law. No such possible construction seems to have been apprehended until suggested by McKean, [in the convention] and the practically unanimous vote on his motion to add ‘under the direction of the court as in other cases,’ shows the feeling of the convention on this subject. McKean was at that time one of the foremost personages of the commonwealth, perhaps its best trained lawyer. He had studied in the Temple, and was familiar with the details of the legal controversy between Buller and Mansfield, on the one side, and Erskine, on the other, before Fox took it up as a matter of politics; and he knew, as Lewis and Wilson and Eoss and Sitgreaves and Addison and Findley and other leaders of the convention knew, that the contest was not for any control by the jury as judges of the law,— even Junius hardly ventured to put his denunciations of Mansfield in that form, — but for the right of applying the law to the facts and pronouncing the result by a general verdict. And such was the understanding of the convention, as it was of parliament two years later, and such the natural meaning of the language on which they finally settled to express their purpose. It puts beyond question the right to return a general verdict, nothing more. To cut the sentence in two, and say the jury are ‘to determine the law,’'is not only to pervert the meaning, but to nullify the other command that they are to determine ‘under the direction of the court.’ What they are to determine is. ‘the law and the facts as in other cases,’ <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>that is, the law as given to them by the court, and the facts as shown by the evidence. They are bound to take the law from the court; but, so taking it, they have the right to apply it to the facts as they may find them to be proved, and to announce the result of the whole, by a general verdict of guilty or not guilty. Any other construction would be totally at variance with the fundamental principles of our system of jurisprudence and with our settled and uncontested practice. It has never been claimed that the jury are to determine what evidence is admissible, or what witnesses competent; yet, if they are judges of the law, they should decide these often most important law points in a case.” At page 93 he said, “Whether the distinction between power and right be shadowy and unsubstantial in practice, or not, it is clear and vital, and I must repudiate such a confusion of logical as well as moral ideas. A jury may disregard the evidence, but no judge has ever said it had the legal right to do so; and if the disregard is of the weight of the evidence favorable to the prisoner, the court sets aside the verdict without hesitation; and even this court, though it does not pass upon the weight of evidence, does examine its sufficiency and may on that ground reverse without a new venire, [citing cases] ***** And in Commonwealth v. Sherry, an indictment for murder' growing out of the riots of 1844, removed by certiorari from the Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia and tried in the Nisi Prius in April, 1845, Justice Rogers charged the jury as follows: ‘You are, it is true, judges in a criminal case in one sense of both law and fact; for your verdict as in civil cases, must pass on law and fact together. If you acquit, you interpose a final bar to a second prosecution. . . . The popular impression is that this power . . . arises from a right on the jury’s part to decide the law as well as the facts, according to their own sense of right. But it arises from no such thing. It rests upon a fundamental principle of the common law that no man can <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>twice be put in jeopardy for the same offence. ... It is important for you to keep this distinction in mind, remembering that, while you have the physical power by an acquittal to discharge a defendant from further prosecution, you have no moral power to do so against the law laid down by the court. The sanctity of your conclusions, in case of an acquittal, arises, not from any inherent dominion on your part over the law, but from the principle that no man shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same offence, a principle that attaches equal sanctity to an acquittal produced by a blunder of the clerk, or an error of the attorney general. ... You will see, from these considerations, the great importance of the preservation, in criminal as well as in civil cases, of the maxim that the law belongs to the court, and the facts to the jury. My duty is therefore to charge you, that while you will in this case form your own judgment of the facts, you will receive the law as it is given to you by the court:’ Wharton on Homicide, App., 721. To the same effect, though less explicitly developed, are the rulings by Sergeant, J., of this court in Commonwealth v. Van Sickle, Brightly, 73; and by Hibson, C. J., in Commonwealth v. Harman, <a href="/pa/4/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="4 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="401909" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0269-01">4 Pa. 269</a>. ***** The idea of a difference in the rights and functions of juries in civil and criminal cases, as to the determination of the law, arose from a misconception of the controversy over the right to give a general verdict, and was an error for which there is no respectable English authority, and which the best American authorities have overwhelmingly disapproved.” The language used by Chief Justice Sharswood in the opinion in <em>Kane v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/89/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="89 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="1063195" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0522-01">89 Pa. 522</a> (1879) was, as Justice Mitchell observed, “less guarded than was usual with that eminent jurist” and was based on <em>State v.
