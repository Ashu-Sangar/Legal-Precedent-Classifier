If the right to accompany the jury during a viewing is a fundamental right essential to due process of law, the prisoner cannot waive it<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> any more than he can waive, after pleading “not guilty,” the right to be tried by a jury of twelve qualified persons. In the <em>Westwood </em>case we said: “In Com. v. Snyder, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20N.E.%20376" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="185 N.E. 376">185 N.

Since it was not error to point out to the jury the whole of the locus in quo, it was not error to point out any part or parts of that whole. The significance of what the jury saw depended entirely on the sworn testimony which they heard in court. For the trial judge to have permitted any testimony to be received, or any discussion to be indulged in, or any argument to be made <em>during the view, </em>would háve been improper.

Other courts have taken the position that <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>the view is <em>not </em>a part of the trial.

A trial implies a contest of opposing parties in the presence of the judge. There is no contest between the parties when a viewing takes place. The trial judge may or may not be present, as he chooses. Yet there cannot be a judicial trial without a trial judge. The attorneys for the respective parties are usually present but they take no active part. Neither can offer or object to, any evidence, or ask any questions. They must remain passive and mute. The prisoner, if present, must do likewise. The situation is analogous to an agreed-to temporary cessation of hostilities between opposing armies on a battlefield. During the cessation the soldiers of the opposing armies make no hostile move. A flag of truce is in the ascendant and is respected. In one sense the period of cessation of conflict may be considered a part of the battle; in another and stricter sense of the word it is not a part of the battle; the battle is temporarily suspended.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> So in <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>viewing the scene of a crime by the jury the trial is temporarily suspended, for there is no clashing of opposing parties or opposing counsel and no offer of evidence or ashing of questions.</p>

Neither the State nor the Federal Constitution declares that an accused must be present at a viewing of the scene of his alleged crime or at every feature of the trial if a viewing is considered a feature of the trial. Section 9 of the State Bill of Bights provides as follows: “In all criminal prosecutions the accused hath a right to be heard by himself and his counsel, to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to meet the witnesses face to face, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and, in prosecutions by indictment or information, a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the vicinage; he cannot be compelled to give evidence against himself, nor can he be deprived of his life, liberty or property, unless by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.” The 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution forbids any state depriving any person of “life, liberty, or property without due process of law”. For a jury to view the scene of a defendant’s alleged crime in his absence does not violate the defendant’s right “to meet the witnesses face to face, or to be represented by himself or his counsel”. At the viewing there are no witnesses for the <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>accused to face. All witnesses against him must take the witness stand and be sworn and confronted by him. The Constitution so requires. Wigmore on Evidence, Third Edition, Yol. 5, Section 1397, says: “There never was at common law any recognized right to an indispensable thing called Confrontation <em>as distinguished from Cross-examination. </em>There <em>was </em>a right to cross-examination as indispensable, and that right was involved in and secured by confrontation; it was the same right under different names.”</p>
    <p id="b291-3" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[130,835,1152,1417]]]'>The defendant’s right of confrontation is not violated by a viewing of the scene of the crime in his absence. Justice Cardozo, speaking for the United States Supreme Court, said in <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em><a href="/us/291/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="291 U.S. 97" data-case-ids="1498121" data-case-paths="/us/291/0097-01">supra:</a> “We assume in aid of the petitioner that in a prosecution for a felony the defendant has the privilege under the Fourteenth Amendment to be present in his own person whenever his presence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fulness of his opportunity to defend against the charge. Thus, the privilege to confront one’s accusers and cross-examine them face to face is assured to a defendant by the Sixth Amendment in prosecutions in the federal courts (Gaines v. Washington, <a href="/us/277/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="277 U.S. 81" data-case-ids="3902610" data-case-paths="/us/277/0081-01">277 U. S. 81</a>) and in prosecutions in the state courts is assured very often by the constitutions of the states. For present purposes we assume that the privilege is reinforced by the Fourteenth Amendment, though this has not been squarely held. (Citing cases) . . . the presence of the defendant [at the trial] satisfies the test that was put forward a moment ago as basic and decisive. It bears, or may fairly be assumed to bear, a relation, reasonably substantial, to his opportunity to defend. Nowhere in the decisions of this court is there a dictum, and still less a ruling, that the Fourteenth Amendment assures the privilege of presence when presence would be useless, or the benefit but a shadow.”</p>

      <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>The fact that the knowledge gained by the jurors from the viewing of the scene of the crime may have some part in enabling them to reach a verdict does not make it imperative that the defendant be present. There is much other useful knowledge possessed by jurors which may enable them to reach a just verdict, and which may have been acquired long before they were summoned as jurors. One juror may be an expert in ballistics. He may have gained his knowledge by years of study and experience. This knowledge may influence his decision as to the truth or falsity of certain testimony given at the trial as to whether or not the fatal bullet was fired from the defendant’s revolver. Is the defendants right to a fair trial impaired because this knowledge was gained by a juror when defendant was not personally present? Any knowledge which a juror possesses may influence his judgment on any matter submitted to him for decision, just as the knowledge an appellate court judge possesses on a certain subject may influence his decision in a case involving that subject. It may happen that some of the jurors have long resided near the scene of the crime and are entirely familiar with it. Or, it may have happened that several or all of the jurors visited the scene shortly after the crime was committed, as sensational murders often attract people to its locus. By so visiting the scene no one would be disqualified to serve as a juror should he be thereafter summoned as such, nor would he be expected to forget his knowledge of the scene when later it becomes his duty to deliberate upon the guilt of the accused. The fact that a juror gains some knowledge of the case by viewing its locus in defendant’s absence gives the latter no cause for complaint, for the simple and obvious reason that the defendant’s mute presence at the scene when the juror gained his knowledge could not have affected in the slightest degree the latter’s <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>acquisition of knowledge. “Reason is the life of the law”, said Sir Edward Coke.</p>

There would be far more reason to hold that to permit a witness to repeat in court an alleged “dying declaration” of the defendant’s victim violated the rights of the defendant to “confront” his accusers, yet the courts have uniformly held that the admission of “dying declarations” do not violate any constitutional right of the accused. Wigmore on Evidence, Third Edition, Volume 5, Section 1398, says: “The use of <em>dying declarations </em>has been thus passed upon, and without any dissenting rulings.” Citing <em>Mattow v. U.

There is nothing he could do if he were there, and almost nothing he could gain. The only shred of advantage would be to make certain that the jury had been brought to the right place and had viewed the right scene. If he felt any doubt about this, he could examine the bailiffs at the trial and learn what they had looked at. ... If the bailiffs were to bear false witness as to the place they had shown, the lie would be known to the jury. There is no immutable principle of justice that secures protection to a defendant against so shadowy a risk.”</p>

However, to do so was not prejudicial error. Had there been an issue raised at the trial as to whether the appellant has committed a common law robbery or merely one of the statutory offenses proscribed in section 704, there would be some substance to appellant’s complaint. But no such issue was raised. The evidence as to the commission of common law robbery by defendant was neither contested nor contestable. When Poster upon entering the Peasterville Tavern in criminal concert with Darcy and Zietz, went behind the bar, pointed his gun and said: “This is a stick up. Get ’em up”, he and they thereby publicly proclaimed, in effect, that they were engaging in a common law robbery; that is, in forcibly and feloniously taking from the person or presence of another money or goods of any value by means of violence or putting that other person in fear. Both the defendant and his confederates made statements admitting that they entered the tavern for the purpose of committing violent robbery. Under this evidence for a jury not to have found that these men were engaged in a common law robbery would have been perverse. The offense of robbery as it was known in the common law (4 Blackstone 242) and as it has been known to lawyers and laymen is so easily recognized that it seldom <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>if ever requires formal definition.

He must intend to make his felonious venture successful and it cannot be successful until he has made his escape.” We also.said: “The jury was justified in finding that Kelly’s shooting of an officer in order to effectuate his flight from the scene of his attempted robbery was so identified with that initial crime as to make the homicide one committed in the attempted perpetration of the felony of robbery.”</p>

The District Attorney offered this evidence for the following purpose: “1. To show identity. 2. To show that the hold-up at the <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>Deacon Inn had been performed in the same general method as the hold-np at the Feasterville Tavern. 3. To establish a course of conduct. 4. To fix the presence of Darcy and his companions at or near the scene of the Feasterville Tavern hold-up. 5. To furnish the jury with evidence to be considered in connection with possible punishment.” There is no error in the reception of this evidence. It is always permissible to show that a defendant and his confederates in a murder case have entered upon a plan or a system for the commission of murder and related felonies. Proof that they did so is relevant to the issue raised of the guilt of the crime specifically charged in the indictment on which they are tried.</p>
