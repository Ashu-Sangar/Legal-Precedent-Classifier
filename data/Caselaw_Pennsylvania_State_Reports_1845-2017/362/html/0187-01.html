This appears to be a complaint that the receiver paid Meltzer an amount awarded to him. As the agreement bound Rubin to submit, he cannot be heard to complain that the amount awarded was paid promptly.</p>
    <p id="b212-3" data-blocks='[["BL_212.3",212,[272,267,1148,427]]]'>
      <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>The second and third assignments complain that the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction. An arbitrator must of course keep within the agreement: see <em>Goldstein et al. v.

Assuming that such a complaint can be made at this stage, we have examined the brief in support of these assignments but can find no support for the contention.</p>
    <p id="b212-4" data-blocks='[["BL_212.4",212,[270,714,1149,758]]]'>The fourth and last assignment is to the confirmation of the receiver’s account. We find nothing in appellant’s argument supporting the contention the court should not have confirmed the account. The parties agreed to a common law arbitration. Rubin will not be heard to complain that in ascertaining the amount due Meltzer, the arbitrator took October 26, 1940, as the convenient date from which to figure the obligation due Meltzer, because it was on that date that Rubin required two of his partners to leave the office maintained by the firm. That conclusion by the arbitrator is not a holding that October 26, 1940, was the date of the legal dissolution and not May 16, 1941, as was held in <em>Scheckter et al. v. Rubin et al., </em><a href="/pa/349/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="349 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="458270,458593" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0102-01,/pa/349/0102-02">349 Pa. 102</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20A.2d%20467" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="36 A.2d 467">36 A. 2d 467</a> (1944).</p>
