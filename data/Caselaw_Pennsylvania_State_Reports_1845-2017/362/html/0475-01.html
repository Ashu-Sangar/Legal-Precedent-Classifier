The plaintiff complains that, if the construction of the Easton approach be proceeded with, he will suffer an increased tax burden through the loss of revenues by both the City of Easton and the Easton School District from other heretofore taxable properties to be acquired by the Commission for use in the bridge approach.

It is the plaintiff’s contention that in the absence of proof that that street was open at the time of the prior recording of the deeds of the abutting property owners (which by their descriptions referred to the sides of that street as boundaries), such owners did not acquire title to any part of the street but the title thereto passed to and is in the Borough under its deed therefor. It is the Commission’s contention that the abutting owners acquired title to the middle of the street because it was dedicated to public use by the prior recording of a plan of lots designating the street and the abutting properties in relation thereto, to which plan the deed to the Borough <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>and all of the deeds to the abutting property owners expressly refer; that the abutting owners acquired title to the bed of the one street in question; and that the Commission may acquire through condemnation the right to overpass that street as well as all of the other four streets where the reversionary interest in the portions to be overpassed concededly is in the abutting owners.</p>

The Commission thereupon filed an amended answer, setting up the Act of 1949, supra, as conclusive of the issues, here involved, adversely to the plaintiffs. The Borough of Morrisville filed a reply to the Commission’s amended answer wherein the Borough alleged that Act No. 35 is void and of no effect because it undertakes to change the terms of the compacts without the approval of the State of New Jersey and the Congress of the United States.

(2) The Borough of Morrisville having refused its consent to the Commission’s occupation of its streets for bridge-approach purposes, can the <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>Commission, within the authority of the compacts, overpass said streets, the use whereof as highways will be unaffected thereby? (3) Is the Pennsylvania Act of Assembly, No. 35, approved March 31, 1949, which eliminates the necessity of the Commission’s obtaining consent to its occupancy or overpassing of the streets of a Pennsylvania municipality invalid as altering the compacts between Pennsylvania and New Jersey without the consent of the latter or of the Congress of the United States?</p>
    <p id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.4",506,[279,829,1147,966]]]'>To these, the intervenors add several more questions, only one of which needs be noticed, viz., Does the Pennsylvania Act of Assembly, No. 35, approved March 31, 1949, constitute local and special legislation in violation of Article III, Section 7, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania? The remaining questions stated by the intervenors, exclusive of those stated by the plaintiff as hereinbefore given, involve assumptions of fact not in accordance with the record, namely, that the Commission intends “to close and fill in” the streets in Morrisville which it proposes to overpass. As already stated, the bill of complaint avers, “. . . the approach . . ., in accordance with detailed engineering plans adopted by the Commission, will cross said streets in the said Borough of Morrisville by overpasses but not actually occupy the said streets which will remain open for all public uses.” Such questions need not, therefore, be considered.</p>

Act No. 35 is not an amendment of the compacts, as we shall hereinafter see. But, in any event, an amendment thereof would be a matter for the contracting States subject, of course, to the congressional consent required by Article I, Sec. 10, cl. 3. of the Constitution of the United States, just as was <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>done in the ease of the supplemental compact. The granting of the required congressional consent did not serve, as the intervenors argue, to make the compacts laws of the United States. They remained what they had been before congressional approval was accorded them, namely, statutorily evidenced agreements between the two contracting States. The inhibition of Article I, Sec. 10, cl. 3, of the Constitution that “No State shall, without the Consent of Congress . . . enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State ...” presupposes <em>State </em>action in the premises. And, while consent of Congress is required in the circumstances to validate the State action, it continues, nonetheless, to be State action. In <em>People v. Central Railroad, </em>79 U. S. (12 Wall.) 455, 456, it was held that the consent of Congress to a compact between States did not make the compact a statute of the United States so as to justify a writ of error to a State court on the ground that a <em>statute </em>of the United States was thereby drawn in question. Nor does the ease of <em>Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission v. Colburn, </em><a href="/us/310/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="310 U.S. 419" data-case-ids="6139576" data-case-paths="/us/310/0419-01">310 U. S. 419</a>, which the intervenors cite, derogate from the principle presently pertinent. It is true that in the <em>Colburn </em>case the ruling in <em>People v. Central Railroad, </em>supra, was modified to the extent that jurisdiction of a case involving a compact between States was taken on certiorari by the United States Supreme Court, <em>not, </em>however, because a <em>statute </em>of the United States was thus drawn in question, but because the congressional sanction of the compact under Article I, Sec. 10, cl. 3, of the Constitution “involves a federal Title, right, privilege or immunity’ ” which, when set up in a State court, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court on certiorari by virtue of Section 237(b) of the Judicial Code, 28 USCA §344.</p>

Congressional consent is not necessary to every step taken by a State in an effort to carry out a duly approved compact with another State. In <em>Virginia v. Tennessee, </em><a href="/us/148/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="148 U.S. 503" data-case-ids="3567361" data-case-paths="/us/148/0503-01">148 U.

Actually, the statute is in aid of the Commonwealth’s expeditious fulfillment of its undertakings in the compacts. The provisions of Act No. 35 do not tend to increase the political power of the contracting States in encroachment upon or interference with the just supremacy of the United States. Congress is therefore not concerned Avith the legislative implementation which Pennsylvania has adopted in <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>order to execute fully and faithfully its undertakings in the compacts which already have congressional approval.</p>

Article III of the original compact, to which New Jersey subscribed, contemplated that the Commission might secure authority from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the State of New Jersey to appropriate property of a municipality by virtue of the power of eminent domain. Thus, Article III prohibited the Commission’s taking municipal property without the consent of the municipality “unless expressly authorized so to do by the Commonwealth or State in which such municipality is located.” To this, also, the consent of Congress attached. It is evident, therefore, that all that Act No. 35 does in such regard is to empower the Commission to appropriate municipal property, without obtaining the municipality’s consent, in fulfillment of the possible power so to do as anticipated by Article III of the original compact. No right of the State of New Jersey nor any of its citizens is affected adversely by the provisions of Act No. 35. And, neither the plaintiffs nor any owners of property to be condemned by the Commission for the construction of the project have any standing to object that New Jersey has not formally consented to Act No. 35. Incidentally, while New Jersey is understandably not a party to the record in the instant proceeding, the Attorney General of that State appeared at bar upon the oral argument of this case and expressly associated himself with all that the Attorney General of Pennsylvania had said in support of the Commonwealth’s action (including Act No. 35) designed to carry out the terms and intendment of the compacts.</p>

It is merely an agency instituted by the sovereign for the purpose of carrying out in detail the objects of government — essentially a revocable agency — subject to legislative control “which may destroy its very existence with the mere breath of arbitrary decision”. . . .’” <em>Pittsburg’s Petition, </em>supra, was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States sub nom. <em>Hunter v.

The State, therefore, at its pleasure may modify or withdraw all such powers, may take without compensation such property, hold it itself, or vest it in other agencies, expand or contract the territorial area, unite the whole or a part of it with another municipality, repeal the charter and destroy the corporation.” See, also, <em>City of Pawhuska v.

Ill, Sec. 7) against the passage of local or special laws. So far as the bridges, here involved, and their locations are concerned, little more need be said in regard to the intervenors’ contention in this connection than to point out that the same constitutional provision expressly excepts from its inhibition laws relating to “. . . the erection of bridges crossing streams which form boundaries between this and any other. State.” And, of course, such is the very nature of the bridges which, together with their necessary approaches, the Commission was created to construct and operate. Indeed, in the light of the particular river to be spanned and the arteries of travel on either side to be joined, the undertaking could not be otherwise than local in its setting. Yet, the Act is general in its terms and scope and that satisfies the constitutional intendment. What Mr. Justice Bbown said in <em>Pittsburg’s Petition, </em>supra, with reference to the consolidation statute, which was there upheld, is peculiarly apposite here, viz., “That [the Act] applies now, and for the present can apply, only <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>to thé cities of Pittsburg and Allegheny, and that it was passed for them, can make no difference if the legislation is general in form and substance, and is not within the prohibition of the constitution: Wheeler v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/77/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="77 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="436265" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0338-01">77 Pa. 338</a>.” Nor is Act No. 35 local or special in its authorization to the Commission to enter upon streets and highways. Such legislative procedure has long been sustained as being not in violation of the local and special law prohibition of the State Constitution, for, while such highways are necessarily “local so far as the situation of any portion is concerned, . . . each as a whole may be considered state wide, for it is built and maintained for the use and benefit of all the people of the State and its location is merely incidental to the great system of which it forms a part; . . .”: <em>State Highway Commissioner v. Chambersburg &amp; Bedford Turnpike Co., </em><a href="/pa/242/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="242 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="998723" data-case-paths="/pa/242/0171-01">242 Pa. 171</a>, 174, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.%20938" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="88 A. 938">88 A. 938</a>. In that case the Highway Act of May 31,1911, which authorized the Highway Department to purchase or condemn any turnpike or toll road forming part of a State highway was attacked as being local and special legislation. The contention was rejected by this Court in an opinion by Mr. Justice Moschzisker from which the above quotation is taken.</p>
