Their presence was noticed and the police were called. Two officers entered the house, arrested appellant and his accomplice, and then ordered them to precede the officers out of the house. Right after they did so, one of the prisoners remarked, “Stay where you are. Don’t anyone move.” DiPofi covered the officers with a gun and then backed away and directed the officers to enter their car. The officers made a break and DiPofi fired at them, fatally wounding officer Chemelynski, who died four days later.</p>

The objection was overruled and the evidence was admitted, accompanied by the following instruction by the judge: “These other records, 15 of them,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> have been received in evidence for another reason altogether and I will stress that again in connection with my charge, but I want you to have it in mind at this point.

You are only to treat them as an aid to you, if so they be, if you find the defendant guilty of first degree murder, and then in consideration of the penalty that you will impose for that offense, if you so find. Please keep that definitely in mind.” In his charge to the jury, the judge stated that the records “were received in evidence solely for the purpose of assisting you in determining the penalty to be inflicted upon the defendant, if you find him guilty of murder in the first degree and to enable you to know what manner of man he is.

L. 759, which gave a jury adjudging a defendant guilty of murder in the first degree the right to fix the penalty of death or life imprisonment, and we said: “That act introduced a new feature in the procedure of homicide trials . . . Does the Act of 1925 open a new field of evidence to the extent here claimed? . . . Obviously, the legislature, in directing the jury to fix the penalty and providing a new penalty, intended that the jury should have some guide in determining which punishment to inflict.” We held that evidence as to prior convictions might be offered “in aggravation of the penalty”, but that this evidence “must be strictly limited” to that purpose. “But in no case should a record of such criminal acts such as pickpocketry, adultery, embezzling, perjury, or others of a similar nature be used in aggravation of the penalty.” We added: “Where the trial judge is convinced that such [previous] crime was committed for profit, such as the crimes of highway robbery, burglary, murder for life insurance, bank holdups, and the like, and that the criminals are habitual offenders against society, then prior convictions may properly be received by the jury as an aid in determining the penalty to be inflicted.” In that same case we discussed the Act of March 15, 1911, P.

The subject matter of the Act of 1911 is the <em>cross-examination </em>of a defendant when testifying in his own behalf. The subject matter of the Act of 1947 is <em>affirmative proof </em>by the Commonwealth at the. trial of <em>any person charged with crime </em>whether or not he is called as a witness in his own behalf.

The English <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>Act applies <em>only </em>when a person who is charged with a crime <em>becomes a witness in Ms own behalf </em>and it relates solely to the questions that may be asked him on <em>cross-examination. </em>The Pennsylvania Act of 1947 applies <em>to </em>any person charged with <em>crime </em>whether he testifies in his own behalf or not, and defines what <em>affirmative </em>evidence may be used against him. While §1 f (i) of the English Criminal Evidence Act reads somewhat like the last subsection of the Pennsylvania Act of 1947, a comparison of the corresponding sections shows a substantial difference between them.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The meaning of sub-section 3 of the Pennsylvania Act of 1947 is obscure and has already caused confusion in the administration of criminal law in Pennsylvania.</p>

Judge McNatjgher in overruling this contention held that the phrase “degree of the offense” in the Act of 1947 meant the heinousness of the offense and that therefore the jury was justified in considering evidence of these other crimes in order to ascertain what sort of. a man the defendant was to the end that appropriate punishment might be <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>inflicted as between death and life imprisonment. As we have already pointed out, Judge McNaugher in admitting the record of the 15 unrelated burglaries instructed the jury that they were not to consider that evidence as in any way indicating the guilt of the accused but only in determining the proper penalty in the event the jury should find him guilty of murder in the first degree. In his charge to the jury he said as to these prior convictions: “They are in no circumstances to be considered in weighing the question of the defendant’s guilt or innocence, or the degree of the offense.”</p>
    <p id="b259-3" data-blocks='[["BL_259.4",259,[152,933,1149,921]]]'>In his opinion refusing a new trial Judge Mc-Naugher interpreted the third paragraph of the Act of 1947 as permitting “the introduction of the records of prior convictions . . . to shqw aggravation of the penalty for first degree - murder.” He said: “The language, ‘degree of the offense’ cannot and does not in the third exception (Act of 1947) refer to first or second degree murder.” In other words, the trial judge after instructing the jury as to what constituted murder in the first degree and what constituted murder in the second degree, charged the jury in effect that subsection 3 of the Act of 1947 divided murder in the first degree into two degrees for the purpose of making a difference in the penalties to be imposed, the penalty of death or the penalty of life imprisonment, depending upon the record of the defendant in respect to being a previous offender against society.</p>

Logic appears to be on the side of the appellant, who contends that evidence of other crimes cannot under subsection 3 of the Act of. 1947 be admitted unless they are relevant to the guilt of the accused, and since it is' the established law that <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>evidence of unrelated crimes are not admissible to prove the guilt of an accused, the admission in this case of the evidence of the unrelated crimes was in error.

We find nowhere in the opinions of this Court discussing the Act of 1925 any reference to the comparative heinousness of two distinct murders in the first degree. <em>Every </em>wilful and deliberate and premeditated murder is a <em>heinous </em>offense. It is with the exception of treason the highest offense known to the law, and it would be to introduce an absurd anomaly into the law to divide murder in the first degree into <em>first degree </em>first degree murder and <em>second degree </em>first degree murder. It is now sometimes difficult for juries to comprehend the difference between first degree murder and second degree murder. It would certainly add to their confusion if the court was obliged to tell the jury that after it decided the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, it should then decide whether <em>that </em>“murder in <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>the first degree” was murder in the . first degree <em>of the first degree, </em>or murder in the first degree, <em>of the second degree </em>for the purpose of fixing the appropriate penalty.</p>

His interpretation of “degree of the offense” as used in the Act of 1947 was manifestly strained and it was forced because of the fact that the phrase “degree of the offense” as applied to murder has for a long period of time had an established meaning and it has never before been used as having any reference to the comparative heinousness of <em>two </em>“degrees” of the crime of murder in the first degree, which the court below believed subsection 3 of the Act of 1947 had created.</p>

Since murder is the <em>only </em>crime which in Pennsylvania is divided into degrees, the phrase “degree of the offense” as used in the Act of 1947 must mean the degree of the <em>murder </em>found to have been committed! To interpret the phrase the “degree of the offense” to mean the heinousness of the crime is without warrant in any statute or <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>in any decision of this court. It is also made in contravention of Section 33 of Article III of the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P.

He also said: “If, as was strongly urged by tbe defendant’s counsel at tbe argument, tbe legislature, in passing tbe Act of 1947, clearly intended to bar all affirmative proof by tbe commonwealth of independent crimes or convictions, other than tbe crime for which tbe defendant is on trial, then tbe Act of 1925, as re-enacted, supra, becomes ineffectual and, since we have no statute in Pennsylvania permitting piece-meal verdicts, our juries Would be deprived of tbe evidence, so necessary, to properly fulfill their function of assessing the penalty.”</p>

Subsections 1 and 2 of the Act are connected by the conjunction “or” while subsections 2 and 3 are <em>not </em>so connected. Subsection 1 and subsection 2 are obviously related, because just before the word “or” at the end of subsection 1, there is a semicolon, while at the end of subsection 2 there is a period. Since in the English Act, which the Act of 1947 resembles in its' phraseology, the three sections are all connected by the conjunction “or”, the question arises whether or not subsection 3 is to be read as a categorical imperative or whether it is to be read as subject to the restrictive conjunction “unless” <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>which appears at the end of section 1.

Since evidence is never “admitted” on cross-examination, the amending portion of the title is not germane to the title it purports to amend. Neither is the 1947 “amendment” to the Act of 1911 germane to the Act of 1911.

If an act had been passed in 1911 regulating the use of explosives in the <em>demolition </em>of buildings an act passed in 1947 prescribing what material could or could not be used in the <em>construction </em>of buildings would certainly not be germane to the earlier act. The “admission” of evidence refers to the admission of affirmative evidence in chief and not to what may be asked of a defendant on cross-examination.

In his opinion Justice. Mitchell said.: “It is true that under this clause of the constitution the rule is well settled that the title need not be an index to the contents of the bill, and that, in general, entitling an act a supplement to another will be sufficient to cover any subject that is <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>reasonably germane to the purpose and scope of the latter.

It was here said that the usual meaning of food does not include drink, and that if the word was so used in the title there should have been some plain indication of the sense in which the term was employed. The purpose of the constitutional provision was to require that the title should inform legislators and others of the contents of the law, therefore the words used in the title must be understood in their common signification, and if any other meaning is to be given them by a definition adopted by the Legislature, there must be some indication of this in the title.</p>

The immediate repeal of this entire statute is highly recommended.” In an article in the Erie County Legal Journal for December 26, 1947, Volume 30, No. 47, as to the Acts of.1911 and 1947 there appears this statement: “The final proviso of the 1947 amendment which reads, ‘The proof that he has committed or has been convicted of 'such other offense is admissible evidence as to the guilt or degree of the offense wherewith he is then charged’ is of more doubtful méaning. It may be limited to murder cases where evidence of prior crimes could aid the jury in granting either, death or life in' prison as the penalty for first degree murder or it may become an extensive exception to the Act of 1911. Time and many cases will tell. In any event, if Professor Wigmore considered the Act of 1911 per se ‘a vicious piece of legislation’ I cannot but wonder what he would have thought of the 1947 amendment.”</p>

If it was intended that it be given a wider construction so as to exclude all evidence of prior offenses and convictions or admissions of unrelated criminal acts, regardless as to whether by affirmative testimony or by cross-examination, then, in that event, we would be inclinéd to hold the act to be unconstitutional.”</p>

A little later the Act of 1911 was directly nullified judicially in a case where the district attorney, on the trial of an indictment for murder, cross-examined the defendant in a manner designed to bring out his conviction of prior crimes. Even though neither of the exceptions under the Act of 1911, necessary to make such evidence admissible, were present, this Court found no error in the district attorney’s cross-examination and upheld the defendant’s conviction of first degree murder with penalty of death: see <em>Commonwealth v.

The opinion for this Court in the <em>Flood </em>case justified the ruling on the ground that the Act of 1925 had “modified” the Act of 1911 “as it relates to a phase of homicide trials.” The anomaly of the situation is apparent when it is recognized that the Act of 1911 was not so “modified” with respect to trials for all other crimes.</p>

Thereafter and until the Act of 1947, supra, we had a situation in this State with respect to prior offense evidence, so made admissible against a defendant in a homicide case, that amounted to little less than a fanciful illusion. A jury was supposed to keep separate in its “adjudicating” mind the evidence it heard as to the defendant’s guilt and, in its “penalty-fixing” mind, the evidence as to the defendant’s prior unrelated criminal offenses. The thing could, and no doubt has, actually worked out in practice in a truly shocking way. It is not beyond the range of possibility that where, upon a trial for murder, the defendant’s guilt is doubtful under the evidence, the balance may be tilted in favor of a conviction because of the subconscious effect of the impression made on the minds of the jury by the evidence of the defendant’s prior criminal record. If anyone should think the possibility overdrawn, see observation by a Pennsylvania assistant district attorney in his complaint against the Act of 1947, supra, in 22 Temple Law Quarterly 220 (October 1948), where he says in the first paragraph that,— “Following the passage of the 1947 amendment to the Act of 19111 have seen habitual criminals set free only because the jurors had no knowledge of the defendants’ criminal records.” In <em>Commonwealth v.

Thenceforth, evidence of a defendant’s prior offenses was not <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>to-be brought out <em>either </em>in cross-examination of the defendant or as a part of the Commonwealth’s case in chief, except in the situations specified by the Act of 1911 to which the Act of 1947 added a third exception where such evidence is also admissible. The proscription ordained by the Act of 1911 related alone to evidence adduced in the cross-examination of a defendant, and very naturally so. Up until then, and for some time following, evidence of prior unrelated offenses was not thought of as being admissible on a trial, for a subsequent offense except where there was evidentiary relation between the prior and subsequent offenses tending to show the defendant’s guilt of the offense for which he was on trial: see <em>Commonwealth v. Weiss, </em><a href="/pa/284/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="284 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1092080" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0105-01">284 Pa. 105</a>, 109-110, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20A.%20403" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="130 A. 403">130 A. 403</a>, and cases there cited. The practice of receiving evidence of prior convictions in the Commonwealth’s case on the question of penalty was, of course, new with the decision in the <em>Parker </em>case, supra, in 1928. Quite properly, therefore, when the question of revitalizing the Act of 1911 with respect to its prohibition of evidence of prior convictions upon cross-examination of the defendant (which the <em>Flood </em>case had allowed) came up for consideration, it was but logical to have the amendatory Act also abrogate the practice fathered by the <em>Parker </em>case.</p>

The new third exception in the Act of 1947 reads as follows: “The proof that he has com<a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>mitted or has been convicted of such other offense is admissible evidence as to the guilt or the degree of the offense wherewith he was then charged.”</p>

The fact of the matter is that, save for the three words “or the degree” contained in the third exception of the Act of 1947, the provision is identical with the first exception of the English Criminal Evidence Act of 1898. Indeed, when the bill was introduced in the legislature, the third exception of the proposed Act of 1947 <em>was exactly the same </em>as the first exception of the English Act. But, during the course of the Act’s passage, the third exception was amended by the addition of the words “or the degree”; and, as so amended, the Act was finally passed and signed by the Governor. The reason for the amendment requires neither refined reasoning nor speculation for the discovery of the obvious answer. Unlike the English, we have <em>two </em>degrees of murder, and, inasmuch as first degree murder may depend upon proof of the defendant’s perpetration or attempt to perpetrate a particular independent offense, the amendment was to make certain that the Commonwealth would not be prevented in any instance, because of the inhibitions of the Act, from showing the independent offense essential to making the homicide, charged, murder of the first degree. It should not be overlooked that the only place where the breakdown of the historically just provisions of the Act of 1911 has taken place has been exclusively in the field of homicide trials. What was more natural, then, than that any proof necessary to find a murder to be of the first degree should not be rendered inadmissible <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>by virtue of any of tbe provisions of tbe Act of 1947?

The error is apparent where the majority- opinion gives as an illustration of the specification required of a title the following: “An attorney engaged to defend a person accused of crime and who did not plan to- call his client to the <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>witness stand would, if lie read the title to the Act of 1947 which-purports to be only an amendment to the Act of 1911,; conclude that he had no occasion to examine the body of the Act Of 1947.” The title to an Act is not required to.be an index or synopsis of its contents <em>Commonwealth v. American Gas Company, </em><a href="/pa/352/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="352 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="464119" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0113-01">352 Pa. 113</a>, 118-119, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20A.2d%20161" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="42 A.2d 161">42 A. 2d 161</a>; <em>Poor District Case (No. 1), </em><a href="/pa/329/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="329 Pa. 390" data-case-ids="1181501" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0390-01">329 Pa. 390</a>, 399-402, <a href="/citations/?q=197%20A.%20334" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="197 A. 334">197 A. 334</a>. “It has been decided over and over again”, as was said in <em>Gilbert’s Estate-, </em>supra, at p. 650, “that the title need not be a general index to the contents of an act . . .”</p>
    <p id="b280-4" data-blocks='[["BL_280.4",280,[276,876,1148,1132]]]'>The purpose of the constitutional requirement was that the title should give notice of the subject dealt with (in this instance, the admissibility and inadmissibility of certain evidence relating to the defendant in a criminal'trial) so that a reasonably inquiring state of mind 'would lead one to examine the body of the Act: <em>Kelley v. Earle, </em><a href="/pa/325/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="325 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="1172236" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0337-01">325 Pa. 337</a>, 353-354, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.%20140" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="190 A. 140">190 A. 140</a>, where it was said that, — “We have had this Article and Section [Art. Ill, Sec. 3] before us so often that it is scarcely necessary to discuss the subject at length: [citing cases].”. The title is not supposed-to be a compendium of information for the use of practicing attorneys after a bill has become law. The notice intended is for the benefit of legislators and all other interested persons during the passage of an Act so as “to prevent Tog-rolling’ and fraud, trickery, or. surprise in legislation”: Buckalew dn the Constitution, p. 68.' For an interesting-discussion of the true purpose of the particular constitutional provision see opinion of Chief Justice Kephart in <em>Commonwealth v. Stofchek, </em><a href="/pa/322/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="322 Pa. 513" data-case-ids="1167881" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0513-01">322 Pa. 513</a>, 517, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20840" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="185 A. 840">185 A. 840</a>.</p>

Hammond, </em>supra, cited also by the majority opinion in support of its. illustration above-quoted, the title of the Act there under consideration was. defective because the date of approval of the original Act, as recited by the title of the amending Act, was incorrect. There was no such <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>Act of such date and, of course, the title was fatally defective.</p>
    <p id="b281-4" data-blocks='[["BL_281.5",281,[136,388,1148,539]]]'>It is not disputed in the instant case that the fifteen separate indictments , received ih evidence against the defendant over his objection all covered unrelated crimes, — unconnected with the crime for which the defendant was on trial. They were, therefore, not admissible in evidence under any of the three exceptions speci: fied in the Act of 1911.as now amended.by the Act of 1947. As a consequence, their reception, in evidence constituted fatal error and I would, therefore, reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.</p>
