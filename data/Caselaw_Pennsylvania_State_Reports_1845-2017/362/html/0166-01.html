Rosa B. Klugh died on May 24,1935, and by her last will she gave a life estate in all her real estate to her sister, Huldah B. Rearick, and with remainder to Huldah’s issue. Huldah’s husband, J.

Eberly with which the above agreement was made by Rosa B. Klugh on April 1, 1935. Ira S. Eberly subsequently withdrew from the business. Petitioner alleges that he has made various improvements and additions to this real estate, and has over the years built up a successful business in connection with the use of the premises under the name of Klugh Lumber Company. No deed for the said premises was ever executed, nor any provisions made for the conveying of the premises by the decedent in her lifetime, nor by her executor. On July 8,1947, Castles received his first notice to vacate the premises. He refused to do so and avers that he is now ready, willing and able to perform the agreement of April 1, 1935.</p>

In a letter written by Castles to Mr. and Mrs. Rearick, dated July 20, 1945, he said: “As you will remember I had an option to buy this property, given by Mr. Klugh, which was relinquished to you when the estate changed hands.

Klugh, executed and delivered to the co-partnership, trading as “Klugh Lumber Company,” a written instrument purporting to be a lease for the premises, in which all reference to an option to purchase the premises by the lessees was omitted. The monthly rental was $25.00, and the lease was not run for “an indeterminate period beginning August 6th, 1935,” and would terminate one year after the owner gave written notice to the Klugh Lumber Co., or its successor, of its desire so to do. (B) On September 27,1935, Huldah B. Rearick, life tenant, as party of the first part, and Castles and Eberly, trading as “Klugh Lumber Company,” as parties of the second part, made a lease for one month from October 1,1935, in which no reference was made to any option to purchase. This agreement provided that either party had the right to terminate the lease upon twelve months’ notice. (C) After Eberly sold his interest in the co-partnership to Castles, the latter expressed a wish for a new lease on the premises, and, on July 1, 1943, another monthly lease was entered into between Huldah B. Rearick and Castles, in which no reference was made to any option to purchase.</p>

Mutual assent to abandon a contract, like mutual assent to form one, may be inferred from the attendant circumstances and conduct of the parties. Therefore, ‘If either party without right claims to rescind the contract, the other party need not object, and if he permit it to be rescinded, it will be done by mutual consent.’ But the situation must justify such an inference for ‘mere failure to object to repudiation is not a manifestation of assent to a rescission.’ Sometimes circumstances of a negative character, such as the failure to take any steps looking towards the enforcement or performance of the contract, also justify the inference of mutual assent to rescind.”</p>
