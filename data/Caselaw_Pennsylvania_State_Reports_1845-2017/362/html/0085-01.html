Her mother, being unable to care for her, placed her in the Rosalia Foundling Asylum in Pittsburgh where she remained until May, 1945, at which time the Society requested the mother to remove the child because of its age. The mother then sought the assistance of the Children’s Aid Society to arrange for the child’s care. In May, 1945, Mr. and Mrs. Gard answered the appeal of the Children’s Aid Society for foster homes for children then in the Society’s custody. Mr. and Mrs. Gard sought to file an application for the adoption of a child but the Society discouraged it because of the large number of such applications they had already received. The Society’s agent informed the Gards that there was need of “foster homes” for children. Being willing to provide such a home, the Gards on May 23,1945, signed a “boarding home contract” in which they agreed “to accept any child so placed with us subject to the conditions laid down by the Society which we recognize has custody. We agree to hold any such child subject at all times to the call of the Society.” It was also provided that the Gards should be paid for “board, clothing, medical care,” etc., for the child. They declared therein that <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>they understood that “any child entrusted” to them was not “for placement and adoption”, and they covenanted “not to do any act or thing with a view toward adoption.”</p>

In August, 1945, the child’s mother- advised the Society that she had an opportunity to marry and she asked the Society to arrange to have the child adopted by suitable persons. On December 20, 1945, Mr. and Mrs. Gard expressed to the Society their desire to adopt the child. On June 28, 1946, the mother executed a formal release of her claim to her child and granted authority to the Society to arrange for the child’s adoption. Three days before this, the Society advised the Gards, without stating any reason therefor, that the Society desired the return of the child. Appellees refused the demand. On June 28, 1946, without notice to the Gards, the Orphans’ Court appointed the Society as Guardian of the child. On July 2, 1946, the Society filed with the Orphans’ Court its petition for the child’s custody. On July 29,1946, the Orphans’ Court directed the Gards to deliver possession of the Child to the Society. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court it was held that the Orphans’ Court, was without jurisdiction to decide the question of the custody of the- child and that the parties seeking possession must proceed by writ of habeas corpus in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>

They , also averred that the Agreement was ineffective as “against public policy” and that “the best interests of Betty Jean Tuttle are best served by her remaining with the respondents”. They denied that the Society had a permanent placement selected for the child, in accordance with the desires of the natural parent, and demanded proof thereof. They declared that information concerning this matter “has been consistently denied to the respondents by the petitioners” and that they “have become attached to said child during the two years<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> of their possession, and that they desire to raise and adopt this child as their own and being reputable citizens of the community assert that the best interests of the child will be served by remaining with them and in their custody.” They stated that, “For in excess of two years<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> they have lavished their affection upon her and maintained her in a proper style and atmosphere.

He expressed the view that the appointment by the Orphans’ Court, of the Children’s Aid Society as guardian of the minor was determinative of the question before him. He said: “in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, Common Pleas Court should dispose of the proceeding in a manner that will give effect to the judgment of the Orphans’ Court.” In taking this position he fell into error. He added: “However, the case will also be decided on its merits.” Near the close of his opinion he said: “It is likely that adopting parents seeking a child— not to be boarded for a price, but to be their own — will develop a relationship more nearly like that of natural parents and child than exists now. The child’s identity will be new in her new surrounding.” In making this conjecture as to the child’s future, Judge Adams overlooked the harm that would be done to her by the sundering of the close and affectionate relationship which has been formed between this child and the man and woman who have stood in a parental relationship toward her for more than three years. At the hearing, neighbors testified that Mr. and Mrs. Ga'rd “have both been excellent parents, that they gave the child love and security”, and that “they are very affectionate with her and she with them”. One neighbor testified that “she never saw such a haunted face on a child” as this child had when she first came to the Gards’ home, that the “sad look” on her face was “indescribable”, and that “her appearance now spells happiness”.</p>

It is a secret of the Society.” As to that Judge Fine, speaking for the Court, pertinently observed: “There are no secrets where the welfare of a child is concerned. For a court to award custody of a minor on a mere statement by the relator that appellants’ home ‘is not a suitable permanent home for this child’ and that they have a more desirable home without the court knowing the pertinent factors supporting such conclusion would be to delegate the judicial function in such matters to the relator.

Wood, </em>26 Kansas 650, 40 American Reports 321, involved proceedings for the possession of a minor child. The parents being poor gave their daughter at birth to the mother’s sister, who cared for it well for a period of <em>5yz </em>years. The father having then acquired wealth and the mother having died he applied for this child. He proposed to put the child with his sister and mother, who had never seen it. The Supreme Court of Kansas denied the application. The opinion was written by Justice Brewer, who was from 1889 to 1910 a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Justice Brewer admirably summed up the law applicable to cases of this character. He said, inter alia: “The father is the natural guardian and is prima facie entitled to the custody of his minor child. This right springs from two sources: one is, that he who brings a child, a helpless being, into life, ought to take care of that child until it is able to take care of itself; and because of this obligation to take care of and support this helpless being arises a reciprocal right to the custody and care of the offspring whom he must support; and the other reason is, that it is a laAV of nature that the <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>affection which springs from such a relation as that is stronger and more potent than any which springs from any other human relation. The second proposition of law is, that a child is not in any sense like a horse or any other chattel, subject-matter for absolute and irrevocable gift or contract. ... In this it differs from the gift of any article which is only property. . . . The third proposition is, that a parent’s right to the custody of a child is not like the right of property, an absolute and uncontrollable right. If it were, it would end this case and relieve us from all future difficulties. A mere right of property may be asserted by any man, no matter how bad, immoral, or unworthy he may be; but no case can be found in which the courts have given to the father who was a drunkard and a man of gross immoralities, the custody of a minor child, especially when that child is a girl. The fact that in such cases the courts have always refused the father the custody of his child, shows that he has not an absolute and uncontrollable right thereto. The fourth proposition is, that though the gift of the child be revocable, yet when the gift has been once made and the child has been left for years in the care and custody of others, who have discharged all the obligations of support and care which naturally rest upon the parent, then, whether the courts will enforce the father’s right to the custody of the child, will depend mainly upon the question whether such custody will promote the welfare and interest of such child. This distinction must be recognized. . . . ties of blood weaken, and ties of companionship strengthen, by lapse of time. . . . The fifth proposition is, that in questions of this kind three interests should be considered: The right of the father must be considered; the right of the one who has filled the parental place for years should be considered. Perhaps it may not be technically correct to speak of that as a right; and yet, they who have for years filled the place of the parent, have discharged all the obligations of care and support, and especially when <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>they bave discharged these duties during those years of infancy when the burden is especially heavy, when the labor and care are of a kind whose value cannot be expressed in money — when all these labors have been performed and the child has bloomed into bright and happy girlhood, it is but fair and proper that their previous faithfulness, and the interest and affection which these labors have created in them, should be respected. Above all things, the<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> paramount consideration is, what will promote the welfare of the child?”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In that respect it resembles a young tree whose roots have not yet taken deep hold in the nourishing earth, but when a child is much beyond the age of two years, it becomes strongly attached to those who stand in parental relationship to it and who have tenderly cared for it. Its bonds of affection have become so strong that to sunder them suddenly may result not only in the child’s unhappiness, but also in its physical injury. Even dogs which have been separated from- masters to whom they are attached have been known to go into physical decline and sometimes to die as a result of that separation. To take this nearly 65 months old girl, Betty Jean Tuttle, away from the only parents she has known since she was an infant of eighteen months would be exactly the same in its effect on her and on the man and woman who have stood in a parental relationship to her for nearly four years as would the separation of any well cared for child from its own parents. Nothing could be more cruel than the forceable separation of a child from either its real or foster parents by whom it has been lovingly cared for and to whom it is bound by strong ties of affection; to a child it is equally cruel whether the separation is brought about by “kidnapping” or by legal process.

It is well known that Nature in endowing children at their creation with gifts of spirit, mind and body never discriminates against the so-called “illegitimate”, and the circumstances of their birth has been no blight upon their careers. Some of the greatest men and women in history were born out of wedlock.

Fortunately, the law’s regard for a child’s welfare does not admit of any such injury or harm being done it.” In that case this Court ordered that a decree of adoption of a four year old girl by the child’s uncle and paternal aunt who had reared and cared for the little girl since her earliest infancy, be entered. This order was made over the objection of the child’s mother, the .sole surviving parent. It was held that she had abandoned the child and that therefore her consent to the proposed adoption was unnecessary. (Act of April 4, 1925, P. L. 127, Sec. 2, as amended (1 PS 2).)</p>

Such is not the case. On the evidence, including testimony given by the Society’s supervisor and its trained and experienced case worker, and the testimony of the physician who has attended the child at regular intervals since placed with the Cards, Judge Adams found that “the child’s best interest will be served by returning her to [the Society]”, and based his decision thereon. His opinion states: “In reaching our conclusion, we neither approve nor disapprove the broad general policies of the Children’s Aid Society. <em>Our concern is the welfare of the child involved in this case. </em>The society’s policies are only relevant insofar as they affect her. The mutual rights and obligations of the parties growing out of the signed writing and [the Cards’] continued custody were considered only insofar as they throw light upon the basic issue.” Such finding, arrived at by the trial judge who heard and observed the witnesses, after careful consideration of the evidence, should not be lightly disregarded.</p>

The evidence establishes that the mother of Betty Jean Tuttle has maintained close contact with the Society at all times, and at gréat personal sacrifice entrusted the child to the Society on the assurance that adoption in a permanent home, carefully selécted by the Society in cooperation with her, would be so arranged that the stigma of illegitimacy would be avoided. The majority decision now assures exactly the opposite. As said by Judge Adams in his opinion for the common pleas: “If the child remains with [the Gards] she will not escape the detrimental effect arising from public knowledge concerning her origin. This is an important aspect of the case. It is of great weight in influencing judgment.”</p>

By their contract they recognized that the Society had custody and covenanted that they would “never assert any rights, custody or control adverse to that of the Society.” They agreed that the Society should have the right “to call for the return of or to remove said child from our custody at hny time in its sole discretion provided only that we shall have been fully paid” and they covenanted “not to do any act or thing with a view toward adoption under pain of forfeiture of this contract and the immediate return of such child to the Society.” They accepted the child for boarding home care with full knowledge of and acquiescence in the terms of the agreement, and have received full money compensation for their services. Their desire to continue the companionship, of the child affords no legal basis for permitting them to evade their solemn written obligation, now that the purpose of the agreement has been fulfilled, <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>against the findings of the trial judge, the wishes of the mother, and the recommendation of the Society.</p>

Their position would be that of a “mere stranger or volunteer who is in no way entitled to the custody, or responsible for the welfare of the child”, and the question of the best interests of the child would not be considered in such proceeding: <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Ebel v. King, </em><a href="/pa-super/162/0533-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="162 Pa. Super. 533" data-case-ids="462874" data-case-paths="/pa-super/162/0533-01">162 Pa.

By its decision that a different status can be acquired through the simple expedient of deliberate violation of the contract, the majority places a premium on disrespect for written obligations, solemnly entered into, and jeopardizes the effective operation of the Society and other similar agencies throughout this State. In the one case, as in the other, orderly procedure requires that the boarding home contract be enforced according to its terms, and, if the party or parties who have temporarily taken care of the child, for a consideration, under such a contract, should desire permanent custody or adoption, the question of their fitness can be determined upon a proper application for the purpose, as in other cases. Ample power exists in the courts to protect the rights of all concerned. The Society cannot arbitrarily place the child in a permanent home without approval of the courts. Such power and authority is always retained by the court under all circumstances in the best interests of the child. A court may in a proper case take a child from one or both natural parents and it can also take its custody from the Chil<a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>dren’s Aid Society.
