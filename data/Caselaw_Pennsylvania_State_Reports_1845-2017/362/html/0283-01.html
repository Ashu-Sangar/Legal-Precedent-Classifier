The other trustee having died, the plaintiff instituted suit against the survivor individually and as surviving trustee of the indentured estate. The defendant impleaded the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Company as an additional defendant, but, in view of the questions of law to which the appellant limits <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>this appeal, the fact that there was an additional defendant is of no present significance.</p>
    <p id="b307-3" data-blocks='[["BL_307.4",307,[156,380,1149,756]]]'>From the pleadings, whereon the matter was disposed of below, it is evident that the sole purpose of the suit was to impress personal liability on the individual defendant for the unpaid taxes on trust real estate. It affirmatively appears that the real estate involved is no longer a trust asset, having been sold to the county on tax liens, and that there are no longer any assets whatsoever in the trust estate. The individual defendant filed preliminary objections to the plaintiff’s original and amended complaints, raising a question of law as to his non-liability personally. The learned court below sustained the objections and, accordingly, entered judgment for the defendant from which the plaintiff appealed.</p>

We have no hesitancy in holding that, as to taxes levied and assessed against real estate the record title whereto is in a trustee, the latter, in his personal capacity, is not the person owing such taxes. As we recently said in <em>Frailey Township School District v. Schuylkill Mining Company, </em><a href="/pa/361/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="361 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="476447" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0557-01">361 Pa. 557</a>, 563, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20A.2d%20788" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="64 A.2d 788">64 A. 2d 788</a>, with reference to the same section of the Act of 1945, — “Personal liability for taxes on real estate in Pennsylvania is an incident of record ownership of land at the time of the assessment and levy of the taxes covered by the liability,” citing <em>Pennsylvania Co. for Insurances, etc., Trustee, v.
