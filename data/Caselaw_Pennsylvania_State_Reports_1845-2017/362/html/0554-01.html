Robinson, appellant, had removed to Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, for the sole purpose of obtaining a divorce and praying for an injunction restraining him from prosecuting a divorce action against her in any court other than the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County. On the same date a preliminary injunction was issued and supplemental service authorized to be made upon appellant in Idaho. Service of the bill, the preliminary injunction and the order directing supplemental service was made upon the housekeeper at the residence of appellant’s father in Swarthmore, Delaware County, where appellant lived for a period of approximately ten months following separation of the parties on September 9, 1946. Service was not made on appellant in Idaho.</p>

Service of the rule was made personally on appellant in Vancouver, and on the return day he entered an appearance <em>de bene esse </em>and filed a petition under the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, 12 PS 672-675, on which the court below granted a rule for preliminary determination of jurisdiction. After hearing, an order was entered discharging the rule, and this appeal followed.</p>

The only question is whether the court below acquired jurisdiction over appellant in this proceeding to restrain its procurement.

However, the court concluded that it was compelled to hold otherwise because of the decision of this Court in <em>Janney v.

Janney, </em>supra, the court below found as a fact that the defendant’s absence from the state was a mere temporary absence, for a limited purpose only, and we were of opinion that the evidence sustained that finding. There the evidence disclosed that the de<a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>fendant’s business was in Philadelphia both before his departure and after his return, on the very day he received his Nevada decree of divorce. During the entire period of his stay in Nevada defendant continued to maintain in full operation the apartment in Philadelphia which he admitted was his home and residence before he went to Nevada and to which he immediately returned with a divorce decree as the sole apparent token of his sojourn. All the facts and circumstances in that case indicated beyond question that the defendant’s absence from his established residence in the City of Philadelphia was temporary only and for the sole and limited purpose of securing a divorce. Here the evidence discloses that the parties separated on September 9,1946, on which date appellant removed to the home of his father in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, and thereafter on June 17, 1947, they entered into a separation agreement which provided for conveyance to the wife, as sole owner, of the residential property theretofore owned by them as tenants by the entirety; for the division of personal property and the custody of the children; and for the support and maintenance of the wife until remarriage and for each child until the age of twenty-one years. Appellant occupied a guest room at his father’s house from the date of separation until July 2, 1947, on which date he left his father’s house in Swarthmore in his automobile, with a trailer attached filled to capacity with his personal possessions, arriving at Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, on July 9, 1947. Unlike the defendant in the <em>Janney </em>case, appellant did not return to Philadelphia following the divorce decree, but proceeded to Vancouver, Washington, where he purchased a dwelling house, became eligible for admission to the bar of that State, and he has since resided there.</p>

L. 76, 12 PS 2891, providing for issuance of writs of foreign attachment, are not the equivalent of and do not mean “not domiciled within the Commonwealth.” This Court there concluded <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>(p. 70) that the term “residing” as used in the Act of 1836, as amended, must be construed to mean “actual and not constructive or legal residence or domicil.” See also <em>Magel v.

Similarly, the term “residence”, as used in the substitute service provisions of Pa. R. C. P. 1009, must be construed to mean “actual residence” and cannot be held to mean or be the equivalent of “constructive residence” or “domicile” as contended by appellee. To hold otherwise would result in the anomalous situation that the same person would be subject to both an action in assumpsit and foreign attachment at one and the same time.</p>
