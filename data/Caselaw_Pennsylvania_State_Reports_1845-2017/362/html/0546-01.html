As administratrix of his estate, his widow, Rose Cinquina, brought this suit in trespass under the Wrongful Death Statute of April 26, <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>1855, P. L. 309, as amended, and the Survival Act of July 2, 1937, P. L. 2755. At the trial, counsel for plaintiff informed the court that the cause of action under the latter statute was abandoned. The jury returned a verdict of $20,000 in plaintiff’s favor. Judgment having been entered on the verdict after the refusal of motions for judgment n. o. v. and a new trial, defendant appealed.</p>
    <p id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.4",570,[284,718,1148,645]]]'>The accident occurred at about five-forty on the clear afternoon of April 22,1947, at the intersection of Eleventh and Market Streets. The latter street, which is 62 feet wide from curb to curb, with sidewalks 19 feet in width, is a very busy east and west thoroughfare. It is traversed by double street car tracks. The north rail of the westbound track is 23 feet 5 inches from the north curb, and the track is 5 feet 2 inches from rail to rail. Eleventh Street, which intersects Market Street at right angles, is a one-way street, traffic moving northward. It is 26 feet between curbs, with sidewalks 12 feet wide, and has a single car track located in the center of it.</p>

The sequence of these traffic lights is green, amber, red, amber and green. The red and green lights are timed for 17 seconds and the amber for 3 seconds.</p>

As he started to make the crossing, walking steadily, a westbound street car ivas stopped, discharging passengers, at a safety zone located approximately 10 feet east of the traffic light on the north side of Market Street east of Eleventh Street. Cinquina proceeded on the foot crossing, and, when he reached a point on the cartway of Market Street about 8 or 10 feet north of the north rail of the westbound track, the trolley started 2 seconds after the traffic signal had turned red against it, picked up momentum and proceeded across Eleventh Street. The front end of the trolley struck him as he was a, foot or two inside the north rail of the westbound track. He was knocked down, seriously injured, and as a result died three days later. There was no vehicular traffic in the north cartway of Market Street, nor was there any traffic between the trolley and Cinquina, who was in plain view of the operator of the car from shortly before he left the sidewalk until he was struck. From the moment the car started across Eleventh Street until the accident, the traffic light continued red against the street car.</p>

The testimony established that the motorman was negligent in operating the street car through a traffic signal and striking Cinquina, who was walking across the intersection on the crosswalk, with the traffic light in his favor. It is the contention of defendant, however, that the learned court below erred in not entering judgment in its favor, notwithstanding the verdict, because of the contributory negligence of Cinquina. It argues that inasmuch as the sole eyewitness called by plaintiff stated that he did not see Cinquina look eastwardly at any time as he proceeded from a point 8 or 10 feet north of the north rail of the westbound track <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>“until the car was quite close to him”, and- because Cinquina was struck almost at the moment he stepped upon the westbound track, he was contributorily negligent as a matter of law. With this argument we cannot agree.</p>

In situations such as that in the instant case “whether the pedestrian should have looked again or was warranted in assuming that he could cross in safety depends upon shifting conditions, and presents, therefore, a question of fact rather than of law”: <em>Harrington v. Pugarelli, </em><a href="/pa/344/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="344 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="1211024" data-case-paths="/pa/344/0204-01">344 Pa. 204</a>, 207-8, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20A.2d%20149" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="25 A.2d 149">25 A. 2d 149</a>. Here, the jury had a right to find that Cinquina looked as he left the sidewalk and saw the street car at a standstill with the traffic signal against it and in his favor, and, as he proceeded across Market Street, that he approached the <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>westbound track and entered upon it on the assumption that defendant’s motorman would not start the trolley into the intersection through the red light and run him down. When Cinquina realized that the street car was disregarding the red light and was running through the intersection he was then in a position of peril on the cartway through no fault of his own, and, therefore, he was not legally responsible if his judgment was not the best.</p>

The language used in Gilles v.
