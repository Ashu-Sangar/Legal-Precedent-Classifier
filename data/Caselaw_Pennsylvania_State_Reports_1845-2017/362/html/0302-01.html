The facts, about which there is.no dispute, may be summarized as follows: John Granquist, plaintiff’s predecessor in title, and Bose Granquist, the defendant, were married in 1908. The husband purchased the dwelling in question, <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>located in White Mills, Wayne County. Title was taken <em>in the husband’s name </em>on June 8, 1922. Immediately thereafter the husband took his wife and children upon the premises which they jointly occupied as a home until October 1922. On that date the husband, leaving his wife and children in the premises, went to Ohio in search of employment. The husband never returned to his habitation. On October 29, 1934 he secured an ex parte decree in divorce from his wife. The wife has continued to reside in the premises. On November 7, 1947, the husband sold and conveyed the premises to the plaintiff. No allegation is made that the conveyance was made collusively by the husband to the plaintiff in fraud of defendant’s marital rights. In the action of ejectment defendant claims that she acquired a valid title to the real estate by adverse possession against her husband. The court entered a verdict for the plaintiff. This appeal followed.</p>

Such an allegation, or even proof thereof, would be superfluous to the present issue. Granted that the plaintiff acted with highest good faith, still, to his bounden knowledge, Mrs. Granquist was in actual possession of the property when <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>he purchased it and, of course, in that situation he took it subject to her rights whereof it was his duty to inquire.</p>

That would necessarily require the development of additional facts and, thereafter, further findings by the trial court, for which purposes, I would reverse and remand.</p>
