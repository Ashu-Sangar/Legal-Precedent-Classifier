      <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>Testator died April 6, 1935. Under Ms will the residuary estate was placed in trust to pay the income, under spendthrift provisions, to his daughter for life. One half of the corpus or principal was passed, at the death of the daughter, under a general power of appointment of the life tenant. The other half, with all unappointed principal, was devised and bequeathed to the daughter’s issue. Testator directed that all stock dividends should constitute part of the corpus or principal. The life tenant is a minor with a duly appointed guardian. A trustee ad litem for all unascertained remainder interests represents and is acting for the remaindermen. At the audit of the second account of the trustees in the Orphans’ Court, it appeared that after May 3, 1945, the effective date of the Uniform Principal and Income Act, supra, and prior to the effective date of the 1947 Principal and Income Act, supra, the trustees received stock dividends from three corporations, whose stock formed part of the trust, and they also sold other corporate stock and rights to subscribe which resulted in large capital gains. Judge Boyle, the auditing judge, in a well considered opinion, unanimously concurred in by the court in banc, decided that by long established decisions of this Court, under the Pennsylvania Buie of Apportionment, the life tenant possessed a vested right to receive, as “income”, the stock dividends and a share of the capital gains (representing accumulated unpaid earnings) on sales of the stock. The award to income was approximately $75,000. There is no dispute concerning the correctness of this valuation and calculation. The court below also ruled that because these items constituted income, testator’s direction that they be treated as corpus was void as violating the statute against accumulations. The trustee ad litem appealed.</p>

We also decided when this distribution should be made, i. e., when such accumulations were paid out by the corporation by an extraordinary stock or cash dividend, or when the corporate stock, being part of the trust, was sold or exchanged, or when the corporation was liquidated or merged with other corporations, and where the value of such accumulated earnings was reflected in realized cash in the sales price or constituted a portion of the value of the stock or corporate assets upon liquidation or merger. In <em>Nirdlinger's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/290/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="290 Pa. 457" data-case-ids="1104400" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0457-01">290 Pa. 457</a>, 462, <a href="/citations/?q=139%20A.%20200" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="139 A. 200">139 A. 200</a>, this Court, speaking through Justice Kephart (later Chief Justice), reviewed the three doctrines of apportionment. They are: (1) the <em>Massachusetts Rule. </em>Under this rule all <em>cash </em>dividends are payable to the life tenant and all <em>stock </em>dividends to the remainderman. (This rule is conceded to be one of <em>convenience. </em>While perhaps unscientific in principle, it is understandable and easy of application). (2) the <em>Kentucky Rule, </em>sometimes termed the English Rule. (This was also a rule of convenience). Under this doctrine a dividend, whether of stock or cash, passe,s to the person entitled to receive income at the time the dividend is declared. (3) the <em>Pennsylvania or American Rule. </em>Under this rule, a gift of “income” in corporate stock is defined and measured. <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>It includes áccumulated earnings, above tbe amount necessary to preserve the intact value of corpus. (While the rule is unquestionably difficult in <em>application, </em>nevertheless, it is, in <em>principle, </em>a just and equitable measure). The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania adopted and consistently has applied the Pennsylvania Rule since 1857: <em>Earp’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/28/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="28 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="981664" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0368-01">28 Pa. 368</a>; <em>Nirdlinger’s Estate, </em>supra; <em>Waterhouse’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/308/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="308 Pa. 422" data-case-ids="1140235" data-case-paths="/pa/308/0422-01">308 Pa. 422</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.%20295" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="162 A. 295">162 A. 295</a>, and the many cases therein cited and those which follow them. The Legislature, in adopting the Uniform Principal and Income Act of 1945, supra, in substance, substituted the Massachusetts Rule for the Pennsylvania Rule and made the operation of the Act retroactive.</p>
    <p id="b484-4" data-blocks='[["BL_484.4",484,[256,992,1148,749]]]'>The issue is thus sharply drawn. If the decisional law of the Pennsylvania Rule of Apportionment established a vested property right in the life tenant, then the retroactive provisions of section 17 of the Act of 1945, supra, rendered the Act unconstitutional as applied to trusts created prior to its enactment. Such a provision in the statute takes income, which this Court has decided belongs to a life tenant, and passes it to the remainderman, thus contravening Art., I, sections 1 and 9 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania and the- Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. <em>Brown v.

Where part of the trust corpus consisted of corporate stock, this Court possessed the power, in the absence of then existing Legislative enactment, to <em>define and measure </em>what constituted or was included in the term “income”. In so defining and measuring such “income”, we decided what cash or property passed to the life tenant and at what time. Such “income” thus defined became a <em>vested </em>property interest. In so adjudicating the right to income between the <em>life tenant and remainderman, </em>this Court was exercising an inherent judicial power and function. It was deciding qnd declaring legal principles governing the ownership and possession of property. In <em>Gibbons’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/317/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="317 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="8846246" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0465-01">317 Pa. 465</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=177%20A.%2050" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="177 A. 50">177 A. 50</a>, we reaffirmed the principle or rule of law that <em>“a devise of the rents, issues and profits of the land” </em>passed a fee, and so defined the quality of the property interest.

This Court decided that such an illegitimate individual possessed no property interest and that he could not take even though he was subsequently legitimatized by act of the Legislature. In <em>Klinger et al. v.

It was further held that the <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>subsequent passage of the Act of April 1, 1909, P.

In that case there was no difference in opinion concerning the fundamental principle that the life tenant possessed a vested interest in accumulated corporate earnings and profits. It concerned a complicated corporate <em>merger, </em>involving common and preferred shares. In the first case, we decided unan<a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>imously that the situation was merely that of <em>exchange </em>and no common stock had been given in payment of arrears of dividends on the preferred stock. But it was decided that no apportionment could be made until after a sale of exchanged stock. In the second case we decided that <em>all </em>of the stock need not be sold before there could be an apportionment. Three Justices dissented in the view that common stock included in the merger was given in <em>payment </em>of defaulted accumulated dividends on the preferred stock. In the third case, a majority decided that the intact value of corpus <em>had been preserved </em>and the life tenant was therefore entitled to certain of the accumulated corporate earnings and profits as income. The dissenting opinion was that the <em>intact value had been impaired. </em>We emphasize that no question was raised in any of the three decisions that the life tenant was not entitled to accumulated undeclared corporate earnings and profits. The sole difference in the <em>application </em>of the rule was in determining the amount due the life tenant and when it should be paid. Uncertainty as to the <em>quantum </em>of income and when it is to be received cannot convert a vested interest into a mere expectancy.</p>

Those cases have to do with liquidation and <em>administration of trust assets, </em>which have been received in foreclosure, or the sale of and carrying-charges on unproductive or insufficiently productive real estate. In the ascertainment and distribution of accumulated corporate earnings and profits, the fund is in existence, whereas in salvage operations a fund is being created. In salvaging and liquidating “frozen” assets, equitable principles must be applied in each case to determine what should be income and what should be principal. For example: a trust estate may possess a mortgage secured on real estate. On foreclosure, the real estate taken at Sheriff’s sale may be valued at a <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>sum much less than the amount of the mortgage with interest arrearages. Upon a forced sale, such real estate may be sold at a sacrifice. The life tenant ordinarily prefers an immediate sale, even at a sacrifice, as he receives at once income, even on reduced principal, whereas the remainderman demands retention until a more advantageous price may be obtained. In unproductive real estate, or that which is insufficiently productive, the same problem is presented. In determining the equities between the parties, the Court must necessarily exercise discretion. In so acting the court is not declaring property rights but is administering or liquidating distressed trust assets.
