    <p id="b370-6" data-blocks='[["BL_370.8",370,[268,582,1147,413]]]'>In the court below, this proceeding was treated as an appeal from the refusal of the board of law examiners of Montgomery County to approve the appellant’s application for admission to the bar of the county. The court agreed with the board. From the order dismissing the appeal from the board, dated November 23, 1948, the applicant appealed to this court. We all agree that the order must be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b370-7" data-blocks='[["BL_370.9",370,[267,1015,1147,479]]]'>It is unnecessary to detail the steps averred by appellant to have been taken unsuccessfully, prior to the filing of his petition of April 27, 1948, now before us. It is sufficient to say that at various times beginning with September, 1935, appellant applied to the board of law examiners for the required certificate of compliance with the local rules for admission to the bar and that some of those local rules were no longer in force when appellant filed the petition now under review.</p>

He acquired a home in Montgomery County in 1935 and established a law office in his home, thereafter practicing his profession in his Philadelphia office as well as in his Montgomery County office, except when in the Navy. He is at a disadvantage in Montgomery County because, not being a member of the bar of that county, he cannot conduct litigation in its courts without associating local counsel with him. Desiring to avoid this disadvantage he instituted this proceeding. His petition was dismissed for want of compliance with rule 7, paragraph 9, subsection 5, of the requirements for admission adopted by the Montgomery County courts. It provides: “(5) Siich ap<a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>plicant shall also deliver to the said Board a declaration signed <em>by </em>him, setting ont that he intends permanently to practice in this county, and that he- will, within three weeks of his admission, open and maintain his principal office therein, and that failure to do so, or removal of his principal office to another county shall be construed as a request by him to have his name stricken from the Roll of the Bar of this county. If the said Board shall approve the applicant this declaration shall be attached by the Board to their certificate recommending his admission, which shall be produced in open court when his motion for admission is made, and shall be filed thereafter with the Prothonotary.”</p>

Well, from a point of view-of seeing clients I would say it would be Philadelphia. From the point of view of getting work done, I would say it is Montgomery County — that is, office work, desk work and records. Q. If you should be admitted to the Montgomery County Bar, what is your intention with respect to offices in the future? A. To continue them the same as I am at the present time. That is,’ I would say, I would have the office in Philadelphia and also the office in Montgomery County. Q. Now, at the present time where are your files and records kept? • A. Most of them are kept in Montgomery County. Some of them are kept in the Philadelphia office. Q. What are your intentions as to the future with respect to the continuance of the present office in Montgomery County? A. My intention is to continue it the same as at the present time.”</p>
