O’Connor, brought an action in trespass against defendant, Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by him in a collision between a truck, driven by plaintiff while in the employ of the Penn Supreme Dairies, and a street car of the defendant company. A compulsory nonsuit was entered on the ground of plaintiff’s contributory negligence. Plaintiff appeals from the refusal of the court below to take off the nonsuit.</p>

The tracks run parallel to Garrett Road for a distance and then cross, at grade and right angles, Windemere Avenue which runs in a north-south direction. The car tracks approach Windemere Avenue on a downward grade and are straight for several hundred yards to the west. A warning signal light which shows red and green was in operation at the intersection of Windemere Avenue and the tracks directly over the <em>center </em>of the tracks and the highway.</p>

He made a right hand turn into Windemere Avenue and proceeded northwardly, crossing the two tracks of the defendant company. He drove about <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>126 feet and realizing he was lost, sought directions. Thereafter he turned around and retraced his route southwardly on the right hand side of Windemere Avenue. As he approached the crossing he was traveling at a slow rate of speed. Plaintiff stopped the truck before any part of it entered the first rail of the first set of car tracks. He observed that the warning signal was green and in his favor for crossing. He then looked for approaching trolleys <em>but saw none. </em>His view to the right or west was partially obtructed by poles, a tree, and some heavy brush, but he could see approximately two hundred (200) feet in a westerly direction up the track. After thus looking for approaching trolleys and seeing none, and with the signal light still green in his favor, he started the truck at a rate of three or four miles per hour. He again looked for approaching trolleys before his truck entered the first rail of the eastbound track. At this point, he saw for the first time, a trolley approaching from the west and moving in an easterly direction about one hundred ten (110) feet away. He immediately applied the brakes. The truck halted and the front bumper, while not across the first rail of the second set of tracks (east bound), was in the path of the overhang of the trolley. Plaintiff tried to put his truck in reverse but failed. He endeavored to signal the motorman but was unsuccessful because the motorman had his back turned. A collision occurred. The left front overhang of the trolley struck the right front of the truck. The evidence was amply sufficient to warrant a finding that the motorman was negligent. A witness, a passenger on the trolley car, testified that he saw plaintiff’s truck when the defendant trolley was still fifty (50) feet away from the crossing; that he endeavored to secure the motorman’s attention, but the motorman had his head turned around toward the rear of the car talking to a trainee; that no warning was <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>sounded by the trolley nor did it slacken its speed. Tbe witness also testified that the signal light was red against the trolley and that the trolley was being operated at a speed of forty (40) miles per hour and that it continued for a distance of two hundred (200) feet before being brought to a stop after the collision.</p>

It was snowing at the time and the streets were slippery from ice. When the plaintiff had reached a point about forty feet from the first rail of thé near (outbound) track on Murray Avenue, he looked to his right and saw a street car about two hundred feet away, coming northwardly on the inbound track on Murray Avenue toward the intersection. <em>The light in the traffic signal was showing green for travel on Beacon Street. </em>The plaintiff approached the crossing at a speed of approximately ten miles an hour. When he had reached the first rail of the track nearest him, he reduced the speed of his automobile to two or three- miles an hour. The street car was then a hundred to a hundred and twenty-five feet away. While crossing the first track at his reduced rate of speed, he saw that the street car, which was travelling at a speed of from thirty to thirty-five miles an hour, would likely be unable to stop at the intersection notwithstanding that the signal light was set against it. Believing that a collision was inevitable if he proceeded further, the plaintiff ‘slammed on [his] brakes’ but, on account of the icy condition of the street, his automobile skidded into the street car, striking it on its side about the third or fourth window from the front with resultant injuries to the plaintiff for which he brought the suit here involved.</p>

He continued looking in both directions as he started to move toward the crossing in low gear at a speed of about two miles an hour. About the time the front end of his truck reached the first rail, he saw a car approaching from the west at a distance of approximately one hundred and twenty-five feet and running at a speed of eighteen or twenty miles an hour. He stopped immediately with the front of his truck extending about fourteen inches over the first rail. Before he had time to back, the car collided with the truck, pushed it out of the way and ran a square before it stopped. <em>Upon such facts, the questions of defendant’s negligence and plaintiff’s contributory negligence .were for the jury. </em>Plaintiff did not violate any positive rule of law. He stopped at the building line, looked and saw nothing which in his judgment should have prevented his going across the tracks.
