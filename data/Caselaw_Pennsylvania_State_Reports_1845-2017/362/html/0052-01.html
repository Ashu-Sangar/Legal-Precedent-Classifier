The function of the judiciary to administer justice does not include the power to levy taxes in order to defray the necessary expenses in connection therewith. It is the legislature which must supply such funds. Under the system of division of governmental powers it frequently happens that the functions of one branch may overlap another. But the successful and efficient administration of government <em>assumes </em>that each branch will cooperate with the others. As was said by the late Chief Justice Mosci-izisker (when a judge in Common Pleas No. 3 of Philadelphia) reported in <em>Commonwealth v. Mathues, </em><a href="/pa/210/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="210 Pa. 372" data-case-ids="937852" data-case-paths="/pa/210/0372-01">210 Pa. 372</a>, 406, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20A.%20961" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="59 A. 961">59 A. 961</a>: “. . . the presumption always is that public officers will perform a public trust, not that they will default therein or abuse the trust, and we prefer to believe that the legislature have performed, and will continue to perform, their trust, rather than to stand in any fear of a wrong being attempted at some time in the future by one branch of the government against another, even if the power to commit such a wrong be admitted to exist, which we thoroughly believe is not so.”</p>

In that case, it was held that a judge of a court of common pleas possessed the power to appoint a “secretary or clerk”, <em>where no statutory provision existed for such appointment, </em>at a salary fixed by the court, to be paid by the county.

Should the legislature, or the county salary board, act arbitrarily or capriciously and fail or neglect to provide a sufficient number of court employes or for the payment of adequate salaries to them, whereby the efficient administration of justice is impaired or destroyed, the court possesses the inherent power to supply the deficiency. Should such officials neglect or refuse to comply with the reasonable requirements of the court they may be required to do so by mandamus.</p>
