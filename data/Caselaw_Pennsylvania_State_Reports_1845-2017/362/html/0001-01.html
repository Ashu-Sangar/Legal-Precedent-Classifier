It is argued that testator’s remarriage after the date of the codicil and the physical situation of the papers offered for probate indicate and strengthen such intent. Great reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in <em>Evans’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/58/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="58 Pa. 238" data-case-ids="1013205" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0238-01">58 Pa. 238</a>.

There the question related to the revival of a revoked will. As the writings offered for probate complied with the provisions of section 2 of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, 20 PS 191, such writing may not be revoked by parol. Any oral evidence of testator’s expressed intention was therefore properly excluded.</p>
