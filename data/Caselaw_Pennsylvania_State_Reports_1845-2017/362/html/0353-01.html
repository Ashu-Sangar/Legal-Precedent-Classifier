      <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>The Commonwealth contends that the property was owned by the decedent and his wife and their daughter in three undivided interests; that on KLeinschmidt’s death his one-third interest accrued to his wife and to his daughter by the specified right of survivorship, and was therefore taxable under the statute. The court below held that Kleinschmidt and his wife held one-half of the property ás tenants by the entireties and that the daughter owned the other half and on the death of Kleinschmidt the first half , passed by operation of law to the widow without liability for the tax.</p>
    <p id="b377-4" data-blocks='[["BL_377.4",377,[156,881,1155,1358]]]'>There is no evidence showing the circumstances in which Kleinschmidt caused the title to the property to be placed in the names and with the addition stated, so that there is not much from which intention can be inferred. It is significant that Kleinschmidt did not identify Alice Kleinschmidt as his wife or specify that they would hold as husband and wife or as tenants by the entireties and, instead of those phrases which might have been understood as indicating intention, he used the familiar phrase “joint tenants with the right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.” It was certainly not inappropriate (if that was his intention) to exclude the idea of tenancy by the entireties by using the phrase joint tenants with the right of survivorship, because the three title holders could not hold by the entireties; they could only take as joint tenants or tenants in common. If Kleinschmidt understood the meaning of the technical terms he used, he would have intended the court to hold- that he meant exactly what he said, that there was a joint ownership but no holding by entireties. Whether he was familiar, or not with the technical, meaning of his words is immaterial, in the limited circumstances shown in the record, because, having used them, he will be presumed to have intended their normal meaning.</p>

Mauser or Mahala Mauser or Alonzo Mauser” (husband, wife and son). It was said, page 259, “The statement in the bill that this was an estate <em>by </em>the entireties cannot be taken as true because the very title in which the account was held precludes any such possibility. An estate by the entireties, whether in personalty or realty, must be held in. the names of husband and wife and no others. Whether the name of Alonzo was added as a matter of convenience or not does not dispose of the fact that the title was in the name of three parties, and on John’s death his interest passed under the control of the Orphans’. Oourt as did Mahala’s on her death.”</p>

In that case the court construed a deed in, which land was conveyed to “Hannah Speakman and John Hart and Lydia his wife, and to their heirs and assigns, as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants, . . .” The court held that Hart and his wife took one moiety of the estate conveyed and that Hannah Speakman took the other moiety notwithstanding the fact that the habendum was to them as .tenants in common and not as joint tenants. It was a necessary application of the c'ommon law unity of husband and wife who could only.be seised of the whole and not of the part. In later years, the disability of a wife to contract freely has been removed by the Married Women’s Property Acts passed from time to time; she may now contract almost as freely as her husband* a subject referred to in a number of our cases, among them, <em>O’Malley v.
