The court below eliminated the words “growth” and “produce” from the discussion, saying, “In using the term ‘articles of his own growth,’ <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>the legislature, it seems to us, intended to say that the farmer, who grew grain of any kind, or vegetables or hay, or any product of the soil, was exempt from the tax. In like manner, the farmer or poultryman, for example, who was engaged in the production of cattle or sheep or chickens or any kind of poultry might be said to be selling articles of his own produce although, of course, the eggs and other articles, which he might sell, were not produced entirely by his own efforts, but •were dependent on other considerations in part. The word ‘produce/ of course, may have a very general meaning such as the product of a factory or of an industry, but we doubt whether it was the intention of the legislature to so regard it in this particular taxing act, and if it were given this general definition there would be very little that would be left as subject to this taxing Act.</p>

It is making. To <em>malee </em>in the mechanical sense does not signify to create out of nothing; for that surpasses all human power. It does not often mean the production of a new article out of materials entirely raw. It generally consists in giving new shapes, new qualities, or new combinations to matter which has already gone through some other artificial process. A cunning worker in metals is the maker of the wares he fashions, though he did not dig the ore from the earth, or carry it through every subsequent stage of refinement. A shoemaker is none the less a manufacturer of shoes because he does not also tan the leather. A bureau is made by the cabinet-maker, though it consists in part of locks, knobs, and screws, bought ready made from a dealer in hardware.” The court at page 495 said, “A dealer, in the popular, .and therefore in the statutory, sense of the word, is not one who buys to keep, or makes to sell, but one who buys to sell again. He stands intermediately between the producer and the consumer, and depends for his profit, not upon the labour he bestows on his commodities, but upon the skill and foresight with which he watches the markets.”</p>

It was said that the defendant was engaged in “merchandising,” buying for the sole purpose of selling again. The Court said at page 607, “[The defendant] buys cattle, which are for it the raw material, and it converts that material into forms and size suitable for the market which it supplies, and it then sells the material, as merchandise, to others who vend and deal at retail in the same products. <em>... It </em>subjects the material which it buys to certain manipulations, but those are not such as to properly constitute it a manufacturing corporation.” The subject of meat processing was again considered in <em>Com. v.

It appeared that the defendant sold pickled and dry salt pork, smoked hams and other processed meat products. The Court cited as adequate the following definition from 26 Cyc. 520, “Manufacturing is: (1) the application of labor or skill to material whereby the original article is changed to a new, different and useful article, provided the process is of a kind popularly regarded as manufacture or the product of such process.” The court rejected the contention that hams, bacon and hides became manufactured products by the application of science, labor and skill to the raw materials. “We find that what is done preparatory to placing the meat on the market is to cut from the carcass of the slaughtered animal the parts popularly and generally designated as the ‘hams,’ and these are submitted for a time to a successive process of pickling or curing in solutions of nitrate of soda, sugar and water, thereafter encased in cotton covering and suspended for the period required in a <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>smokehouse over a fire of hickory wood. And what is the ultimate article when it emerges from this careful treatment, ready for sale to appellant’s customers? Just what it was in form, in character and in substance when the treatment was begun on the original article — a ham, both as to designation and as to use. There has been injected into it salt solutions; otherwise, the original substance is there. There may be a change in coloration, but no special, change in form or substance. The treatment given to this meat, instead of constituting a process of manufacture, is really an elaboration of the time-honored method of preparing and curing in the grimy little smokehouse of the farmer. From the moment of its separation from the carcass of the animal, the ham remains constantly intact, it retains practically its original shape and size, and neither the curing solution that is ‘pumped’ into it, nor the solution in which it is steeped,, nor the chemical preparation with which it is ‘scrubbed,’ nor the ultimate ‘smoking’ applied to it, has done anything more in changing the original meat than to modify its color and taste and prevent deterioration and decay; and the purpose and use for which it was originally cut from the carcass as a ham is exactly the same, — to be used as food.” See also <em>People ex rel.

With respect to ice cream, the court below referred to the Ice Cream Regulatory Act of 1933,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in which ice cream is treated by the legislature as a manufactured product, but a like inference with respect to milk generally cannot be made from the Milk Control Act of 1935,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> because the phraseology of that Act deals with both processor and manufacturer.</p>

All the evidence was produced by the plaintiffs; the defendants produced none. The chancellor made no findings of fact with respect to the processes applied to produce these fourteen products which plaintiffs sold. As the evidence came from them and is not contradicted by evidence offered by defendants, we shall deal with it as if the chancellor had made specific findings in accord with plaintiffs’ evidence. We shall refer briefly to a few of them. A city ordinance of Pittsburgh requires pasteurization. Pasteurized milk <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>was described at some length by two witnesses. Pasteurization involves heating milk to a certain temperature and holding it at that temperature for a specified length of time for the purpose of destroying disease producing organisms. The process results in changes in its protein and mineral content. The mere fact that plaintiffs do this on a large scale with expensive machinery does not make it any the less processing milk.

A. 1917A 48 (1916), in construing statutes exempting machinery used in manufacturing, the courts held that pasteurization of milk was mere processing and not manufacturing. Homogenization breaks up globules of fat to prevent separation of cream from milk and results in uniform distribution of the fat content of the milk. Milk is homogenized by forcing it through small openings at pressures from 2500 to 4000 pounds per square inch. While some of the attributes of milk are changed by the process it is not manufacturing into a new and different article. It also continues to be sold as milk. Pasteurized and homogenized vitamin D milk and pasteurized chocolate milk are milk with the addition, in one instance, of vitamin D concentrate and, in the other, of chocolate and sugar. Condensed, evaporated and powdered milks are produced by boiling off, under controlled conditions, a portion of the water content of the milk; this is a variation of the process of reducing a raw material to its constituent parts for purposes of distribution. Buttermilk and sour cream are produced by inoculating milk or cream with a pure culture of lactic organisms which at proper temperatures and for a controlled incubation period will grow and propagate. These products are sold as milk; the changes are essentially in the milk flavor, they are still used as beverages and are not new and different products in the sense <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>of the definition of manufacture. What is said of these products may, in general, be said of the others excepting the three which we agree are manufactured.</p>

E. 2d 614</a> (1938); The decision in the <em>Wisconsin Electric </em>case was “that electrical energy supplied to these dairy plants through single meters, or through more than one but without differentiation as to use, is energy sold for commercial consumption.” That decision sheds no light on the legislative meaning intended by our legislature in the mercantile tax law of 1947. In the Ohio case, a town ordinance, requiring a license to engage in the business of “peddling and dealing in milk” was held in conflict with a statute prohibiting municipalities from requiring “of the owner of any product of his own raising, or the manufacturer of any article manufactured by him” a license to sell “in any way, by himself or agent, any such article or product.” The agent of a dairy company was fined in a mayor’s court for peddling its products without a license. The conviction was set aside. After reciting that the dairy company pasteurized milk purchased from farmers the court continued “The dairy company also sells by-products which it manufactures, such as cottage cheese, buttermilk and pure butter fat. The dairy company has its pasteurization vats, machinery for straining the milk, machinery for bottling the milk, and machinery for cleansing the bottles. ■ It is undisputed that this machinery is extensive and expensive in its operation. It is further undisputed that in preparing the milk for sale, it requires the operation of all these machines. This certainly comprehends more than <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>a mere dealing in a raw product. ... It would seem that these facts clearly establish that the defendant’s employer is a manufacturer.” While we have reached the same conclusion as respects ice cream, cottage cheese and butter, we cannot regard what the Ohio court says of pasteurization as affecting the meaning of “manufacture” established by the long line of our cases expressly dealing with the word in our taxing statutes.</p>
