The decision turns on a point of procedure and not on whether there was abuse of discretion in granting the new trial, the point usually presented in appeals from, such orders. The plaintiff transportation company sued to recover for damage to its trolley car resulting from collision with defendants’ concrete-mixer ■ truck. The jury found for plaintiff. Defendants’ motions for judgment n. o. v. and for a new trial were overruled by the court in banc and judgment on the verdict was entered January 5, 1948, during the December term of the court below. Thereafter on March 25, 1948, during March term, the December term order, refusing a new trial and directing judgment on the verdict, was superseded by an order granting a new trial, the order chai<a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>lenged by the present appeal. The question is whether the trial court had sufficient control of the judgment during March term to enable the court then to grant a new trial.</p>

No stay of proceedings was granted nor did the court set aside its order of January 5 refusing the new trial motion. The judgment remained undisturbed. On February 28, the plaintiff answered the rule. Thereafter the court made an order that “the defendants above named, having presented a petition to show cause why the court should not hear reargument of the defendants’ motions for judgment n. o. v. and for a new trial, and the court having allowed a rule thereon returnable March 1, 1948, and the matter having come on for argument before the court en banc, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the said rule be and the same is hereby made absolute, and the court will hear reargument of the said motions on Tuesday, March 9, 1948, at 10:00 o’clock A. M.” In other words, the court in the March term, decided to hear reargument on March 9th. The effect of the rehearing was to reinstate the motion for a new trial. Meanwhile, in the absence of a stay of proceedings, the order refusing a new trial and the <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>judgment entered January 5, pursuant thereto, remained in effect.</p>

The order of February 13th grant ing the rule to show cause contained no stay of proceeding or other reservation of control over the judgment, which therefore remained unaffected by the order granting the rehearing. Mere leave to argue that a rehearing should be granted did not reopen the order of January 5 refusing a new trial: <em>Dean v.

Such an order, if in time, would of course have set aside the verdict and judgment: <em>Giles v.

It was ineffective because the court had <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>not, during -December term, reserved power to extend or project its control over the verdict and judgment into March or any subsequent term. If for example, during December term, the court had granted the reargument and reinstated the motion for a new trial, the case relied -on, <em>Kingsdorf v. Frank Gamburg, Inc., </em><a href="/pa-super/147/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="147 Pa. Super. 84" data-case-ids="1039032" data-case-paths="/pa-super/147/0084-01">147 Pa.

There is an essential difference between granting a rehearing of a motion for a new trial that has been- dismissed and reinstating a motion for a new trial with leave to argue it a second time. Dismissal of a motion for a new trial will support the entry of judgment; the mere, allowance of a rehearing will not affect the judgment unless the court retains control, as, for example, by staying all proceedings meanwhile: compare <em>Frazier Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/7/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="7 Pa.

Frank Gamburg, Inc., </em>supra, when carefully examined, supports the appellant. On page'87, the opinion of the Superior Court states, “On January 23, 1940, within the term of the entry of the judgment, the defendant obtained a rule to show cause why a reargument of the rule for a new trial should not be granted, on the ground of after-discovered evidence, including. . . . Following an answer filed by the plaintiff to this rule, and the taking of depositions in support of it, and oral argument on the rule, the -court, on March 30,1940, made the rule absolute and granted a new trial. The motion having been made within the term, no objection can be made that it was: not finally disposed of until a subsequent term’: Lance v. Bonnell, <a href="/pa/105/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="105 Pa. 46" data-case-ids="454268" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0046-01">105 Pa. 46</a>.” On page 90, in <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>discussing “the effect of the granting-of a new trial,” the opinion states, “In this connection, it must be remembered that a motion for a new trial was filed within four days after the verdict was rendered, and that the motion for a reargument of this rule was made within twelve days after the rule had been discharged and eleven days after the entry of judgment and the issuance of an attachment execution thereon, and <em>within the term of the judgment. </em>A motion for a new trial may. be-allowed any time within the term, and if the motion is filed within the term, it may be disposed of at a subsequent term. . .</p>
    <p id="b353-3" data-blocks='[["BL_353.4",353,[108,877,1149,1413]]]'>We have examined the record in that case, and we find that on defendant’s petition “a rule is granted to show cause why a reargument should not be granted . . . <em>and why a new trial should not he granted . . . because of after discovered evidence . . </em>.” (italics supplied). It will be observed that the order involved more than mere leave to reargue. The rule ordered two things: first, to show cause why the reargument of the first motion for a new trial should not be had; and, second, something not involved in the first motion for a new trial and, in fact originating thereafter, to show cause <em>why a new trial should not ■ he granted on the ground of after-discovered evidence. </em>The court, in the second quotation made above from the opinion uses the words “the motion for a reargument' of this rule.” While that phraseology identified the rule, it did not mention the rule to show cause why a new trial should not be granted for after-discovered evidence, a-reason not considered in the first motion; it was on this second ground that the trial court had granted the new trial. The order to show cause why there should not be reargument did not, of itself, continue the control of the court into the next term but-the order to show cause why there should not be a new trial for after-discovered evidence, did continue the power of the court because the order was made during the term in which the judgment was entered.</p>

But unless such control has been reserved, tbe law prohibits action after tbe term, unless, as the cases cited above show, there is extrinsic fraud, clerical error, or tbe like.
