The crime’s locale was Philadelphia; its victim, Cecil Ingling, a forty-two year old patrolman off duty. On January 30,1947, David Almeida, Edward Hough and James Smith imbibed freely of liquor at a Philadelphia taproom, and in another taproom at 22nd and Fitzwater Streets Smith gave a .45 automatic type revolver to Hough and “a large pistol” to Almeida. Hough had a smaller pistol. Carrying out a “hold-up” plan they then went to a garage, pointed their pistols at the attendant, stole a blue car, and motored to the Acme Market, 29th <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>and Fairmount Avenue. There Smith said: “This looks like a good place.” Almeida and Hough entered the market. The former had a handkerchief tied around the lower part of his face, and the latter wore black glasses. They entered the market with drawn guns. Hough emptied a cash register, saying: “This is a hold-up.” He also took $3 from the cashier’s wallet. He then robbed another cash register. Almeida, with gun in hand, approached the store manager. The latter yelled, “Hold-up,” and grabbed two cans of corn, whereupon Almeida cursed him, and said: “I’ll get you” and started firing. The manager was not hit. The total amount stolen was |262. Almeida also grabbed some bills from a one-armed customer.</p>

Patrolman Ingling was off duty at the time and when the bandits were backing their car Ingling returned to his car in which his wife, his son Leon and his daughter Jean, age 16 and 15 respectively, were sitting. The cries of “hold-up” brought three policemen and two police cars to the scene. Officer Waters and Officer Fox, in one of the police cars, came almost abreast of the blue car when Hough fired a bullet in their direction at a distance of about 30 feet. Policeman Waters then fired a shot at him.</p>

For any individual forcibly to defend himself or his family or his property from criminal aggression is a primal human instinct. It is the right and duty of both individuals and nations to meet criminal aggression with effective countermeasures. Every robber or burglar knows when he attempts to commit his crime that he is inviting dangerous resistance. ... If <em>in fact </em>one of the bullets fired by Ear] Shank in self-defense killed Harvey Zerbe, the responsibility for that killing rests on Moyer and his co-conspirator Byron, who had armed themselves with deadly weapons for the purpose of carrying out their plan to rob Shank and whose murderous attack made Shank’s firing at them in self-defense essential to the protection of himself and his employees and his property.”</p>

The <em>legal </em>question presented and decided in the <em>Moyer-Byron </em>case was precisely the legal question raised in the instant case; to wit, when men who are feloniously shot at by robbers return their fire in self-defense and a third person is killed by a shot fired by the defenders, are the robbers whose felonious action caused the shooting guilty of murder? In the <em>MoyerByron </em>case this Court after a thorough discussion of that question decided that under the facts of that case, “The Moyer-Byron felonious invasion of the Shank gas station on July 13, 1946, was likewise the proximate cause of the resultant fatality.” (191 of 357 Pa.)

Wharton on Homicide, Third Edition, p. 30, says under the heading of “Causal Connections” that: “. . . one whose wrongful act hastens or accelerates the death of another, or contributes to its cause, is guilty of homicide, though other causes co-operate. And he is guilty <em>if Ms act was the cause of the cause of death; if the relation was causal, </em>and the injured condition was not merely the occasion upon which another cause intervened not produced by the first injury, or related to it in any other than a casual way, then the person inflicting the injury is guilty of homicide.” Professor Joseph H. Beale of Harvard Law School in an article entitled “The Proximate Consequences of an Act,” 33 Harvard L. R. 633, 646, said: “Though there is an active force intervening after defendant’s act, <em>the result will nevertheless be proximate if the defendant’s act actively caused the intervening force. </em>In such a case the defendant’s force is really continuing in active operation, <em>by means of the force it stimulated into activity. . . . </em>Defendant may by his conduct so affect a person or an animal as to stir him to action; the result of such action is chargeable to defendant. . . . Defendant by threats of violence drove his wife through the house until she jumped out of the window; he was a proximate cause of the injury thereby resulting to his wife.” Citing: <em>Reg. v. Halliday, </em>61 L. T. R. 701, 702 (1889), where Lord Coleridge, C. J., said: “If a man creates in another man’s mind an immediate sense of danger which causes such person to try to escape, and in so doing he injures himself, the person who creates such a state of mind is responsible for the injuries which result.” Professor Beale sums up the requirements of proximity of result as follows: “1. The defendant must have acted (or failed to act in violation of a duty). 2. The force <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>thus created must (a) have remained active itself <em>or created another force which remained active until it directly caused the </em>result; or (b) have created a new active <em>risk </em>of being acted upon by the active force that caused the result.”</p>

The Court held that the defendant could not avoid the consequences of his wrongful act by <em>relying on a supervening cause which resulted naturally and proximately from that act. </em>The Court said: “. . . in the instant case the wrongful act of the defendant; that is, firing at or near the boys in the boat, was the proximate cause, the producing cause, the cause that was primarily responsible for the death of deceased.” The defendant was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. The jury apparently found that there was no malice in the defendant’s act. However, in order to convict him of even involuntary manslaughter the jury had to find that the <em>proximate cause </em>of the drowning of the deceased was the firing by the defendant of two shots near the boat in which the deceased was sitting when it was capsized by the action of a <em>third </em>occupant who ■ having been frightened by defendant’s shooting, jumped out of the boat in such a way as to capsize it. The “jumping out” from the boat, which act capsized it, was the natural result of the defendant’s unlawful act in firing shots toward the boat, and his unlawful act was, therefore, the proximate cause of the fatality.</p>

Where a burglar or kidnapper breaks into a man’s home with the intent to steal property therein or to kidnap a child and while so engaged opens fire upon the occupants, and the man of the house returns the fire in an attempt to defend his family, and by mischance he kills his wife or his child, or his servant, the invading felon is <em>morally and legally responsible for that homicide. </em>In Pennsylvania and in other jurisdictions such a felon would be adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree.

Whether his own weight or the weight of himself <em>and </em>the watchman caused the ladder to break would have been immaterial as affecting the result.

In treating therein with the defendant’s contention that he could not be held guilty of murder if the jury should find that one of the resisting policemen fired the fatal bullet, the opinion for the court en banc states that “Whatever doubts may have existed on this question have been unequivocally settled by the recent decision in Commonwealth v. Moyer, <a href="/pa/357/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="357 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="472087" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0181-01">357 Pa. 181</a> (1947), which stands for the proposition that all who participate in a robbery, are guilty of first degree murder if someone is killed in the course of the crime even though the fatal bullet is fired by some third person ‘in an attempt by him to frustrate the attempted robbery.’ ” I do not think that this Court’s pronouncement in the <em>Moyer </em>case, supra, should be taken as justifying the broad and unrestricted ground of liability upon which the learned trial judge submitted this case to the jury. Indeed, this Court’s opinion in the instant case does not 'warrant a finding of murder under the felony murder theory for a killing not actually committed by the felons or their accomplices <em>except </em>upon a showing and adjudication of causal connection between the perpetrators of the felony and the homicide.</p>

Thus, the learned trial judge’s charge in this connection was as follows: “Was this a holdup? That is for you to say from all these facts. Is this a holdup? If you have any reasonable doubt about the fact that this was a holdup, you must give this defendant the benefit of it and say, not guilty, but the doubt must be reasonable. If you have no reasonable doubt about it, then your verdict should be guilty of murder in the first degree”,— virtually a directed verdict of guilt in the circumstances. It is further evident from the instruction, just quoted, that the learned trial judge did not reckon with the <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>necessity of the <em>jury’s </em>finding causation. Else, why did he instruct the jury that, unless they found that there was a “holdup”, they would have to acquit the defendant? Failure to find a “holdup” would, of course, have eliminated the presence of malice and, thus, have prevented the homicide from being deemed murder. But,' the causation, just the same, would be no less efficient to convict the defendant of manslaughter. See comment in the majority opinion on the jury’s verdict in <em>Letner v.

Whether the acts of Almeida and his confederates<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>

The only way that the question of the defendant’s guilt can any longer be properly adjudicated upon adequate instructions to the jury is by the medium of a new trial for the granting of which there is ample precedent. See <em>Commonwealth, v. Kelly, </em>supra. In the <em>Kelly </em>case, the defendant was convicted of a felony murder and was sentenced to death but the judgment of guilt was reversed and the case sent back for a new trial because the trial judge had failed to submit to the jury whether there had been any break in the chain of events and whether the homicidal act was connected with the initial maliciously motivated offense. What the present Chief Justice said (at p. 288 of 333 Pa.) in the 'opinion for this Court, upon sending the <em>Kelly </em>case back for retrial, is peculiarly apposite, — “When the indictment charges that a murder was committed in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of any of the enumerated felonies, <em>the jury </em>must first decide whether the homicidal act was connected with the felony or was there <em>‘a </em>break in the chain of events.’ The court below erred in taking it upon itself to decide that basic question.” (Emphasis the author’s.)</p>
