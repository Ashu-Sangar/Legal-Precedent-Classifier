        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Lin\u00f1;\nPlaintiff appeals from the refusal to continue in force a preliminary injunction which had been granted on affidavits pursuant to Equity Eule 38. Unless clear abuse of discretion is shown such orders are affirmed: Trainer v. International Alliance, 353 Pa. 487, 491, 46 A. 2d 463 (1946). In this case: the error is plain. For that reason we granted plaintiff\u2019s p\u00e9titioh for a writ of supersedeas. The facts on the merits, as they may be developed on final hearing, are not before'us; we may therefore not at this time enter affinal decree such as appellant suggests is authorized by the Act of May 20, 1891, P. L. 101, section 2, 12 PS 1164.\nThe plaintiff is a member of the bar of this Court and also is a member of a voluntary association of patent agents and patent lawyers known as the Patent Law Association of Pittsburgh. He filed this bill February 17, 1949, in the court of common pleas of Allegheny County. The defendants' are seven individuals who constitute the board of managers of the Patent Law Association of Pittsburgh-. \u25a0 Plaintiff sues to restrain the defendants from instituting or conducting proceedings to expel him from the association on the ground of unprofessional conduct. He alleged that the \u2018defendants\u2019 proceeding, if not restrained, would cause irreparable harm to his professional, social and civic\u2018reputation, and that the defendants could not- and would not accord him a fair and impartial hearing because they had prejudged his conduct and bore; personal animosities, jealousies and prejudices against; him. -In the opinion.filed by the eourt below, Judge Montgomery, said, \u201cAt the conclusion of--the testimony relating to jurisdiction and before proceeding on the merit's of- the charges preferred against plaintiff, a motion- to refuse the preliminary injunction for lack \u00f3f. jurisdiction was sustained,'because: (1) Plaintiff failed to establish that any property right was involved; and (2) He failed to establish that he had exhausted or been deprived of his remedies provided by the By-laws of the Association.\u201d We differ from the learned chancellor, on both grounds.\nThe objects of the association, as averred in paragraph 5 of the bill are: \u201c \u2018to promote social intercourse among its members, and the exchange of views upon subjects of professional interest; and to consider and take appropriate concerted action concerning matters which may arise affecting Patent, Trade-Mark and Copyright Laws and the administration thereof.\u2019 The membership consists of virtually all persons in Pittsburgh who are qualified to practice Patent Law and who are registered as Patent Agents before the United States Patent Office. The Board of Managers of the Association, under its by-laws, \u2018have general charge of the affairs, funds and property of the Association.\u2019 \u201d\nParagraphs 6, 7 and 8 of the bill are as follows: \u201c6. Membership in the Association is a valuable property right, and plaintiff\u2019s membership therein is of substantial value to him.\u201d\n\u201c7. Article III, Section 6, of the Articles of Association of The Patent Law Association of Pittsburgh provides : \u2018Section 6. Any member of this Association who, after a full hearing by the Board of Managers, shall be found by the affirmative vote of five (5) members of said Board to have conducted his profession in an unethical or unprofessional manner, shall be expelled from this Association.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201c8. Without any notice that any complaint had been lodged against him or that any aspect of his professional standing or conduct was under consideration by the defendants or any other body and without any opportunity to appear before the Board, or any representative thereof, on January 18, 1949, plaintiff received, by registered mail, a letter on the letterhead of the Association, dat\u00e9d January 17, 1949, and signed by defendant Schmeltz as President. This letter stated that at a meeting of the full Board of Managers of The Patent Law Association of Pittsburgh on January 13, 1949, \u2018full consideration was given to the facts leading up to, and the conclusions stated in the opinion of the Commissioner in the Peik Interferences Nos. 74841 and 75177, which was handed down on July 19, 1948,\u2019 and that \u2018as a result of this consideration\u2019 the Board had adopted a resolution \u2018to the effect that you immediately resign from our Association and that you also resign as a member of the Bar of all Courts before which you are eligible to practice, and that you submit to this Board evidence of compliance therewith within twenty days of the receipt of this letter.\u2019 The letter then threatened that upon failure to comply with these \u2018demands\u2019 the Board would institute disciplinary \u2019 proceedings against plaintiff. A complete copy of this letter is attached hereto, made a part hereof and marked Exhibit \u2018A\u2019. The \u2018Commissioner\u2019 referred to in this l\u00e9tter is an appointive administrative officer in the United States Department of Commerce.\u201d\nThe \u201cfacts\u201d referred to in paragraph 8 of that bill \u201cleading up to\u201d the opinion of the commissioner of patents are stated by the plaintiff in paragraph 10. The plaintiff also avers that the commissioner of patents erred in attributing fraud to the plaintiff in making the affidavit referred to by the commissioner; plaintiff denies that he was guilty of any unethical or unprofessional conduct.\nIn paragraph 13 plaintiff avers, \u201cOn February 3, 1949 counsel for plaintiff met with defendant Sehmeltz and in the course of the meeting asserted that plaintiff was of the opinion that, because of prejudgment \u2022 and personal animosities and antagonisms, he would not get a fair hearing by defendants, acting in their capacities as members of the Board of Managers of the Association. Defendant Sehmeltz agreed that plaintiff\u2019s feeling was justified \u2018as to some\u2019 of the defendants. Plaintiff, acting through his counsel, thereupon insisted on his right to be heard by an unbiased tribunal and requested that defendants, or any of them, forthwith file a complaint against plaintiff with the Board of Governance of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and that defendants agree not to pursue any other proceedings until final action on the complaint filed with the Board of Governance. At that time defendant Schmeltz agreed to submit the proposal to the other defendants but, substantially conceding that the proceeding before the Board of Governance would result in a vindication of plaintiff, indicated that, because of personal animosities within the Association, defendants would probably insist on an agreement by plaintiff that regardless of the outcome of the.proceeding he would resign his membership in the Patent Law Association. Plaintiff refused to make such an agreement.\u201d\nIn paragraph 14 he avers that he was informed \u201cthat defendants would not agree to file a complaint with the Board of Governance but that they will, after the expiration of the time for compliance, institute proceedings to expel plaintiff from the Association.\u201d\nIn paragraphs 15 and 16 he avers that defendants have prejudged his case and have conspired \u201cirreparably to cause damage and injury to plaintiff by expelling him from the Association;\u201d and that he \u201cwill be deprived of a fair and impartial hearing, as is clearly indicated by the letter of January 17, 1949, and defendants\u2019 conduct and statements prior and subsequent thereto.\u201d\nParagraph 18 avers \u201cThe expulsion of plaintiff from membership in The Patent Law Association of Pittsburgh, would deprive him of valuable property rights, would interfere with his ability to earn a living, and, regardless of whether he might subsequent thereto,, by resort to judicial process, compel his restoration to membership, would cause irreparable harm to his professional, social and civic reputation.\u201d\nDefendants\u2019 letter of January 17, 1949, addressed to the plaintiff, signed by Andrew H. Schmeltz, President, is written on the letterhead of the' Patent Law Association of Pittsburgh and is as follows: \u201cAt a meeting of the full Board of Managers of The Patent Law Association of Pittsburgh on January 13, 1949, full consideration was given to the facts leading up to, and the conclusions stated in the opinion of the Commissioner in the Peik interferences Nos. 74,841 and 75,177 which was handed down on July 19,1948.\n\u201cAs a result of this consideration, the Board adopted a resolution to the effect that you immediately resign from our association and that you also resign as a member of the bar of all courts before which you are eligible to practice and that you submit to this Board evidence of compliance therewith within twenty days of the receipt of this letter. In the event of your failure to comply with the demands of the resolution, it will be necessary for this Board to institute disciplinary proceedings against you.\n\u201cThis letter is written in compliance with the requirements of the above mentioned resolution and on behalf of the Board of Managers of The Patent Law Association of Pittsburgh.\u201d\nThe right of property vested in members of unincorporated associations rests on the agreement of the associates and may vary with the nature and purposes of the association. The contract creates the right and even the state may not impair the obligation of the contract. Equity interferes in the interest of all the rights flowing from the contract relation. Expulsion from such an association was considered by this Court as early as 1810 in Com. v. St. Patrick\u2019s Benevolent Society, 2 Binney (Pa.) 440, in which the society was required to restore to membership the expelled relator. See also Manning v. Klein, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 210 (1896); Heasley v. Operative Plasterer\u2019s and Cement Finishers International Ass\u2019n, 324 Pa. 257, 188 A. 206 (1936); Law v. Chartered Institute of Patent Agents [1919] 2 Ch. 276; Fisher v. Keane, L. R. 11 Ch. Div. 353 (1879); State ex rel. Waring v. Georgia Medical Society, 38 Ga. 608 (1869).\nThe court had jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter. \u201cOrdinarily\u201d as was said in Heasley v. Operative Association, 324 Pa. 257, 261, 188 A. 206. (1936) \u201ccourts will not entertain jurisdiction in such cases unless the remedies provided by the laws of the organization have first been exhausted: Maloney v. United Mine Workers of America, (308 Pa. 251). But here no practical avenue of appeal within the association was open to plaintiffs. The International Executive Board had already acted in the situation by delegating Mcllveen to reorganize the local.\u201d The paragraph from which we quote ends by the statement, \u201cThe law does not insist upon forms when resort to them would be an obvious futility.\u201d If therefore the defendants have disqualified themselves to sit in judgment, the courts must intervene. \u2022\nAt the hearing in the court below, parts of the bill were read in evidence, and the articles of association of the Patent Law Association were admitted. One of the defendants, Mr. Schmeltz, was called for cross examination.\nWe all agree that the defendants by their letter of January 17, 1949, written in the circumstances shown in the record, have disclosed such prejudice against the plaintiff and such prejudgment of the case, as to require them to withdraw from participation in the hearing on the charge (Article III, section 6, of the articles of association) that the plaintiff had \u201cconducted his profession in an unethical and unprofessional manner\u201d rendering him liable to expulsion. The text of the letter not only shows a disqualifying state of mind, but, so far as now appears in the record, shows an attitude requiring the exclusion of the defendant members of the board from participation as members of the trial tribunal. If the activity of the board was limited to the purposes of the members among themselves, it was ultra vires to demand plaintiff\u2019s resignation \u201cas a member of the bar of all courts before which you are eligible to practice\u201d etc. In considering disqualification, we next have their threat to institute disciplinary proceedings if plaintiff refused their demand to resign as a member of the bar. What had the defendants then to do with plaintiff\u2019s membership of the bar of this or any other court? Of what relevance was it in their inquiry? If the association was then acting in the public interest to prevent unworthy lawyers from practicing law, its duty in that interest should have required the institution of immediate disbarment proceedings if a proper case was submitted to them. It appears clear to us that the defendant board, in violation of elementary principles, was acting as prosecutor and trial tribunal at the same time. When both functions, in rare cases of necessity, become united in a single person or tribunal, it is not only necessary that there be absolute impartiality but it is necessary that such impartiality appear without possibility of misunderstanding. The record now discloses complete disqualification.\nIt appears that on July 19, 1948, the patent..commissioner had filed an opinion in .which he had concluded that plaintiff on May 10, 1935, had made and filed an affidavit intended to mislead the patent office. Based on that transaction a complaint against plaintiff was lodged with the association by E. W. McCallister in November, 1948. Mr. McCallister was not then a member of the board. The complaint was received by defendant Schmeltz and was referred to the ethics and grievance committee.\nEarly in December, 1948, the board held a meeting at which the patent commissioner\u2019s opinion was discussed. The board determined that it would take jurisdiction of the complaint against the plaintiff, \u201cby-passing\u201d the ethics and grievance committee to whom Mr. Schmeltz had referred Mr. McCallister\u2019s complaint. Mr. W. Denning Stewart,, who appears in the present case as counsel for defendants, and Mr. Schmeltz, defendant, went to Washington and discussed the case with the commissioner of patents and a Mr. Hall who is said to have participated in the patent cases as counsel opposed to plaintiff. Additional information was secured from a former associate of appellant named Webb. At this same meeting of the board in December, 1948, Mr. Mackey, a member, of the board having resigned, the six remaining members, to fill the vacancy in the board, elected E. W. McCallister, who had made the complaint in November, 1948.\nOn January 13, 1949, the board met to consider the charge against plaintiff who had ho notice of the meeting. The seven defendants participated but kept no minutes. Mr. Schmeltz reported his investigation and submitted certain material secured from Mr. Hall. The result of this meeting was that the letter of January 17th was drafted and after approval by all of the members of the board was sent to the plaintiff. On January 15, 1949, however, Mr. Schmeltz, as president of the board, wrote to each member of the board suggesting \u201cthat we seem to be denying the gentleman the right to be heard by our association provided for in the articles \u00f3f the association.\u201d He suggested that the board refer to appellant\u2019s right to a hearing and offer him such hearing if he refused to resign. The other members rejected this suggestion. Mr. McCallister is still a member of the board and is one of the defendants and is therefore still engaged in bringing the plaintiff to trial before himself and other defendants. It thus appears that a party who made the first complaint to the board, has since, by the votes of the other members, become a member of the board in succession tea member who resigned after the complaint reached the bo\u00e1rd. Mr. Schmeltz testified that his recollection was that at a meeting with counsel for the appellant, he, Mr. Schmeltz, made \u201ca statement to the \u00e9ffect that perhaps some of them were prejudiced\u201d, meaning some of the members of the board. At page 90a the following appears in the cross-examination of Mr. Schmeltz: \u201cQ. Do you remember my expressing the opinion that no judicial or quasi-judicial body would, on the basis of the evidence against him, discipline Blenko? A. I do. I remember you say that. Q. Do you remember in substance agreeing with the statement? A. In substance agreeing with it. I said something to the effect I thought before a panel of fair and unprejudiced people you would have \u00bf good chance to get Blenko off.\u201d ,\nIn testifying about the investigation Mr. Schmeltz was confronted with the affidavit made by the plaintiff May 10, 1935,- apparently the basis of the ruling by the commissioner of patents and therefore important in connection with the charges against plaintiff. He was asked to specify in the affidavit what it was that was submitted to the board as false at the meeting in Mr. McCallister\u2019s office. He ultimately answered as follows: \u201cA. The exact wording of it appearing on page 20, the language [of Blenko\u2019s affidavit] is, \u2018that under all the circumstances the said abandonment may properly be said to have occurred through accident and mistake.\u2019 In connection with that I pointed out that in my opinion that was an argumentative conclusion that was intended, and could only have been added for the purpose of intending to mislead the Patent Office as to the circumstances as they existed at that time. Q. But you concede that is what you call an argumentative conclusion and not an assertion of fact? A. To me it appeared to be that.\u201d Later, at page 118a the witness stated that in his opinion and in the opinion of the board \u201cthere was something improper in the addition of that conclusion to this affidavit of Blenko\u2019s.\u201d Whatever construction shall ultimately be put upon it, the affidavit was made and filed in the patent office in 1935. At this stage of the record we can not pass on the charge based on the affidavit nor should we now determine the effect of the delay in the proceeding with respect to it; that will be for consideration after defendant association shall have had an opportunity to answer and proceed to final hearing, if that course is taken. s\nPlaintiff has shown, prima facie, that in their deliberation concerning the charge brought against plaintiff, defendants have so conducted themselves as to require a court of equity to divest them of the power conferred on them by the association to try the plaintiff on the charge presented by Mr. McCallister. The learned chancellor erred in resting his refusal to enjoin on the grounds that plaintiff had failed to establish a property right and had also failed to show that he had been deprived of the remedies provided by the by-laws of the association.\nThe order refusing the preliminary injunction is reversed; the injunction granted February 17, 1949, by Judge Patterson is re-instated; the record is remitted with instructions to restrain the defendants, members of the board of managers of the Patent Law Association of Pittsburgh, from proceeding with the trial of the charge instituted on the complaint filed by Edgar W. McCallister in November, 1948, until final hearing of this cause, costs to abide the result.\nA number of common pleas decisions illustrate various phases of the subject: Leech v. Harris et ah, 2 Brewster 571 (Pa.) (1869) ; Powell v. Abbott et al., 14 Phila. 104 (1880). See also Lenahan v. Perm State League, 21 Luz. L. Reg. 165 (1920) ; Danner v. Rhoads, 15 Berks Co. Law Journal 41 (1922). In Metropolitan Base Ball Association v. Simmons et al., 17 Phila. 419 (1885) the opinion was written by President Judge, Thayeb, who said, \u201cNow, membership of such an association, after it has been acquired in pursuance of the constitution, is a matter which is in itself legal property even in an unincorporated association; the right of membership in such an association is recognized in the courts of Pennsylvania as property, and no man can be deprived of it without having forfeited it by some act which was lawful ground and cause of forfeiture, nor without notice and trial.\u201d\nThe subject is considered by Pound, 29 Harv. Law Rev. 640 at page 677 (1916), and by Walsh: Equity (Callaghan and Co., 1930), p. 275 et seq.\nThe Act of 1836, P. L. 784, sec. 13, 17 PS 281, provides: \u201cThe several courts of common pleas shall have the jurisdiction and powers of a court of chancery, so far as relates to: ... V. The supervision and control of all corporations other than those of a municipal character, and unincorporated societies or associations, and partnerships.\u201d\nIn his opinion filed in the case Judge Montgomery said, \u201cIf the Board of Managers deem it necessary to proceed, further to determine plaintiff\u2019s right to membership in the Patent Law Association,, they should proceed according to the By-Laws and practices even to the extent of filling the vacancies on the Ethics Committee and haying it first consider the complaint. In filling those vacancies care' should be exerted to assure the appointment of persons who have no personal relations or particular feeling toward plaintiff. When the matter is referred to the Board, Mr. McCallister should refrain from sitting since he filed the complaint.\u201d.",
