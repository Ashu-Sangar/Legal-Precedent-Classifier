The refusal of the court to withdraw the evidence and instruct the jury as requested, is the subject of complaint in the several specifications of error.\nIn his opinion refusing a new trial, the learned judge, referring to the manner in which the case was tried, says: \u201cWhen .....objection was about being made to the admission of defendant\u2019s testimony as to set-off, because it was apparent the amount of set-off claimed would exceed the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace and could not have boon admitted by the justice, we very plainly intimated to counsel that if the justice had not jurisdiction of defendant\u2019s set-off, neither had he of plaintiff\u2019s claim as shown by the narr and pleadings in the ease, as both in amount exceeded the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace, and that it would probably be best to dismiss the case for that reason; but, neither party desired that this should be done. Both appeared desirous of proceeding with and disposing of the case on its merits. The objection was not pressed nor entered and the case was proceeded with on its merits, as if originally brought in this court. The whole dealings and accounts between the parties'were fully and fairly laid before the jury. The plaintiff, without objection on the part of the defendants, took his chance of obtaining a verdict, and did obtain a verdict for $22.68.\u201d\nIn view of what clearly appears to be the fact, that technical objections were waived and by mutual consent the case was tried upon its merits as though the suit had been originally brought in court, it was too late, after all the testimony was before the jury without any exception to its admission, to ask the court to strike out the evidence on which defendants mainly relied, and to direct a verdict in favor of plaintiff. Under the circumstances, the court was clearly right in refusing to do either. The assignments of error are not sustained.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "J. O\u2019FERRALL & CO. v. S. MOORE ET AL.\nERROR TO THE COURT OE COMMON PLEAS OE LANCASTER COUNTY.\nArgued May 24, 1889\nDecided June 7, 1889.\nIf, upon the trial of an appeal from the judgment of a justice of the peace, the cause is tried upon its merits, without regard to the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim or of the defendant\u2019s set-off, it is too late, when all the testimony is before the jury, for the plaintiff to ask to have the defendant\u2019s evidence of set-off withdrawn from the jury, on the ground that its amount exceeds the jurisdiction of the justice.\nBefore Sterrett, Clark, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nNo. 358 January Term 1889, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 22 May Term 1887, C. P.\nOn April 1, .1887, John O\u2019Ferrall, trading as John O\u2019Ferrall & Co., obtained judgment before a magistrate against Samuel Moore and Eugene M. Haines, for 8293.92, from which judgment the defendants took an appeal. In the Court of Common Pleas the plaintiff, on April 23, 1887, declared on a note for 8400, dated September 7, 1886, with the common counts. At the foot of the narr was the memorandum: \u201c 8400 less f 114.29,\u201d and the following statement in addition:\n\u201c Amount of plaintiff\u2019s demand 8285.71\nCost of protest, etc., 2.51\nInterest from December 9,1886 -\u201d\nOn the same day the plaintiff filed an affidavit of claim setting out a copy of the note with a credit indorsed of 8114.29, and claiming a balance of 8285.71, with interest from December 9, 1886, and 82.51 costs of protest.\nThe defendants pleaded, non-assumpsit, payment, payment with leave and set-off.\nAt the trial on February 8, 1888, before Livingston, P. J., the plaintiff put in evidence the note with its indorsement and rested.\nThe defendants showed that the note was given in part payment for fruit cans which defendant Moore had purchased from the plaintiff, and offered evidence to the effect that Moore had suffered damage by reason of the defective character of the cans furnished, loss on fruit, delay, overcharges, etc., and as to cash paid by defendants in excess of the credits allowed. When footed up the items of damage and credit claimed by the defendants, upon the evidence, aggregated 8442.81.\nThe plaintiff adduced testimony in rebuttal of defendants\u2019 case, and when the case was closed on the evidence, \u201c Mr. Hensel, on behalf of plaintiff, requested the court to withdraw from the jury all evidence offered by the defence in support of a set-off, as the total amount of set-off exceeded $300, a sum beyond the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace from whom this case comes into this court on an appeal; and to instruct the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff for the full amount of his claim.\u201d\nThe court declined to withdraw the testimony of set-off from the jury, and to instruct the jury as requested by plaintiff\u2019s counsel. Exception to plaintiff.\nWhile the case was with the jury, by leave of the court, the plaintiff amended his narr by declaring for $285.63, instead of $400.\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $22.63. A rule for a new trial having been discharged, by opinion filed, Livingston, P. J., the plaintiff took this writ, specifying that the court erred:\n1. In not withdrawing from the jury all evidence offered by the defence in support of a set-off after it appeared that the total amount of set-off claimed exceeded three hundred dollars.\n2. In not withdrawing from the jury all evidence offered by the defendants except so much as related to payment and overcharges.\n3. In not giving binding instructions for the plaintiff for his whole claim, except so much as was shown to have been paid or to have been based on overcharges.\n4. In not giving binding instructions for the plaintiff for the full amount of his claim.\nMr. W. U. Hensel (with him Mr. Brown), for the plaintiff in error.\nMr. Marriott Brosius, for the defendants in error."
