The refusal of the court to withdraw the evidence and instruct the jury as requested, is the subject of complaint in the several specifications of error.</p>

Both appeared desirous of proceeding with and disposing of the case on its merits. The objection was not pressed nor entered and the case was proceeded with on its merits, as if originally brought in this court. The whole dealings and accounts between the parties'were fully and fairly laid before the jury. The plaintiff, without objection on the part of the defendants, took his chance of obtaining a verdict, and did obtain a verdict for $22.68.”</p>

Under the circumstances, the court was clearly right in refusing to do either. The assignments of error are not sustained.</p>
