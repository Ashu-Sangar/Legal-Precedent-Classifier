It applies to all cities of the commonwealth excepting those of the first class. The classification of cities by the act of 1874 has been declared to be within the power of the legislature, and legislation for the government of all cities of any particular class therein constituted is general and not local legislation: Wheeler v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/77/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="77 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="436265" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0338-01">77 Pa. 338</a>; Kilgore v.

It is equally applicable to all kinds of taxes, and bas been repeatedly used by the legislature in legislating upon the subject of taxation for general revenue purposes. The general tax laws provide for the “ assessment of county taxes,” the “ assessment of school taxes,” and the “ assessment of state taxes.” The supervisors of any township are authorized to “lay a rate or assessment not exceeding one cent on the dollar at any one time upon all real and personal estates within said township; ” similar authority “to lay a rate or assessment ” is conferred upon the overseers of the pool1 of any township. A similar use of the word occurs frequently in the municipal law of 1874 and its supplements, and indeed in many, if not most of the laws enacted upon the subject of taxation. It is my opinion that this is the sense in which it is used in the act under consideration, for the purpose of providing for all possible objections that may be raised to the tax <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>levies and assessments which were the subject of the act. Taken in this sense, the language is clear and unambiguous and germane to all the preceding provisions of the act. In the sense contended for by the plaintiff, it is vague, uncertain, and wholly unconnected with the subject and purposes of the act as expressed in the other portions of it. But if it is conceded that the word is used to indicate assessments for street improvements on property benefited by them, it may well be doubted whether the legislature intended it to be retroactive in its effect as to such assessments.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b198-5" data-blocks='[["BL_198.4",198,[234,865,1173,1208]]]'>That the legislature has the power to pass retrospective laws cannot be doubted. A recent example of the exercise of that power is found in the act of April 30, 1885, P. L. 11, which enacted that all ordinances theretofore passed, levying taxes in any of the cities of the third, fourth and fifth classes, in amount not exceeding twenty mills in any one year, were validated ; and the Supreme Court affirmed the validity of that act in Erie City v. Reed, <a href="/pa/113/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="113 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="457576" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0468-01">113 Pa. 468</a>. It was the clearly expressed intention of the act that it should ■ be retrospective in its effect. But there is no canon of construction better settled than this, that a statute shall always be interpreted so as to operate prospectively, and not retrospectively, unless the language is so clear,as to preclude all question as to the intention of the legislature. “ Retrospective laws generally, if not universally, work injustice and ought to be so construed only when the mandate of the legislature is imperative: ” Taylor v. Mitchell, <a href="/pa/57/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="57 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="1010414" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0209-01">57 Pa. 209</a>; “No statute is held to operate retroactively unless its language admits of no other construction: ” Neff’s App., <a href="/pa/21/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="21 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="411562" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0243-01">21 Pa. 243</a>: “ And nothing short of the most indubitable phraseology is to convince us that the legislature meant their enactment to have any other than a prospective operation: ” Dewart v. Purdy, <a href="/pa/29/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="29 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="982860" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0113-01">29 Pa. 113</a>.

If they intended by the language to distinguish between general taxes and local charges, it is equally clear they intended to distinguish between the effect to be given to the act upon the two kinds of taxation. As to the one, its effect is retrospective, and as to the other, prospective. At least, it must be conceded that the language admits of that construction. It is the natural and grammatical construction. If 1 am correct in my conclusions as to this branch of the defence made by the defendants, their affidavit of defence is sufficient and it is unnecessary to consider the other questions raised.</p>
