The latter having paid, was held entitled to recover of the former his share for contribution, Parker, C. J., saying, “ We are of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover for the amount paid after the period when no action could have been sustained directly against the defendant by the payee of the note.”</p>

Paige, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20N.H.%20438" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="11 N.H. 438">11 N. H. 438</a>, the rule is thus stated: “ When one promisor still continues liable.....and is compelled to pay.....the liability of the co-promisors for con<a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>tribution will still remain, notwithstanding.....they may be discharged by the operation of the statute of limitations, from their liability to the promisee.”</p>
    <p id="b420-6" data-blocks='[["BL_420.4",420,[263,508,1174,508]]]'>In Wood v. Leland, 1 Metc. (Mass.) 387, it was said by Chief Justice Shaw, “ Defendants contend that as they could not be held responsible to the obligee after the year, so they would not be liable for contribution to a surety after that time. But the court are of opinion that the statute of limitations cannot be so applied. It may well be admitted that the statute of limitations would be a good bar to an action by the obligee;.....but the right of action by the surety for contribution does not accrue at the breach of the bond, but upon his payment of the money pursuant to that breach.”</p>

    <p id="b420-9" data-blocks='[["BL_420.6",420,[262,1381,1173,301]]]'>It is thus clear on the authorities that whatever rights of contribution plaintiff in error may have, arise out of his payment of more than his due proportion of the joint obligation, and will date from such payment, entirely unaffected by the fact that the statute of limitations has barred any direct liability of his co-surety 'to the creditor.</p>
    <p id="b420-10" data-blocks='[["BL_420.7",420,[262,1689,1171,198]]]'>The agreement relied on being therefore without consideration, either by way of advantage to the plaintiff or disadvantage to the defendant, was not a valid defence, and the learned judge was right in directing a verdict for plaintiff.</p>
