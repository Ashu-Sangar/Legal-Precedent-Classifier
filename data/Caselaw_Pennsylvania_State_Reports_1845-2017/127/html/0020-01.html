The plaintiff testified that he had presented the bill to the defendant: “ I spoke to him about it, and told him about the unsettled account of Sipler, Ashbaugh &amp; Co., and told him it was time it was settled, and he asked why I hadn’t spoke to him about it before; that he supposed the matter was settled; that he had paid his share and more too, and didn’t think he ought to pay any more. I told him it was not my fault, that it was not settled; that it was his business to see that it was settled. I had spoken to the other parties.” The defendant denied that he was a partner in the drilling of the well and testified that he had only purchased a one fourth interest in the lease with the well upon it drilled to completion.

    <p class="summary" id="b47-6" data-blocks='[["BL_47.5",47,[217,761,1172,553]]]'>The goods seem to have been delivered to Sipler in the fall of 1876. The amount is 854.76; no controversy about that. The last charge, I think, was December 19,1876. A larger amount of goods seem from the testimony of McElwaine to have been sold in the same way, and several payments made by Sipler reducing the claim to the amount claimed in this action. I think McElwaine testified to that, to two payments, perhaps, by Sipler. But were these defendants partners at the time of the sale and delivery of these goods ? The goods seem to have been charged to Sipler, Ashbaugh &amp; Go., but this is a fact of no consequence in the case as establishing the partnership.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b47-7" data-blocks='[["BL_47.6",47,[214,1322,1174,1068]]]'>The plaintiff contends that the defendants were partners in putting down an oil well, and the defendants contend that the arrangements between them did not constitute a partnership, and Sipler, Gatos and Ashbaugh have each taken the stand and each denied that any partnership existed between them, and each state the facts from which it is claimed by the plaintiff that a partnership is to be found, taken in connection with the other evidence. We have said to you that men may be held liable as partners, who hold themselves out to the world as partners, and thereby obtain credit. But there is no sufficient evidence that these parties held themselves out to the world as partners, and no recovery can be had against them for such reason, unless you find that they were partners in fact. Sipler is the only one of them that ever, according to the evidence, claimed that they were partners; and this is not such a holding out as partners as would make Ashbaugh, Gates and Logue partners or liable under it, unless they were actually partners in fact by their own agreement. And we say to you there can be no recovery in this case, unless you find that the defendants were, each and all of them, members of the partnership to which the goods were delivered.</p>

      <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>Now the evidence on the question of the partnership is confined mainly to the testimony of Sipler, Gates and Ashbaugh, I think they were the ones that were sworn. It is testified, or contended, or not denied, and evident from the evidence in the case, that in February, 1877, the February succeeding the November or December that the goods were delivered, a partnership was formed between Sipler, Morgan, Ashbaugh and Logue, but there is no allegation that Gates upon whom this writ in this case was served, was a member of that firm, and if he was, no recovery could be had in this case against that partnership formed afterwards, unless they were partners at the time of the sale of the goods. The partnership must <em>exist </em>at the - time the credit was obtained or there can be no recovery. It is alleged and testified that Gates bought a one fourth interest in an oil well of Sipler. [Gates testified that it was to be put down by Sipler, and that at the end he was to pay to Sipler what it cost to put down the well, one fourth of it, and that there was no agreement, arrangement or understanding for a partnership, or any understanding at that time that there was anything else in the transaction other than the purchase by him of a one fourth interest in a finished well. Sipler testifies substantially in the same way. The testimony is for you.] 6 It is alleged that Sipler testifies carelessly and that his recollection is faulty and his" testimony not always consistent with itself. That is for you. Ashbaugh says that he bought his interest in the same way, and that he knew nothing of how Gates acquired his interest.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b48-5" data-blocks='[["BL_48.4",48,[254,1741,1185,660]],["BL_49.1",49,[211,356,1186,1277]]]'>If this were all there is in this case, we say to you that we do not think it would make these parties partners in such a way as to be liable for the debt sued for here. A simple purchase of a one fourth interest in a finished well, the seller to put it down at his own cost and to receive the pay for it from the purchaser, we do not think would make of itself the purchaser liable as a partner, if he does not hold himself out as a partner. The witnesses all testify that this was the character of the transaction; that is, the witnesses for the defendants; that Sipler was paid in full for the well. They testify too that there was no agreement or understanding whether or not there was to be a future partnership or future operation. But it is claimed by the plaintiff that there are circumstances surround<a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>ing the transaction, going to show that these partios were partners, and that they have not testified truthfully. Now of course this evidence is for you, and we do not withdraw it from you. But is it sufficient to overcome what appears to be almost the uncontradicted evidence in the case of the three defendants who have testified as to this transaction ? There is no evidence in the case that Gates, Ashbaugh or Logue knew anything about goods being bought by Sipler and charged to the partnership of which they were alleged to be members. Gates and Ashbaugh both testify that they had no knowledge of this, and no one swears that they did at the time of the transaction. Gates testifies that the first knowledge that he had of it was some months afterwards. I don’t recollect how long, and it is not important. When a bill was presented to him by Mr. Mc-Elwaine, in which this was charged in this way, McElwaine testifies that at that time Gates says, “ Why didn’t you present that before ? ” and complained of the length of time. And Gates says that he contended at that time that he was not liable and did not belong to any such partnership. And he says that he did not admit any partnership except so far as it was an admission of it not to deny it at that time ; but that is not a question of great consequence in the case, for that is not such a holding out to the world that they were partners as would make them liable and authorize the plaintiff to recover against them unless they were partners in fact.</p>

If this transaction was simply a purchase by Gates of a one fourth interest in a well to be finished by Sipler, and Gates to pay Sipler for the putting of it down, and that was all, and the other man acquired his interest in the same way, as we have already said to you, that, as we think, of itself, and that is more a question of law than of fact,— we do not think under the authorities as we understand them that that would make these parties liable as partners; and you could not find that these parties were partners unless there was something else in the case besides this evidence that is sufficient to overcome the testimony of the defendants, themselves, and sufficient to justify the jury in coming to the conclusion that there was an actual partnership between these parties at the time. [If this was a purchase of a one fourth <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>interest and these parties were to go on and put down this well — these four men who owned it — at their joint expense, then we say that would be a partnership such as would make the defendants liable.] 7 But if it was a simple purchase by each of these parties as they testify, of a one fourth interest in a finished well, it would be holding the rule too strictly, or too loosely rather, to make parties liable under such circumstances. .....And we have already said to you that the fact that there was a partnership formed in February would not make these men liable here at all. Gates, according to the testimony, was not a member of the partnership, and unless he was a member at the time of the credit there could be no recovery, but if Gates had been a member of the partnership formed in February it would not make him liable at all from that fact. [If you do find from the evidence that these four men were partners at the time these goods were delivered, and the credit was obtained on the strength of this partnership, then your verdict will be for the plaintiff for the amount of the debt with interest.] 8</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b50-7" data-blocks='[["BL_50.4",50,[255,1336,1178,607]]]'>But you will bear in mind that you are not to find them partners unless you find from the evidence that in fact they were partners by agreement between themselves in some way. There is some evidence, Sipler denies it and McElwaine affirms it, that Sipler gave the names of this partnership and the names of the partners to Mr. McElwaine. That declaration would not hold Logue, Gates and Ashbaugh, for the declaration of one partner cannot bind the partnership in that way; it would be a very dangerous rule to do that. Whatever your view may be as to whether Sipler said that at the time, would not be very important in this case, and of itself it would be nothing, so far as liability on the part of the others is concerned.</p>
