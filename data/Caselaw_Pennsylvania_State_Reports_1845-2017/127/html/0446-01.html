By the other contract, plaintiff agreed to put in a tin roof, complete, and in a workmanlike manner, for $250. Plaintiff claimed the amount of the two contracts and also $223.70 for extra work and materials. $225.73 was admitted to be due, and judgment was taken therefor. This suit was for the balance.</p>

The defendant, and witnesses called by her, testified in support of her contentions, and she therefore claimed that as the contracts were entire, and had not been fulfilled by the plaintiff, he could not recover.</p>

You heard his testimony and the testimony of his witnesses. He testified, as you will recollect, that he did fulfil and substantially perform all that he contracted to perform, and furnished all the materials in accordance with the terms of the agreements or contracts between the parties..... Now you have heard the testimony of Mrs. Sticker and her daughter and the other witnesses and you will determine from all the evidence in the case whether the plaintiff did perform his contracts. And, whilst the law is as I have stated, yet the law is founded on reason, and all that is required of a party who makes a contract is that he shall substantially perform it. If he goes on to finish his contract honestly and in good faith and does so substantially, although there may be some slight matters that he has not performed, yet he may recover, and the question as to whether he substantially performed his contract or not, is a matter to be determined by the jury from the evidence in the case.</p>

There are many of them, but a few will suffice. In the case of Chambers v. Jaynes, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Pa.%2089" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Pa. 89">4 Pa. 89</a>, it was held: “A plaintiff, who has substantially and bona fide complied with the covenants on his part, in a written contract, is not precluded by slight omissions from receiving a fair compensation, according to such contract, where the breaches can be paid in damages.” That was a contract for the erection of a building, and the judge trying the case said this: “ The trifling omissions of a second coat of paint, on some of the window shutters and doors, and a grate in a cellar window, could be supplied at any time without injury or annoyance to the tenants.” In the case <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>of Preston v. Finney, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 53" data-case-ids="1853553" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0053-01">2 <em>W. </em>&amp; S. 53</a>, it was held: “An action upon a written contract, to recover the price of certain labor and services performed, will not be defeated by proof that the plaintiff failed in some slight particulars in his performance, if it appear that he acted with a bona fide intention of fulfilling his whole contract, and the other contracting received the fruit of his labor as performed.” That was a case of a contract to deliver logs, and the Supreme Court said : “ The contract was a very precise one. It specified not only the number of logs and time of delivery, but the mode of cutting, quality of them, the width to he not less than thirteen inches at the top end and the smallest logs not to be crooked, to be sixteen feet long, and not to be split in getting them down the hill. If the plaintiffs really and bona fide endeavored to fulfil tbe contract, and thought they had, but from accident or otherwise some did not measure to tbe width provided for, and were rejected as defective too late in the season to supply them, and the deficiency was no more than a small portion of the number stipulated,” etc. In that case the plaintiff was allowed to recover, although there was some defect in the logs and they did not entirely come np to the contract. I will refer only to one more ease, that of Ellis v. Lane, <a href="/pa/85/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="85 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="440455" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0265-01">85 Pa. 265</a>: “The defendants contracted to rebuild a mill ‘ to be furnished with machinery in all respects similar to that in the mill burned.’ The plaintiff contended that this was intended to mean all the machinery in the mill, whether in use or not. The court found that nearly all the machinery for which the plaintiff claimed damages had gone out of use or been laid aside, and that the only machinery in contemplation of the parties was that in actual use when the fire occurred, and that having been placed therein, the contract was substantially performed.” That was a case which was submitted to the court to be tried by the judge without a jury, and Justice Stbrrktt, in referring to the finding of the judge before whom the case was tried, said: “He further found that the contract had been substantially performed by the defendants and that the greater part of the work was fairly done; but, for defects in the frame work, roof, etc., he deducted $500 from the price agreed upon by the parties.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b473-5" data-blocks='[["BL_473.4",473,[181,2304,1171,92]],["BL_474.1",474,[284,379,1174,961]]]'>So you see, gentlemen of the jury, it becomes important for you under the evidence in this case to determine whether the <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>plaintiff substantially performed his part of the agreements in evidence. If he did not, but only performed the contracts in part, he cannot recover the price agreed upon in thé contracts; but if, on the other hand, you find that he substantially performed the agreements, then we think he is entitled to recover. Now, you heard the testimony of Mrs. Sticker and her witnesses in regard to many of the items, water closets, for instance. She claims they were not in accordance with the contract; that they were not the latest Philadelphia improved; that they were not such water closets as were to be furnished and put in her house under the contract in evidence. But if these are only slight and immaterial matters, the plaintiff, as I have shown you, would still be entitled to recover, the jury of course making proper deductions from the contract price for any damages sustained by her by reason of the plaintiff not fully complying with his contract. The jury in such case should deduct whatever it would cost to put those slight matters in place, in accordance with the terms of the contract of the parties.] 6</p>

There was evidence to justify the learned judge in submitting to the jury the question of a substantial compliance with the contract. Such evidence may be generally anticipated, now that the plaintiff is a competent witness. Whether the jury should, under all the evidence in the cause, have found such substantial compliance, was a matter which was for the consideration of the court below upon a motion for a new trial. It does not concern this court; hence we express no opinion upon it. A careful examination of the case fails to disclose error in those portions of the charge contained in the first six assignments.
