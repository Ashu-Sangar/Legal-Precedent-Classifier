These papers, and the duty of the court under the law, required a searching and thorough examination of the applicants. Nor could they complain of this.

The acts of 1887 were passed to cheek these evils. The act in reference to distillers, brewers, wholesale dealers and bottlers, was before the legislature at the same time as the retail act, and should be construed in connection with it, both as parts of the new system; for in all these cases the -court is required to hear remonstrances and objections and exercise a sound discretion.

Generally they were willing to confess the wrong and promise not to be guilty in the future. Those were granted license on that condition. But some claimed the right to sell to any persons who would pay, without inquiring or caring whether or not they were engaged in the illegal traffic. Of course, such were refused.

But it may be a convenience to wholesale druggists to have a wholesale liquor license, when filling orders from retail drug stores in the country, or to furnish a quart or gallon of liquor occasionally for proper purposes in the city. But it should be merely incidental to their other business, and the amount sold be a small fraction of their total sales. When the liquor traffic, especially in bottles and jugs, becomes a main feature of their business, they should be refused license. On this principle the court has acted.</p>

When the retailer deals out extensively in bottles, pints or quarts, he is.perverting his legitimate business; when the wholesaler deals out extensively in single bottles, he is perverting his legitimate business.</p>

The examination of the applicants showed that many of the parties having a wholesale license did little more than a retail business in bottles. That the jug trade constituted a main feature of their business. Such a house is a greater evil than a retail house. It sells almost exclusively in the neighborhood.

These are most disgraceful and demoralizing associations. The members themselves seem to have thought so, for they were generally-disguised under the name of a “ Literary ” or “ Musical ” society. This, however, is only a temporary evil, perhaps engendered by spiteful hostility to the stringent act of 1887. The clubs will soon die out. The had effects are already seen and felt. The members will soon get ashamed of them and abandon them. The existence of such clubs is no argument in favor of more licensed houses, for the members could all get enough drinks without them. It is rather an argument in favor of more stringent regulations, and for drawing a tighter rein on those wholesale dealers who furnish them the liquors.</p>

It is not unlawful to sell a quart of beer or whiskey in a bucket. But when men, women and children are seen with buckets entering or coming from a saloon or liquor store, and carrying them along the streets to their homes, the sight is offensive and revolting to most persons, and is regarded as a sure sign that the persons are of a low class and the saloon or store one of the lowest and worst. There is an indecency about it that should not be tolerated. Some one lias said the poor man ought to have the privilege of carrying his liquor in his bucket, for be cannot, like tbe rich man, have it sent in a demijohn by the express wagon to his bouse. But every man should have a decent respect to public opinion. Stopping the indecent bucket trade will not prevent any poor man from getting what liquor be wants.</p>

L. 194, provided that “licenses shall be granted only by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the proper county, in such manner as is provided by existing laws,” it referred to and carried into it some of the provisions of the retail act of May 13, 1887, P. L. 108, and therefore, among its rules to govern the license court, established Rule 6, and held that no one was of right entitled to a wholesale license; that the discretion to grant or refuse was wholly with the court; that the necessity of wholesale stores should be taken into account and no more licenses should be granted than the court thought were necessary to transact the wholesale business; that wholesale dealers should not sell in bottles or jugs, though the quantity sold was one quart or more; and that druggists’ sales should be but a small fraction of their total business, but what the percentage should be the court did not fix. It seems clear that the wholesale act does not authorize any of these rulings, and in so holding the court acted beyond the scope of its power.</p>

On the contrary, the act plainly states that licenses “ shall ” be granted, and the jurisdiction in the Court of Quarter Sessions to refuse a license, arises only when objections and remonstrances are filed, setting forth some fact which, under the act, would be ground of refusal. A comparison of the language of the retail act of May 13, 1887, with that of the wholesale act of May 24, 1887, plainly shows that while the former act was intended to regulate and restrain the sale of liquor by retail, and to vest a large discretion in the court, the latter act, on the contrary, was merely a revenue act and gave no power to the court, unless objections and remonstrances were filed. If a man or woman is a citizen of the United States, and is neither intemperate nor immoral, he or she may have a license to sell,liquors at wholesale. This the wholesale act of 1887 says, and it is similar in this respect to § 7, act of March 31, 1856, P. L. 200, as modified by § 6, act of April 20, 1858, P.

The words of the latter act, providing that licenses shall be granted only by the Court of Quarter Sessions “in such manner as is provided by existing laws,” refers either, (a) to the special act of April 3, 1872, P. L. 843, relating to Allegheny county, or (6) to the general act of March 31, 1856, as amended by the act of April 20, 1858. In either case, it is the duty of the court to grant licenses to all who comply with the act. Neither the retail act of 1887, nor the wholesale act of 1887, repealed the prior acts relating to wholesale licenses, and especially the local act of April 3, 1872, so far as relating to the qualifications of petitioners. One statute is not to be construed to repeal a prim-one which is not irreconcilable with it: Brown v. Commissioners, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Pa.%2043" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="21 Pa. 43">21 Pa. 43</a> ; Barber’s Election, <a href="/pa/86/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="86 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="1056633" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0392-01">86 Pa. 392</a>; Sifred v.

It is not the court, or the judge thereof, who grants the license; it is the state. The words of the act of May 24, 1887, we earnestly urge, show that the legislature intended that licenses should, be granted in all cases where the record shows that the application was regular, and that neither objections nor remonstrances were filed thereto.</p>

The court below applied the doctrine of that case to applications for licenses, made under the act of May 24, 1887, P.

The retail act of May 13th was intended to restrain the sale of - liquors. This clearly appears in its title, which reads: “ An act to restrain and regulate the sale of vinous and spirituous, malt or brewed liquors, or any admixtures thereof.” This was the construction placed upon that act in Itaudenbusch’s Petition, supra. The act of May 24, providing for wholesale licenses was a revenue act. There is not a word in it to indicate any intention of restraining the sale of liquor. The second and third sections of said act are as follows:</p>
    <p id="b542-5" data-blocks='[["BL_542.4",542,[230,853,1183,760]]]'>“ Section 2.

From the latter proposition it may be argued with some force that the court has a discretion in the matter of wholesale licenses. For of what use would it be to hear an application by “ evidence, petition, remonstrance, or counsel,” unless the court has the power to decide, that is, to grant or refuse such application. All this is conceded. The court has a discretion in such cases; it will be our purpose to define the character of that discretion and its extent.</p>

Clearly, the existing laws in regard to wholesale licenses. I know that the opinion has prevailed in some quarters that the effect of these words is to read into the wholesale act several sections of the previous retail act. This construction is so palpably erroneous that it would be a waste of time to discuss it. There is no reference in the one act to the other. The act in force in the county of Allegheny in May, 1887, in regard to wholesale licenses, was the special or local law of April 8, 1872, P. L. 843, applicable to Allegheny county only, which provides, inter alia, that “ The treasurer of said county shall, annually, upon payment to him of the license fees, and the receiving of the bond hereinafter mentioned, grant the licenses hereinafter specified, to citizens of the United States of temperate habits and good moral character,” etc. The act of May 24, 1887, contains no repealing clause. The act of 1872 is not repealed in express terms or by necessary implication, so far as regards wholesale licenses, excepting to the extent that the one act is supplied by the other. Thus, the act of 1887 declares that wholesale licenses shall be granted by the Court of Quarter Sessions, instead of by the county treasurer; it provides for a hearing by the court of applications for such licenses; makes a different classification of venders and fixes a different rate to be paid. But it imposes no qualifications upon applicants for wholesale licenses; it does not even require that they shall be citizens of the United States, or that they shall be persons of temperate habits, or of good moral character. Where are we to look for these qualifications ? Certainly <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>not in the retail act, which has nothing whatever to do with it, but in the existing laws in regard to wholesale licenses, to wit, the act of 18X2. There is nothing in the act of 1872, which as before observed is a local act, applicable only to the county of Allegheny, to indicate that any qualification was requisite for a wholesale dealer than those above mentioned; or, that any discretion existed in the Court of Quarter Sessions to refuse such license, except for cause, and such cause must relate to one of three things, viz.: citizenship, character, or sobriety. It follows that a citizen of the United States, of temperate habits and good character, who presents his application for a wholesale license in due form, and who has complied with the requisites of the law, has prima facie a right to such license. In the absence of anything upon the record to impeach such right, it is the duty of the court to grant it. If a remonstrance is filed setting forth that the applicant is disqualified for either of the three causes above stated, it is the duty of the court to hear the case, and if the remonstrance is sustained by evidence, to refuse a license. Such case is not reviewable here, for the reason that it would be a proper exercise of the discretion conferred upon the court by the act of May 24, 1887. But the discretion goes no further. It does not extend to an arbitrary refusal of a license. I use the word arbitrary in no offensive sense, but to indicate the refusal of a wholesale license for reasons other than those above indicated. The learned judge below has performed a thankless and most unpleasant duty, and we are satisfied he has done so without fear or favoritism. But we are compelled to differ from him in our construction of the act of assembly referred to.</p>
    <p id="b544-5" data-blocks='[["BL_544.4",544,[236,1844,1173,551]]]'>An extended argument is not needed to show that the discretion conferred upon the court by the retail act of 1887, does not extend to the wholesale act. A few words upon this subject, however, may be appropriately added. As before observed, the object and leading thought in the former act was to restrain and regulate the sale of liquor; that is to say, to restrain its sale to the consumer. It was for such reason that a large discretion was conferred upon the Quarter Sessions. If we contrast the second section, above quoted, of the wholesale act, with the seventh section of the retail act, the difference between them is palpable. The said seventh section is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b545-4" data-blocks='[["BL_545.3",545,[206,365,1168,760]]]'>
      <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>“The said Court of Quarter Sessions shall hear petitions from residents of the ward, borough or township, in addition to that of the applicant, in favor of [and] remonstrances against the application for such license,‘and in all cases shall refuse the same whenever in the opinion of the said court, having due regard to the number and character of the petitioners for and against such application, such license is not necessary for the accommodation of the public and entertainment of strangers or travelers, or that the applicant or applicants is or are not fit persons to whom such license should bo granted, and, upon sufficient cause being shown or proof being made to the said court that the party holding a license has violated any law of this commonwealth relating to the sale of liquors, the Court of Quarter Sessions shall, upon notice being given to the person so licensed, revoke the said license.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.4",545,[204,1133,1170,1273]],["BL_546.1",546,[256,365,1177,708]]]'>We cannot incorporate or read into the wholesale act the above section of the retail act, for the reason that we are not clothed with legislative powers. Moreover, it is inapplicable to wholesale licenses. What has the court to do with the question whether a particular wholesale license is “ necessary for the accommodation of the public and entertainment of strangers or travelers ? ” In the case of a retail license the court may well inquire, indeed it is its duty to do so, whether the public accommodation in the particular ward, street or block, requires that the applicant shall be licensed. The whole theory upon which retailors are licensed, and it is the theory of the law, is that they are needed for the public accommodation, to provide places where strangers and travelers may rest, and procure needed refreshments. Hence it may very well be, as was said in Raudenbusch’s Petition, supra, that “ if a ward has one hundred public houses, where only fifty are required by the public wants, it is plain that fifty houses must be denied license, although every one of the applicants is a worthy man and keeps a respectable house, an,d although there be neither remonstrance nor objection on the score of want of fitness.” None of this reasoning applies to a wholesale license. It is not granted for the convenience of a particular neighborhood, nor for the accommodation of strangers or travelers. Nor does it matter where the place of business is located. If all the wholesale liquor houses in Pittsburgh were in a single <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>block, it would make no difference, and would be no objection to tbeir being licensed. Tbeir business is not confined to any particular locality; on tbe contrary, it is general, and we may fairly infer from the knowledge of trade which every intelligent man possesses, that but a small portion of the sales of a wholesale house is confined to the city or place in which it is located. How then would it be possible for a judge to intelligently exercise a discretion as to the need of a wholesale house in a particular location ? The power to close up large establishments, such as breweries, distilleries, and wholesale liquor houses, when perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars are invested therein, is too vast to be exercised by any man or any court, excepting upon the clearest grant of legislative authority. It cannot be dene upon mere implication.</p>
