Section 10. “Any county..... or other municipality incurring any indebtedness shall, at or before tbe time of so doing, provide for tbe collection of an annual tax sufficient to pay the interest and also the principal thereof within thirty years.” That these constitutional provisions are mandatory and not merely directory, and are to be viewed in the light of limitations upon the powers to be exercised by municipalities, seems to us clear.
