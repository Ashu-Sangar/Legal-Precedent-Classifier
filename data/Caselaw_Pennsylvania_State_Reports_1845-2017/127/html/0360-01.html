M. Hannan, administrator of the estate of his relative, Jno. M. Harman, deceased? He received 1)1,874.61. His counsel, as testified, inasmuch as there were claims against Jno. M. Harman’s estate, probably sufficient to render it insolvent, advised him that it would not be safe to make distribution of the money then until after he gave notice to creditors, and advised him also that it would be well during this time to get interest on this money if he could, so as to make the fund as large as possible for distribution. The administrator then lived in Baltimore, Md., and. left the money with his counsel to deposit at interest if possible. And on June 25, 1884, his counsel deposited the money in the bank of A. S. Henderson, in the city of Lancaster, as appears in Henderson’s receipt; “ and at the time that deposit was made and the certificate taken it was agreed between A. S. Henderson, banker, and myself (accountant’s counsel) that the money could be drawn out at any time within the year on return of the certificate.” The receipt or certificate of Henderson was made payable to the order of D. G. Eshleman as his (the administrator’s) attorney, which shows the banker knew his relation to the administrator, and his authority to make a contract for him. All the circumstances of the case, therefore, show that this was a deposit, and not a loan, and we must, therefore, and now do set aside the finding of the auditor that it <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>was a loan. It was an arrangement made for the best interests of the estate; to be drawn out any time if wanted, and if not wanted to bear interest. The auditor has found that Mr. Eshleman is a well known lawyer of the best reputation. There cannot be even a shadow of doubt thrown on his testimony. The auditor himself has no doubt about the truth of Mr. Eshleman’s testimony. He says in his report that “ it has been found that there was an oral agreement or arrangement between Mr. Henderson and Mr. Eshleman.” The deposit was made about six and one half months, and then, to use the language of the auditor, “ a few days after the death of Mr. Henderson the disclosure came suddenly and without premonition that his estate was insolvent, and that the claims of depositors in his bank could not be paid in full.” Is there any want of good faith, vigilance or watchfulness made to appear in all the foregoing on the part of the administrator or his counsel ? We can perceive none.</p>

Should the administrator have surrendered his certificate and demanded the money on the oral contract ? Had he done so, it would have brought no response. There were no funds in the bank to answer that demand. Yet the learned auditor argues, because he did not do so, but presented the certificate with the accrued interest added, and obtained thereon a dividend out of the insolvent banker’s estate, therefore, he dealt with the deposit as an investment and must be held for the loss. We think that by any other course of dealing with the money so deposited, after the insolvency and death of Mr. Henderson, the banker, became known, than that which was adopted, the administrator would have been justly chargeable with want of good faith. The trustee, or administrator, seems to have done, and by the advice of counsel, too, everything he could profitably do. Every step was taken by the advice of counsel and it does not appear anywhere that by neglect of duty or mismanagement of the trust, he has rendered himself liable for the loss to this estate.</p>

N. 373, is to be distinguished; yet the opinion in that case contains a summary of the principles of equity upon which the accountant in this case relies. In that case, the certificate was for three months with interest, but the money could not be withdrawn without thirty days’ notice of the intention. Mr. Justice Gbeen says: “ During that period it was entirely beyond the control of the depositor. He could make no legal demand for the money until at least three months had expired, and not even then unless he had given thirty days’ notice of his intention to withdraw the fund. In no essential feature does this transaction differ from an ordinary loan.....The distinguishing feature of the case is, that even if the money be regarded as deposited in the technical sense, it was also loaned, and hence was subject to the qualities and incidents of a loan.”</p>

Upon tbe considerations mentioned in tbe opinion in that case, the administrator, D. M. Harman, who made tbe loan, must suffer tbe loss resulting from tbe insolvency of Henderson, unless there is something in tbe present ease to take it out of the operation of the decision in Frankenfield’s Appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> The only matter set up <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>to work this result is a parol contemporaneous agreement made by the counsel of Harman with Henderson, the banker, that the money might be drawn out at any time within the year on the return of the certificate, but in that event without interest. As such a contract is entirely contrary to the written agreement, it is incompetent to change the latter by means of the parol testimony, except upon proof of its omission from the written contract by fraud, accident, or mistake. An examination of the testimony of Mr. Eshleman disproves the possibility of any such theory. He simply says that such a verbal agreement was made at the time of the deposit. He does not say that he was induced to make the deposit and accept the certificate, upon the faith of any promise that the money might be drawn out at any time within the year, nor that there was any kind of fraud, accident, or mistake in the transaction. It is unnecessary to cite the numerous authorities that unless these elements are present, the written contract must stand as it is, unaffected by the parol proof. The question of good <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>faith on the part of the administrator and his counsel in making the deposit does not arise, because it cannot change the result. No one can doubt that so far as they were concerned the highest integrity and utmost good faith characterized the transaction. It is simply an instance of misplaced confidence, unfortunate in its consequences, but which must nevertheless be disposed of according to the plain legal rules which govern all similar cases.</p>

So far, therefore, as those considerations affect the question of the appellant’s liability for the loss of the money by reason of the insolvency of the bank, it must; be conceded at once that no liability would arise. There was no bad faith ou the part of the appellant, and although the bank was really insolvent when the deposit was made, that fact was not known in the community. The question at issue is thus reduced to the narrowest limits. If this had been an ordinary deposit, subject to the check of the depositor from the day it was made, it is very probable the appellant would not have been liable. But it was not such a deposit. In practical effect, it was a loan to the bank for a fixed period and payable with interest. During that period it was entirely beyond the control of the depositor. lie could make no legal demand for the money until at least three months had expired, and not even then unless he had given thirty days’ notice of his intention to withdraw the fund. In no essential feature does this transaction differ from an ordinary loan. It is true, the borrower is a bank and not an individual. But that circumstance is of no moment in determining the character of the transaction. It is a loan still, just as it would have been had the depositary been a citizen or <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>a firm of the greatest wealth, or a manufacturing or business corporation of large capital and resources.- In these latter cases, the security would apparently have been greater, for the capital of this bank was actually very small. The distinguishing feature of the case is, that even if the money be regarded as deposited in the technical.sense, it was also loaned, and henee was subject to the qualities and incidents of a loan superadded to those which belonged to it as a deposit.</p>
      <p id="Au5" data-blocks='[["BL_394.3",394,[237,1609,1176,758]]]'>Nor does the brevity of the time affect the question. There could be no difference in principle between a deposit payable in three months and one payable in twelve or twenty-four .months, when the question relates only to its character as a loan. This being so, the law regulating investments by committees of lunatics becomes applicable to the case and controls it. The act of June 13, 1836, § 25, P. L. 597, expressly directs that such investments must be made under the direction of the Court of Common Pleas, and only exempts the committee from liability for loss when lie pursues this course and in good faith. In Hemphill’s App., <a href="/pa/18/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="18 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="969080" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0303-01">18 Pa. 303</a>, it was formally and definitely settled that a trustee can only protect himself from risk when he invests the trust fund in real or governmental securities or makes the investment in pursuance of an order by the court. On page 306, Brack, C. J., says: “It has never been doubted anywhere that a loss which accrues of a trust fund invested on personal security, must be borne by the trustee.” These considerations determine that the auditor and court below were right in holding the appellant liable for the loss of the sum of one thousand dollars, deposited with the Franklin Savings Bank.</p>
