The provisions of that section limit the power of the court to grant distillers’ license to “ citizens of the United States, of temperate habits and good <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>moral character.” The titles to both the act of 1856 and. the act of 1858 show that the intent of these acts was “ to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors.” The several sections comprising both of these acts show that the “ regulation ” contemplated by them was to restrain the sale of intoxicating liquors in the interest of the peace and welfare of the community. The act of 1887, by its reference to and adoption of these acts re-enacts their intent. It emphasizes that intent by authorizing any person to appear as an amicus curia to oppose the granting of the license, without becoming a legal party or without joinder of issue as such. It extends the range of evidence and information, by authorizing an exception to the common law rules of evidence, so as to embrace petitions, remonstrances and the oral communications of counsel. In the interpretation of the evidence and information, which are admissible, and on which courts are authorized to act, in discussing the 3d section of the act of May 13, 1887, which is in substance identical with the 2d section of the act of- May 24, 1887, and, on a cognate subject, in the case of Raudenbusch’s Petition, <a href="/citations/?q=120%20Pa.%20342" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="120 Pa. 342">120 Pa. 342</a>, your honorable court, in full recognition of the beneficent intent of the law (Paxson, Justice, delivering the opinion), declared that “ In order to perform this duty properly (the granting of license), the act of assembly has provided means by which the conscience of the court may be informed as to the facts; it may hear petitions, remonstrances or witnesses, and we have no doubt the court may in some instances act of its own knowledge. The mere appearance of an applicant for license, when he comes to the bar of the court, may be sufficient to satisfy the judge that he is not a fit person to keep a public house. The judge is not bound to grant a license to a man whom he knows to be a drunkard or a thief, or has actual knowledge that his house is not necessary for the public accommodation. The object of evidence in such cases is to inform the conscience of the court, so that it can act intelligently and justly in the performance of a public duty. While the act in deciding in such cases is perhaps quasi-judicial, the difference between the granting or withholding of a license, and the decision of a question between parties as to a private litigation, is manifest. Neither the petitioner nor any other person in this state has any property in the right to sell liquor.”</p>

      <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>That the intent of the act of May 24, 1887, is of twofold character is clear. One of its purposes is to provide revenue; the other is to so regulate the sale of liquors as to secure the public peace and welfare by limiting the sale of liquors. If revenue had been the sole purpose, it would have been useless and perhaps worse than useless, to limit the right to sell to citizens of the United States, or to persons of temperate habits and good moral character; for the money of the foreigner, the intemperate or immoral man is equally as valuable as that of the best citizen. In entering judgment in this case, the Court of Quarter Sessions believed itself to be under obligation to recognize the effect that the granting of this license would be likely to have upon the public peace and morals in that community, where sufficient licenses had been granted. In so doing, in accordance with the general judicial interpretation of the acts of 1856, 1858, 1867 and 1875, it was held in this case that the Courts of Quarter Sessions were invested with a reasonable judicial discretion, not subject to review, to be exercised according to the intent of the several laws to restrain such sales of liquors as were certainly known by the court to be pernicious to the public morals and destructive of the public peace.</p>

Breaches of the peace have been common, and in several instances homicides among this class of people have been largely traceable to the use of intoxicating liquors. These facts are well known to the court; no remonstrance nor evidence was offered, but from knowledge possessed by the court, largely acquired from the hearing of civil and criminal causes from that locality, within the past throe years, sufficient facts came to the knowledge of the court to satisfy its conscience that the conservation of the public peace and morals demanded the refusal of the license.</p>

The attempt to write into that act the provisions of the retail act of May 13th, was so palpably erroneous, and so wide a departure from every recognized principle for the interpretation of statutes, that no further discussion of it is necessary. Hence it follows logically that the granting of wholesale licenses must be regulated by the discretion which “ existing laws ” conferred upon the Court of Quarter Sessions, at the time of the passage of the act of May 24th. At that time, in Allegheny county and Philadelphia there was no discretion at all, beyond requiring that the applicant was a citizen of good moral character and temperate habits. The Court of Quarter Sessions had nothing to do with granting such licenses ; it was done by another officer, and the license was a matter of right upon payment of the fee. It is at least possible that when the legislature passed the wholesale act of May 24th, they overlooked the fact that licenses in Allegheny and Phila<a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>delphia were regulated by local laws having no application to the rest of the state, and that those local laws, and no other, were the only “ existing laws ” to which the act of May 24th could possibly apply. That those “ existing laws ” in the localities referred to, are a great evil and have been endured for years against the protest of thousands of the best citizens of those cities, is a fact as painfully clear to us as it is to any one. We do not make the law, however; we merely interpretor declare it. This particular law was the work of the people themselves, through their duly constituted representatives. In our decisions in the cases referred, to, we endeavored to declare what the law was so plainly and emphatically that the people could see exactly what they had done, and, if dissatisfied with their work, could amend the law through their legislature. We have no such power.</p>

Our opinion would have been mere dictum, and would have bound no one, not oven ourselves. The wisdom of confining a decision to what is before the court, becomes daily more apparent with increased judicial experience. It never occurred to us that the professional, much less the judicial mind, could possibly construe a decision upon local laws, and which was therefore necessarily local, to have any application to the rest of the state where such local laws had no existence. In this, however, we were mistaken. We are informed that some judges throughout the state have felt themselves constrained by our decision to grant wholesale licenses, and, in one instance at least, a judge who thought our decision was general, refused a license by an act which was evidently meant for insubordination. The insubordination, however, was merely in intent, as the learned judge unconsciously followed our ruling and entered a lawful judgment without intending it. Several of the Quarter Sessions judges have, however, taken another and the correct view of this question. I have now before me a copy of the Weekly Notes of Cases for September 13,1889, in which I find carefully prepared opinions upon <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>this question, by Judge Stewart of Franklin county and Judge Yerkes of Bucks county,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> in each of which, while following strictly in the line of our decisions in the Philadelphia and Allegheny cases, they yet hold that said decisions have no application to the rest of the state. This clearly appears from the elaborate and able opinion of Judge Stewart, a portion of which I will take the liberty of extracting. <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">†</a>

Herein error was committed, for, as is clearly shown by the opinion of the Chief Justice, the two acts have no relation to each other whatever, the one being a restraining statute, while the other, relating to wholesale licenses, was enacted for the purpose of revenue solely. It is unnecessary to quote here at length the several reasons advanced to show that it could not have been the legislative intent that the earlier act of the 13th was to be read into the later act of 24th of May. It is enough to say that the whole purpose or scope of the argument of the court is to show that by the term ‘ under existing laws ’ was not meant the retail act of May 13, 1887, but such other laws as related to wholesale licenses and which remained unrepealed. In the Pollard Case, the existing law was the local act of 1872, relating to Allegheny county exclusively. In the Prospect Brewing Co. Case, the existing laws were those which related to the city of Philadelphia exclusively. And in neither case did the existing law vest any discretion in the Quarter Sessions court, where the qualification of the applicant was conceded. With this plain and explicit interpretation of the act of May 24th by the Supreme Court before us, we have but to determine what was the existing law in regard to wholesale licenses in Franklin county at that time. Certainly it was not the act of May 13th : that much has been settled beyond all dispute. It could not have been the act of 1872, which determined the Pollard Case ; for this act was local in its operations, being limited to Alle<a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>glieny county. Nor was it the law governing the granting of license in Philadelphia, under which the Prospect Brewing Co. Case was decided; for in Philadelphia, prior to the act of 1887, the courts had nothing to do with the granting of license to sell liquor, as we shall see further on. What, then, was the ‘ existing law ’ as applicable to Franklin county, and, indeed, the entire state, excepting those localities which were under the operation of special statutes ? ”</p>
    <p id="b577-5" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[199,772,1166,503]]]'>The learned judge then proceeds to discuss very clearly and at length the legislation upon this subject and comes to the conclusion that the “ existing law ” in Franklin county and throughout the state, excepting where interfered with by local statutes, was the act of March 22, 1867, P. L. 40. In this he was clearly right.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> Our attention has not been called to any local law in force in Jefferson county, in regard to the granting of wholesale licenses. It follows that the general law of 1867 is in force there and is the “ existing law,” referred to in the act of May 24, 1887.</p>
    <p id="b577-6" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[195,1284,1166,964]]]'>We do not think it necessary to discuss the act of 1867 at length. It places wholesale and retail licenses upon the same plane, and confers upon the Courts of Quarter Sessions the same discretion in granting or refusing a wholesale license as in the case of a retail license. It makes no distinction between them, lilis has been the uniform construction given to that act by the Courts of Quarter Sessions throughout the state for many years, with very rare exceptions if any. Even if we doubted the correctness of such construction, we would be loth to disturb a principle which had received the universal approval of so large a number of distinguished jurists. But so far from doubting it, the construction referred to was distinctly approved by this court in Reed’s App., <a href="/pa/114/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="114 Pa. 452" data-case-ids="550040" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0452-01">114 Pa. 452</a>. This and some other cases were not referred to in Pollard’s Case and that of the Prospect Brewing Company, for the reason that they had no application: we were then considering the local acts in force in Allegheny county and the city of Philadelphia; not the act of 1867, which is a general law. This is too plain a matter to require further discussion.</p>

We need refer to but one, the provision that a wholesale dealer may sell by the quart. It seems a perversion of terms to call a person who sells liquor by the quart a wholesale dealer. It is practically a retail traffic and of the worst character. But we will not pursue the matter further. The whole subject is earnestly commended to the attention of the legislature.</p>
