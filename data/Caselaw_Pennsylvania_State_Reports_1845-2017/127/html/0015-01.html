Berkstresser had a hearing before the Court of Quarter Sessions upon a charge of wife desertion, and was ordered to give security to the commonwealth for the payment to his wife, L. Amelia Berkstresser, the sum of $4 per week, and to pay the costs of the proceeding, and his commitment to the county jail was directed until the order should be complied with. He never complied with the order. Although constructively in the custody of the sheriff, it does not appear <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>by any direct or positive averment that tbe sheriff had taken said Berkstresser into actual custody. On the same day of the order, Berkstresser and the other defendants in this suit, under their hands and seals respectively, executed the obligation in suit, conditioned that said Berkstresser should appear at the next Court of Quarter Sessions and give the security ordered by the court in the proceedings for desertion. This obligation was taken and acknowledged before the clerk of the court. The affidavit of defence does not state that the sheriff had any knowledge of the terms of the obligation executed by the defendants, or that he consented that Berkstresser might be discharged from imprisonment. From the fact that he did not put the defendant, Berkstresser, in jail, it is not unreasonable to surmise that he was informed that security had been given and that he supposed that it was the security ordered by the court, and that hence his duty had ended. But whether this is so or not, we are of opinion that the obligation in suit was the voluntary obligation of the defendants. The terms are, in substance, that defendants shall be liable, if Berkstresser shall fail to appear at the next Court of Quarter Sessions and give tbe security ordered by the court. There is no averment that the defendant did appear and give the security ordered. We see nothing illegal in the terms of the obligation, and the affidavit of defence states no fact showing illegality in the consideration, or any policy of law forbidding the enforcement of defendants’ contract in accordance with its terms. We do not deem it necessary to decide whether the sureties might surrender the body of the principal to the sheriff, in discharge of their liability, because a careful reading of the affidavit does not in our opinion show any facts that in law are the equivalent of such surrender.</p>
