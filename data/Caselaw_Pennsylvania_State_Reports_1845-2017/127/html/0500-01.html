Gentlemen of the jury, we admitted this evidence for the purpose of enabling us to get the whole case before the court, in order that we might more accurately determine and ascertain the nature of the contract between these parties. After hearing this evidence, I have reached the conclusion tliat the case is to turn and be decided upon the written consignments and consignee’s agreements that were forwarded by the plaintiffs, at the time they shipped the pianos to Mr. Hill; that all the evidence that was admitted as introductory to the contract is to have no weight whatever in your deliberations. I therefore charge you that you are to disregard that evidence and that the case is to be determined solely upon the construction to be given to the consignee’s agreements, consignment invoices and the terms of consignment, which were executed by the plaintiffs on one side and by Mr. Hill on the other, upon the receipt of these respective consignments of pianos.] 4 Now, then, the nearest case upon the subject that I know of is the one which I have already alluded to, the case of McCullough v. Porter, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 177" data-case-ids="1856514" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0177-01">4 W. &amp; S. 177</a>..... The court there held that under the contract the relation of factor existed between the party to whom the goods were sent and the party who sent them to him. [But in the papers before us there is no stipulation that Mr. Hill was to sell these goods as the agent or factor of Peek &amp; Son, who shipped them to him, and in that part of it differs radically from the case of McCullough v. Porter, to which I have just alluded. It may have been the intention of the parties who concocted these consignee’s agreements, consignment invoices and terms of consignment, to establish <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>such a relationship between the plaintiffs and F. K. Hill, but, gentlemen of the jury, I instruct you that the agreement fails to carry out and consummate such a purpose. There is no provision or stipulation in them whereby F. K. Hill was to sell these goods as the agent or factor of these plaintiffs. But, on the other hand, it looks to me and I so charge you that these papers on their face constitute what is denominated in law a conditional sale. It was a fraud on the part of Peek &amp; Son to sell these pianos to F. K. Hill and retain a lien upon them until they received the price named in the invoice. Such contracts are forbidden by the law, as we have already told you, and for this reason we charge you that under all the evidence you ought to find a verdict in favor of the defendants.] 3</p>

    <p id="b529-8" data-blocks='[["BL_529.7",529,[207,774,1164,451]]]'>This was a feigned issue under the sheriff’s interpleader act. The pivotal question is, whether the property levied upon by the sheriff had been consigned to Hill, the defendant in the execution, as the factor or consignee of Peek &amp; Son, to be sold by him on their account, or whether the transaction amounted to a conditional sale with an attempted reservation of a lien for the price. The court below took the latter view of it and instructed the jury accordingly. All of the assignments of error bear upon this point.</p>
    <p id="b529-9" data-blocks='[["BL_529.8",529,[198,1234,1171,1113]]]'>We see no error in the ruling of the court. The whole contract appears from the two papers, the one headed “ Terms of Consignment,” and signed by Peek &amp; Son, and the other headed “ Consignee’s Agreement,” and signed by F. K. Hill. It is true the words “consignor” and “consignee” appear sufficiently conspicuous, but these are merely labels which the parties have placed upon the transaction; we must look within to see its real nature, and it is immaterial what the' parties designate it. We thus learn from the “Terms of Consignment ” that the piano named and invoiced, and consigned to Hill, “is the property of Peek &amp; Son, of New York city, and is to remain their property until fully paid for; and the said Peek &amp; Son ship and deliver the same upon the express condition that F. K. Hill of Sunbury, in the state of Pennsylvania, shall remit the sum of one hundred and sixty-five dollars to them therefor, within.....from the date hereof, or return the said piano to them at the expiration of the said time, at the expense of the said F. K. Hill.” Then follows the “Consignee’s Agreement,” by which Hill acknowledges having received the piano on consignment; that it is to remain the property of Peek &amp; Son until paid for, and if not paid for, to be returned at his own expense, etc.</p>
    <p id="b529-12" data-blocks='[["BL_529.9",529,[243,2357,1117,46]],["BL_530.1",530,[282,371,1172,1203]]]'>That this was not an ordinary transaction between consignor <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>and consignee is too plain for argument. Where goods are consigned to a factor for sale, they remain the property of the consignor and are not subject to the debts of the factor, and no ingenious contract is required to protect them from his creditors. There is nothing upon the face of the papers to indicate that Hill was to sell the pianos for the account of Peek &amp; Son, as their factor. On the contrary it was manifestly a sale to Hill, with an agreement that the title was to remain in Peek &amp; Son until the price was paid. The arrangement was good between the parties, but worthless as to Hill’s creditors. The secret lien attempted to be created cannot affect them. It would seem almost a waste of time at this late day to cite authority for so evident a proposition. I will refer, however, to Thompson v. Paret, <a href="/pa/94/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="94 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="485900" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0275-01">94 Pa. 275</a>, where it was said by our late brother Tktxnkey : “ Whatever the form of the agreement, if its purpose was to cover up a sale and preserve a lien in the vendors for the price of the goods, it was void as respects creditors, whether the credit was given before or after the delivery of the goods. A consignment for such object was no better than any other device.” See also Stadtfeld v. Huntsman, <a href="/pa/92/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="92 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="490953" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0053-01">92 Pa. 53</a> ; Forrest v.

These decisions are in harmony with a long line of cases which are familiar to the profession. What we have said covers all the assignments of error.</p>
