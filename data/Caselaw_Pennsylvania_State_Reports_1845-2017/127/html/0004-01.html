Subject to such objection, the auditor finds that there was no money or property consideration to the maker of the note, moving him to its execution and delivery. And, without regard to such testimony, the auditor finds that the real consideration moving him to such execution and delivery, was his natural love and affection for his children named therein as beneficiaries, and his desire to set aside the sum named in the note for their use and benefit.</p>

On October 14, 1864, the said Sobieski Ross conveyed to Mary A. Ross, in trust for John Ross, Mary Ross and George F. Ross, a lot of land in the borough of Coudersport, a part of grantor’s homestead lot. The lot conveyed was worth about $2,500. The consideration expressed in the deed was one dollar.

This election was a choice between the provisions of the will in her favor, and .her right of dower at common law. It was necessary and proper, in order to establish her relations to the estate in this regard. It should not be interpreted to affect her rights in other respects, or be construed to be a <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>waiver of any rights not directly involved in the choice made by her.</p>

Any allegation that a fraud upon the intended wife was designed by the execution and delivery of the note, in order to be a defence would have to be supported by clear proof of facts evincing the fraudulent intent. No such proof is adduced. On the other hand, the owner of a large estate, in contemplation of marriage to a second wife, might execute and deliver to a trustee for his children by a former wife, an obligation such as the one in question, with the most correct and honest motives. And from the authorities above cited, the auditor is of the opinion that the obligation in question is not a fraud upon the personal rights of Isabella Ross.</p>

He therefore recommends that the exception in this case be dismissed and the account as stated be confirmed.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b32-7" data-blocks='[["BL_32.7",32,[244,1628,1182,349]]]'>1. The auditor erred in finding as mixed matter of law and fact, that the giving of the note in question upon the day of his marriage, without valuable consideration and without notice to his intended wife, taken in connection with the conveyance of his homestead lot and house without valuable consideration, was not a fraud upon the said Isabella Ross, wife and widow of said S.

The evidence in the case showing that prior to the payment of the $6,000, for which the executor claims credit in this case, the personalty of said estate of S. Ross had all been exhausted in the payment of his debts and the expenses of administration, and no action having been brought upon said note to recover the same, and five years having elapsed after the death of said S. Ross, before the payment of said $6,000, the auditor erred in allowing the said payment of $6,000 to be passed <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>to the credit of said accountant, thereby making the same a charge against the proceeds of realty of the estate of said Sobieski Ross, deceased.6</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b33-6" data-blocks='[["BL_33.5",33,[221,718,1175,550]]]'>The argument in support of the exceptions was heard on January 11, 1887. One of the exceptions which was earnestly pressed at that time was, that the auditor erred in not finding that the payments made by the accountant on the note of Mary A. Ross, trustee, were made from the proceeds of real estate sold more than five years after the death of Sobieski Ross. The force of this exception lay in the want of definiteness of statement in the account and in the testimony of the accountant before the auditor, as to the time when the several sales of real estate were made from which the moneys entering into this account were received.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b33-7" data-blocks='[["BL_33.6",33,[221,1287,1173,198]]]'>An application was made to re-open the testimony so far as to enable the accountant to fix the dates of these sales.

    <p class="summary" id="b33-8" data-blocks='[["BL_33.7",33,[219,1494,1174,288]]]'>From this evidence we find as a fact that the sales of real estate from which the moneys appearing in the account were derived, were made in the lifetime of Sobieski Ross, or by his executor, within five years after his decease, except about $8,000, a sum much less than the balance remaining in the hands of the accountant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b33-9" data-blocks='[["BL_33.8",33,[215,1802,1174,604]],["BL_34.1",34,[259,354,1181,506]]]'>It follows then that the auditor was right in allowing the accountant credit for the money paid Mary A. Ross, trustee, on the note of October 19, 1864, if that note was a valid obligation. It is insisted that the note was not a valid obligation for the reasons, first, that it was a fraud upon Isabella Ross, one of the exceptants, to whom Ross was married on the same day that the note was given; and second, that it was an unexecuted gift inter vivos. As to the first of these reasons, the facts found by the auditor are a sufficient answer. He found that Sobieski Ross had boon previously married, and had three children by the marriage, who are the three persons named as beneficiaries in the note ; that he had, at the date of said note <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>and at the time of his decease, real and personal estate exceeding 1100,000 in value, and that no evidence of any fraudulent intent anywhere appears in the evidence. We have looked into the evidence and think the auditor is fully justified in his conclusions. It would seem very clear, therefore, that the arrangement made by Ross was merely a reasonable and natural provision for the children named, and, considered in connection with the amount of property owned by him when it was made, it was by no means a large one, or one of which the ex-ceptant had just reason to complain.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b34-5" data-blocks='[["BL_34.4",34,[258,868,1182,762]]]'>The facts found by the auditor also dispose of the remaining objection urged against the validity of this note. Ross was on the eve of a second marriage. He signed, sealed and delivered the note to his mother, Mary A. Ross, in trust for the three children of his first marriage. A seal imports a consideration, but there is here a good consideration in the natural affection of a father for his children and his obligation to provide for them. The note was not placed in escrow, but was delivered to the payee named therein. It passed wholly and unconditionally out of his control and into the custody and control of the payee. Ross himself recognized this fact and during his life conferred with his mother in regard to the note, the proper time for its payment, and the division of the money among the beneficiaries. There is no room, upon this state of the facts, to hold this note to be an unexecuted gift.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b34-6" data-blocks='[["BL_34.5",34,[254,1639,1184,507]]]'>We conclude with the auditor that the note to Mary A. Ross, trustee, was a valid outstanding obligation, that it was the duty of the executor to pay it, and that the funds employed for that purpose do not appear to have been drawn from the sales of real estate made five years after the decease of testator. Under this view of the case the consideration of the question, whether the will of Sobieski Ross by its terms makes a conversion of the real estate, is wholly unnecessary and we do not enter upon it. The exceptions are dismissed and the report of the auditor is confirmed.</p>
