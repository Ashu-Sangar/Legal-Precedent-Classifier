The execution was accordingly stayed on November 21, 1888, by being so marked on the writ and signed by the plaintiff’s attorney, the defendant or his attorney paying the costs, and was so returned by the sheriff.

It was then that the defendant, Jacob H. Norbeck, the successor of the firm of Norbeck &amp; Miley, presented his petition to the court, and on November 28, 1888, obtained the above rule to show cause, to wit, to strike off said alias fieri facias, and to open said judgment for the purpose of ascertaining how much, if anything, was due on the same.

When the collateral judgment of $10,000 was given and entered up in the prothonotary’s office on January 5, 1888, although another judgment held by a different party preceded it, the plaintiff in this judgment was willing to take the second place and apparently considered himself perfectly safe on the real estate of the defendants.

The act referred to provides for an appeal to this court by parties aggrieved by the action of court on applications to open judgments entered by warrant of attorney, etc. A writ of error is the proper remedy for such action of the court as is here complained of. The court below had before it at the same time two distinct rules, one to open the judgment, and the other to set aside the alias fieri facias.

The agreement is in writing, signed by the plaintiff at the time he received from defendants the bond on which the judgment above referred to was entered; and, as recited in the opinion of the court below, reads as follows: “Whereas, Jacob H. Norbeck and Jacob Miley have executed this day a judgment as collateral security to John Feagley to secure him against all liability as indorser or surety for the said Norbeck &amp; Miley, payable one day after date; now it is agreed, that for and in consideration of one dollar that the said John Feagley will not issue execution upon said judgment, unless it should become necessary by reason of delay, or on account of judgment being about to be obtained and execution issued by some other party against the said Norbeck &amp; Miley.
