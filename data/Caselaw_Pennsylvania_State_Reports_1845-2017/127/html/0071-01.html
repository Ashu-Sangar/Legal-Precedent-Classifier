Beatty took possession and paid part of tbe purchase money, but failed to pay-subsequent instalments as they became due. On December 26, 1884, Hamilton and wife, in the right of the wife, brought an action of ejectment against Beatty to enforce the payment of the balance of tbe purchase money. After issue joined, tlie case was called on May 21, 1888, and by agreement of counsel a conditional verdict was entered in favor of the plaintiffs for tbe premises in dispute, to be released on tbe payment by the defendant of $2,826.77, in 90 days thereafter, the plaintiffs to tile a warranty deed, etc.</p>

The defendant then filed a petition, upon which a rule was granted to show cause why the writ of habere facias should not be stayed, and why the plaintiffs should not be compelled to accept the amount of the verdict, with interest and costs, or why the verdict should not be amended by a clause providing that on failure by the defendant to pay the said sum within 90 days, the premises should be sold and proceeds paid to the plaintiffs and defendant, as to right and justice should belong.</p>

This, the counsel for the plaintiffs denies, and says he never agreed to extend the time, but that he did agree that he would not proceed further in the matter until directed by the plaintiffs. If the counsel for plaintiffs had so agreed, 'without authority from the plaintiffs, and it. is not claimed that he had such authority, would the defendant be in any better situation? We think not. It cannot be doubted that the plaintiffs may extend the time, but can his counsel without express authority from him do so ? We have not been able to find any case that goes so far as to say that he can; but on the other hand, it is held in Gable v.
