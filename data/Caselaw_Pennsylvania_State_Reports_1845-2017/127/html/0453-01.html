On April 19, 1888, the property was re-sold at a loss of $8,519.20. McWilliams then brought this suit upon the above agreement to recover one half the loss, to wit: $1,759.60. David S.

    <p class="summary" id="b478-8" data-blocks='[["BL_478.8",478,[276,1317,1170,442]]]'>It must have been observed, from the statement of the facts found, that the solution of the question involved depends upon the construction to be- given to the agreement entered into between the parties on November 4, 1876. The contention of the plaintiff is that by force of the agreement the defendant, Robert Forgy, Jr., is bound for the one half of $3,519.20, the whole loss, or $1,759.60, with interest from April 19, 1888, and not simply for the one fourth of the entire loss, to wit, $879.80, as defendant contends.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b478-9" data-blocks='[["BL_478.9",478,[275,1775,1171,604]],["BL_479.1",479,[210,346,1170,854]]]'>The agreement is in writing and its construction is for the court. The language employed is, “ If the guardian, Samuel McWilliams, shall buy in certain real estate.....we, the subscribers, hereby agree and bind ourselves to bear equal shares of the loss (with his wards, J. and J. Forgy,) which may be sustained by the property bringing less than the face of the mortgage thereon and its interest.....and we are to be benefited if it brings more.” This is a joint undertaking between the defendants and McWilliams. They agree with him that they will make up the loss to him, if he will buy; and, while the undertaking is several as between themselves, so that on a recovery against the one the other could <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>sue for compensation, yet as to the guardian they are sureties, aud each undertakes to make him whole just as if they had given their joint note. The expression, to bear equal shares, defines the amount which is to be paid, and not the manner of the payment. It defines and ascertains the amount to be paid to the guardian, but does not fix and ascertain the amount to be paid between themselves. I cannot see how it can be pretended, in the face of the language of the agreement, that each (if the defendants is only liable for the one fourth of the loss as to the guardian, McWilliams, for there is a promise which, while two make it, is yet the promise of each. The act of April 6, 1830, P. L. 277, cuts up the distinction between joint and several obligations: Lewis v. Williams, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Whart.%20268" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Whart. 268">6 Wh. 268</a>; Moore v. Hepburn, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Pa.%20402" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Pa. 402">5 Pa. 402</a>. It seems clear that either of the makers of the agreement is liable for the one half of the whole loss, and if the defendant hero pays it all he can sue his fellow for contribution.</p>
