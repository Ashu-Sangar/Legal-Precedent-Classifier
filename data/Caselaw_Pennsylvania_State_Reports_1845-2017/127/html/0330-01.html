The act of selling, irrespective of intention, constitutes an offence under a strict construction of the language used by the legislature.</p>

In other cases, the rule is different. The distinction is thus laid down by Greenleaf: “The rule ” (i. e., that ignorance of fact will excuse), “ would seem to hold good, in all cases where the act, if done knowingly, would be malum in se. But where a statute commands that an act be done or omitted, which in the absence of such statute might have been done or omitted without culpability, ignorance of the fact or state of things contemplated by the statute, it seems, will not excuse its violation. Thus, for example, where the law enacts the forfeiture of a ship having smuggled goods on board, and such goods are secreted on board by some of the crew, the owners and officers being alike innocently ignorant of the fact, yet the forfeiture <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>is incurred., notwithstanding their ignorance. Such is also the ease in regard to many other fiscal, police, and other laws and regulations, for the mere violation of which, irrespective of the motives or knowledge of the party, certain penalties are enacted; for the law, in these cases, seems to bind the party to know the facts, and to obey the law, at his peril: ” B Green!. Ev., § 21. Measured by this standard, it would seem that ignorance as to the age of the persons to whom the liquor was sold, was no excuse. The law is of the class recited by Professor Greenleaf, in which such a rule obtains.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b357-5" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[189,858,1174,970]]]'>That the legislature intended the mere fact of selling to a minor to constitute the offence, irrespective of intention or good faith, is, I think, apparent upon a review of its legislation upon this subject. The act of May 8, 1854, § 1, P. L. 668, enacted “ that wilfully furnishing intoxicating drinks by sale, gift or otherwise ” “ to a minor ” “ shall be held and deemed a misdemeanor,” etc. By the second section of the act of April 17, 1867, P. L. 89, it was enacted that “no person shall sell, give away, or dispose of any strong or spirituous liquors, wines, ale, beer, or any intoxicating drinks to ” “ any person under twenty-one years of age ” without the consent of parent or guardian, etc. By the eleventh section of the act of April 12, 1875, P. L. 42, it was enacted “ that it shall not be lawful for any person, with or without license, to sell,” etc., “ at any time to a minor.” And lastly, by § 17 of the act of May 13, 1887, P. L. 113, it was enacted “ that it shall not be lawful for any person, with or without license, to furnish by sale, gift or otherwise ” “ any spirituous, vinous, malt or brewed liquors ” “ at any time to a minor.”</p>

By each of the succeeding acts cited, the sale is made unlawful, the word “ wilfully ” being omitted, and no other word of similar import being used. This change must have been intentional. Whether or not the act of 1854 was, upon experience, found to permit too easy an opportunity for evading the law, it is not necessary to inquire. The succeeding legislation effected a change, by which the question of good faith and criminal intention became unimportant in determining the question as to whether or not there had been a violation of the <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>law. Sales to minors whether wilfully or ignorantly are equally prohibited. It follows that, the law having been violated, it becomes the clear duty of the court to revoke the license in this case.’</p>

The records have been brought here upon writs of certiorari, and we can only review what appears upon their face. The seventh section of the act of May 13, 1887, P. L. 110, provides that “.upon sufficient cause being shown, or proof being made to the said court, that the party holding a license has violated any law of this commonwealth relating to the sale of liquors, the Court of Quarter Sessions shall, upon notice being given to the person so <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>licensed, revoke the said license.” This provision is mandatory, and upon this writ we must presume the court below had sufficient evidence before it to show that each of the plaintiffs in error had violated some law of this commonwealth in regard to the sale of liquor. What particular law had been violated the record does not show, as neither the testimony nor the opinion of the court form any part of it. The agreement of counsel of March 27, 1889, that the testimony may he omitted from the paper book, and that the findings of fact as contained in the opinion of the court should be considered in lieu thereof, is nugatory, as we would have no right to consider the testimony if printed.</p>
    <p id="b359-5" data-blocks='[["BL_359.4",359,[223,967,1174,1218]]]'>If we look into the opinion of the court for the facts, however, we find nothing to help the plaintiffs. From it we learn that the offence of which the plaintiffs in error were guilty, was that of selling liquor to minors, and that the only excuse offered was that they did not know the persons to whom they sold were minors. This ignorance is not a sufficient excuse or justification under the act of assembly. If such a defence could he successfully interposed in such cases, there would be few convictions, and the law would be nullified for all practical purposes. Speaking for myself, I regret that the act of assembly does not make it a criminal offence for a minor to obtain liquor from a licensed dealer upon the pretence that he is of full age.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> As the law now stands it is an offence to sell a person a glass of liquor the day before he is twenty-one years of age ; yet it is often difficult for a saloon keeper to know the age of the person who may call for a drink. Some persons are as mature in appearance at twenty, as others are at twenty-two. While I would rigidly enforce the license laws, yet the dealer who pays for Ms license and sells by authority of law is entitled to some consideration. I would bold liim to a strict compliance with the law; at the same time I would protect him in so far as he honestly attempts to comply with it, and would punish the individual who, by a falsehood, induces him to violate it.</p>
