    <p class="summary" id="b136-9" data-blocks='[["BL_136.8",136,[252,1784,1178,605]],["BL_137.1",137,[211,376,1169,450]]]'>There is no repealing clause in said later act. In Brown v. County Commissioners, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Pa.%2048" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="21 Pa. 48">21 Pa. 48</a>, it is said, that “ it seems to be well settled that a general statute without negative words cannot repeal a previous statute which is particular, even though the provisions of one be different from the other.” There are no negative words in the act of May 12, 1887. To the same effect is the ruling in the case of Malloy v. Reinhard, <a href="/citations/?q=115%20Pa.%2029" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="115 Pa. 29">115 Pa. 29</a>, which turned upon the construction of the act of June 25, 1885, P. L. 187, which has a repealing clause excepting local laws; and the court there held that even had such repealing section been omitted, the local statutes would not have been affected. But it is argued the language of the act of 1887 is <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>so comprehensivo and explicit that it shows that a repeal of all local laws on the subject was intended. That language is, “that from and after the passage of this act the auditors of each county shall bo allowed; ” and the language in the act of 1885, in question in the case of Malloy v. lleinhard, supra, is equally explicit, etc., for that act says, “ that the qualified electors of each borough and township in this commonwealth shall be; ” and yet it was decided that no local law was thereby repealed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b137-4" data-blocks='[["BL_137.4",137,[210,834,1167,445]]]'>And it will not do to argue that the auditors of this county should receive as much as such officers elsewhere in the state, for the court does not fix the compensation, but the legislature. There are doubtless local laws in other counties of the state whereby the auditors of those counties receive more than is provided in the act of 1887, and the auditors of those counties would have their compensation reduced if the act of 1887 repeals the local law of this county, for then it would repeal all local laws.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b137-5" data-blocks='[["BL_137.5",137,[205,1298,1170,551]]]'>Another theory: The plaintiff here does not pretend to have earned the mileage claimed by the travel of the distance named, at least the number of times mentioned, nor at all by the route claimed for; and, in any event, only mileage for the route lie traveled, if shorter than the route usually adopted, and for the times actually traveled, could be claimed. These facts are not given us. It can hardly be that it was intended by the act of 1887 to give mileage when the distance was not traveled. The special law of February 5, 1869, is not set out in the case stated, as it should be, and in the order leave will be given to amend in that respect.</p>

    <p id="b138-7" data-blocks='[["BL_138.6",138,[277,629,1176,1064]]]'>The act of February 5, 1869, fixes the pay of the county auditors of Fayette county at three dollars per day, but gives them no mileage. It was a local act, evidently passed because it was desired by that county, and has been enforced since 1869. The act of May 12, 1887, is a general law, fixing the pay of county auditors throughout the state at three dollars per day, “ together with six cents per mile circular, from and to their homes, once for each and every week so employed.” The present county auditors of Fayette county claim that they are now entitled to mileage under the act of 1887, but the learned judge below thought otherwise and disallowed their claim, upon the ground that the local act of 1869 is not repealed by the general law of 1887. In this we see no error. It may very well be that the auditors of Fayette county are as much entitled to mileage as are those of other counties in the state. As an abstract proposition this may be conceded. But their local law is in the way. Now that it gives them no advantage over other parts of the state they may perhaps see their way to get it repealed, in which event the general law would apply. For the present they must be content with the law as it has stood for the last twenty years.</p>
    <p id="b138-8" data-blocks='[["BL_138.7",138,[1042,1699,359,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
