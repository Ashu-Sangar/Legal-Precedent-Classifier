    <p class="summary" id="b84-10" data-blocks='[["BL_84.7",84,[243,1074,1176,747]]]'>At the trial, the plaintiff showed that on August 7, 1870, the Home Mutual Life Association of Pennsylvania had issued a policy of insurance on the life of Jacob H. Lenig for $1,000; that two days afterward the assured in consideration of $1 assigned the policy to Daniel Eisenhart, to whom the company paid the insurance after the death of the assured on September 5, 1880. The plaintiff then called one Samuel Spitler, stating that by said witness he proposed to prove that some time after the death of Jacob H. Lenig, in a conversation witness had with the defendant, the latter admitted to him that he was to pay Jacob H. Lenig $5 for the policy; this for the purpose of showing that the insurance was speculative, and that the defendant was not a creditor of the insured. Under objection and exception to the defendant, the witness testified as follows :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b84-11" data-blocks='[["BL_84.8",84,[240,1840,1176,248]]]'>“ I went to Mr. Eisenhart and told him I was to get $5 from him that he owed Jacob H.

The law <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>hates such contráete. In order to make such contracts, it requires the assent of the plaintiff’s intestate, as well as the defendant. The ordinary rule of law as to such contracts is, that the plaintiff cannot recover unless he can come into court with clean hands, that is, prove he has a case without showing that he too has broken the law. If he cannot do this, the law says that he is in pari delicto and there can be no recovery. The Supreme Court has made an exception to this well-known rule in these wagering life insurance policies and we propose to follow the rule. In the case on hand the plaintiff alleges that the contract was a wagering one, and he must prove it. One may have an insurable interest in the life of another in two ways : first, he must be of the blood of the insured in such a degree as to give him an insurable interest; second, the relation of debtor and creditor must exist between them. The plaintiff recognized this principle when he called witnesses to negative relationship by blood between the defendant and the assured. Proof of either of these conditions will strip the contract of the character of being wagering. The proof of non-relationship put the plaintiff half-way on the road to a recovery; but he could not stop there. He must go further and prove that the relation of debtor and creditor did not exist between the deceased and insured. The presumption is that the assignment of the policy to the defendant was all right. The law presumes that all men do right and obey the laws; that all contracts made by them are not forbidden. He who alleges the contrary must prove it. The plaintiff has so alleged, but the faint glimmer of evidence offered is insufficient to show that the relation of debtor and creditor did not exist, and hence we order a peremptory nonsuit.</p>

    <p id="b86-7" data-blocks='[["BL_86.6",86,[245,717,1182,920]]]'>The learned counsel for the plaintiff in error have failed to satisfy us that the court below erred in entering a nonsuit. The plaintiff proved that Eisenhart was not a relation of Jacob H. Lenig, the assured, and if he had also proved that Eisenhart was not a creditor of Lenig, he would have had a stronger case. The plaintiff contended, however, that the burden was upon the defendant to prove that he was a creditor of Lenig. We do not think so. The' policy of insurance had been formally assigned to Eisenhart, and the company had paid him the money. He was prima facie entitled to retain it. The transaction upon its face was regular and legitimate. What occasion had the defendant, with the money in his pocket, to prove anything, until his right to retain it had been impeached 'by evidence ? It must be remembered that this was not a suit against the company to recover upon the policy, but a suit by the administrators of the assured to recover the money from one to whom the company had voluntarily paid it, thus recognizing his right to recover it.</p>
