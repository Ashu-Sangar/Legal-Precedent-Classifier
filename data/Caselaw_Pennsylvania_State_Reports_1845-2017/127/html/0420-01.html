The auditor may think that the charge of $1,522.24 is not excessive, and if the accountant actually handled the money he charged himself with, it would be a very modest charge; and it may be a moderate charge for responsibility merely, considered by itself; but this question can arise only on a review.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b449-6" data-blocks='[["BL_449.5",449,[213,1132,1172,1319]]]'>Of one thing there can be no doubt. Dr. Priestley continued to be the legal trustee under the will of Hugh Bellas of Mrs. Rodrigue, by appointment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and he was not discharged as such until 1882. During the time from 1872, when he filed what he designated as his final account and applied to the court to be discharged, up to 1882, when he was discharged on the second petition after filing the account in controversy, he had a right to demand and receive the one third of the income or interest of the estate of Hugh Bellas due Mrs. Rodrigue, and he was accountable for the same. But he did not do so. He became incensed at the allegations of Mrs. Rodrigue that no trustee was necessary, and that his commissions were too high and a useless diminution of her income. Acting upon what he deemed sufficient provocation, he declined to receive further remittances on account of Mrs. Rodrigue from the administrator of the estate. True, he did not press his petition for discharge and allowed it to be lost sight of; but after returning the administrator’s check in 1872, with the declaration that he would have nothing further to do with Mrs. Rodrigue’s affairs, he cannot be said to have acted in any sense as her trustee. Certain things he did relative to the business, but these were only for his own protection and not necessarily for the protection of the trust estate or the benefit of the cestui que trust. In fact, he did what he determined to do in the first place, and never changed his mind. He refused to have anything to do with Mrs. Rodrigue or her affairs.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.3",450,[255,366,1177,1219]]]'>
      <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>All this has nothing to do with his responsibility as trustee, but it seems to me to be important in considering the right to charge himself with funds which by his own declination never came into his hands; to claim credit with payments which he never made, and to claim compensation as though he had managed the affairs of the estate. The account is in that form. It is fictitious and erroneous on its face. It is true that the receipts taken by Mr. Wolverton, the administrator, were taken as though the money had been paid by Dr. Priestley, through the administrator. But this was as fictitious as the account itself, and it is in evidence that Mrs. Rodrigue objected to dealing with the administrator in that way, and declined to sign many of the receipts. It does not appear that Dr. Priestley either authorized or directed Mr. Wolverton to pay Mrs. Rodrigue. He simply refused to receive and handle Mrs. Rodrigue’s money. Mr. Wolverton requested Dr. Priestley to withhold his application for discharge until another trustee could be appointed, and took receipts in Dr. Priestley’s name simply because he thought the will required the intervention of a trustee. After Dr. Priestley’s refusal to act, the trusteeship itself became a fiction except as to the responsibility of the trustee, and this the trustee had a right and it was undoubtedly Ms duty to guard, by demanding the money due the cestui que trust and to receive and pay it out.</p>

I cannot say the petitioner has not averred errors of law on the face of the account. It is necessary to aver errors on the face of the record or in the account merely, and I am of opinion that it is sufficient to aver that the accountant in fact never received the moneys with which he charged himself, and upon which he bases claims for commissions, the balance being against the cestui que trust.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b451-4" data-blocks='[["BL_451.3",451,[231,358,1170,908]]]'>
      <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>It is also contended that the allegation of want of notice of the filing of the account has no evidence to support it, that it is denied by the answer and contradicted by the evidence before the auditor ; and that, had there been no actual notice, the advertising of the account by the register is as effective and binding as actual notice; citing App v. Dreisbach, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20R.%20287" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 R. 287">2 R. 287</a>. Tt has been found as a fact that actual notice has not been shown or denied, but that there was constructive notice, which in law is as binding, for all practical purposes. The act of 1840, however, does not by its terms require it to be shown that there was no notice, to entitle an interested party to a review. In the case of Simpson’s App., 18 W. N. 175, which arose in this court, constructive and actual notice were shown, and the petitioner lived within a few yards of the register’s office, yet the court allowed a review and the Supreme Court affirmed the decree. Where no intervening rights are affected, and where no equities have arisen to the contrary, I believe the matter of notice to be immaterial.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b451-5" data-blocks='[["BL_451.4",451,[230,1284,1169,608]]]'>Counsel also contends that Dr. Priestley could not abandon the trust, and that if he did abandon it, as alleged, it did not relieve him from the responsibility of the proper appropriation of the funds by the administrator; citing Perry on Trusts, §§ 266-268 ; Webster v. Vande venter, <a href="/mass/72/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 Gray 428" data-case-ids="1994702" data-case-paths="/mass/72/0428-01">6 Gray 428</a>; 11 Paige, 819. This is undoubtedly the law. If Mr. Wolverton had squandered the money, the trustee would have been liable for it; and, moreover, he could have made no claim for commissions, and could not have charged himself with the funds as a basis of a charge against the cestui que trust. He may have estopped himself from charging anything, and I understand that the petitioner claims that he did so.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b451-6" data-blocks='[["BL_451.5",451,[230,1900,1169,442]]]'>It is further contended that it was arranged between the administrator and the trustee that from 1872 the money should be paid direct to Mrs. Rodrigue by the administrator and receipts taken in the name and for the trustee by him. I have not been able to find this. There is no evidence before- me that goes to show that there was such an agreement. On the other hand, the trustee appears as insisting upon liis discharge and merely delaying the matter for a term when it seems to have been overlooked.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b451-7" data-blocks='[["BL_451.6",451,[274,2360,1123,44]],["BL_452.1",452,[237,362,1174,342]]]'>Again; it is contended that the trustee considered himself <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>as acting after April, 1872, and down to his final discharge, and responsible for the acts of Mr. Wolverton who was merely his agent. If Mr. Wolverton acted as -the agent of Dr. Priestley after 1872,1 would take a different view of the case, but I do not think the evidence warrants that conclusion. Dr. Priestley continued to be the technical trustee after that time, but he did not act.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b452-5" data-blocks='[["BL_452.4",452,[233,722,1191,1425]]]'>I think I have now considered and disposed of the questions involved in the case at this stage. I must say, however, that I have been largely influenced by the position of the court and the Supreme Court in Simpson’s Appeal, to which I have referred. It seems to me the circumstances of the two eases are quite similar. The allegation there was, that the accountant had charged himself with moneys which had never come into his hands, the petition being presented by the surety in the guardian bond. This was held to be an error on the face of the account. ' It was also shown in that case that the surety had notice of the filing of the account, and by examining it he would have discovered that his principal was charged with a large balance for which he, the surety, would be liable. He" allowed the account to be confirmed; and yet the court struck off the decree of confirmation and allowed a rehearing, when it was shown that in fact the guardian had never received the larger part of the moneys with which he was charged. In this case, it is the beneficiary who is charged with a balance and makes the application for a rehearing. She alleges that the moneys charged on the debtor side of the account, upon which the balance against her is predicated, never came into the hands of the accountant, and that he never performed any of the services indicated by the account. I cannot distinguish the two cases, and am therefore constrained to say that in my opinion the decree of confirmation of the account of Dr. Joseph Priestley, trustee of Ann C. Rodrigue, filed July 15, 1882, should be stricken off and a rehearing of the whole of said account granted.</p>

If this is so, the objection is a good one, and I admit that 1 am not entirely clear in regard to it. The facts, however, are, that Dr. Priestley did not in any sense act as trustee for Mrs. Rodrigue, after April 9, 1878. He having refused to act, although not discharged by the court, a written agreement was put on record, signed and executed by the cestui q uo trust, who was sui juris, and her family, that all moneys were to bo paid directly to her. After that date all moneys were paid directly to her and not to the trustee, nor was any paid by him to her. The account, however, on the face of it, shows that commissions were charged on all sums paid after that date. It is claimed that this is not error apparent on the face of the decree. I think it is as much so as was the case in Simpson’s Appeal, decided in this court and affirmed by the Supreme Court, and I am sure there are many other cases in the books where the courts have looked beyond the record in the case, especially [into] other records for the facts, in order to ascertain whether there was error apparent on the face of the record.</p>

Dr. Priestley had not actively acted as trustee since filing what he styled his final account in 1872, and Mrs. Rodrigue doubtless never expected another account to be filed. She lived in another state and did not discover that an account had been filed until 1887, when she was called upon to pay the balance in favor of Dr. Priestley, as it appeared in the account. This balance arose from the charge of the trustee for commissions. Of course, the presumption is that the legal notices were given of the filing of the account, and therefore Mrs. Rodrigue had constructive notice and this perhaps was all that was necessary. She was not entitled to actual notice. She has not produced what is considered strictly after-discovered evidence, that is, evidence discovered since the decree, which could not by diligence have been discovered and produced at the time. But the fact that she had no actual notice of the filing of an account which she had reason to believe was not <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>necessary and never would be filed, will cause a court to consider carefully all other matters that may by law afford relief.</p>

Pie died on March 10, 1888, and letters of administration were granted to Hannah PI. Priestley, the appellant, on March 28,1883. More than four years after Dr. Priestley’s death, Mrs. Rodrigue, the appellee, presented the petition in this case for a review of his account as trustee. The whole contention was about a matter of commissions, the trustee having charged $1,522.24, being two per cent upon the money passing through his hands for a number of years. It was alleged that for a number of those years Dr. Priestley did not actually receive and disburse the money, owing to differences between himself and Mrs. Rodrigue, which it is not necessary to refer to in detail; that during this time he refused to act as trustee, or to have any business intercourse with his cestui que trust, and the money was paid by S. P. Wolverton, Esq., the administrator, directly to Mrs. Rodrigue. The receipts therefor were taken in the name of Dr. Priestley as trustee. The court referred the petition to an auditor, who took a large amount of testimony, resulting in the granting of the review, a subsequent re-statement of the account, with a decree of the court below reducing the commissions to $930.84. The principal question raised upon this appeal was the propriety of granting a review. This underlies the entire case.</p>

In such case there should be no laches: Scott’s App., <a href="/pa/112/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="112 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="546550" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0427-01">112 Pa. 427</a>. In her petition the appellee alleges that “she resides in New Jersey, had no notice of the filing of the account, and only recently learned of its existence.” This averment is evasive. It should have stated when she learned of it. The appellant in her answer distinctly avers that the account “ was filed with the actual and legal knowledge of the petitioner.” It was conceded she had legal notice; there was no evidence as to actual notice before the auditor, and this point must be disposed of upon the pleadings. As no evidence was offered to contradict the answer, it must stand as conclusive. This is the rule in equity, where, as here, the answer is responsive: Eaton’s App., <a href="/pa/66/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="66 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="432333" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0483-01">66 Pa. 483</a>; Rowley’s App., <a href="/pa/115/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="115 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="551754" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0150-01">115 Pa. 150</a>.

I have not referred to those matters for the purpose of showing that they would bar the right to a review within five years. It is not necessary in this case to decide such a point or discuss it at length: where, however, there has been laches, and the party complaining had both legal and actual notice of the' filing of the account, it would be a persuasive reason why a court, exercising equity powers, should move slowly, and see that the case clearly comes Avithin the act of 1840, and refuse it altogether where the application is ex gratia.</p>

It was said by Mr. Justice Strong, in delivering the opinion of the court in Hartman’s Appeal, supra: “Tbe construction given by the court below to the act of October 13,1840, was entirely accordant with that which the court has given in numerous cases. It was first announced in Riddle’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=19%20Pa.%20433" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="19 Pa. 433">19 Pa. 433</a>, repeated in Bishop’s App., <a href="/pa/26/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="26 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="977301" data-case-paths="/pa/26/0470-01">26 Pa. 470</a>.

The construction is now too firmly settled to be disturbed by us.” And the authorities I have cited show that the same construction lias been maintained to tlie present time. Tlie rule in equity is, that a bill of review will not lie for an error of law, unless such error appears on tlie face of tbe decree. Mr. Justice Story, in commenting upon this rule in Whiting v. Bank of the United States, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Pet.%2013" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="13 Pet. 13">13 Pet. 13</a>, said: “ That is true, in the sense in which the language is used in the English practice. In England the decree always recites the substance of tlie bill and. answer, and pleadings, and also tlie facts on which tbe court founds its decree. But in America tbe decree does not ordinarily recite either the bill, answer, or pleadings, and general Ly not tbe facts on which the decree is founded. But with us the bill, answer, and other pleadings, together with the decree, constitute what is properly considered the record; and, therefore, in truth the rule in each country is precisely the same in legal effect, although expressed in different language, viz., that the bill of review must be founded on some error apparent upon the hill, answer, and other pleadings, and decree; and that you are not at liberty to go into tlie evidence at large in order to establish an objection to tbe decree, founded on the supposed mistake of the court, in its own deduction from the evidence.” And in Putnam v. Day, <a href="/us/89/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="22 Wall. 60" data-case-ids="3409096" data-case-paths="/us/89/0060-01">22 Wall. 60</a>, it was said by Mr. Justice Bradley: “We think tbe rule to be well established, and a wholesome one, that tbe proofs cannot be looked into on a bill of review-.

Unfortunately for the appellee, no error of law is set forth in her petition, or appears anywhere in the record. It was a question of fact pure and simple, that the accountant had claimed commissions on money which had not passed through his hands. This was an objection which could as well have been taken when the account was filed, as it could several years after its confirmation and the death of the accountant. The act of 1840 was never intended to open accounts for the re'-trial of questions of fact, years after they, have been passed upon by a competent tribunal. The question of Dr. Priestley’s commissions was adjudicated by the Orphans’ Court years <em>ago; </em>it was a question distinctly appearing upon the face of the account ; it was a challenge to any person objecting to come in and dispute it. As was said in Scott’s Appeal, supra, “ Something is due to the finality of judicial proceedings.” As there was no error of law upon the face of this record, the appellee was not entitled to a bill of review as a matter of right; as there was no allegation of after-discovered testimony, she was not entitled to it as a matter of grace.</p>
    <p id="b458-4" data-blocks='[["BL_458.4",458,[294,1656,1179,610]]]'>The learned judge below evidently relied upon Simpson’s App., 18 W. N. 175, as authority for granting this review. An examination of that case, however, discloses the fact that there was one, if not two, errors of law apparent <em>upon </em>the face of the record. The account as guardian was prematurely and illegally filed, and the balance decreed to Mary Y. Simpson was not coming to her, under the terms of her father’s will, at the time the decree was made, and might never have been due her. It follows that the review in that case was strictly in accordance with our construction of the act of 1840. The review in this case was a departure from Milligan’s Appeal, Scott’s Appeal, and the cases cited.</p>

The court below awarded $980.34 to the accountant as commissions, which, together with some other small credits, left a balance due the accountant of $1,042.50. This allowance is assigned for error upon this appeal. All that was said in Priestley’s Appeal is applicable here.
