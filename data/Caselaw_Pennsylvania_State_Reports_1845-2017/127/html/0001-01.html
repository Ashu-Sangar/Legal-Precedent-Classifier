      <a id="p2" href="#p2" data-label="2" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*2</a>A Rule of Court provided that, “ if the plaintiff shall have filed a copy of the account or instrument of writing on which the suit is founded, with his declaration, on or before the return day of the writ, he shall be entitled to a judgment by default for the amount so claimed, at any time after twenty days from and after the return day of the writ,” in default of an affidavit of defence filed by the defendant. Under this rule, on November 6, 1884, a judgment was taken against the defendant for want of an affidavit of defence, and the sum doe liquidated at $4,025.90.</p>

In March, 1887, a creditor’s bill was filed by George C.

This bill was duly-served, and embraced, in the indebtedness of the company set out, the judgment of the plaintiff in this case.</p>

It is voidable only, and we think the length of time that has elapsed since the defendant had knowledge of the judgment, and the neglect for so long a time to move to set it aside, coupled with the fact that the defendant, since the rule to strike off the judgment was obtained, has suffered judgment, ' pro confesso, to be taken against it in the equity suit pending, and with the other facts recited, the defendant must be regarded as having waived the irregularity, if any, in the taking-judgment for want of an affidavit of defence. The rule to strike off the judgment is therefore discharged.</p>

The writ was taken, however, to the refusal of the court below to strike off the judgment. The ground of this motion was that the judgment was void. The writ of error was taken out in less than two years from the refusal of the court below to strike it off.</p>

It is something on the record which has no business there, which confers no rights and imposes no obligations. At the same time, it may be a source of annoyance to some one; it may becloud a title or injure credit, and the person who is injuriously affected by it has a right to have it stricken from the record.</p>

The court below had jurisdiction of the person and the subject matter. It was entered for want of an affidavit of defence, and we must assume that the court below regarded the case as coming within the Hule of Court. The defendant thought it did not, and filed no affidavit. This is neither a good nor a safe practice. If a defendant thinks the statement or copy filed does not come within the rule requiring him to file an affidavit, it is the better practice to suggest such fact upon the record. He can then have a decision of the court upon the point. When he decides this question of law for himself, he takes the risk of it being incorrect. In the case in hand, it is at least a question whether the judgment was not properly taken. We are not required to go so far however. It is sufficient to say that it was <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>not void. Under such, circumstances we might well quash this writ. <em>We </em>prefer, however, to affirm the order of the court below refusing to strike off the judgment.</p>
