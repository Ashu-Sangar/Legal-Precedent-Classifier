[On the other hand, it is argued, and it was so held by the learned auditor, that by the said latter clauses it was only intended that in the event of the widow re-marrying she should have the one half of the real and personal estate “ for her own use; ” that is, to be used by her during life.] 3 As the widow did not re-marry, no question of that kind arises in the case, except so far as the whole will must be taken together in order to ascertain the intention of the testator.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b484-6" data-blocks='[["BL_484.5",484,[225,1324,1181,896]]]'>It is well settled as a general rule of law, that a devise of the rents, issues and profits of land, is equivalent to the devise of the land itself, but the intent to dispose of land is not usually manifested by disposing of the income, rents, and use only thereof; and in such cases, it has always been held that the devisee only takes the land for such length of time as he is given the income, rents and profits: France’s Est., <a href="/pa/75/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="75 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="1036706" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0220-01">75 Pa. 220</a>. In the present case, it being clear that the will only gives the improvement and income of the land, or the land itself to the widow, for her own use during widowhood, which would mean, at the longest, during the natural life of the widow, I am of opinion that it by no means follows that the latter clauses giving her the one half of the estate for her own use, or the one half of the proceeds of a sale in case of remarriage, necessarily enlarges the life estate given in case she remained unmarried. The one is a provision in case the widow remained unmarried, and the other a provision in case she re-married.</p>

Looking at the whole scheme of the will, nothing would seem more natural. The meaning of the will in this respect may be doubtful, but in that case the construction is to be as conformable as possible to the general rules of inheritance: France’s Est., supra. If the contention of the plaintiffs is correct, the land goes to the parties who would be entitled to the same under the general inheritance laws of the state; but, if the construction contended for by the defendants should be adopted, it would go to parties who are entire strangers to the blood of the testator. [The same construction contended for by the plaintiffs, it seems, was put upon the will by the widow herself, when a part of the proceeds of sale of some of the land sold by the executor and the widow, for the payment of debts, was distributed by the Orphans’ Court of this county. See report of W. B. Faust, Esq., auditor, filed January 7, 1884, and the opinion of the court, confirming the same, filed April 7, 1884.] 3 The learned auditor gaye her the interest on the proceeds, which represented the land, and she éxpressly declined, in writing, to accept.</p>

    <p id="b486-5" data-blocks='[["BL_486.5",486,[253,416,1170,694]]]'>The draughtsman of this will had a very limited command of the English language, and even this was evidently hampered by the recollection of the form book. But taking the whole will together the testator’s intention is reasonably clear to give his wife the use and income of his whole estate so long as she remained his widow, and of half of it in case she re-married, but not in either event to give her more than a life estate in the realty. The lands are expressly given to her “ to keep for her own use, as long as she keeps my name,” which is plainly a gift during widowhood, and therefore, an estate for life determinable on a second marriage. In this regard the case is not distinguishable from Cooper v. Pogue, <a href="/pa/92/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="92 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="491066" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0254-01">92 Pa. 254</a>, and indeed is by no means so strong a case for plaintiffs in error’s contention as that was.</p>
    <p id="b486-6" data-blocks='[["BL_486.6",486,[254,1128,1171,297]]]'>The first devise as to realty is of the “ improvements and income ” of his dwelling house, and it is conceded that these words in general carry the land. But the gift of the improvements and income is only “ so long as she keeps my name,” and cannot be more effective than a gift of the land itself, which, expressed in those terms, would not extend beyond a life estate.</p>
    <p id="b486-7" data-blocks='[["BL_486.7",486,[253,1434,1171,602]]]'>Nor is this estate enlarged by the provision that she shall pay the debts, and if she cannot (otherwise) she shall sell so much of the land as will enable her to keep the rest. This is only a power, not an estate, and is limited to the payment of debts, thus merely enabling the devisee to do in her own way what the law would do compulsorily for her without this provision. So far indeed as this clause of the will bears upon its construction at all, it would seem to indicate that the testator himself did not intend to give a fee; for, if he had done so, the power of sale would have been superfluous, except as a matter of convenience on account of the possibility of the determination of the estate by a second marriage.</p>
    <p id="b486-8" data-blocks='[["BL_486.8",486,[253,2045,1171,349]],["BL_487.1",487,[234,357,1168,1168]]]'>But after the devise to the widow so long as she remains unmarried, there is a provision for the case of her re-marriage, in which event she is to have “ the one half of all my real and personal property for her own use, and the other half I bequeath to my three sisters ” etc., and the further provision that the executor shall make the division, and if it cannot be done without spoiling the whole, then he shall sell the property and <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>“divide the money as directed;” and it is argued that this is a gift of the corpus of one half in case of re-marriage, and therefore, unless the first estate was a fee, a larger provision in case of second marriage than in the event of remaining a widow, which would be clearly contrary to the testator’s main intent. While a fee in one half would probably have been called by the early lawyers an estate of higher dignity than a life estate in the whole, 1 am not aware of any rule which would enable us to say as a matter of law that it was a larger or more favorable provision for a widow. That is a question of fact which depends on circumstances, and must always be largely a matter of individual choice. But it is by no means clear that this is the proper construction of the provision in ease of re-marriage. On the contrary the repetition of the phrase “for her own use” seems rather to be meant to continue the idea of a life estate contained in the preceding clause, and if so, the direction to the executor to make the division of the property, and if that cannot be done, to sell, and divide the money, would be subject to the same limitation, to wit, to her own use for life. As the widow however did not re-many, our only concern with these parts of the will is their bearing on the construction of the previous clause, and as to it they give us very little light.</p>

Pogue, already cited. With variations of language the substance of the gifts is identical, and while will cases are rarely precedents for more than the principles they illustrate, yet where there is such substantial identity, not only in intent but in expression, the prior case is at least very strong confirmation of the correctness of the view we have taken of the present. And the same remarks apply with great force to the notably analogous case of Nash v. Simpson, <a href="/me/78/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="78 Me. 142" data-case-ids="8844670" data-case-paths="/me/78/0142-01">78 Me. 142</a>.</p>
