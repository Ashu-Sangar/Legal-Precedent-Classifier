This court decided that he took an estate-tail, and the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment. The question, thus, is res adjudicata, unless there are different facts now presented, calling for a different judgment. This is alleged to he the case. Only the fourth item was then submitted; the entire will is now presented to the court. The additional facts, therefore, consist in the other items of the will. The plaintiff contends that the fourth item is so modified by tbe other items, tbat, read in bbe light of tbe whole will, a different case is presented, requiring a different determination; tbat, considered by itself and unexplained by tbe context, tbe phrase, “ and if be should die leaving no lawful beirs,” may well mean a general indefinite failure of issue; but viewed in connection with tbe other items, imports a failure at tbe first taker’s death; and tbat therefore Thomas Preston Cochran did not take an estate-tail.</p>

L. 249; it required no words of inheritance or of perpetuity to pass the whole estate of the testator in the premises devised. The devise to William P. Cochran, in the second item, of the testa<a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>tor’s Missouri lands, passed the testator’s whole estate therein, and vested a fee simple in the devise. The devise to James M. Cochran, in the third item, and to Mary Ann Thompson, in the sixth item, is expressly during natural life, and at their deaths respectively, to descend to their lawful children, and, if they should leave none, to descend to their brothers and sisters equally. The devise in the fourth and fifth items, to Thomas Preston Cochran and Eliza Jane McDowell, respectively, differ from the others in that they are not expressly for and during natural life, on the one hand, nor do they pass the whole estate of the testator therein to the first takers, on the other. The will is not artistic, but the testator was intelligent. He knew how to create different estates in the first takers, and has done so by an intention clearly expressed. He has given a fee simple to one, life estates to others, and at least a freehold estate to Thomas. An inference could not safely be drawn from the fact that he used the term “ children ” in a devise expressly for life, that he also meant children, by the terms “lawful heirs” in conferring a freehold. Even if it might be inferred that he used “issue” in the sense of “children ” in the fifth item, nevertheless it would not materially'' aid an inference that he meant children by “ lawful heirs ” in the fourth item. Heirs is a word of larger import than issue: Taylor v. Taylor, <a href="/pa/63/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="63 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="1019043" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0481-01">63 Pa. 481</a>. “Lawful heirs” here means heirs of the body; because, since the devise over is to the brothers and sisters, they are necessarily excluded from the first takers; and since the brothers and sisters are not to take while there are heirs of the body of the first takers, the limitation over is after an indefinite failure of issue: Covert v. Robinson, <a href="/pa/46/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="46 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="420620" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0274-01">46 Pa. 274</a>.</p>

The devise over is to the first taker’s “brothers and sisters, share and share alike, or to their legal representatives.” Where there is a bequest of personalty, “ legal representatives,” as in Fleck’s Est., 1 Pars. 126, ordinarily means executors or administrators. But where there is a devise of realty, “ the legal representative, in legal contemplation, is the heir, and not the administrator:” Duncan v. Walker, 2 Dali. 205; Ware v. Fisher, <a href="/yeates/2/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Yeates 578" data-case-ids="812762" data-case-paths="/yeates/2/0578-01">2 Y. 578</a>; Commonwealth v. Bryan, 6 S. &amp; R. 81. If the testator felt <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>a necessity of providing an indefinite succession for the devise over, it must have sprung from the contemplation of an indefinite failure of issue of the first taker: Stook’s App., <a href="/pa/20/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="20 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="972300" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0349-01">20 Pa. 349</a>. Certainly, it is not clear, from a consideration of the whole will, that the testator meant to give less than a freehold estate to his sou Thomas; certainly, there is nothing “ to contradict unequivocally the presumed intention that the devise over shall not take effect until the whole line of issue is extinct,” and that is all that is required in order to give the same construction to the fourth item which it received when the case of Cochran v. Titzell was under consideration.</p>
