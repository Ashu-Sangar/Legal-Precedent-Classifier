In pursuance of this agreement, on September 9,1886, John C. Nissley, at the suggestion of Mr. Mumma, took out letters of administration upon the estate of Patrick Evers.

In these cases, the court decided, that by the common law, the overseers of the poor, who had furnished relief and support to one in need of said relief and support, could not, in the absence of fraud, maintain an action against the party relieved and supported, or against his estate after his death. The relief and support thus furnished the pauper being a mere charity, no debt was created and no action could be maintained therefor. In other words, that tbe right of the overseers of the poor to maintain an action to recover the property of one whom they have relieved and supported, being a right given only by the act of assembly, they were bound to proceed according to that act. The auditor is of the opinion that these claimants have done so. They were not bound necessarily to bring suit in the Court of Common Pleas to recover this <em>claim; </em>by presenting it before your auditor they complied with the act of assembly.</p>

In answer to this, the auditor found that money realized on a policy of insurance upon the life of an individual, made payable to him or “ his heirs,” or payable to him or his “personal representatives,” was personal property in the hands of his administrator for all the purposes of distribution: Day v.

The act of assembly gives the overseers of the poor of any district in which any person shall have become charged, power to sue for and recover any personal property belonging to such person, and to apply the proceeds thereof, or so much as may be necessary, to defray the expenses incurred in the support and funeral of said person. The common law must give way to the statute referred to. The claimants, the overseers of the poor of the borough of Mifflintown, are legally entitled to this fund; their claim or so much thereof as is not barred by the statute of limitations was fully proven, and there being no other legal claims against this estate, the entire fund in the hands of the accountant, less the expenses of the audit, is awarded to said overseers of the poor of the borough of Mifflintown.</p>

      <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>The accountant’s 3d exception is, that: “ The auditor erred in not deciding that the overseers of the poor of the borough of Mifflintown had no legal standing before the auditor in the matter of exceptions and distribution.” And his 4th exception is, that: “ The auditor erred in not deciding that the relief and support furnished the pauper, Patrick Evers, was a mere charity ; and that no debt was created; and that no action could be maintained therefor.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b503-5" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[255,770,1168,1372]]]'>These exceptions are radical, and, if well taken, determine the controversy, because the account is then satisfactory to all parties legally interested, and distribution must be made among the heirs of Patrick Evers. They are based upon the proposition that, at common law, supplies furnished to a pauper are a gratuity, for the payment of which no promise was implied. In support of this proposition, Deer Isle v. Eaton, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Mass.%20338" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="12 Mass. 338">12 Mass. 338</a>; Kennebuckport v.

But probably the relief of the poor is rather to be considered a duty enforced by statute : 1 Bl. Com. 359. The world owes no man a living; he is in this respect his own debtor. If the poor district has been compelled to assume and pay some portion of this debt, there is no good reason why it should be denied the right to be reimbursed from his estate. Whatever may have been the common law rule, it has been superseded by statute both in Maine and Massachusetts, as well as in Pennsylvania. Our act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 548, makes it lawful “ to sue for and recover any real or personal estate belonging to such person, and to sell or otherwise dispose of the personal property .....and to apply the proceeds, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to defray the expenses incurred in the support and funeral of such person.” And, since said act makes it lawful “ for the overseers of any district.....in which any person shall have become chargeable to sue for,” etc., it is apparent that the above cited authorities are not applicable; and that said exceptions are not well taken.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b503-10" data-blocks='[["BL_503.5",503,[257,2150,1164,189]]]'>The other exceptions are to the effect, that the auditor erred in reducing the accountant’s compensation; in giving the fund to the overseers of the poor; and in not distributing it among the heirs of Patrick Evers.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b503-11" data-blocks='[["BL_503.6",503,[302,2356,1115,44]],["BL_504.1",504,[237,354,1181,1317]]]'>In regard to the compensation we need only say, that the <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>amount fixed by the auditor is more than five per cent of the whole amount collected, where there were but little time and trouble required in the collection. It is argued that the disposition of the fund was erroneously made, because it was derived from insurance on the life of Patrick Evers, which was only payable after his death, and no title to have it ever existed except in the legal representatives of the deceased; and that, therefore, the overseers are without any rightful claim. But the conclusion is a non sequitur. The same thing might be said with respect to the heirs, and the argument, if sound, would prove that the administrator alone is entitled to the fund. Day v. New England Life Ins. Co., Ill Pa. 507, is cited to support the argument. But that case simply decides that a policy of life insurance is not the subject of an attachment execution during the life of the assured; but it does not decide that the fund is not assets in the administrator’s hands for the payment of all his debts, or that it does not “ immediately and necessarily enure to the benefit of all who are interested in the decedent’s estate, whether as creditors or distributees.” No question was raised here, nor can be raised now, as to the original right to sue for and recover the fund from those liable upon the death of the assured; the fund has been recovered, and the question now is one of distribution. But the case of Jester v. Overseers, <a href="/pa/11/0540-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="11 Pa. 540" data-case-ids="404634" data-case-paths="/pa/11/0540-01">11 Pa. 540</a>, is not without importance, because it decides that the overseers, who had fed and clothed the pauper and not his heirs, were next in interest to the pauper.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[228,1679,1179,755]]]'>The said act of June 13,1836, P. L. 548, makes it lawful for the overseers “to sue for and recover any real or personal estate belonging to such” pauper. The policy of insurance was a chose in action and personal estate belonging to the pauper. The fact that no recovery could be had on it until after his death did not change its character. A promissory note may not mature until after the payee’s death; indeed, it may not be payable until a certain time after his death: Colehan v. Cook, Willes 393; s. o. 2 Stra. 1217; De Wald’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Phila.%20251" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="13 Phila. 251">13 Phila. 251</a>; but it is none the less, for that reason, personal estate of the payee. The statute intends that the overseers shall be reimbursed their expenses, in the pauper’s behalf, from the pauper’s estate, and should receive a construction consistent with that intention. We are of opinion that the accountant’s exceptions should be overruled.8</p>

The testimony taken before the auditor showrs that there was collected the sum of $1,031.88. This was money that belonged to the estate of Patrick Evers, and his administrator should have charged himself with it. This exception is sustained.10</p>

We think this exception is well taken.13 We are of opinion that the heirs are entitled to no part of this estate. The overseers are next in interest to the pauper : Jester v. Overseers, <a href="/pa/11/0540-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="11 Pa. 540" data-case-ids="404634" data-case-paths="/pa/11/0540-01">11 Pa. 540</a>. Their rightful claim exceeds the ■whole amount of the estate ; there is no balance remaining to be paid over; and therefore nothing payable to the heirs. Their agreement should not therefore deprive creditors of their legal claims. The administrator’s counsel should receive reasonable compensation for services properly rendered; but nothing more.

There was but little trouble in collecting the estate; it belonged, when collected at least, if not before, to the overseers of the poor, who were not bound by an agreement to which they were not a party: Chester Co. v. Barber, <a href="/pa/97/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="97 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="444786" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0455-01">97 Pa. 455</a>.</p>

The only statute is § 33, act of June 13,1836, P. L. 548, the full force of which is that the overseers are simply sequestrators to apply the pauper’s personal property and the income of his real estate to his maintenance and burial. They may sue others for its recovery, but not him as for a debt. Not being creditors, they cannot prove a claim in the Orphans’ Court against his estate. If they had any right to the insurance money, their remed3r would have been against the assignees of the policies; here, <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>they can claim if at all only as creditors: Overseers of White Deer Tp.’s App., <a href="/pa/95/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="95 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="492964" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0191-01">95 Pa. 191</a>.</p>

The fee was contingent; was fixed by agreement with the heirs, ratified by the administrator, and the actual outlay exceeded the $100 allowed. The overseers had slept for nearly five years without taking steps to recover the money, and, had it not been for Mr. Mumma’s diligence, not a dollar would have been realized. Both the administrator and counsel in the action labored faithfully to protect this fund, and the cutting down of the former’s commissions from $100 to $75, and the allowance of the latter from $150 to $100, were unjust. All authority teaches that you must not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn. Moreover if these overseers have no standing as creditors, all their exceptions to the account and auditor’s report fall.</p>

The appellants claim together over 75 per cent. No court of equity can sanction such rapacity. The agreement with Mr. Mamma was champertons and not binding. The heirs could not bind creditors by it, and as to the administrator it was ultra vires : Chester Co. v. Barber, <a href="/pa/97/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="97 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="444786" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0455-01">97 Pa. 455</a>.

But they are entitled to it under § 33, act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 548. Although there may be no implied assumption on the part of the pauper for maintenance at common law, the statute clearly gives the overseers the right to reimburse the district out of his property, including dioses in action, though these may not fall due until after his death. The statute is remedial and should be liberally construed.</p>

Said parties are David Mumma, whose claim to retain one half the fund collected from the different life policies was disallowed by the court below, and the administrator of Patrick Evers, the deceased pauper, whose commissions have been reduced, as well as the amount expended for counsel fees. The heirs of Patrick Evers have not appealed, hence the relative rights of said heirs and the overseers of the poor of the borough of Mifflintown are not before us. We are, therefore, spared the discussion of this interesting subject.</p>
    <p id="b508-4" data-blocks='[["BL_508.4",508,[261,878,1180,1377]]]'>The main question is whether Mr. Mumma was entitled to retain one half the sum collected by him. It appears from the report of the auditor that Patrick Evers, the decedent, was, at the time of his death, and had been for several years prior thereto, a pauper and a charge upon the borough of Mifflintown. It further appeared that during his life he was induced by certain parties to take out life policies in certain speculative insurance companies. These persons paid all expenses, took assignments of the policies, maintained them, and after his death drew money thereon, and kept it as their own. After the decisions of this court in other cases that such insurances enure to the benefit of the estate of the assured, an agreement was made between the heirs of said Patrick Evers and David .Mumma, of Harrisburg, that said Mumma was to raise up an administration upon the estate, ascertain what policies existed on his life, who held them, to whom money had been paid thereon; collect by suit or otherwise the money so paid by the insurance companies to the policy holders; bear all expenses and pay all charges out of his own pocket, if no money was obtained; and if any money was recovered the said Mumma was to receive as his compensation one half of the gross amount so obtained. In pursuance of this agreement letters of administration were taken out upon the estate, and the administrator ratified the agreement before made by the heirs. Mr. Mumma succeeded in collecting the sum of $1,031, one half of which he paid to the administrator, and retained the other half under the agreement as his compensation.</p>
    <p id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[257,2260,1178,145]],["BL_509.1",509,[205,355,1169,1065]]]'>Up to this time no one had knowledge of a claim on the part of the overseers of the poor for the maintenance of the pauper. ■The overseers made no effort to collect this money from the <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>parties who had received it, and the auditor distinctly finds that had there been no such agreement with Mr. Mumma there would have been no estate to distribute. The auditor further finds, and in this he is sustained by the evidence, that 50 per cent was the usual charge of attorneys for this class of cases. It must not be overlooked that the fee was contingent; no recovery, no compensation, and the expenses to be borne by the attorney. When we look at the character and amount of the claims, we are not prepared to say that the charge was unreasonable or the agreement ultra vires. We are not discussing a question of professional ethics, but an agreement as to professional compensation. The said agreement was not necessarily invalid because made by the heirs. Prima facie they had a right to make it, subject to the rights of creditors. But the latter having made no move toward collecting the money, they cannot wholly repudiate the agreement made by the heirs in good faith by moans of which the money was received. They would have a right to object if it was unreasonable and in fraud of their rights. Neither appears to be the fact in this case, and we think it was error to surcharge the accountant with any portion of the money retained by Mr. Mumma.</p>
    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[205,1429,1168,195]]]'>The auditor reduced the accountant’s claim for compensation from $100 to $75. In this he was sustained by the court below, and we think they were both right. This question does not require discussion.</p>

This the court reduced to $100. The auditor found as a fact that the charge was not excessive for the services rendered. The learned judge does not give a satisfactory reason for reversing him upon this point. He does not say that the amount was excessive or that it was not fully earned. That the estate when collected belonged to tbe overseers of the poor, and that they were not bound by an agreement to which they were not a party, is aside from the ease. The administrator had a right to collect this money and to administer the estate. Creditors are bound, as well as heirs and distributees, for expenses incident and necessary to the conduct of the business ; they can only be heard to object that such charges are excessive, and this has not been shown in this case. We are <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>of opinion that the fee of $150 to counsel should have been allowed.</p>
