All the cases cited were ordinary judgments, except Pentland v.

No' case has yet arisen on a mortgage which we have been able to discover. The question, then, is one of first'impression. To require different forms of execution to issue simultaneously on the same judgment founded upon a mortgage would be burdensome and inconvenient; a fieri facias, levy, inquisition and venditioni exponas against the life-tenant defendant, and a levari facias against the owner of the fee, and sales made at least weeks apart, an extent as to one and a sale as to the other. Under proceedings to enforce payment of a mortgage there can be no extent, and as the object of the acts of 1836, 1840 and 1849 was to prevent the sacrifice of life-estates, by applying rents and profits to the liquidation of the debts against them, those acts might well apply to all judgments where an extent is allowable. It is true that in Pentland v. Kelly, supra, a mechanics’ lien was held within the acts. But a mechanics’ lien does not exist by the written conveyance of the debtor, it is adverse; whereas a mortgage is a voluntary act and deed of the mortgagor, with specific remedies for collection, and is in fact a conveyance of the land itself and a specific pledge that it shall be responsible for the payment of the debt.</p>

There are two methods of appropriation open to us; one is to treat the surplus as real estate, and direct it to be invested until the accumulated interest on it swells the surplus to $14,000, the entire value of the estate, and then award the interest of this $14,000 to Robert Datesman, the tenant for life, so long as he lives, and at his death the principal or corpus of the estate, $14,000, to the remaindermen; this accumulated interest to compensate the remaindermen because their interest was taken to pay the debt of the tenant for life. The other is, to treat the sale on the mortgage by all the parties in interest as a voluntary one; that is, the parties conveyed by mortgage and therefore subjected the property to sale by process, just as if they had deeded the two interests, life-estate and fee, to a purchaser. If they had done so, it is clear that their respective interests would have been one third for the life-estate and two thirds for the fee. The conversion, then, being for the debt of all, so far as the Dunkel mortgage was concerned, and by the consent of all three, the equitable rule in dividing the proceeds of a sale of the entire estate at one third and two thirds, is that one third cash, or absolutely, is equivalent to the interest on the whole for life.</p>

If a man gets $1,000 cash absolute, that is equal to interest for life on $3,000. I take it this is what the common law rule means in valuing a life-estate at one third. It was the debt of the life-tenant which caused the sale, and he has thus voluntarily terminated his life-<a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>estate and caused a sale of tbe fee also. If bis life-estate only had been sold to pay his debt of $4,314.48, it would not have been paid, and there would have been no surplus. Then why should he receive interest when it took nearly all his interest to pay his debt ? The land was converted by consent of all the owners. We will adopt the common law rule, which gives the value of the life-estate as one third of the fee. This seems more reasonable than to tie up the entire fund during the life of the tenant for life, by giving him the interest on the whole for that period. The sale must be treated as a conversion of all the interests into money, just as if they had all joined in a conveyance to a stranger for $14,000 as the value of all their interests.....</p>

    <p id="b381-15" data-blocks='[["BL_381.15",381,[213,1684,1171,604]]]'>The first question we have to consider is whether the life estate of Robert Datesman passed by the sheriff’s sale on the writ of levari facias No. 13 May Term 1888. Prior to the sale the title was vested in the said Robert Datesman as tenant for life, with remainder to his two sons, Edgar P. Datesman and Harris M. Datesman. While the title stood in this position, the life-tenant and the two remaindermen united in a mortgage to Hiram Dunkel for $4,181.70. Upon this mortgage a scire facias xvas issued, and upon the judgment recovered thereon a writ of levari facias was issued, No. 13 May Term 1888, and the mortgaged premises sold for $14,000. It is upon the distribution of this fund that the questions in this case arise.</p>

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that under said act a life estate can only be sold upon a writ of venditioni exponas after ten days’ notice to the life-tenant, and by leave of court, and a number of cases were cited in support of this proposition.

There is no question as to the law of these cases. Whether they apply to a sale under a mortgage is a different matter. Upon this point the industry of counsel has not furnished us with any decided case in tins state, and I do not think it has been expressly ruled. I see no difficulty, however, in disposing of it upon principle. A sale of a life estate upon a mechanics lien, or an execution issued upon an ordinary judgment, is an adversary proceeding. A life-estate is an uncertain thing, and an adverse sale thereof can rarely take place without a serious sacrifice. The law, therefore, wisely lays its hand upon such a proceeding and prohibits a sale except upon certain conditions. But a sale upon mortgage is a different matter. No one doubts that a life-tenant may convey his estate by deed. A mortgage is but a conveyance with a clause of defeasance. It is something more than a lien; it is the grant of an estate as specific security for the money loaned. The mortgagee is not bound to proceed by scire facias, but may bring his ejectment. Moreover, a mortgage contains an express stipulation that if default be made in the payment of the money secured, the mortgagee may at once proceed to collect the same, and may issue a writ of scire facias thereon, “ any law, usage, or custom, or anything herein contained, to the contrary notwithstanding.” We are entirely clear that the act of 1849 has no application to the sale of a life-estate upon a mortgage given by a life-tenant, and that such sale passes his entire interest.</p>
    <p id="b382-5" data-blocks='[["BL_382.4",382,[253,2193,1175,195]],["BL_383.1",383,[234,342,1169,1272]]]'>The remaining questions refer to the distribution. The auditor has found, and upon sufficient evidence, that the mortgage under which the property was sold was given for the benefit of the life-tenant alone, the two remaindermen having <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>joined in it to perfect the security, but without receiving any part of the proceeds. Under such circumstances the mortgage must be paid out of the interest of the life-tenant, as also the expenses and costs of audit, as they were rendered necessary by his default. There were two modes of disposing of the fund, either of which would have been allowable. One was to invest the fund until with its accumulated interest it would amount to $14,000, tlie sum which the property brought at tlie sheriff’s sale, after which the life-tenant would have been entitled to the interest on the fund for life; the other was to value the life interest, give the tenant thereof his share in cash, and divide the rest between the two remaindermen. The court adopted the latter principle, and followed the old common law rule in force in England, and recognized in this state in Dennison’s App., <a href="/pa/1/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="1 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="949851" data-case-paths="/pa/1/0201-01">1 Pa. 201</a>, and in Shippen’s App., <a href="/pa/80/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="80 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1042300" data-case-paths="/pa/80/0391-01">80 Pa. 391</a>, that one third of the capital sum is the measure of the life interest. The court therefore awarded $67.66, which was all there was left of his interest, to the life-tenant, and the balance was equally divided between the two remaindermen. We see no error in this. The life-estate in the land was destroyed by the act and default of the life-tenant; the fund realized by the sale represented the entire title to the property; the interest of the life-tenant therein had been exhausted within a few dollars, and no good reason is apparent why the remaindermen should not have their money.</p>
    <p id="b383-5" data-blocks='[["BL_383.4",383,[231,1622,1169,759]],["BL_384.1",384,[262,341,1173,146]]]'>What has been said covers all of the assignments of error except the fourth, in which complaint is made that the court below erred in not allowing to Robert Datesman, the life-tenant, the amount expended by him for permanent improvements, as found by the auditor. I do not see that the appellant made any such claim before the auditor; certainly no such exception was made to his report. There was some evidence before him tending to show that the life-tenant had made some trifling improvements and repairs, but it was so unimportant as not to be included in his findings of fact. There was nothing to show that the improvements were made with the consent of the remaindermen, and it is settled law that the life-tenant cannot of his own motion improve the remaindermen out of their estate. Where the latter consent to improvements for the mutual benefit of the joint estate, and the property is afterwards sold <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>to promote the interests of both, equity would perhaps allow the life-tenant a reasonable compensation for the value of the improvements.
