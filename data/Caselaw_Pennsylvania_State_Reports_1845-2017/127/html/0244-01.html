This being a suit by an administrator of a decedent, to recover an alleged loan made to the defendant firm in her lifetime, the act of 1869 does not apply, and the competency of the witness must be decided as if that law had not been enacted: Hoopes v. Beale, <a href="/pa/90/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="90 Pa. 82" data-case-ids="1065635" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0082-01">90 Pa. 82</a>. Had the witness simply released her interest in the sum sought to be recovered, to the administrator, beyond all doubt she would have been made competent; for a distributee cannot be forced to accept a share of the decedent’s estate. But when a distributee not only does not decline but actually accepts the share, and then makes an assignment or sale of it, either colorable or for value, and then is offered as a witness to support the claim, the law rejects such a witness: Post v.

It may be claimed that in this case the interest is collateral, and not direct, and that that should make a difference. Why should it ? In Asay v. Hoover, <a href="/pa/5/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="5 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="953512" data-case-paths="/pa/5/0021-01">5 Pa. 21</a>, which was a contest relating to land the ownership of which was cast upon the heir, the court held that the witness could not assign his interest and then come in and swear his title through. Suppose it had been a distributive share or a legacy, cast upon him or given to him by will, does the fact that he must get it through the personal representative interfere with his interest or with the reasons of public policy which will exclude him ? Haus v. Palmer, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Pa.%20297" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="21 Pa. 297">21 Pa. 297</a>, was a feigned issue. Mary Norman, a legatee, assigned her legacy to her mother, and was admitted as a witness. But this court held her incompetent. So in Hitner’s App., <a href="/pa/54/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="54 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="1006322" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0110-01">54 Pa. 110</a>, the widow of a decedent executed an assignment of her interest in the estate to her son. She was rejected as a witness by the court below, and the rejection was affirmed. The law of Post v. Avery, Haus v. Palmer and Hitner’s Appeal, is the true law of this state. A legatee or distributee may decline to accept the share or legacy, and by executing a release to the estate become a competent witness; but he cannot accept and then assign, for a valuable <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>or other consideration, and then come in to support the sale or assignment by his oath.</p>

It is well settled, that in actions by or against executors or administrators, a party to the record, or the assignor of the claim sued upon, cannot testify, even if he. have assigned or released his interest; nor can one who, although not nominally, is yet substantially a party to the record, as in cases of legatees or distributees in feigned issues, or in matters involving the settlement of the estate. But, on the other hand, it is equally well settled that in an action by an administrator against a third person, a legatee or distributee who has parted with his interest is a competent witness. And it is immaterial whether such interest has ceased by assignment, by transfer, by payment, or by release, for when the interest from whatever cause ceases, the disqualification ceases: Dellone v. Rohmer, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20W.%209" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="4 W. 9">4 W. 9</a> ; Steininger v.

The witness was not the plaintiff in the action, nor could she ever have been; nor was she the assignor of the claim sued upon; hence she did not first raise the claim and then support it by her testimony. Her interest, apart from the assignment, was wholly a collateral interest in the sum which might be recovered ; and it has always been the law that when such interest was divested by assignment or any other species of transfer, the witness thereby became competent. Thus in Commonwealth v. Ohio &amp; P. R. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Grant%20348" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="1 Grant 348">1 Gr. 348</a>, Black, J., said: “ When the interest of the witness is collateral, his competency may be restored by a release or a transfer of it. The rule in Post v. Avery, applies only to persons who have assigned choses in action, on which the recovery should have been for their own use, if no assignment had been made......The rule in question is not leveled against interested witnesses, but is founded in the policy of stopping a disinterested party from testifying in favor of one who sues in his right.” See also, Cornell v.

She was neither the owner nor the assignor of the claim in suit; nor could she, individually, in her own right, ever have been plaintiff in an action to recover the same. She was not a party in interest, because, prior to suit brought, she absolutely released and transferred to her brother, individually, all the interest she ever had or could have in the amount that might be recovered. She was therefore competent to testify, and no policy of law excluded her. On the contrary, the policy of the law is rather to favor the admission of witnesses who are divested of all interest. Whenever it is practicable to do so, the tendency of modem legislation, as well as judicial decision, is to let questions of policy, interest, etc., go to the credibility, rather than to the competency of witnesses.</p>

      <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>In Commonwealth v. Ohio &amp; P. R. Co., supra, Mr. Justice Black notices the- distinction between an interest that is collateral and one that is direct, as follows : “ When the interest of the witness is collateral, his competency may be restored by a release or transfer of it. The rule in Post v. Avery applies only to persons who have assigned choses in action on which the recovery would have been for their own use, if no assignment had been made. Its object is to prevent a party from transforming himself into a witness by the magic of a bit of paper. It forbids one who assigns a claim to sell his oath along with it. But a person who has a merely incidental interest in the result, an interest which arises entirely out of the fact that the record may be evidence for or against him in some other action, may divest himself of such interest, and if he does so at any time before he is offered as a witness, his testimony must be received. For instance, a stockholder in a corporation may transfer his stock and become a witness for the company; a legatee may dispose of his interest in the estate and testify for the executors; an attorney who has a contingent fee may release it and give evidence in favor of his client. The rule in question is not leveled against interested witnesses, but is founded in the policy of stopping a disinterested party from testifying in favor of one who sues in his right.”</p>

Dennison, supra, was an action of ejectment against a mortgagor by the administrators of the mortgagee who died intestate, unmarried and without issue- On the trial, a niece and heir-at-law of the intestate, and wife of one of the administrators, was called by them to sustain the mortgage on which the action was based. Being objected to as incompetent, because she was the wife of one of the plaintiffs and also a distributee of the estate represented in part by her husband, and therefore interested, it was shown that she had previously executed and delivered to a third party an assignment of all her interest in the mortgage in controversy ; and on the authority of Carter v. Trueman, Steininger v. Hoch, and kindred cases, it was held that inasmuch as she was not a party to the suit, either actually or substantially, and her interest as distributee, so far as the claim in suit was concerned, having been divested by the assignment, she was a competent witness. In principle, that case is not essentially different from the one under consideration. The first specification of error is not sustained.</p>
