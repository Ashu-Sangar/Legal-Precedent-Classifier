From these offers and explanation, it appears to us that the charge of nuisance in this case must be sustained, if at all, by showing, that while the charter permitted this railroad to be built and while the assent of the borough of Kingston was secured as early as the year 1866, this assent contemplated the occupancy of the centre of a certain street, while the actual location made in 1866, and maintained since, has not been in the centre thereof, at a certain point. But it appears from the indictment that nothing of this kind is alleged therein as constituting the nuisance complained of. The indictment is couched in the most general phraseology and alleges a public nuisance without any particular specification of its nature, or of its effect upon the public; in other words, while alleging that the railroad in question is a <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>nuisance because of a mislocation, the fact of mislocation is not set forth.

At the end of the offer, also, the nuisance complained of was defined as follows, viz.: “ The nuisance consisting in so much of the track as diverges from the centre of the track to the southerly side thereof.” .The only manner in which it is claimed that the part of the track complained of was a nuisance at all, was in its not being laid in the centre of the street. It was not alleged nor offered to be proven that the structure of the track, or its position, in point of fact interfered with public travel in any respect. The alleged unlawful location of this <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>small piece of connecting track, was the only element set up as establishing a nuisance at all. But it is very evident that this element is not established by any or all of the matters contained in the offer. The resolution of council, which it is said was violated, only provides that the track “ shall be laid in the centre or middle of the said street, with a street rail <em>in such a manner </em>that wagons, sleighs, vehicles of every description can conveniently cross and re-cross said street without hindrance at any time and at any point,” etc. A mere inspection of the map shows conclusively that if the track is properly laid as to its structure, it does not interfere with the public travel in any manner whatever. Its mere location cannot interfere in any degree with its being conveniently crossed and re-crossed. It is simply a continuation of the track of tbe railway, just as it is laid through the street, without any complaint of the manner of the structure. In addition to this the place in which this particular piece of track is laid is not Railroad street or any part of it. It is a wide open space formed by the intersection of five streets in which the individuality of each street is lost. The track is laid on the centre of Railroad street, up to the point at which that street enters the open space constituting the intersection of the several streets, and from that point the track is laid not upon Railroad street, but upon the open ground of the intersection. On the opposite side of this space where the track continues, there is a slight deflection from a straight line, to enter upon the private property of the company. But this cannot be regarded as in any sense a nuisance in itself, since the company has a necessary right to reach a track upon its own land as plainly as if it were a car house or a horse stable.</p>
