By them it appears that on December 28,1836, the county commissioners contracted with William Boardman and Calvin Avery to erect the bridge for §870. On October 17, 1837, the commissioners presented their petition to the Court of Quarter <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>Sessions, setting forth the prior proceedings, and that the bridge had been completed agreeably to the contract, and praying for the appointment of six fit persons to inspect the said bridge, etc.; whereupon the court appointed six fit persons as prayed for, five of whom reported November 6, 1837, that they had inspected the bridge and the workmanship thereof; that it had been built and finished according to the agreement, and was a permanent and substantial structure.

This settling has been gradual for a few years past and the abutments are now, partly in consequence of the settling and partly from the action of the frost, floods and ice, cracked, bulged out towards the stream, with some of the stone washed out, and in need of thorough repairs. I cannot find, however, that the particular damage done by floods and ice amounts to the destruction, partial destruction, or blowing down of the bridge, within the meaning of the act of May 5, 1876, P. L. 112. Floods and ice contributed, with the other causes I have named, to gradually affect the abutments and render the repairs necessary.</p>

That the legislature <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>did not intend comity bridges to be repaired at the expense of the county, is evident from the subsequent legislation upon the subject.

The act of April 6, 1854, P. L. 295, extended the exception to Erie county. Then came the act of May 5, 1876, P. L. 112, requiring counties to rebuild and reconstruct bridges destroyed or partially destroyed by casualty. Wherefore, if by the act of 1802, the several counties were obliged to repair and reconstruct county bridges, they must also be obliged to do so under the act of 1836, and in such ease, all the subsequent legislation upon the subject is superfluous. If the bridge in question has become so dilapidated that a new structure is necessary, the petitioners have mistaken their remedy, and they must proceed under § 35, act of June 13, 1836.</p>

In §§20 and 21, the legislature clearly distinguishes between bridges to be kept in repair by townships, and those to be kept up by the county. In bridges over small creeks and rivulets, the supervisors are required both to build and maintain them: but there is no requirement that supervisors shall repair bridges erected by the county, and thus no liability on their part to do so. We concede that the duty to repair is not specifically imposed by this act upon counties, but it would seem to follow ex necessitate from their obligation to erect, and thus thought this court, as shown in the case of Howe v. Crawford Co., <a href="/citations/?q=47%20Pa.%20381" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="47 Pa. 381">47 Pa. 381</a>. Moreover, this seems to have been the construction placed upon the act originally by the county authorities: Smithfield Creek Bridge, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Whart.%20362" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="6 Whart. 362">6 Wh. 362</a>, a construction sanctioned impliedly by § 28, act of April 15, 1834, P.

L, 295, extended the exemptions of the act of 1843 to Erie county. It does not reach this case. The bridge in question was made a county bridge in 1836. In the language of Woodward, C. J.: “ How has the obligation to maintain it, been taken off the shoulders of the commissioners ? ” In our case, the bridge was built by the county, and as the act imposes the duty of repair on no one else, it falls upon the county: Meadville v. Erie Canal Co., <a href="/pa/18/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="18 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="969059" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0066-01">18 Pa. 66</a>.</p>

L. 214, providing for the election of road commissioners in Erie county, in its §§20 and 27, clearly divested the road commissioners of the township of all jurisdiction in relation to the bridge in question. They have no power over it, nor right to repair or rebuild it. For them to expend money upon it, would be to misappropriate, and it follows necessarily that if it is not the duty of the county commissioners to take charge of the bridge in question, there is no one liable for its dangerous condition. It cannot be presumed that such a result as this was intended.</p>

The local road officers represent the district for which they are chosen, and must discharge the duty of opening and repairing the highways within it.

      <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>It will sometimes happen, however, that the line of a road crosses a river or other considerable stream of water and that the expense of carrying the road across the water by a bridge is greater than the township is able to bear. In that case, the law provides that the county shall come to the aid of the township and build the bridge. The act of June 13,1836, regulates i,he manner in which this may be done. The facts must be made known to the Court of Quarter Sessions of the proper county by a petition. Viewers are then appointed by the court to examine into and report upon the facts stated in the petition. The report of the viewers must be submitted to the grand jury for its approval. If this is obtained, the court and the county commissioners must also concur, before the expenditure of one dollar by the county is permissible. If the bridge is finally determined upon, an estimate of the cost must be made, and the building of the bridge may then be entered upon. After it is completed, it must be inspected by another view to be appointed by the Court of Quarter Sessions, and if they report to the court that the work has been properly done, the money may be safely paid out of the county treasury. The object of this legislation is to relieve the township by imposing a part of its duty under certain prescribed circumstances on the county, and paying the cost of discharging that duty out of the funds of the county which otherwise would not be applicable to such a purpose. But the law does not make provision for its care after its erection. That duty remains on the township, and the finished bridge, when opened for travel, becomes a part of the highway and passes as such under the care of the township officers. The county has no road officers. Its duty is simply to build the bridge, when the township cannot; and, that duty done, it has no further responsibility for its maintenance than for the maintenance of the roadway leading to or from it.</p>

Monroe County, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 495" data-case-ids="1853555" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0495-01">2 W. &amp; S. 495</a>. By the act of 1843 the duty of repairing county bridges was placed, upon the county, but by the terms of the proviso and by subsequent acts about one half the counties of the state were excepted from its provisions. The county of Erie was taken out from its operation by the act of April 6, <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>1854, and has since been under the rule that prevailed before the act of 1843 was passed. If tliis was not so, it is evident that the effect of the act of 1843 was confined to repairs, in the ordinary sense of that word, and could not authorize a rebuilding of the superstructure at the discretion of the county commissioners. This would still require all the formal prerequisites provided by the act of 1836, the petition, view, report, and the action of grand jury, court and county commissioners. The delay consequent upon these proceedings was sometimes found to work great inconvenience to the traveling public and to relieve against it the act of May 5, 1876, was passed. It provided that in all cases where a county bridge had been “blown down, destroyed, or partially destroyed, or swept away by floods, freshets, ice, storm, fire or other casualty,” it should be the duty of the county commissioners to rebuild the bridge so blown down, destroyed or swept away, subject, however, to inspection in the same manner as an original construction. As the county of Erie is not under the act of 1843, it is not necessary to inquire particularly into its effects, nor to determine the relative duties of county and township under it.</p>
    <p id="b232-5" data-blocks='[["BL_232.4",232,[288,1417,1171,856]]]'>This proceeding is not under the act of 1876, nor is it alleged that this bridge has been blown down or destroyed by casualty. The question presented is over the duty to make repairs under the provisions of the act of 1836, and we are clearly of opinion that the duty rests on the township and not on the county. The case of Howe v. Crawford County, <a href="/pa/47/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="47 Pa. 361" data-case-ids="485542" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0361-01">47 Pa. 361</a>, on the authority of which the learned judge of the court below ruled this case, is in conflict with the Commonwealth v. Monroe County, supra, and with the rule now laid down. If the condition of the bridge is such as to justify its rebuilding under the act of 1876, it is possible that upon a proper application a mandamus may yet issue. If it is not, but its dilapidation is such that a new bridge must be built, it will be necessary to resort to a proceeding under the act of 1836. If however the question presented is. as we understand it to be, one about liability for ordinary repairs, the townships in the county of Erie are liable, and for that reason this petition should be dismissed.</p>
