L. 193: “ When any one shall die, leaving an infant child or children, without having made an adequate provision for the support and education o'f such child or children, during their minority, the Orphans’ Court may direct a suitable periodical allowance, out of the minor’s estate, for the support and educa<a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>bion of such minor, according to the circumstances of each case; which order may, from time to time, be varied by the court, according to the age of the minor and circumstances of the case.”</p>

Lightner, then further provides : “ It is my will that all the balance of my property be divided equally between my two sons Linn C. Lightner and Horace W. Lightner in the following manner; ” and then follows the provision copied into the case stated. There is here a separate and antecedent gift, which is independent of the directions as to time of payment, and therefore the legacy of $1,000 to Linn C. Lightner is a vested legacy: Seibert’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Pa.%20503" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 Pa. 503">13 Pa. 503</a>; Bowman’s App., <a href="/pa/34/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="34 Pa. 19" data-case-ids="418025" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0019-01">34 Pa. 19</a>. But whether the legacy be vested or contingent, the legatee, by virtue of said act of assembly, may have an allowance, at least out of the interest, for his support and education: Seibert’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=19%20Pa.%204" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="19 Pa. 4">19 Pa. 4</a>.9; Seitz’s App., <a href="/pa/87/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="87 Pa. 159" data-case-ids="1057823" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0159-01">87 Pa. 159</a>. We are not aware that it has been decided that such allowance may not be made out of the corpus of the legacy. That question was left undecided in Leiby’s App., <a href="/pa/49/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="49 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="998527" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0186-01">49 Pa. 186</a>.</p>

Lightner has no absolute right of property in the corpus of the fund to be invested ; this was otherwise disposed of by the testator: Bentley v. Kauffman, <a href="/pa/86/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="86 Pa. 99" data-case-ids="1056564" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0099-01">86 Pa. 99</a>.

Lightner was not intended to come into the enjoyment of either the absolute legacy, or the farm, until he had attained the age of twenty-one years. The provision respecting Horace is, “ It is my desire that my son Horace W. Lightner receive his portion of this bequest when he arrives at the age of twenty-one years.” In respect to Linn C. Lightner it is, “ I desire that my son Linn C. Lightner receive $1,000 as soon as he arrives at the age of twenty-one years, and that the remainder of his share be in<a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>vested in a farm.” That remainder would be the residue of his share of the estate, principal and interest, after deducting the one thousand dollars ; or, in other words, the whole of Linn C. Lightner’s share of the estate, with its accumulated interest at the time he attains his majority, is to be invested in a farm, excepting only the legacy of one thousand dollars. If now we give said legatee “ an additional $1,000 upon his arriving at the age of 21 years,” it can only be done by taking from the remaindermen property to which they have an absolute right, and, in violation of that right and the manifest intention of the testator, bestowing it upon one absolutely who is entitled only to a life interest.' This we think cannot be done. If the legatee has been advanced the corpus of his own estate, no wrong at least has been done to any other person; but if it now be paid from the corpus of another’s estate, the remaindermen would have just cause of complaint.</p>

It gives the testator’s son Horace a legacy of one thousand dollars, and divides all the residue of his estate equally between his sons Horace and Linn. Horace’s share is given absolutely to be paid to him on arrival at the age of twenty-one, with a •conditional devise over in case of death before that time. Linn’s share is given in the following words: “ I desire that my son Linn C. Lightner receive one thousand dollars as soon as he arrives at the age of twenty-one years, and that the re<a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>mainder of Iris share be invested in a farm, he the said Linn C. Lightner having full control and management of farm, and receiving all revenues and proceeds therefrom, but not having power to sell,” etc., with remainder to his issue, and in default of issue, devise over to Horace or his heirs. The testator intended that on coining of age his son Linn should have a cash sum of one thousand dollars put in his hands to start with. The gift for that purpose is absolute, and no provision is made for reduction or abatement. If his whole share had amounted only to that sum, on reaching the stipulated age it would all have been payable to him without regard to the consequent failure of the provision for a farm. So long as that amount remained, it became his absolutely and presently, and the court has no authority to say that it shall be reduced by sums paid previously and for a different purpose. To do so is to substitute a new will for that which the testator made. We are therefore clearly of opinion that there must be judgment for the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b497-4" data-blocks='[["BL_497.4",497,[240,1284,1168,655]]]'>The learned court below was largely influenced by the consideration that plaintiff liad but a limited interest in the money to be invested in the farm, and an absolute property only in the legacy of one thousand dollars, and that the sums paid for his maintenance during minority should therefore come out of this latter fund. Such a result might have followed had it become necessary to use up the fund for maintenance during minority, but it could not do so until all the rest of the share had been exhausted. As already said the specific gift of the one thousand dollars was the primary and controlling intent of the testator, and must be carried out so long as any portion of the share remains to pay it with. It is only the remainder after payment of this sum that is directed to be invested in a farm.</p>
    <p id="b497-5" data-blocks='[["BL_497.5",497,[239,1948,1170,450]],["BL_498.1",498,[250,363,1173,797]]]'>Nor do we find any difficulty in regard to the income. The gift of the shares themselves is not by way of remainder, or of a future contingent estate, but is, in terms, absolute, present, and immediate — “ it is my will that all the balance of my property be divided equally between my two sons.....in the following manner,” — -and then follows the provision for his son Linn already quoted. In the case of Horace there is a subsequent devise over in the event of his death before reaching the age of twenty-one, but in the case of Linn there is no contin<a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>gency of any kind between him and his life estate. It is postponed as to full enjoyment, till majoritjr, but the gift itself is of a present and absolute interest for life in the fund, vesting at once upon the death of the testator, and there is neither gift over of the income, nor direction to accumulate during minority. If the devise had been of real estate, the title would have passed by the will directly and immediately to Linn for life. As it was of personaNy his interest is equally direct and immediate. The title being in him, the income followed the title, and was his absolute property both before and after majority. During minority of course it was applicable to his maintenance under the direction of his guardian or of the Orphans’ Court. If there are any accumulations they are payable to him on coming of age, in addition to the thousand dollars of the corpus of the fund, given him specifically by the will.</p>
