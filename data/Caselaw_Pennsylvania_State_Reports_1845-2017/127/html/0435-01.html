At the time of his death, the intestate was seised in fee simple of a tract of land situate in Spring township, Perry Co., Pa., containing 227 acres, more or less. Henry Cooper, father of the decedent, entered into and retained possession of the said real estate until his death on April 21, 1881, when he was succeeded by Sarah Cooper, the mother, who held the same until her death, which occurred on July 9, 1884. After the said real estate came into the hands of the collateral heirs at the death of their mother, partition thereof was made by the Orphans’ Court of Perry county, and the entire tract was awarded to Frederick S. Cooper, one of the brothers of the decedent. On April 7, 1888, Frederick S.

Cooper died in 1873, without.issue, and seized of a tract of land situate in Spring township, in this county, containing about 227 acres. He left surviving him his father, his mother, and collateral heirs. His father died in 1881, and his mother died on July 9, 1884. On April 7, 1888, an appraiser was appointed for the purpose of ascertaining the collateral inheritance tax. He reported that he had valued and appraised the real estate of which the said William H. Cooper died seised “ at $28 per acre, for each and every acre thereof of 227 acres, which amounts to the sum of $6,256, as of the 9th day of July, 1884, as the sum on which the collateral inheritance tax is to be assessed.” He further reported the facts that W. H. Cooper at the time of his death was indebted to his father and others in the aggregate amount of $2,998.42, and that after crediting the amount of his personal estate, to wit, <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>$1,399.40, there resulted a deficiency of personalty for payment of debts amounting to $1,599.02.

    <p class="summary" id="b462-5" data-blocks='[["BL_462.4",462,[256,839,1172,441]]]'>Thus, it is apparent, the law recognized the estates for life and in remainder as liable each for its own tax, interest and penalty, and neither as liable for the other; and that the taxes both on the life estate (excepting the exempted interest in favor of father, mother, etc.) and the estates in remainder were due immediately upon the death of the decedent, and liable to the penalty of twelve per cent in default of payment. See Commonwealth v. Smith, <a href="/pa/20/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="20 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="972415" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0100-01">20 Pa. 100</a>; Commonwealth v.

Thus, the payment of the tax by remaindermen, which before this act, was payable at the death of the decedent, may now, at their election, be postponed until they come into actual possession, upon proper security for its payment; then, with interest at six per cent from the date of decedent’s death. They were in this manner relieved from the penalty until they came into possession, but not from the interest.</p>

L. 79. This statute is entitled “ An act to provide for the better collection of collateral inheritance taxes.” It is chiefly a compilation and re-enactment of all previous laws in force on the same subject. It makes but little change, except in the orderly arrangement and logical connection of previous enactments, omitting what has been supplied and retaining the alterations so made, and constitutes now probably the only statute law relating to collateral taxes. The only change affecting our present inquiry relates to the commencement of interest on taxes for which tenants in remainder are liable. The third section provides: “ That, in all cases where there has been or shall be a devise, descent, or bequest to collateral relations or strangers liable to the collateral inheritance tax, to take effect in possession, or come into <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>actual enjoyment after the expiration of one or more life estates, or a period of years, the tax on such estate shall not be payable, nor interest begin to run thereon, until the person or persons liable for the same shall come into actual possession of such estate by the termination of the estate for life or years, and the tax shall be assessed upon the value of the estate at the time the right of possession accrues to the owner aforesaid; provided that the owner shall have the right to pay the tax at any time prior to his coming into possession, and in such cases the tax shall be assessed on the value of the estate at the time of payment of the tax, after deducting the value of the life estate or estate for years.” Thus the interest which, before this statute, began to run at the death of the decedent, now begins when the tenant in remainder has the right of actual possession. The twelfth section re-enacts the law previously in force regulating the appraisement for purposes of collateral tax; and the first section continues the provision that, on all estates subject thereto, the tax shall be “ five dollars on every hundred dollars of the clear value of such estates.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b464-5" data-blocks='[["BL_464.4",464,[244,1333,1177,1065]],["BL_465.1",465,[218,357,1169,652]]]'>But the appraiser was of the opinion that, because the real estate descended intact to collateral heirs, the tax must be assessed upon the valuation of the real estate, without abatement of the debts owing by the decedent at the time of his death. This, however, would exclude any room for the application of “ clear value,” and is inconsistent with the legislative intent in imposing the tax. This tax at first became due upon the death of the decedent. His debts were then a lien against his real estate, and the law authorized the land to be sold, if necessary, for their payment. The surplus only was liable to the tax. It is to be assessed, not upon the pecuniary value of the land coming to the tenant in remainder, but upon the clear value of the estate passing from the person who may die seised thereof. If an unmarried son purchase a farm for $6,000, and having paid but $2,000, dies, leaving it to pass to his father incumbered with the remaining $4,000, and then to a brother after the father has extinguished the debt, and it is now valued at $6,000 by the collateral appraiser, this is to tax, not the estate that passed from the son, but the different estate three times as great that passed from the father. But if it is the father’s estate, it should pass from him to his other sons free from any <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>such tax whatsoever. It is the same land that passes to the tenant in remainder, but not the same estate; and it is the estate that is to be valued and appraised, and not the land. An estate in land is the interest which the tenant hath therein, and for collateral tax purposes; this is measured by its “ clear value,” and not by extent of title. -This is consistent with the provisions directing the valuation of the several estates for life and in remainder. Thus, when the tenant for life is a stranger, the value of his estate is fixed by the appraisement. It depends upon the clear value of the estate passing to him as affected by its probable duration. When once ascertained, it remains as to him unchangeable: Commonwealth v. Freedley, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Pa.%2038" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="21 Pa. 38">21 Pa. 38</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b465-4" data-blocks='[["BL_465.4",465,[220,1026,1170,1423]]]'>If the tenant in remainder desired “ to pay the tax at any time prior to his coming into possession,” it is to be “ assessed on the value of the estate at the time of the payment of the tax, after deducting the value of the life estate or estate for years.” The value of his estate depends upon the clear value of the estate that passes from the person who died seised, and the probable duration of the preceding life estate. If the life tenant is old, or if his estate has already been enjoyed for a number of years, the tenant in remainder will not be kept out of his inheritance so long as otherwise, and the value of his estate would be the greater. When, therefore, the act declares that the tax shall be assessed upon the value of the estate, at the time the right of possession accrues to the owner, or that “ the tax shall be assessed on the value of the estate at the time of the payment of the tax,” it refers to the then quantum of the estate, after deducting the life estate, and not to the value of the land, which may bo a very different estate from that which passed from the decedent. The act of 1887 simply provides for the better collection of collateral inheritance taxes. No other purpose is expressed in its title. It does not subject any other or different estates to the tax than is provided in previous statutes; if it did, it would be amenable to constitutional objection. It is still the estate passing from the deceased proprietor, that is liable to the tax, and that is the estate as it existed at the death of said proprietor. That estate consisted in the “ clear value ” of the real and personal property of which said proprietor died seised and possessed: Commonwealth v. Eckert, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20Pa.%20102" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="58 Pa. 102">supra.</a></p>
