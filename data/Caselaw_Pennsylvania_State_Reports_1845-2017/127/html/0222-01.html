    <p class="summary" id="b249-6" data-blocks='[["BL_249.6",249,[206,1005,1183,756]]]'>The intention of the testatrix, Mary Ahl, to dispose of her entire estate is plain. She commences with the words, “ And as to such worldly estate as I may be possessed of at the time of my death, I dispose of the same as follows : ” and concludes with the words, “ And as to the rest and residue of my estate, if any, I give and bequeath the same.” The will is inartificially drawn, but taking the whole together, it is sufficiently clear that she intended to dispose of all her property, not fo die intestate as to any part of it. Says Justice Sharswood, in Geyer v. Wentzel, <a href="/citations/?q=68%20Pa.%2085" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="68 Pa. 85">68 Pa. 85</a>, 87, this, to be sure, is never a conclusive argument in favor of a construction which passes a fee, hut the courts have invariably laid hold of introductory or other words indicating such an intention, as they do of every other circumstance in a will which may help to guide their judgment to the true construction of it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b249-7" data-blocks='[["BL_249.7",249,[206,1781,1181,650]]]'>It is equally clear that the testatrix’s three daughters, Mary, Louisa and Catharine, were not merely the principal, but the only objects of her solicitude and bounty. They are the only beneficiaries named in the will, and there is no devise over. To them is given everything that passes by the will. Prima facie the first taker is always the principal object of testator’s bounty, and in doubtful cases the construction leans in favor of making the gift to him as effectual as imssible : Rewalt v. Ulrich, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20Pa.%20888" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="28 Pa. 888">28 Pa. 888</a>. While not conclusive, still the plain intent to dispose of her entire estate for the benefit of these three daughters, is a most important and controlling consideration in determining the quantum of the estate in her realty given to them by her will.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b250-4" data-blocks='[["BL_250.3",250,[281,390,1181,912]]]'>
      <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>It is, however, contended by defendant’s counsel that there is a contingency, on the happening of which this testatrix must be regarded as dying intestate as to the realty, the title to which is in controversy in this suit. For, they say, the para^graph in the will disposing, eo nomine, of this lot of ground, gives to the daughters but a life estate, with a power of disposition of the same in the one who shall become the unmarried survivor ; and that if the said survivor shall die without executing the power, this real estate will descend to the heirs of the testatrix under the intestate laws. And further, they contend that the deed of conveyance to the plaintiff from the two surviving devisees in the will, was not a valid execution of the power, because, by its terms, it was to be executed by the single survivor, who had not, at the date of that deed, and has not yet been ascertained bjr the death or marriage of all but one ¿ and that a power to be exercised on the happening of a particular event, or at a particular time, cannot be legally exercised before the time comes, or the event happens.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b250-5" data-blocks='[["BL_250.4",250,[280,1311,1181,751]]]'>As already indicated, this construction would be contrary to-the manifest intent of the whole will, to give the entire estate to the three daughters. And it has the further vice of being based on a part only of the will, viz.: that paragraph which disposes, eo nomine, of the lot in controversy. Besides all this, a power of absolute disposal, even coupled with the grant of a life estate only, is sufficient to vest a fee, when there is, as. here, a manifest and general intent of the testator which would be defeated by adhering to the particular intent: Church v. Disbrow, <a href="/pa/52/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="52 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="1002256" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0219-01">52 Pa. 219</a>-23 ; Grove’s Est., <a href="/pa/58/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="58 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="1013169" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0429-01">58 Pa. 429</a>. Certainly when the time arrives, as it must in the natural order of events,, that one of these daughters shall be the sole survivor, she will have the absolute power of disposal of this land, and her estate will be a fee. Until the survivor is ascertained, the fee rests between the three devisees.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b250-6" data-blocks='[["BL_250.5",250,[281,2079,1178,351]],["BL_251.1",251,[218,358,1175,812]]]'>It is difficult, and probably unnecessary to define with technical accuracy the estate in these devisees created by the paragraph of the will now under consideration. With approximate correctness it may be said to be an estate for their joint lives, subject to be divested as to either one marrying, with alternative remainder in fee to the survivor. Certain it seems that by the operation of this paragraph alone, the fee resided among <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>the three devisees, and their conveyance in fee to this plaintiff, joined in by all of them, carried it to the plaintiff. Even if the fee were in abeyance during the currency of the life estate, and would only vest in the survivor at the death or marriage of the others, such survivor would be estopped to claim against her deed: .Brown v. McCormick, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Va.%2060" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 Va. 60">6 V. 60</a>; Wasbabaugh v.

Regarding the estate in the devisees as merely a life estate, with a power of disposition in the survivor, and not to be exercised until the survivor is ascertained, — a construction so contrary to the general intent as to be in my judgment entirely untenable, — still as there is no devise over, and the postponement is solely for the benefit of the life tenants, they could consent to its exercise before the period, and, all joining in the deed, the survivor would be estopped to assert a right contrary to it: Styer v. Freas, <a href="/pa/15/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="15 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="408699" data-case-paths="/pa/15/0339-01">15 Pa. 339</a> ; Cast v.

    <p class="summary" id="b251-5" data-blocks='[["BL_251.4",251,[218,1180,1170,194]]]'>But it is unnecessary to rest the judgment in this case on grounds so technical. For I regard the residuary clause in the will as entirely decisive of this controversy, a view of the case which seems to have escaped the attention of either counsel.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b251-6" data-blocks='[["BL_251.5",251,[211,1384,1177,1016]],["BL_252.1",252,[281,370,1181,905]]]'>The residuary clause is in these words : “ And as to the rest and residue of my estate, if any, I give, devise and bequeath to my said three daughters in equal shares.” And whatever doubt may have existed as to the estate of these three devisees in this lot of ground, under the prior gift in the will, is entirely removed by this clause. If, as contended by defendant’s counsel, the prior gift only vested in the daughters and devisees a life estate in this lot, with a power of disposal in the survivor, then there remained a residue thereof, undisposed of, to wit, the reversion after the expiration of the life estate, if the power should remain unexecuted, and this was clearly given to the three daughters by this residuary clause; and it cannot be successfully contended that that clause only referred to the estate of the testatrix other than what had been previously mentioned: Brown v. Boyd, <a href="/watts-serg/9/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 123" data-case-ids="12169108" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0123-01">9 W. &amp; S. 123</a>, 129 ; Harper v. Blean, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20W.%20473" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="3 W. 473">3 <em>W. </em>473</a>. In the latter case says Justice Sbrgtcant, in language peculiarly applicable to this case, “ That the last devising clause was thrown in for the express purpose of comprehending every thing which he might have previously omitted, and with the design of making his wife universal legatee and <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>devisee of all that he owned or possessed, I think is apparent; and in the construction of wills, the intent of the testator is to be carried into effect, if no rule of law be thereby infringed. It is objected that by the bequest of whatsoever was not named that he had any right to, either in law or equity, only things ejusdem generis as those previously mentioned passed, and that this clause cannot be extended to real estate. But artificial rules for the interpretation of deeds, contracts and other deliberate instruments, are not applicable to the construction of wills. On the contrary, many constructions have been given to words in a will to effectuate the intention of the testator, which would not have been permitted in a deed, and the same words have received different constructions. In modern times words not appropriate to real estate such as property, interest, effects and even legacy, have been adjudged sufficient.” It will be observed that the language of the residuary clause of Mrs. Ahl’s will is at least as apt to pass real estate as those held sufficient in the above case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b252-5" data-blocks='[["BL_252.4",252,[276,1292,1182,914]]]'>Applying the principles of this and the other above cited cases to the case in hand, it follows that whatever interest or estate in this particular lot of ground, however contingent or remote, did not pass by the first gift in the will of Mary Ahl to the three devisees therein named, must have passed to them by the residuary clause; that the fee vested in them at and immediately after the death of the testator; and by the death of the daughter, Mary, her share descended under the terms of the will to her sisters Catharine and Louisa, whose conveyance to the plaintiff was effectual to invest the fee in her. As that deed contains no reference to the power of disposal given by the will, it cannot be construed to have been made in execution of the power, for when one has both a power to sell and an interest in land, and makes a conveyance without reference to the power, it shall be deemed and taken that the land passed by virtue of his ownership, and not in execution of the power: Hay v. Mayer, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.%20203" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="8 W. 203">8 W. 203</a>; and hence the question of the premature execution of the power does not arise.</p>

But the construction must be placed upon the whole will. There is manifest a paramount intention of the testatrix to give her three daughters her whole estate, and by the residuary clause, she effectuates that intention by words sufficient to carry real estate in fee. It follows that the fee vested in the three devisees, subject to survivor-ship, and must finally and completely vest in one of the two now living. Their deed in fee simple to this plaintiff, is conclusively presumed to have been made in virtue of their ownership, and not in execution of the power of disposal granted in the will, and it conveyed to the plaintiff a fee simple in the lot of ground in controversy.</p>
