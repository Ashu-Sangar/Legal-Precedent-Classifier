    <p class="summary" id="b69-7" data-blocks='[["BL_69.6",69,[216,733,1167,1524]]]'>It is a conceded fact, that in .1852, one A. H. Ludlow acquired title to the land in suit by a treasurer’s sale of the same, for the non-payment of the unseated taxes of 1850 and 1851; and it is an undisputed fact, that by sundry conveyances, the title that Ludlow thus acquired became vested in the plaintiffs, before the cutting of the timber for which tiffs suit is brought. We say to you, that the plaintiffs were the owners of the three fourths of the land, during the time of the trespass complained of, unless such title was divested by a treasurer’s sale made to one D. 11. Mitclioll in 1868; and we further say to you, that even if the plainti ffs’ title was divested by the treasurer’s sale to Mitchell, ihey are still entitled to a verdict for the timber cut between December 6, 1882, and May 20, 1886. I repeat, that whether you do or do not find the plaintiffs’ title divested by the treasurer’s sale of 1868, you should find a verdict in the plaintiffs’ favor for the value of the timber cut between December 6,1882, and May 20, 1886. The reason for this is, that on December 6, 1882, these plaintiffs brought an action of ejectment against the defendants, and recovered, and possession was obtained by the plaintiffs on May 20, 1886, and that is conclusive of the right of the plaintiffs to recover between tliose dates. We further say, that you should also find a verdict for the plaintiffs for all the timber cut by defendants, between February 4, 1881, which was six years before the bringing of this suit, and December 6, 1882, the date of the bringing of the ejectment suit, if you find that their title was not divested by the treasurer’s sale of 1868; but if their title was divested by that sale, under tbe instruction we shall give you, then you will not allow tbe plaintiffs anything for wbat was cut between February 4, 1881, and December 6, 1882.</p>

Was the treasurer’s sale to Mitchell good to vest a title in him, is the question to which your attention is directed, because the answer to that question will determine whether you will allow the plaintiffs anything for the cutting between February 4,1881, and December 6,1882. On the part of the plaintiffs, it is claimed that such sale to Mitchell was not good, because, they say, that before the sale the taxes' on the land had been paid by Mr. Porter and Mr. Gamble through Mr. Benedict. We say to you, if you find, from the evidence, that such was the fact, then the sale to Mitchell was worthless, and the defendant’s title will not avail them, and the plaintiffs will be entitled to a verdict, not only for the cutting between December 6, 1882, and May 20, 1886, but for the cutting between February 4, 1881, and December 6,1882. What we say, in fewer words is, that if before the treasurer’s sale to Mitchell, the taxes were paid, then the sale was void.</p>

    <p id="b74-6" data-blocks='[["BL_74.5",74,[292,1265,1188,1167]]]'>But by the second section of the act of May 4, 1869, P. L. 1251, it was provided, that in case of the cutting or removal of timber trees, by one or more tenants in common, without the consent of all the co-tenants, “ the parties injured shall have every remedy in law and equity for the recovery of the said timber trees,” etc., “ and also for the recovery of damages for the cutting or removing of the same, which they now have against an entire stranger to the title.” As it cannot be doubted that an action of trespass would have been sustainable for the injury complained of, in this case, against a stranger to the title, it is plain that under the provisions of this act of assembly the plaintiffs have a right to the same remedy. If in any given case, trover, trespass, or replevin might be sustained against a stranger, the same remedy is available to a tenant in common in a like case against his co-tenant, or against any other person acting for or under him; but it does not follow, for the act of assembly does not so provide, that the recovery may be to the same extent. Indeed, it has been expressly held in Wheeler v. Carpenter, <a href="/pa/107/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="107 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="8857315" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0271-01">107 Pa. 271</a>, that the penalty provided by the act of Mareh 27, 1824, was not extended by the act of May 4, 1869, to an action by one tenant in common against his co-tenant, for unauthorized cutting and conversion of timber trees.</p>

      <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>Whether, therefore, this be treated as an action of trespass quare clausum fregit, or an action for mesne profits, compensation is the measure of the plaintiffs’ recovery; that .is to say, three fourths of the value of the timber. We are of opinion that judgment should have been entered on the verdict for single damages only.</p>
    <p id="b75-4" data-blocks='[["BL_75.4",75,[483,687,910,147]]]'>The judgment is reversed, and judgment is now entered on the verdict for $889.07, with interest from May 17, 1888, and costs.</p>
