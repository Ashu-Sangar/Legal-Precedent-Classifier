The Supreme Court affirmed us as to this being usury, but they say we erred in allowing $300 instead of $200, inasmuch as the first $100 paid, though usury, could not be set off as a payment in this judgment. But as to this, the counsel for the defendant holds that the Supreme Court were led into error by a misprint in the paper books, and now contends that he is entitled to have a credit for the $100 excluded by the Supreme Court.</p>

[Therefore, as they held that this court should have instructed the jury that the defendant was only entitled to a credit for two payments made, namely, one on January 30, 1880, and one on March 1, 1880, of $100 each, we must and now do instruct you that the defendant is only entitled to credit for the two payments of $100 each, which were made, respectively, on January 30, 1880, and on March 1, 1880 ; and that, after applying these credits to the amount appearing due after all the undisputed credits have been allowed, the plaintiff will be entitled to a verdict ■for such sum as remains unpaid, interest being computed until this day.] 1</p>
