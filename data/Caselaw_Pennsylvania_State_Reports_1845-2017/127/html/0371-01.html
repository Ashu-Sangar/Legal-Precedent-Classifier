The plaintiffs called two witnesses, whose evidence you heard, who swore that that signature is genuine; one of them testified that she saw Needham Wilson sign the very signature to that paper. [These two witnesses, Margaret Manahan and Cornelius Carman have been admitted by the court and held to be competent witnesses. They are competent witnesses.] 4 Of course, their credibility is for you, the jury. The credibility of all witnesses in every ease tried by a jury is for the jury. That is, whether they are truthful, or whether you will believe them. The two competent witnesses need not be subscribing witnesses; that is, their names need not be subscribed to the will or paper.

The belief of the jury as to Cornelius Carman being a competent witness has nothing to do with his competency. Competency means the legal fitness of a witness to be heard on the trial of a cause. It is a legal question, and the court is the sole judge of his competency. The jury has nothing to do in deciding whether he is competent. If the court think he is so interested, or in a position that he cannot testify, they will rule him out; but if they decide he is a competent witness, then that makes his testimony come before you, like that of any other witness. The court admitted Cornelius Carman as a competent witness; his testimony, however, is for the jury like any other witness; his credibility is for them to determine.8</p>

As we have already stated, competency means a legal witness, and the court is the sole judge of his or her competency. In this case the court has received him and permitted him to testify as a competent witness. The jury’s belief of his testimony cannot determine his competency. That is a duty to be discharged by the court. They may, however, or may not believe his testimony. You may or you may not believe it.

Applying this rule, how can the testimony of Car-man be received, as proving the execution of the codicil ? It is to be considered independently of Margaret Manahan’s testimony, and if insufficient of itself, nothing that she testified to can help it. The court held that Carman was competent. He may have been competent to testify, but his testimony was not competent to prove the fact he was called to establish. Carman was not only to be a competent witness, he was to be “ complete: ” Carson’s App., <a href="/pa/59/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="59 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="426951" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0493-01">59 Pa. 493</a>; and, having fallen short, the proof of execution was not up to the statutory standard, and the judgment of the court below on that point should be reversed.</p>

It is said to be sufficient if the witness has seen the party write but once, and then only his name: 1 Greenl. Ev. § 577; and probably no higher standard can be fixed for a definite rule, though, considering the untrustworthiness of opinions on handwriting in general (see note of Chief Justice Redeield to his edition of Greonleaf, vol. 1, sec 578), such evidence <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>ought to be guarded with great caution. Nor in the nature of things is it possible to fix any arbitrary limit of time within which the witness must have seen the writing done. That must depend on his intelligence, his habit of observation of such matters, the apparent strength and confidence of his memory, etc., which must be passed upon in the first instance by the trial judge. Carman’s knowledge seems not only to have been extremely stale, but of the narrowest extent, and if the learned judge had held that it was too remote and unreliable to qualify him, we should not have been disposed to disagree with him. But the matter was within his discretion, and his conclusion was, as already said, within the line of the authorities.

All of the authorities agree that this is one of the matters that do not require to be proved, but are taken judicial notice of, without evidence. “Neither is it necessary to prove.....the coincidence of days of the week with days of the month: ” 1 Greenleaf, § 5; and see Starkie on Evidence, pt. 8, sec. 20 (p. 788 of 10 Am. ed.) “ It is wholly immaterial whether the facts of public and general history, and their dates, are recognized by the court, sua sponte, the chronicles or almanacs being used merely to aid the memory; or whether they will remain unnoticed until suggested by the parties and verified by the books; or whether the books themselves are adduced by the parties as instruments of evidence; the process and the result being in each case the same: ” 3 Greenleaf, § 269.</p>

But there was an apparent contradiction, which at least required explanation, and in a case where the evidence in support of the plaintiff’s case was so meagre, it is impossible to say that even a slight doubt thrown on the testimony of the main witness, would not have turned the scale in the minds of the jury.</p>

But in this respect it was like any other argument or illustration which counsel may make towards the end of a case. If it has not been anticipated it is a surprise, and that is a risk winch parties must encounter in every case. If counsel had run the calculation back himself, so as to show that that daj^ was Sunday, no one could have questioned his right to do so. His reference to the almanac was no more than a reference to the multiplication table, as a labor saving mode of refreshing or confirming knowledge legally presumed to be in everybody’s mind. This kind of surprise is one of the dangers incident to every contest, and the only relief against it, is the discretion of the judge, where the new matter or new view may lead to substantial injustice, and is such as could not reasonably have been foreseen, to allow an opportunity of reply, or subsequently to grant a new trial.</p>
