Jennings, tlie plaintiff, is a resident of Harrisburg, Pa., and was the owner on December 1, 1887, of forty first mortgage bonds, of tbe denomination of $500 each, making $20,000, of the Coal Ridge Improvement and Coal Company, tbe defendant, a corporation of tbe state of Pennsylvania, doing business in the county of Northumberland. By the terms of these bonds, which were registered, and the mortgage securing the same, there was due the plaintiff on December 1, 1887, <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>the sum of $600, being six months interest on said bonds. The plaintiff made demand upon the company for the payment of this interest, to wit, the sum of $600, to which defendant responded by tendering to the plaintiff the sum of $570, being the interest less the sum of $30, which the defendant claimed to deduct as a tax of three mills upon the nominal value of the bonds. This tax was deducted under the provisions of an act of assembly approved June 30, 1885 [P. L. 193], entitled, “ A further supplement to an act, entitled an act to provide revenue by taxation,” approved June 7,1879.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b422-4" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[274,870,1170,595]]]'>The first section of the act of June 30, 1885, is an exact copy of the seventeenth section of the act of June 7,1879 [P. L. 112], and the first section of the act of June 10, 1881 [P. L. 99], with the exception of the omission of bank shares, which are made the subject of a separate section, the second section. Under these two sections of the acts of 1879 and 1881, it has been decided by the Supreme Court in the case of the Commonwealth v. Lehigh V. R. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=101%20Pa.%2089" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="101 Pa. 89">101 Pa. 89</a>, that the word “value ” as used in these acts meant the actual value, and not the nominal or par value, of bonds and mortgages, and that a legal ascertainment of that value was essential to the assessment of a valid tax.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b422-5" data-blocks='[["BL_422.5",422,[270,1481,1170,807]]]'>I find as a fact, that the actual value of the bonds of the Coal Ridge Improvement and Coal Company is not greater than three fourths of their par value, and that the interest on the bonds of said company of late years has been paid from the earnings of that portion of this company’s property not covered by the mortgage. I find also from the evidence that the actual value of corporation securities held by individuals differs from their nominal or par value. In some cases it is below and in other cases above par. I further find that the securities issued by foreign corporations not doing business in Pennsylvania and held by residents of Pennsylvania, and those issued by individuals and owned in Pennsylvania, are assessed at their actual value. I further find that there are a great many bonds of foreign corporations not doing business in Pennsylvania, held by residents of Pennsylvania, the actual value of many of which bonds is much below their par value.</p>
