He offered in evidence tire fact that, on May 9, 1878, about five months after the mortgage was executed by Joseph W. Cake, the Northumberland County National Bank, for the use of W. H. M. Oram, receiver, recovered a judgment for some 84,588.50 against Joseph W. Cake, the mortgagor, and that this judgment was assigned to him on March 19, 1881. He offered this in evidence, to be followed by a sale by the sheriff to him of the lots in dispute, contending that it ought to be received upon the ground that the re-formation of this mortgage did not take place until subsequent to the obtaining of this judgment by the Northumberland County National Bank and subsequently to its being assigned to him. He further contended that he had no notice at the time that this judgment was obtained, that there was an error or mistake in this mortgage. Now, gentlemen of the jury, that evidence was rejected. Whilst it is true that where there is an error in a mortgage and a mistake that would be corrected by the parties to it immediately upon discovery, yet that cannot affect an innocent judgment creditor who parted with his money without knowledge of the fact that there was a vice or a mistake in the mortgage. But in the case on hand, this mortgage was re-formed after the judgment had boon obtained, and after it had been assigned to Joseph W. Cake, Jr., and after notice was given him by this bill in equity. It is true, he was only named in that bill in equity as an heir, or a legal representative of Joseph W. Cake, the mortgagor; but, notwithstanding the fact that notice was given to him simply in that character, we are of the opinion that he had a right and that it -was Ms bounden duty, whilst this bill in equity was pending, to set up any defence he might have to the re-formation of this mortgage. He failed to do that. The result was that a decree was entered against him, which was binding upon him, and affected him with the re-formation of the mortgage, so that so far as his right under the judgment is concerned, he is to be treated with knowledge of it in the beginning. The decree stands until it is reversed, and so long as that record stands he is estopped from disputing it.] 5</p>

The mortgage being the prior lien upon the lots in Caketown, it was the duty of a subsequent incumbrancer before he parted with his money to go upon the ground and examine for himself the description of the lots given in the mortgage. Had this been done, it would have been seen from the adjoiners called for in the mortgage, and the description of the buildings called for, twelve two and one half story frame dwelling houses with slate and metal roofs, with one story brick kitchen attached, that they were located in block No. 7, and that neither the building on block No. 17, nor the adjoiners, would answer the description in the mortgage.

The sale under the mortgage passed a good title to the plaintiffs for the premises in dispute. It is true there was an admitted error in the description of the property as contained in the mortgage. It describes the lots in question as part of block No. 17, when in point of fact they formed a portion of block No. 7. This error was not discovered until after <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>a scire facias had been issued on the mortgage. A bill in equity was then filed to re-form that instrument. Notice of this proceeding was given to the administrator and heirs of the deceased mortgagor, and a decree was finally made re-forming the mortgage to the extent of altering the description contained therein, so far as the number of the block was concerned. It was changed from block No. 17 to block No. 7 to conform to the facts. Upon the mortgage so amended a sale was subseqirently made by the sheriff and the title thus acquired was held by the plaintiffs below at the time of trial.</p>
    <p id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[216,866,1172,1164]]]'>Prior to the decree of re-formation, J. W. Cake, Jr., defendant below, became the owner of a judgment recovered against the mortgaged premises. He was also an heir and was a party to the bill. He now alleges that even if he was bound by the decree as an heir, he is not bound as a judgment creditor; that notice to him in the one capacity does not bind him in the other. This distinction is somewhat refined. We need not discuss it, however, as we regard the mortgage as perfectly good without any re-formation. The misdescription of the block could have misled no one. The property was described as lots 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 in block No. 17, fronting on Susquehanna avenue, each 25 feet in width, and extending west each of that width, 150 feet to Fort Augusta avenue, upon which said lots are erected twelve two and a half story frame dwelling houses, etc., etc. All of this description is accurate excepting the number of the block, which, as before stated, was No. 7 instead of 17. Lots Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 in block No. 17 iron t on Railroad avenue, and run back to an alley not named on the plan. How this error could have deceived any one, least of all, J. W. Cake, one of the heirs, who knew all about it, and. had resided within three squares of this block for years, passes comprehension. It is not necessary to consider the assignments in detail.</p>
