G. Morrison, in which they claim to recover the sum of $200, with interest from March 4, 1871, to the present time. This claim is based upon a note, bearing date March 4, 1871, and is, by its terms, due, and is under seal. This makes out the case of the plaintiffs, and it is incumbent upon the defendant to satisfy you that the note is paid, or settled in some way, or that it is not a legitimate demand.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b54-5" data-blocks='[["BL_54.4",54,[217,765,1181,704]]]'>The claim of the defendant is based in part upon the testimony of Mr. Clark. It would seem from the evidence, that the defendant, Mr. Morrison, and the deceased, Mr. Reed, had numerous and somewhat extensive business dealings with each other. Mr. Clark testifies that he was employed as book-keeper for Mr. Reed; that along in 1877 he was required to make out a statement embracing some business matters and some old affairs, as he expressed it, between these parties; that he made out such a statement, running back four, five or six years, I don’t remember just how long, and that when Mr. Reed and the defendant were present at one time, Mr. Reed recognized this statement as being correct, and according to the testimony of the witness it would show that $200 to $250 was due the defendant, Morrison.</p>

We say to you that the plaintiffs are correct in this. The evidence of Mr. Clark, as to the balance due from Mr. Reed to Mr. Morrison in 1877, does not avail the defendant, except in so far as it tends to satisfy you that this note has in fact been paid. What we mean is, that the balance as stated by Mr. Clark, if it existed, cannot be used as an offset, because more than six years has elapsed, and the statute of limitations applies to the offset just the same as it does to the claim. Hence, we say that the balance would not avail the defendant except in so far as it tends to satisfy you that the note in suit was in fact paid. There is no evidence of any agreement between Mr. Reed and Mr. Morrison applying the balance testified to by Mr. Clark, on the note in <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>suit. [There is no direct evidence that this note was included in any looking over between Mr. Reed and Mr. Morrison. Mr. Clark testifies to making out the statement of the account, showing from $200 to $250 due Mr. Morrison, and in substance that Mr. Reed recognized the statement to be correct. Does this satisfy you either that the note was taken into the account when that balance was arrived at, or that the note had been previously paid? This is a question of fact for you, and an item of evidence for you to consider.] 4</p>

But it is the business of the defendant to satisfy you, by evidence, that the note in suit has been paid, and if he has not done so, your verdict should be for the plaintiffs. Bear in mind that it is incumbent upon the defendant to overcome the presumption of non-payment that arises from the production by the plaintiffs of the note itself.] 3</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b55-6" data-blocks='[["BL_55.5",55,[216,1224,1174,708]]]'>Further, as showing payment, or an item tending in that direction, evidence is given of some business transactions between these parties, Mr. Reed and Mr. Morrison, in 1872, in which Mr. Reed in two instances certifies, first, in substance, that Mr. Morrison had put down a well for him, as agent, on the McIntyre farm in Forest county, Pa., and expended $8,840 in purchasing engine, boiler, tubing, casing and other fixtures, including drilling, etc., to his entire satisfaction. That is signed by Mr. Reed, and another of like import amounting to some $1,725. Now, from these business transactions, counsel for defendant ask you to infer that inasmuch as there were these large business transactions between these parties subsequent to the giving of this note, that it is an item you may consider in determining whether the note is in fact paid.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b55-7" data-blocks='[["BL_55.6",55,[211,1941,1172,503]]]'>Another item of evidence the defendant gives, which you should consider for just what it is worth, is a letter written from Mr. Reed to Mr. Morrison before this note was given. It was December 24, 1870, and in that letter Mr. Reed says: “In regard to furnishing you the $200, I have no objections, if you can let it stand in compensation for services rendered and to be.” From that he asks you to say that the $200 that is embraced in this note was money furnished on the terms stated in that letter. That is a question for you to consider, and the weight it should have in the matter, if any.</p>

The Doctor states the conversation, and where it was, and you are to determine the weight that shall be given to his testimony. He says that he saw Mr. Reed, and they had some conversation in regard to litigation; that Mr. Reed said he had had a long litigation with Mr. Morrison, and that all business matters between him and Morrison had been settled up, and that he was glad of it. That is an item for you to take into account in determining whether this note was settled and arranged between the parties.</p>

If the jury believe from the evidence that about five years after this note was made, there appears to be due to the defendant from William Reed, a sum equal to or greater than the face of the note, they may infer from that fact, together with the other facts in the case, in view of the length of time from the making of the note to the time of bringing suit, that the note in controversy has been paid.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b56-7" data-blocks='[["BL_56.6",56,[266,1335,1171,394]]]'>Answer: We answer this point by saying, that if the jury are satisfied from the evidence, that about five years after the note in suit was made there was due from Wm.

At least this is the general rule. There are cases which intimate that a presumption of payment may arise in less than twenty years ; that is to say, there may be such circumstances surrounding a case as would justify a jury in finding the fact of payment within the twenty years. Thus, if it be proved that the holder of the note has been constantly pressed for money, while the maker was abundantly able to pay, such fact, with other circumstances, might justify the presumption of payment. The single circumstance that the defendant was able to pay, would not be a fact from which this presumption would arise in less than twenty years. For, if the defendant is able to pay, the plaintiff may be able and willing to wait, and within the twenty years the burden is upon the defendant to prove payment, or such facts or circumstances from which the jury may properly infer payment. An examination of the case shows that the rulings of the learned judge below were quite as favorable to the defendant as he had any right to expect.</p>
