The alleged falsity of the statement turns wholly upon the construction to be placed on the words in clause 2 of the statement relating to the capital, viz.: “ payable in lawful money upon the execution hereof.” It is alleged that with this clause in the statement, the actual non-payment of the capital at the time it was recorded, made the statement false, and the whole <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>proceeding or attempt under the act of 1874 a nullity so far as that act is concerned, and constituted the joint stock company, ever after that, a general partnership. On the other hand, it is asserted that there is no false statement; that the true and natural meaning of the words in law is, that the language fixed a time when the capital was due, and payment could be enforced both as among the subscribers and with creditors.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b173-5" data-blocks='[["BL_173.4",173,[261,686,1170,1374]]]'>Before we proceed to a consideration of the act itself, which is involved in the range the argument has taken, we first construe the clause in question. It will be observed that section 2 states that “ the total amount of the capital of said association is §25,000, payable in lawful money upon the execution hereof.” In section 3 each member “subscribes for eight thousand ” (or his amount) “ dollars,” and the evidence shows the statement filed is the subscription. The act does not require a payment at the time of subscribing; it requires a “subscribing and contributing” capital at some time. It leaves the matter of “ when and how ” the capital shall bo “ paid ” to be fixed in the statement filed. It makes provision for the collecting of unpaid subscriptions on the basis of the integrity of the organization, as an organization, in § 2 of the act. Such being the case, we apprehend, that no other construction is to be put upon the words “payable on the execution hereof,” than would be put upon the same words in articles of agreement, or a mortgage, or deed. It was never understood in an agreement or deed that “payable on the execution hereof” signified that the amount was actually paid by such execution, or was an acquittance to the vendee or grantee of such payment. It has no other significance than that the sum is “to be paid” on that event or day, and is no evidence of a fact accomplished. The statute requires that it shall be stated when the capital is “to be paid,” nor does the word “payable ” stand in any sense equivalent to “ paid.” Its legal meaning is that the amount becomes thereby due and its payment can be enforced.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b173-6" data-blocks='[["BL_173.5",173,[260,2069,1168,300]],["BL_174.1",174,[232,341,1185,608]]]'>We can see no falsehood practiced on any person by the recording of the certificate without the payment of the money. Ordinarily the execution of an instrument of writing signifies the whole act by which the instrument becomes of force, its signature and delivery, or if a recording is essential to its existence and validity, also its being recorded. Be this as it may, <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>in this case the act of assembly does not contemplate that the statement filed is evidence of when or how much of the capital stock is actually paid. That must be ascertained by the book or books kept by the association which are required for that purpose. One of the reasons, undoubtedly, why the law did not require the subscriptions to be paid up, in order to make the association valid, was that the capital might not be needed at once. No wrong would thereby be done to creditors, because they could ascertain how much was paid. In the case at ■bar, payment by Strong was made before the plaintiffs sold any goods to the association, and before, so far as this case appears, any business was transacted.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b174-5" data-blocks='[["BL_174.4",174,[230,958,1185,1329]]]'>It may be assumed without question that when all the requisites of the act of 1874 are complied with, and the statement contains truthfully those requisites, that a joint stock company with limited liability is formed, and that general liability is not incurred except under the provisions of the statute. This the statute expressly provides for. These requisites are, (1) that three or more persons shall sign and acknowledge duly a statement in writing; (2) which shall set forth the full names of such persons; (3) the amount of capital of such association subscribed for by each; (4) the total amount of capital and when and how to be paid; (5) the character of the business to be conducted, and the location of the same; (6) the name of the association with the word “ limited ” added thereto, as part of the same; (7) the contemplated duration of said association, which shall not exceed in any case twenty years; (8) the names of the officers selected in conformity with the provisions of the act. All these requisites are literally and strictly fulfilled in this charter. The statement is duly signed and acknowledged by three persons, their full names are set out, the amount of the capital is $25,000. Stetler subscribes for $8,000, Fuller, $8,000, and Archbald, $9,000. The capital is payable on the execution thereof, the business is clearly stated, the name is The Amity Coal Company, Limited, its business is to be conducted in the township of Lackawanna, in the county of Lackawanna, Pennsylvania, its duration is twenty years, and its officers are the three persons who form the association.</p>

The associations organized under the act of 1874 are an entirely distinct class of, organized bodies. This is stated in the elementary works on partnership, and the decisions of our own courts. A limited liability is attempted to be secured to all the members and it is secured by fair, explicit and strict provisions, and in a way which when complied with not only protects the members, but protects all creditors who choose to avail themselves of the knowledge which the law and the books of the association give them of such associations. When the members are within the protection of the act, then it should be held as a shield to them, and creditors and members should be required to conform to the act in seeking these remedies at law. We have seen that this organization in its inception did comply with the act of assembly. The plaintiff, however, in commencing this action assumed, on the mere fact of non-payment of their subscriptions by Stetler, Fuller and Archbald, at the time stipulated and before the statement was recorded, that the whole organization was absolutely void as a limited liability association, both as regards themselves and Strong, who came in subsequently. The act itself pointed out clearly and equitably to all parties concerned, their mode of procedure for non-payment of the capital stock or subscription. They could have sued the association, recovered their verdict and judgment, and then on motion and a rule in case they failed against the association, they could have had their execution against the individuals for the non-payment of subscriptions or any part remaining unpaid. Their whole assumption, in this part of their case, rests on the false foundation that the mere non-payment of the subscription at the time stipulated, avoided the association and made a general partnership. This false foundation giving way, their whole superstructure falls with it. It is true that an attempt to form such a joint stock company, or a corporation, which contains a fatal defect, would avoid all proceedings under it and make the stockholders or members general partners ; it is also true that when a special or limited liability is set up as a defence, that the statute must be strictly followed which creates the limited liability; but when virtue is once given to an organization under the statute, and its integrity is untainted by technical or formal defects, <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>then the limited liability is secured and remains, unless it is lost by a subsequent violation contemplated by the law itself. This general doctrine of special partnerships is clearly and emphatically laid down as a part of this act of 1874, and we shall discover by.an examination of the cases that so far as this act has come under construction by our higher court, the remedies have been pursued under the act of 1874, in every case where there was a substantial compliance in the organization.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b176-5" data-blocks='[["BL_176.4",176,[259,738,1183,905]]]'>' This plaintiff sues the individual partners in the first instance. Section 2 of the act, expressly provides that “the members shall not be liable under any judgment, decree or order which shall be obtained against such association, or for any debt or engagement of such company, further or otherwise than is hereinafter provided.” What is further or otherwise-provided? 1. The collection of the unpaid subscriptions, to the extent of the portions respectively not paid up, and provision is made for the execution. And in order that the extent of the unpaid subscriptions may be ascertained, the court has full power to compel the production of books. And a “ subscription list book ” is required to be kept, of which we shall have something further to say. 2. The omission of the word “limited” makes each member participant in such omission liable personally. Section 3, act of May 1, 1876, P. L. 89, which is supplementary to the original act, and now part of it, provides that such association shall be sued in its association name.</p>

No action can be maintained against the stockholders in the first instance, one or all; it not only is not provided for, but it thoroughly ousts the legal remedy provided. It also conflicts with the equity of that legal remedy, because the members may have paid in in unequal proportions. In the present action the evidence shows a full payment of stock by Strong, a large payment by Stetler, and possibly up to a certain date, <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>none by the two others. A verdict and judgment in this action would be against Strong for the whole debt as well as against Stetler.

The purpose (“for that purpose”) for which that book is to be kept is to aid the court to ascertain the truth in regard to the unpaid subscriptions. It was assumed on the argument by counsel that that book meant an original subscription by sign manual; the term does not so signify. From the evidence, Fuller testified that they considered their original subscription in connection with the stock Ledger, which he said “ showed the transaction,” made a subscription list book. From it he gave the whole data of subscribers’ stock and payments. The book was not formally put in evidence and we have its character only from Fuller’s testimony. We do not say that a separate book, perhaps made out by the secretary, and styled technically “ a subscription list book,” would not be the best mode of meeting this requirement, but the plaintiff has not clearly shown that this provision was not substantially complied with. Even if the other members were deficient in this respect, Strong is in no way chargeable with such neglect.</p>

Kone of the $25,000 capital had been subscribed for, and starting, as the defendants did, without any subscription, they gave their association a name but no location. The statement was false, because in their preliminary arrangements, $1,000 of the contemplated capital had been allotted to a Mr. Davis; Mr. Davis had not subscribed for it, and did not even sign the articles or statement, which is now treated as the subscription list; and not a dollar of the capital was paid in at the time of the execution of the statement, nor until the purchase of the stock by Mr. Strong.</p>

They claim the immunity from liability as individuals which the act of 1874 confers on persons associating themselves in a joint stock or limited partnership association, alleging that they have fully complied with its provisions. This is the question on which the plaintiffs’ right to recover depends. The court below held that the organization of the Amity Coal Company, Limited, had been in full compliance with the provisions of the statute, and that <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>the only remedy of the plaintiffs was by action against the association and then against the stockholders severally for the amount unpaid upon their stock subscriptions.

To the end that the subscribers may be protected and their liability kept within the prescribed limits, no execution can issue against them until an order has been made by the court in which the judgment is entered, or a law judge thereof, on notice to the person to be affected, and after full hearing, fixing the amount due upon his subscription and awarding the writ. In order that this question may be disposed of correctly, the act requires every such association to keep a “subscription list book” that may be produced in court, and that shall be “open to inspection by the creditors and members of the association at all reasonable times.”</p>

This statement set out the following facts for the information of the public: “ The amount of the capital stock of said association is twenty-five thousand dollars payable in lawful money on the execution hereof.” The persons subscribing to the stock and the amount subscribed by each was stated as follows: “ The said Samuel N. Stetler subscribes for eight thousand dollars, said Edward <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>L. Fuller subscribes .for eight thousand dollars, and the said Robert W. Archbald subscribes for nine thousand dollars.” The business to be done by the association is stated to be “the owning and leasing of mines and coal lands, and the mining, preparing, shipping, buying, and marketing of anthracite coal, together with all matters incident thereto.” This statement followed the act of assembly, and as to its form was entirely regular, but the proofs show that not one dollar was paid by either of the subscribers to the stock. It was nevertheless recorded, and the Amity Coal Company, Limited, entered upon its business career without a farthing in its treasury or an article of property in the world. This was not a compliance in good faith with the requirements of the act of 1874. The purpose of that act was to foster legitimate and honest undertakings where capital was “ subscribed and contributed ” by persons desiring to engage in business, and not to bring into life a brood of associations without capital, without a treasury, and possibly without a solvent subscriber. But this association was not merely an empty shell, for its statement was misleading and deceptive. It provided for a capital of §25,000, which was made payable on the execution of the statement. It was subscribed and acknowledged and then regularly recorded, without the payment of a dollar of the subscribed capital. The only source of information, besides the statement which the law provides for, is the “ subscription list book ” which all such associations are required to keep, but which this one never opened. The fair import of the language of the statement that the subscribed capital was payable “ on the execution hereof,” is that it was to be paid down; and the subsequent recording of the statement is an assertion that the subscribers-have performed their promise and paid their subscriptions into the treasury. To enter upon business with the credit which the possession of a paid-up capital of §25,000 would give the association, when in fact nothing had been paid, either in money or property, was an evasion of the law and a fraud upon the public.</p>

The act provides for the protection from personal liability of those who “subscribe and contribute ” a capital to be employed in any lawful business. The “capital” is staked upon the success of the business, but because the amount of the capital appears upon the statement on record and the “subscription list book ” on the desk of the association, all who have occasion to deal with it may know the amount of actual capital within reach, and determine to what extent the association is entitled to credit. But persons who subscribe yet never contribute, and who, by failing to keep a “ subscription list book,” withhold from the public all means of knowing the truth, cannot be within the protection of the act. They really put nothing into the enterprise except the credit of a capital that is actually withheld. They mislead the public and induce confidence to which they are not entitled. In other words, the credit they obtain rests not upon a subscribed and contributed capital, but upon a fraudulent appearance of sucb capital in tbeir statement.</p>

The act of 1874 contemplates the possibility of unpaid balances and provides a, method by which creditors may reach tliem; but we do hold that an association lias no right to enter upon business until some part of tbe subscribed capital has been actually paid. The statement should show when and in what amounts the subscriptions are to be paid, and the subscription list book should thereafter show tbe payment or the failure to pay tbe instalments falling due after tbe recording of the statement, so that members and creditors may see at any time the exact situation of the association. These are the terms upon which the statute promises individual immunity from the debts of tbe concern, and they must be complied with fairly and honestly.

The organization took place on June 18, 1883. On the 17th of November following, Mr. Strong purchased ten shares and paid one thousand dollars, their par value, into the treasury. He did not purchase from one of the subscribers who held the entire stock, and pay to him for his shares, but he paid to the treasurer. He had notice therefore that the stock then issued to him had never been paid for. If he had made inquiry, as he was bound to do, into the manner in which the association had been organized, and whether the act of 1874 had been complied with in good faith, he would have learned the facts; and he is chargeable with notice of all that such an inquiry would have disclosed. He then had notice in law, if not in fact, that not one dollar had ever been paid by the subscribers, either at the execution of the statement or at any intermediate date, and that the association was without money or property with which to conduct business or pay .its liabilities. With this notice he purchased an interest in the association and subsequently became one of its managers.</p>

Thenceforward the promoters cease to act as individuals or as partners in the common business, but through and in the name and upon the credit of the joint stock association.

In the case of joint stock associations, the members are trusted by the law to certify directly to the public without the intervening agency of the governor, and thus to give life to their own creature. Under such circumstances the courts should require absolute good faith and an honest compliance with the law from those who claim exemption from individual liability as members of a joint stock association. If no capital has "been put into the concern, no actual cash with which to begin business, it has no right to begin business. The subscribers have no right to record the certificate, and to do so is a fraud upon the law and a fraud upon the public. We do not say that the entire capital must be paid down.

    <p id="b187-6" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[235,1100,1182,959]]]'>Turning now to the facts of this case, they seem to leave us no alternative under the salutary rule laid down. This certificate when prepared put the capital stock at twenty-five thousand dollars. It gave the names of the subscribers and tbe amount of stock subscribed by each. In obedience to the statutory requirement to state when and how the subscribed stock was to be paid, it stated, “to be paid on the execution hereof.” Now the first thing to he done was to execute the certificate. After that was done, it was to be acknowledged as an assurance of its truth; then it was to be recorded as the certificate of those signing it, made to tbe public, that its provisions bad been complied with. The recording of tbe certificate was therefore a distinct affirmance that tbe capital to be paid on its execution had been paid, and that the association was entitled to the credit which its capital should command. The fact was, however, that neither of the stockholders paid one cent on the execution of the certificate, nor at its acknowledgment, nor when it was recorded, nor yet when they began business in the name of the association.</p>
    <p id="b187-7" data-blocks='[["BL_187.6",187,[235,2078,1174,147]]]'>It is useless to argue that such conduct is a compliance with the requirements of the act. It is a palpable disregard of the act of 1874, and of the requirements of business bonesfcy.</p>
    <p id="b187-8" data-blocks='[["BL_187.7",187,[234,2231,1172,199]],["BL_188.1",188,[278,377,1187,610]]]'>We speak of tbe facts as they appear upon this record. The case goes back for a new trial. If upon sucb trial, with attention directed to this point, a different showing is made and the facts necessary to a legal organization are made to appear, <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>the ease may be taken out from the operation of the rule ; but, on the facts before us, we hold that the subscribers to the stock in this association, by reason of their disregard of the law under which they attempted to organize, acquired no rights under it, but became liable as general partners for all the debts contracted in the name of the association. Nor do we see our way clear to relieve one who bought an interest in the concern months afterward and honestly put his money into its business. Like one buying into an ordinary mercantile partnership, he was bound to inquire into the organization and condition of the concern in which he was about to invest his money.</p>
