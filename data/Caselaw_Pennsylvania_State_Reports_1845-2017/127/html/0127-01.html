After unsuccessful proceedings by bill in equity to enforce an alleged family arrangement and disposition of the property, partition proceedings were instituted in the Orphans’ Court, wherein the real estate of the decedent was divided, accepted at the valuation by certain heirs entitled, and awarded to them by formal decrees, upon their entering into recognizances conditioned to pay the costs of partition and the amount of owelty due to Thomas S. Lewis, to whom no award of land was made. Thereupon, one of the acceptors came into court and filed a petition setting forth that Thomas S. Lewis, in the lifetime of his father, had been advanced by the latter in the purchase of two parcels of real estate. One of these parcels was known as the Kelly farm which, as was alleged, had been purchased by John L. Lewis in his lifetime for $6,594, all of the purchase money being paid by him, except $1,800 remaining as a dower principal for the protection of the widow of Joseph Kelly, deceased, and the deed made to Thomas S. Lewis.</p>

Thomas Lewis was desirous of having it and asked his father to buy it for him, giving as a reason that it had good timber on it, and a saw mill on which more could be made than on the farm. He talked also of leaving him if he did not get it. Father told him and I to go out and bid on it, not to bid too high. We went out and attended the sale <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>and bid it in for $31.40 per acre. We thought we had a bargain.” In the present audit he testifies: “ When the Kelly farm was purchased I was along. Thomas S. Lewis was with me. I had orders and instructions from John L. Lewis as to that purchase. The instructions were to both Thomas S. and myself. He told us to go out and bid, but not to go too high. Thomas did the bidding; we consulted together. There were a number of bids. We finally went to $31.40 per acre. We bought it for John L. Lewis. John L. Lewis paid for it. The deed was made to Thomas S. Lewis.” On cross examination,, he states that he was present once at James F. Linn’s office when John L. Lewis made a large payment of the purchase money of the farm.</p>

Lewis was the purchaser, his. son and son-in-law were at the sale and gave in the name of John L. Lewis as the purchaser......The deed was made to his son Tommy and John L. Lewis paid the money.” He also states that all the purchase money that was paid was paid to him in the office of James F. Linn, Esq., and that it was all paid except the dower. Speaking of the payment of $2,000, by John L. Lewis, at James F. Linn’s office, he says that Mr. Thomas S. Lewis was present; “I don’t know where Mr. Lewis said he had got that money, but I understood him that he had sold property up in Centre county, and had got the money there.”</p>

Nor does the auditor understand that it is essential to constitute an advancement in land, where the title is taken in the name of the son, that the whole amount of the purchase money must necessarily be paid by the parent.
