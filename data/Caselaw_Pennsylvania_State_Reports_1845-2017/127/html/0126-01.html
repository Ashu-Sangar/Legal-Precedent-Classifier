James, against George Noaker and Catharine Noaker. On March 20, 1886, the defendants filed an affidavit of defence and afterward a supplemental affidavit of defence, the two setting out in many pages a complicated series of facts and accounts claimed to affect their liability on said mortgage. The plaintiff entered a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, which rule after argument was discharged, the court, Bucher, P. J., filing no opinion. Thereupon the plaintiff took this writ, assigning as error the order discharging the rule for judgment.</p>
