      <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>Upon the controversy thus arising the auditor reported as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b435-4" data-blocks='[["BL_435.4",435,[212,458,1169,610]]]'>On April 1, 1873, Susan King, W. C. King, S. S. King and M. Edgar King, widow and heirs of Kobt. S. King, deceased, executed a judgment bond to W. C. King in the sum of $1,500, which bond was entered in the Common Pleas of Perry county, on April 12, 1873, to No. 314 January Term 1873, and on November 14, 1873, for a valuable consideration, W. C. King, by his attorney, assigned, transferred and set over the said judgment to the Susquehanna Building Association, who revived the same to their use by amicable scire facias against all the above-named defendants on April 8, 1878, to No. 532 January Term 1878, and also by a subsequent revival by scire facias, issued April 5, 1883, to No. 62 April Term 1883.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b435-5" data-blocks='[["BL_435.5",435,[212,1074,1169,1323]],["BL_436.1",436,[256,363,1177,401]]]'>There is no evidence to show that this judgment against W. C. King and others was not a good and valid judgment at the time it was entered; consequently, had an execution been issued thereon at that time, although W. C. King was legal plaintiff, as well as one of the defendants, the same could have been collected, except the proportionate share for which King himself was liable. As where several persons sign a bond payable to one of their number, it cannot be enforced as a joint promise against all the signers, but where such bond is transferred to a third person it immediately becomes operative as a valid contract from the date of the transfer, and may be enforced by a joint action against all the makers: Byles on Bills, 76. Where, however, parties have contrived by judgment to defeat the rights of a third person, such judgment is not a bar against the claim of the party sought to be defrauded. But fraud is not alleged in this case; the technical ground alone, that W. C. King is both legal plaintiff and defendant, consequently no lien attaches, and that any assignee of the judgment could hold no higher position, or acquire other rights than those possessed by the assignor. This, in the opinion of your auditor, is partly true. Had the judgment of W. A. Sponsler been entered prior to November 14, 1873, the date of the assignment of the judgment, the principle of equity would then have prevailed ; the legal plaintiff could not hold the lien against his property to the prejudice of a third person, and on distribution the fund would have been applied to his judgment, although the <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>same was not first of lien. Now, applying the principle as laid down in Byles on Bills, above referred to, immediately after the transfer or assignment by W. C. King to the building association, he, W. C. King himself, becomes liable and his real estate would be bound by the lien of the judgment, the same being of record where subsequent creditors were bound to take notice of it, and therefore could not be misled. See also Johnson v. McCurdy, <a href="/pa/83/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="83 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="1050815" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0282-01">83 Pa. 282</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b436-5" data-blocks='[["BL_436.4",436,[251,772,1178,707]]]'>Another answer also appears to your auditor most formidable, which was urged by counsel for the building association, viz.: The Susquehanna Building Association twice revived their judgment for their use against W. C. King and others; the first time by amicable scire facias, on April 8,1878, while the judgment of W. A. Sponsler was not entered until November 10, 1880. The effect of this revival was to continue the lien and vest the title and control of the judgment in the equitable plaintiff against all the defendants, W. C. King himself signing with the other defendants. The language of the amicable scire facias itself is, “with full costs of suit, release of all errors, etc., and to have the same effect as if a writ of scire facias had been regularly issued, served on us, and judgment obtained thereon according to law.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b436-6" data-blocks='[["BL_436.5",436,[246,1487,1177,707]]]'>What is the effect of this amicable scire facias ? In Buehler v. Buffington, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20293" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="43 Pa. 293">43 Pa. 293</a>, Justice Lowrie uses the following language: “ Nor can we regard the judgment as invalid, though it was on a scire facias post annum et diem, on a previous judgment that was void. If we could find no previous record at all, the new judgment would not be void on that account, though it might be reversible for irregularity in its own process, but having no valid judgment to rest on, it must be treated as <em>A </em>new judgment.” In Ramsey v. Linn, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20R.%20228" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 R. 228">2 R. 228</a>, Justice Todd says: “A confession of judgment in every amicable action admits the issuing of a writ, though, in fact, no such writ ever issued.” Therefore, a judgment regularly revived by amicable scire facias, is not void, though the original judgment itself is void.</p>

C. King had title to the undivided one third only of the real estate in question, upon which one third interest said revived judgment was the first lien; that title to the remaining two thirds of said real estate was acquired by him eighteen days after said revival, and that prior to the second revival of said judgment the judgment of Sponsler was entered, and thus became the first lien on said undivided two thirds interest. The one third of the fund arising from the real estate was accordingly appropriated by the auditor to the judgment of the building association, and the other two thirds to that of W. A. Sponsler.</p>

King confessed judgment to W. O. King on April 1, 1873, was contracted by the father with the son prior to the father’s death. Wm. C. King undoubtedly became one of the defendants because ho believed it necessary to have the judgment entered against all the heirs. It is absurd to suppose that he intended to incumber his separate real estate, acquired by his own labor, to secure payment of a debt duo him from <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>his deceased father. His appearing as a nominal defendant is of no concern, for the reason that on the entry of the judgment for the purpose of lien against the real estate of which he was part owner in fee, his liability as defendant immediately merged in his fee, and the lien of the judgment became, as against him and his property, extinct in law: Koons v. Hartman, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20W.%2025" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="7 W. 25">7 W. 25</a> ; Moore v.

The rule is clear that there must be an intention, at the time the incumbrance is placed, that it shall not merge; that when this intention is not shown, it will be presumed, if advantage is likely to accrue from maintaining, or disadvantage to follow from discharging the incumbrance ; but, if it is indifferent to the party whether the incumbrance remains or not, it invariably merges in the fee and becomes extinct beyond the possibility of resuscitation : Pennington v. Coats, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Whart.%20283" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="6 Whart. 283">6 Wh. 283</a> ; Richards v.

King, the assignment to the building association could not revive it: Koons v. Hartman, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20W.%2025" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="7 W. 25">7 W. 25</a>. An assignee of a chose in action takes subject to equities affecting the original holder: Hendrickson’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=24%20Pa.%20365" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="24 Pa. 365">24 Pa. 365</a>. A fortiori, on the assignment of a judgment the lien of which is extinct in whole or in part, it remains extinct to the same extent after the assignment as before. Nor should the fact that W. C. King joined with the other defendants in signing the amicable scire facias to No. 532 January Term 1878, alter this case. The judgment was what ■might be termed a class judgment, entered against the heirs of Robert S. King to secure a lien on the decedent’s real estate, ■and the revival changed its status not a whit. W. C. King was still the legal plaintiff and it was still merged in his fee, giving no lien on his real estate. The marking of the revival to the use of the association gave it only such rights as the legal plaintiff had had. The authorities cited by the auditor are not applicable, as they all refer to cases where the plaintiff and defendant in the judgment were two different persons. If the association had revived the judgment in its own name, leaving out the name of <em>W. </em>C. King as legal plaintiff, as it <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>had the right to do under Reed’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Pa.%2066" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="7 Pa. 66">7 Pá. 66</a>, a different ease might have been presented.
