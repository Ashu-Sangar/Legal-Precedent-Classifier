Subsequently, Benjamin Reichenbach borrowed $269.70 more from Leighou and therewith paid to Stevens &amp; Son the balance on tbeir first note dne April 1, 1887. To secure ibis second loan, Benjamin Reichenbach gave another judgment note to Leighou, with the same surety, and the same day, May 2, 1887, judgment was entered thereon, a fieri facias issued to No. 4 September Term 1887, and placed in the sheriff’s hands. Under these two writs the sheriff made and returned a levy upon numerous articles of personalty, including the thrashing machino, traction engine and water tank, as the property of Ben. Reichenbach. At the sale of the property thus levied upon, on May 28,1887, W. H. Leighou became the purchaser of the thrasher, engine and tank.</p>

Enterline, the plaintiffs, in this issue. Subsequently, Stevens &amp; Son issued execution on their judgments and directed the sheriff to make a levy on the thrashing machine, engine and tank, in the hands of Diehl and Enterline. They contended on the trial of the issue that the note of November IT, 1887, for $624.50 was void for want of consideration; that Leighou, who was a party to the transaction, had no title through the first sale and acquired none by the second, and having no title could pass none to Diehl and Enterline; that the intention was to defraud Stevens &amp; Son, who had a legal right to a levy and sale of the property they had sold, and for which they had not been paid.</p>

Reichenbach &amp; Son, for firm purposes, that is, to pay off a firm debt, and it was afterwards discovered that the sale upon those two judgments was void and passed no title to the plaintiff, William H. Leighou, and that in consideration of that matter Benjamin Reichenbach and John A. Reichenbach, the two members of the firm, which firm had received the benefit of Leighou’s money, agreed then to give Leighou another judgment for the amount that he had advanced with interest and costs, I can see no reason why such judgment would not be a good and valid judgment. The first two judgments were satisfied, of course, by the sheriff’s sale, whether Leighou got a good title to the property that he purchased or not. But I cannot see any reason why, if he got no title, common honesty and morality would prevent the two Reichenbachs from afterwards <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>giving another judgment to Leighou, so as to enable him to make himself whole for the money that he had advanced for the benefit of the firm. And, if you find these were the facts, we say to you that the consideration of judgment No. 37 February Term 1888, for $624.50 was sufficient. Then if you find from the evidence that that was a fair and honest judgment, that there was no fraud in its execution and the giving of the judgment by the two .Reiehenbachs to Leighou, then the sale made under the fieri facias issued upon it to No. 8 February Term 1888, passed a good title to Leighou for the property that was sold to him by the sheriff.</p>

Leighou v. Benjamin Reichenbach and Jacob Probst, operated as a satisfaction of the judgments on which the executions were issued. This was so at law, but not necessarily so in equity. It was believed by both the parties to the transaction, that the sheriff’s sale was an abortive proceeding, and that the plaintiff who bought the property took no title. He had not received any actual satisfaction for his debt. To remedy this difficulty, the defendants in the judgment confessed the $624.50 judgment, which was for the same debt, and under it an execution was issued, and the same property again levied upon and sold to the plaintiff. His title was thus perfected. We see nothing objectionable in this. There was no fraud upon other creditors. It appears to have been done in entire good faith and for the sole purpose of perfecting a title sup<a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>posed to be bad.
