The question of fact, important for you to decide and ascertain <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>is, whether there was such abuse. That depends upon what conclusion can be drawn from the fact of the entering of this judgment note or the entering up of a judgment upon the note.] 3 That is a matter, not of law, but of business practice, and one therefore which falls within your domain rather than within mine. It might well be that the entering of a judgment note against a man, so far as his credit is concerned, would have an effect upon his business credit, so as to cause damage to him; and it might well be that the entering up of a judgment note would not affect a man’s credit at all. It might be that the entering up of a judgment would be fatal to the credit of one man, and would not affect the credit of another man.

That point is for you to consider.]4 And in considering it, you must consider the second point, which is, what is the meaning of the word “ embarrassed,” or “ embarrassment,” in connection with a man’s business or his credit ? In considering that word you are to take it in its ordinary sense, as men ordinarily intelligent would use such a word. You must ask yourselves, how would I describe, or in what condition would I understand a man to be, who is described as embarrassed ? I take it to be, and I am simply expressing my own opinion, not binding you, that a man who needs money for the purposes of his business, and is not able to get it without some difficulty, without difficulty which he feels, that man may be said to be embarrassed in his <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>pecuniary affairs.

And the question comes up whether the demand of the judgment note on the one side and the giving of the judgment note on the other side, was such a matter as would indicate of itself that the man was in an embarrassed condition. If that was not fairly inferable from all the facts, if it was a reckless assertion on the part of the newspaper, made wantonly, with levity and with carelessness, then the defendant would be liable for the statement. On the other hand, if it was a statement which any fair-minded, intelligent man, with a knowledge of the circumstances and a knowledge of the community, would naturally make under the circumstances, [if it was such an inference as you and I would draw from the facts, then in my opinion they are not liable and it would not be your duty to find a verdict for the plaintiff.] 5 But the whole matter depends upon questions of fact, which you must find, and which I do not propose to find for you.

During the first year the hotel business showed a net profit of about 18,000, with favorable prospects for the next ensuing year. The house was largely patronized by guests who made it their home during the year, except for a few weeks in the summer.</p>

For that purpose he had a note for $1,500 at four months, indorsed by his brother, discounted by the Third National Bank, with which he kept an account; and, as collateral security therefor, he gave the joint judgment-note of himself and brother, for <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>same amount, payable on demand, with the understanding that the latter should be used only in case the discounted note was dishonored. By an oversight of the bank, judgment was prematurely entered on the collateral note, but no execution was issued thereon. The Press Company, Limited, defendant, in its issue of August 9, 1886, published the following notice of the judgment:—</p>

His object in borrowing the $1,500 was to provide better accommodations for patrons of the hotel. Plaintiff himself was examined and rigidly cross-examined as to his business affairs, financial condition, etc. His testimony tended to show that the publication was prejudicial to liis financial standing, and injurious to his business as proprietor of the hotel. The manner in which it affected both, and the extent of the alleged injury, were stated in detail, and need not be further noticed. The evidence was all for the consideration of the jury in determining questions of fact upon which it was their exclusive province to pass. The hotel books were produced on defendant’s call, but it does .not appear that they were examined or put in evidence, nor was there any rebutting testimony offered by defendant.</p>

That point I cannot unqualifiedly affirm.”</p>
    <p id="b672-6" data-blocks='[["BL_672.5",672,[249,831,1174,704]]]'>We fail to discover in the general charge any such affirmance of the point, qualified or otherwise, as the publication itself and the undisputed evidence required. It was for the jury to say whether the publication meant what is alleged in the innuendo. If they found it did, the publication was libelous; and, under the uncontradicted evidence, plaintiff was entitled to a verdict. Written or printed words which are injurious to a person in his office, profession, or calling, or which impeach the credit of any merchant or trader, by imputing to Mm insolvency, or even embarrassment, are libelous. The law carefully guards the credit of merchants and traders. Imputations on their solvency, or suggestions that they are in pecuniary difficulties, etc., are, as a general rule, actionable: Odgers on Libel, 19, 29, 80, 81, and authorities there cited.</p>
    <p id="b672-7" data-blocks='[["BL_672.6",672,[245,1548,1177,747]]]'>In its application to a man’s financial condition or standing, the word “ embarrassed,” employed in the head-line of the article complained of, ordinarily means incumbered with debt, beset with urgent claims and demands, unable to meet his pecuniary engagements, etc. — words of substantially the same import as those used in the innuendo. The office of an innuendo is to aver the meaning of the language published, but if the common understanding of mankind takes hold of the published words, and at once, without difficulty or doubt, applies a libelous meaning to them, an innuendo is not needed, and if used may be treated as useless surplusage. Considered in connection with the rest of the article, the word “ embarrassed ” means substantially what is ascribed to it in the innuendo. That, however, was a question for the jury. The point should have been affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b672-8" data-blocks='[["BL_672.7",672,[246,2313,1172,94]],["BL_673.1",673,[211,373,1169,1171]]]'>In his answer to the fourth point, above quoted, the learned judge said: “ I have defined in my charge how far it is privi<a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>leged, by telling’ you that a fair comment was admissible, but that an unfair and reckless comment was not admissible. This would take away the privilege.” This answer, we think, was misleading’, and erroneous. Strictly speaking, the question of privilege was not involved. It was the common right of any one to publish the fact that a judgment for $1,500 had been entered against the defendants, substantially as shown by the record of the court in which it was entered; but it was neither the right nor the privilege of defendant or any one else to publish in connection therewith the declaration, in the form of a head-line, or otherwise, that the defendants in the judgment were embarrassed. That had a direct tendency to impair their credit and injure then’ business; and, if the evidence is believed, it did injure plaintiff’s credit and business as a hotel-keeper. Such a declaration, whether it be regarded as an inference drawn by the writer from the fact that the judgment was entered, or he called a comment on a judicial proceeding, was an unwarranted assertion of fact, which, if untrue, was manifestly calculated to impair plaintiff’s credit and injure his business. It does not follow that one who authorizes a confession of judgment against himself is financially embarrassed. The publication, as a whole, including the head-line, was in no sense privileged.
