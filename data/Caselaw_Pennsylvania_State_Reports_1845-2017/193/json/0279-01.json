Thos\u00e9 orders are merely interlocutory; neither of them is in any proper sense a \u201c final sentence or decree,\u201d from which alone an appeal lies to this Court. The appeal was therefore unauthorized, and the same is accordingly quashed at appellant\u2019s costs.\nThe result of the appeal has been an unnecessary and vexar tious delay of nearly a year in prosecuting the case to a final decree. We think the undisputed facts bring the case within the mischief intended to be remedied by the recent Act of May 19, 1897, P. L. 72, authorizing the imposition of penalties for suing out appeals merely for delay.\nIt is therefore ordered, on motion of appellee\u2019s attorney, that as further costs an attorney\u2019s fee of 125.00 be awarded against the appellant.",

L. 72, for suing out appeals merely for delay, will be imposed where an appeal has been taken from an interlocutory order overruling a demurrer for libel in divorce, and granting libellant leave to amend.\nArgued Oct. 9, 1899.\nAppeal, No. 12, Oct. T., 1899, by G. B. Richardson, from decree of C. P. Westmoreland Co., Feb. T., 1898, No. 556, overruling demurrer to libel in divorce.\nBefore Sterbett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nAppeal quashed.\nLibel in divorce. Before McConnell, J.\nErrors assigned were (1) in not sustaining demurrer; (2) in allowing libellant to amend.\nGeorge S. Rumbaugh, for appellant. act\nThe of 1815 provides that the injured party shall exhibit his or her petition to the judges of the court of common pleas of the proper county, where the injured party resides. The jurisdiction of the court therefore depends upon the residence of the petitioner. The residence of the petitioner must appear on the face of the record, or the court has no jurisdiction of the case: Gould v. Gould, 3 Pa. Dist. Rep. 656; Johnson v. Johnson, 3 Pa. Dist. Rep. 166; Smith v. Smith, 1 Pa. Dist. Rep. 550; Sherwood\u2019s Appeal, 17 W.N.C. 338; Weichel v. Weichel, 15 Pa. C.C.R. 601; Thompson v. Thompson, 2 Pa. C. C. R. 573; Powell v. Powell, 3 Del. 206.\nIt requires no argument to show that the court had no jurisdiction of this case, for it clearly appears by an inspection of the petition that the residence of the libellant is not set forth therein.\nWhen a jurisdictional fact does not appear on the face of the bill of complaint, the court can take no valid step: 5 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 777.\nThis is not an interlocutory decree. No valid decree of divorce could be decreed by the court, as the record is fatally defective. The subpoena, al subpoena, and plu subpoena, having been issued by the court before the court obtained jurisdiction of the cause, are of no more effect than if they had been issued by a justice of the peace. It would be useless to co:npel us to proceed to a final hearing upon such a record, as no matter what the result would be it would have to be set aside as of no effect, for the reason that the court had no jurisdiction of the case.\nEdward E. Robbins and John E. Kunkle, for appellee,\nwere not heard, but in their printed brief said: Appeals in divorce cases are regulated by the Act of March 13, 1815, 6 Smith\u2019s Laws, 286, sec. 13, and an Act of June 11, 1891, P. L. 295, by which it is provided: \u201c Either of the parties in any suit or action for divorce now pending or that shall hereafter be brought, after final sentence or decree, may appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court of the proper district.\u201d Thus it will be seen that an appeal lies to this Court only from the \u201c final sentence or decree: \u201d McManus\u2019s Appeal, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 70; Market Co. v. R. R. Co., 142 Pa. 580; Slocum\u2019s Appeal, 12 W. N. C. 84; In re Frankford & Oxford Turnpike Road, 21 W. N. C. 346.\nThis appeal is merely for delay: O\u2019Donnell v. Broad, 149 Pa. 24; Wolf v. Traction Co., 181 Pa. 404; Pennypacker v. Dear, 166 Pa. 284; Bachman v. Gross, 150 Pa. 516.\nThe Court is respectfully moved to impose the penalty provided by the Act of May 25, 1875, P. L. 227, upon the appellant in this case for the reason that, from an inspection of the record as exhibited in appellant\u2019s paper-book, this appeal has been sued out merely for delay and for no other reason.\nOctober 23, 1899:"
