The question of the negligence of the motorman in not stopping or slacking his car sufficiently to avoid a collision was necessarily submitted to the jury, who found for the plaintiffs. There was no error in the charge and answers.\nJudgment affirmed.",

United Traction Company, Appellant.\nNegligence\u2014Street railways\u2014Infant\u2014Province of court and jury.\nIn an action against a street railway company to recover damages for injuries to a boy ten years old, inflicted while crossing a street at a public crossing, the question of the motorman\u2019s negligence in not slacking the speed of the car is for the jury where several witnesses testify that when the boy started to cross the street he was but eight feet from the track and was in full view of the motorman on the ear, and that the car was then sixty-five to seventy feet distant from the crossing.\nArgued Oct. 30, 1899.\nAppeals, Nos. 139 and 140, Oct. T., 1899, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 3, Allegheny Co., Feb. T., 1899, No. 131, on verdict for plaintiffs.\nBefore Green, McCollum, Mitchell, Fell and Brown, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for personal injuries. Before Evans, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that Alexander H. Thompson, a boy about ten years old, was run over by one of defendant\u2019s electric cars, on November 16, 1898, at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and so injured as to make amputation of one foot and the toes of the other foot necessary.\nThe motorman testified: \u201c J ust before coming to Taylor avenue, about a car length or two, I threw the power off, and let it drift, and as there was no stop to make, there was nobody to get on, and I got no bell to stop, after crossing Taylor avenue I fed the car up again, going up to Jackson street, fed the power on until I felt a jolt. I felt the car give a jump, and then received three bells from the conductor, which is a signal to stop, and I did so without any difficulty.\u201d\nThere was some difference in the testimony as to the boy\u2019s position, some of the witnesses saying that the boy ran directly in front of the car, others saying that he ran into the side of the car, and fell down, and that his foot was crushed by being run over by the hind wheel.\nOther facts appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nDefendant asked for binding instructions.\nThe court submitted the case to the jury.\nVerdict and judgment for William T. Thompson for $500, for Alexander H. Thompson for $3,000. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was in refusing binding instructions for defendant.\nHomer L. Castle, with him William A. Stone and W. P. Potter, for appellant,\ncited Pletcher v. Scranton Traction Co., 185 Pa. 147; Funk v. Electric Traction Co., 175 Pa. 559; Bulger v. Albany Ry. Co., 42 N. Y. 459; Gould v. Union Traction Co., 190 Pa. 193.\nRody P. Marshall, with him Thos. M. Marshall, for appellees, were not heard.\nNovember 6, 1899:"
