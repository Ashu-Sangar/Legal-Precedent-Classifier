The information is wholly defective.” To sustain these contentions we had given in evidence the paper called “ Justice Return ” and our attention called to the entries following, or under the word “ Information.” This as a blank was intended to contain, when filled up, the information. It is very clear from an examination of it that it embodies parts of that which was sworn to and part of the proceedings before the justice. This is conclusively shown by the paper. It is dated June 2, and states that Elliot died June 3, at 1:55 o’clock A. M. When the oath was taken Elliot was therefore not yet dead, and the statement that he died simply narrates a part of what appeared before the justice subsequently. This is made still more evident by the balance of the paper, to wit: Thomas Brennan, “ I done it, and I am satisfied to die for it.” This clearly purports to be the language of the defendant, as stated by him, at the hearing. Having nothing else presented to sustain the defendant’s motion to quash, and it being evident that <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>it does not purport to be tbe formal affidavit, we had nothing to base action upon. But let us look at the balance of the paper, to wit: the other page, and we find, “Warrant issued June 2, 1899, on oath of William Walters, Chief Burgess, charging defendant with shooting Harry Elliot, on June 2, which caused his death on June 3, 1899; defendant brought up and after hearing committed to prison.” And then June 2, 1899, “ Acknowledged before me, A. J. Whalen, Justice of the Peace—Seal.”</p>

    <p id="b591-9" data-blocks='[["BL_591.11",591,[140,1646,1183,612]]]'>The defendant was tried upon an indictment found regularly by the grand jury upon examination of witnesses after information made before a magistrate. A trial was had upon the merits and the defendant was duly convicted of murder of tbe first degree. On the trial a motion was made to quash the indictment because it was not found after an information sworn to and subscribed before the committing magistrate. While the defendant might have been heard on that subject upon a proceeding to be discharged from custody on the ground of an illegal commitment, it is certainly too late after indictment found upon the trial of the cause. The finding of the indictment cannot be invalidated for any such reason.</p>
