It was a refusal to declare or enforce a forfeiture himself, but a transfer of his right in that regard whatever it might turn out to be, to appellant, which assumed the risk. Its entry and commencement of operations on the land were an enforcement of a forfeiture for abandonment if Campbell had that right. This depends on the circumstances.</p>

The royalty reserved as rent by the lessor was one eighth of the oil produced. The lease was made July 11, 1887. The test well was put down on a farm in the vicinity, but produced no oil. A second well was drilled on another farm with like result, and operations then ceased without any well on the leased premises. On October 2,1891, Campbell leased to Bailey and on June 19, 1892, Bailey assigned his lease to the appellant.</p>

The rule is thus stated by the present Chief Justice in Koch and Balliet’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/93/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="93 Pa. 434" data-case-ids="442159" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0434-01">93 Pa. 434</a>, 442, “ Where a right to mine iron ore or other minerals is granted in consideration of the reservation of a certain proportion of the product to the grantor, the law implies a covenant on the part of the grantee to work the mine in a proper manner and with reasonable diligence, so that the grantor may receive the compensation or income which both parties must have had in contemplation when the agreement was entered into.” So, in Ray v. Natural Gas Co., <a href="/pa/138/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="138 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="11252411" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0576-01">138 Pa. 576</a>, 589, it was said by our late Brother Clark;, “ Whilst the obligation on the part of the <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>lessee to operate is not expressed in so many words, it arises by necessary implication.- ... If a farm is leased for farming purposes, the lessee to deliver to the lessor a share of the crops, in the nature of rent, it would be absurd to say, because there was no express engagement to farm, that the lessee was under no obligation to cultivate the land; an engagement to farm in a proper manner, and to a reasonable extent is necessarily implied.” That was the case of an oil and gas lease, and it has been said that the doctrine is peculiarly applicable to such leases, owing to the nature of the product: McKnight v.

There is nothing peculiar about them in this respect. But here the parties have provided for a test well, and for what shall be done if it produces oil in paying quantities. But the other contingency, that it prove dry, is not provided for, and it is the omitted case that has occurred. The authorities are uniform that under such circumstances there is an implied obligation on the lessee to proceed with the exploration and development of the land, with reasonable diligence, according to the. usual course of the business, and a failure to do so amounts to an abandonment which will sustain a re-entry by the lessor.</p>
