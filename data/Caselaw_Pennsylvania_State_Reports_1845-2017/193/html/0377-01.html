As stated in 3 Pomeroy’s Equity, sec. 1206: “ The grantee (the coal company) became the principal debtor, primarily liable for the debt, and the mortgagors (the plaintiffs) became the sureties, with all the consequences flowing from the relation of suretyship.” In 1 Beach’s Modern Equity Juris, sec. 455, we find the principle stated in this way: “ When real property has been conveyed subject to a mortgage, the condition in the deed requiring the grantee to assume payment of such mort<a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>gage, it is held that such grantee by the acceptance of the deed impliedly covenants to pay the mortgage debt and thus becomes personally liable to the mortgagee for such payment.

The testimony, to our mind, clearly justifies the finding that the Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company, with its own money, paid to John Runnette, who held by assignment the bond and mortgage of the plaintiffs in trust for the Metropolitan National Bank, the full amount of the mortgage debt, and was entitled to the possession-of the bond and mortgage to be canceled as paid obligations. Let us see what the transaction was. The Metropolitan National Bank, it is true, held the note of the Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company for $6,000 upon which money was advanced when the previous holder of the bond and mortgage, Ella B. Black, was paid the amount thereof ; but it is also true that the bank held the bond and mortgage of the plaintiffs only as a security for the payment of this note; or if not, then they held the note as security for the payment of the mortgage. The principal debtor in both the note and the bond and mortgage was the Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company, and the payment of $6,000 to the Metropolitan National Bank would fully satisfy all claims that it had by reason of being the holder of the note and the bond and mortgage. There was but one debt of $6,000 ; and it follows that if the Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company paid the $6,000 to the bank, the payment not only discharged the debt but éntitled the coal company to the possession of the note and also the bond and mortgage. When this note came due the Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company had no money and the Metropolitan National Bank would not extend the time of payment. The company applied to the Citizens’ National Bank for a loan, it was successful in obtaining it, and an accommodation note was discounted by the bank. Mr. McElroy, the cashier, after examining the bank books, says that “ the proceeds of a note of $6,000 were credited to the Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company on December 5, 1893, and on the same day the account was <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>charged with a check of $6,000.” It was undoubtedly the coal company’s money obtained on an accommodation note that paid the Metropolitan National Bank its $6,000. And a part of a renewal note of this very $6,000 note is what the defendant I. N. Patterson claims he, as indorser for the coal company, paid. Now, what further was done when the Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company placed this accommodation note in the Citizens’ National Bank to obtain the money with which it paid the Metropolitan National Bank. The Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company agreed with the Citizens’ National Bank that the bond and mortgage, which it undoubtedly would be entitled to receive from the Metropolitan National Bank when it paid that bank its $6,000, should be kept alive and assigned by John Runnette, for the Metropolitan National Bank, to the Citizens’ National Bank as a security for the payment of this accommodation note. That the Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company procured the assignment to be made by John Runnette to the Citizens’ National Bank there can be no doubt. Mr. Patterson, one of the defendants, in his testimony says: “ I was attorney for the company; I drew the assignment; Mr. Runnette came into my office, he acknowledged it in my office, and Mr. Runnette and I went down to the Citizens’ National Bank. I handed Mr. Berry the mortgage and the bond with the assignment on it, also the assignment of the mortgage, which I told him I would send to Washington county and have recorded.” In other words, the real transaction was this: the coal company borrowed $6,000 from the Citizens’ National Bank on an accommodation note, the Metropolitan National Bank was paid its $6,000 claim and turned over the bond and mortgage to the Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company, which was entitled to them, because it, as principal, owed the mortgage debt and had paid it; but to keep them alive, so the coal company could use the plaintiffs as its sureties to the Citizens’ Bank, without their knowledge or consent, Mr. Runnette was asked and consented to assign the bond and mortgage to George A. Berry in trust for the Citizens’ National Bank. That this transaction amounted in equity to a discharge of the plaintiffs, the makers of the bond and mortgage, and that the assignment of the bond and mortgage to the Citizens’ National Bank as collateral security for the payment of the Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>Coal Company’s note was a nullity, we think there can be no doubt. Referring again to 8 Pomeroy’s Equity, see. 1213, we find these words : “If payment of the mortgage is made to the mortgagee or the other holder of the mortgage by a party who is himself personally and primarily liable for the debt, who is in any manner and by any means the actual primary debtor whose duty it is to pay the debt absolutely and before all others, such payment operates ipso facto as an end of the mortgage and the lien is completely destroyed. The party so paying is not subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee; there is no equitable assignment to him of the mortgage security; even if he should receive a formal assignment, the mortgage could not be thus kept alive, but would be wholly merged and ended.” If, then, George A. Berry, one of the defendants, took no title to the bond and mortgage by the assignment, does the other defendant, I. N. Patterson, stand in any better position? Or is he, as he claims, entitled to subrogation, and should the bond and mortgage, in equity, be assigned to him to the extent of his payments as indorser for the Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company ?</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.5",408,[279,1173,1180,1233]],["BL_409.1",409,[146,350,1178,252]]]'>There is no doubt of the existence of the principle of equity which the counsel for the defendant here invokes; that is, that where the surety pays the debt of his principal debtor he is entitled to an assignment of any collateral security which the creditor to whom he paid the money holds, or, in other words, he is to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor to this collateral security. But if George A. Berry in trust had no right to use this collateral security, then I. N. Patterson would have none. And surely it cannot be claimed that Mr. Patterson is in any better position than Mr. Berry,—that he was an innocent indorser who through the fault of the plaintiffs relied for protection on what seemed on its face to be a good collateral security. He was the attorney for the Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company; he was also a stockholder and director in the company. He drew the assignment of the bond and mortgage to George A. Berry. Acting for the Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company he supervised the making of the loan from the Citizens’ National Bank. He knew that the debt secured by the bond and mortgage was the debt of the Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company, and that if it was once paid by his company that payment would fully discharge the plaintiffs in this case from all liability under the bond and mortgage. Under these facts, how can the equitable principle that protects a paying surety be invoked. I. N. Patterson was a surety of the <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company, it is true, but so were tbe plaintiffs, and Patterson knew it, because he was both a stockholder and director in the company. Subrogation is “ a mode of relief which equity adopts to force the final satisfaction of a debt by him who is primarily liable.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b409-5" data-blocks='[["BL_409.5",409,[144,611,1180,1341]]]'>To strip the case of the intervening assignees of this bond and mortgage, we have substantially this case: The Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company owed Mary J. Irwin $6,000; J. V. H. Cook and others are the company’s sureties, and their liability is evidenced by a bond and mortgage. The coal company borrows from the Citizens’ National Bank $6,000 on a note with I. N. Patterson as surety, and with it pays Mary J. Irwin her claim. Time goes by and $2,000 of the $6,000 note held by the Citizens’ National Bank is not paid, and I. N. Patterson, the surety, is compelled to pay it. He now wants the sureties of the coal company for the payment of the mortgage debt, to reimburse him, a stockholder of the company, and a court of equity to decree that the bond and mortgage of J. Y. H. Cook and others given to Mary J. Irwin is still alive and that $2,026.65 of it should be assigned to him; the inequity, and not the equity, of such a decree as is here asked is apparent. Under the evidence in the case a claim that John Runnette for the Metropolitan National Bank, and George A. Berry for the Citizens’ National Bank were bona fide purchasers of the bond and mortgage in question, as we have said, is wholly untenable. The money that both the banks paid out was money that was loaned to the Pittsburg &amp; Bellevernon Coal Company. The mortgage debt was paid by the coal company’s money,- and the successive holders of the mortgage, after it was paid, simply tried to keep it alive as a security. This they could not do, at least without the consent of the plaintiffs.</p>
