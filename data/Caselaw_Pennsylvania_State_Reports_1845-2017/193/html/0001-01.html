' When the plaintiff’s account with defendant was opened it was then and there agreed by defendant that if plaintiff would deposit with it in consideration of its being allowed to use the moneys so deposited it would honor all checks and drafts drawn by him upon said account, and would safely keep the moneys so deposited by him, so that the same should be paid only to him or on his order. In accordance with the custom of banks, plaintiff thereupon signed his name in a signature book kept by defendant, that it might know his signature when checks or drafts drawn or purporting to be drawn by him upon said account were presented to the bank for payment. In accordance with the said agreement, plaintiff, on the dates set out in the following account, deposited with defendant the sums set out as cash in said account, and at the times in said account set forth defendant discounted for plaintiff the notes referred to therein, all of which were discpunted so as to permit plaintiff to draw there against, and have long since been paid in cash to defendant.

On the credit side of the deposit book, when it was returned from settlement, was not stated the dates of the checks or notes paid, or anything by which the identity of any particular item could be ascertained, except by a comparison and analysis of the amounts stated in the account with the checks and notes and check book and note book, and sometimes they could not be identified even in that way, owing to the fact that the employees of defendant at times added the amounts of two or three items of credit together, and entered them as if one item.

During all that time, as well as before, plaintiff had in his employ said confidential clerk and bookkeeper, to whom he specially intrusted the business of attending to his. bank accounts. That duty included making deposits, occasionally handing in the bank book to be written up and balanced, and, when that was done, the further duty of receiving the canceled checks, etc., with the payment of which the bank had credited itself, and delivering the same to the plaintiff for examination,, approval, etc. In the same connection, it was the duty of the clerk to verify the bank book, as the same was written up and balanced from time to time by the bank, and report the result. <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>to the plaintiff.

For the purpose of concealing these forgeries, he falsified his employer’s books, and, by misadditions and missubtractions, forced the balances in the check book so as to make them agree with those in. the bank book. During the period above mentioned, plaintiff’s bank book was balanced twelve times. The first settlement included two forged checks, one $800 and the other $200. The last settlement included a $350 forged check. The other forgeries were respectively included in the intermediate settlements. At each settlement the amount of each check, not previously settled and canceled, was entered on plaintiff’s bank book by the bank as a charge against him, and the book, together with the checks, was delivered to his clerk for the purpose of examination and verification. If, at the time of each settlement, the forged checks had been examined by the plaintiff, or, if the number and the aggregate amount of the checks had been compared with the number and amounts of the checks separately entered in the bank book, or, if the checks had been compared with the stubs of the check book, or, if the additions of the deposits and checks on the checkbook had been examined, the forgery would have been discovered. Neither of these was done, for the reason that plaintiff’s unfaithful clerk, who was deputed by him to receive the checks, etc., from the bank, take them to the office and compare the amounts, etc., with the bank book, abstracted and destroyed the forged checks, and failed to call his employer’s attention to the discrepancies which undoubtedly would have resulted from a proper comparison and examination. He did tills because he himself was the forger. The result was that, for more than two years and a half after the first forged checks were paid, no complaint was made and no notice of any error in the settlements was given to the bank. It was not the bank’s fault that the first forgeries were not promptly discovered and notice thereof given. If plaintiff’s duty to the bank had been performed at the proper time the fact would have appeared that the bank had charged plaintiff, on his bank book, with the payment of two items ($300 <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>and $200) for which no vouchers appeared among the checks handed to him by his clerk. These vouchers, the two forged checks, had been abstracted and destroyed by the latter. No objection having been made at the time of the first settlement, the bank had a right to assume that everything was correct, including the two checks purporting to be signed by him. His silence was tantamount to a declaration to that effect, and, in afterwards honoring checks signed by the same person, the bank had a right to consider the fact that these signatures had been at least tacitly recognized by the plaintiff as genuine.</p>

The bank was therefore entitled to have them examined and, if rejected, returned within a reasonable time.' That was not done, and because of plaintiff’s failure to perform his duty in that regard, he should not be permitted to recover.

There was no conflict of testimony as to the failure of the plaintiff to perform the duty which, under the undisputed evidence, he owed to the defendant; nor was there any evidence of negligence on the part of the bank that should have been submitted to the jury. The checks purporting to be signed by the plaintiff were destroyed, and of course they were not <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>produced. There was not a particle of evidence that the signatures were not such complete facsimiles of plaintiff’s signature as to be impossible of detection, even by an expert. As correctly stated by counsel for the bank, the clerk did say in reply to questions put by plaintiff’s counsel, that he was not an expert penman, and that he had never before had any experience in forging other people’s names, but he was not asked, and did not say, that the signatures were not made—either by the use of tracing paper or otherwise—so like the originals that they could not be detected by an ordinary inspection. On this point, negligence is not to be presumed, and hence the presumption must be in favor of the bank. In the absence of any evidence, from the signatures themselves or -from witnesses, that there was any difference between them and plaintiff’s signature, which could be detected by the eye, it must be assumed that the forgery was of such a character that the bank acting with due care and caution was deceived by it. In fact there was no evidence from which the jury would have been warranted in drawing the conclusion that the bank in honoring the checks acted negligently.</p>
