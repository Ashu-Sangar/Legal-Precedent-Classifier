    <p class="summary" id="b327-6" data-blocks='[["BL_327.6",327,[134,501,1177,773]]]'>The will in this case was probated September 6, 1894. The petition of L. L. Wilson and Nettie P. Wilson, by their guardian, S. S. Taylor, was filed on June 22, 1897, with the register of wills for the revocation of the probate of said will. “ With the probate of the will the register’s power ceased. Under the constitution all questions thereafter touching the probate or validity of the will are to be determined by the orphans’ court on appeal from the register’s decision where the proper issue may be framed.” See Mathew v. Biddell, <a href="/pa-super/8/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Pa. Super. 112" data-case-ids="286920" data-case-paths="/pa-super/8/0112-01">8 Pa. Superior Ct. 112</a>. The register in this case upon petition filed, asking for revocation of probate, took testimony and set the will aside. Under the law as interpreted by the Superior Court he had no jurisdiction in the premises. The only course open to the petitioner was by appeal to the orphans’ court from the action of the register in probating the will.</p>
