In other words, there was no evidence that the contract of sale contemplated in exhibit “ A ” was abandoned, except that found by implication in the contract made at the time of settlement in September, as evidenced by exhibits “C” and “B.” Do these exhibits show that the parties intended to substitute a contract of bailment for Irire for a contract of sale originally contemplated? We think not. They rather show a purpose on the part of the Morgan-Gardner Electric Company to hold on to the title to the property to secure the payment, not of rent, but of the purchase money. In exhibit “ B ” the electric company expressly says that the notes received from the coal company ■ by it' “ is in full settlement for the mining plant furnished by us for their Hackett mine under our contract dated May 11, 1896,” etc., and it also says in this exhibit that “ it is understood that this plant is to remain our property until the.above mentioned notes are paid.” Clearly exhibit “B ” does not evidence an intention of the parties to change the contemplated contract of sale found in exhibit “ A ” to a contract of bailment, but on the contrary shows that notes were given in full settlement of the purchase price provided for in exhibit “ A,” and only adds that the title to the property shall not pass until the notes are paid. A condition, it is true, was added to the contract of sale, but surely not such a one as to create a bailment. Now, let us examine exhibit “ C.” The word <em>“ </em>lease ” is used in this agreement, but we take it that that throws no light on the character of the contract. If the delivery of the property was made under such circumstances as to show it was a conditional sale, calling it a lease will not make it a contract of bail- ■ ment for hire or use. The “ whereas ” of the agreement connects it with exhibit “ B,” and shows that the notes which were therein receipted for were included in the consideration of this agreement. The first paragraph reiterates what was stated in exhibit “ B ”; that is, that the title and ownership of said goods should remain in the electric company until the notes are fully paid. No evidence here of a bailment, but, on the contrary, of a conditional sale, the retention of title to secure the purchase money. The converse of this paragraph is that if the notes are fully paid the title and ownership of the goods and chattels <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>shall be unconditionally in the coal company. The second and third paragraphs simply provide that the coal company can “ acquire absolute title and ownership of said goods and chattels ” by paying said notes, and that if it does not pay said notes and take care of the machinery until the time of payment comes the electric company can enter and repossess itself of the goods and chattels. What is this but a provision for the enforcement of the payment of the purchase money as in a conditional sale. Surely we find in these paragraphs no earmarks of a bailment. The fourth paragraph simply provides that if the coal company pays the notes according to their tenor and effect it will be entitled to have a bill of sale from the electric company. In other words, when it performs the conditions of the sale its conditional title becomes “ absolute ” and it will be entitled to a paper showing that fact. Nowhere in this agreement can w.e see the least evidence of a bailment except in the word “lease.” While, on the other hand, a sale of the property on condition that the vendor retain the title as security for the payment of the purchase money is evidenced by every paragraph in the agreement and by exhibit “ B,” and is good between the parties, but void as to the creditors of the parties having possession of the property.</p>

As said by Mr. Justice Williams, in Stephens v. Gifford, <a href="/pa/137/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="137 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="821489" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0219-01">137 Pa. 219</a>, “ it is of the essence of a contract of bailment that the articles bailed be returned, in its own or some altered form, to the bailor, so that he may have his own again.” This contract makes no provision either expressly or by implication for the return of the property to the electric company. The contract, if carried out according to its provisions, leaves the property in the possession of the coal company, and the only provision for its return is in case of a failure of the coal company to make its payments. This provision was not put in the contract to insure the return of the property to the electric company, “ so that it might have its own again,” but to insure the payment of the notes, so that the property might remain in the possession of the coal company as its own. It was a contract remedy to enforce payment, not of hire, but of <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>purchase money. The case of Farquhar v. McAlevy, <a href="/pa/142/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="142 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="976798" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0233-01">142 Pa. 233</a>, is very similar in its facts to the one at bar; there the court held the contract was a conditional sale and not a bailment, notwithstanding the parties called their agreement “ a lease ” and the money that passed between them “ hire.”</p>
