The viewers have made a report whereby the cost of the improvement has been assessed against the owners of the abutting properties according to the frontage on the avenue. To this a large number of the parties assessed have filed exceptions, all so far as we can see in the same words.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b455-5" data-blocks='[["BL_455.5",455,[139,658,1180,716]]]'>There are nine exceptions, the substance of which is that the cost of the paving should not be borne by the abutting property, because: (1) the street is a main thoroughfare and the paving of it a benefit to persons outside the borough and in the borough, not on this avenue; (2) the avenue was formerly a turnpike and was taken by the county commissioners from the turnpike company by condemnation proceedings, and therefore belongs to the county; (3) the proceedings to widen and improve the avenue have never been ended; (4) this is a rural district and the foot-front rule does not apply to it; (5) the turnpike company macadamized the road, and the paving by the borough is a repaving and not an original improvement ; (6) a part of the avenue was not included in the improvement.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b455-6" data-blocks='[["BL_455.6",455,[137,1384,1179,873]]]'>The first, second and sixth of these reasons do not require notice. . As to the third it appears that some appeals from the assessments for the widening of the street have not been finally disposed of. That is no reason why the street should not be paved and the paving paid for by those to whom it may be chargeable. As to the fourth we find from the evidence that this is not a rural district, but that the avenue is practically a city street. The fifth is that on which the exceptants principally rely. We find from the evidence that while the turnpike company was in possession of the road they stoned a portion of the road one fourth to one half its width, leaving a dirt road on one side, at least, if not on both, repairing the same from time to time with broken stone. At the time the road ceased to be the property of the company such stoning or macadamizing as had been done was in a ruinous and unsafe condition and it was removed by the borough in paving, and never used or adopted by it.</p>
