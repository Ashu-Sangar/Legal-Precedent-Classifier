It is also averred in said petition that the petitioner had received an offer from Henry Berg, the defendant, to purchase the said property at the price of $1,000 cash, and that the same was a fair and reasonable price, and more than could be realized at a public sale; that it was necessary to sell the said Verona property in order to pay off the debts of the Pittsburg property, viz : said mortgage of $5,700, a condition provided for in said will, and that all the heirs and parties in interest except the said William Bischof, nonresident as aforesaid, had approved of the said sale, and requested the petitioner to sell the same, and apply the purchase money to the payment on account of said mortgage. Said petitioner in said petition further averred that he <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>was advised that said decedent, in the sixth paragraph of his will, by implication authorized the sale of his Verona property, if and when it became necessary to pay off debts of his Pittsburg property, which authority not having been conferred on any person, by name or description, the power was vested by law in the petitioner as executor, but that it was necessary that he exercise said power under the direction and decree of the said honorable court.

    <p id="b468-4" data-blocks='[["BL_468.7",468,[268,397,1178,1997]]]'>This is a case stated in which Henry Freker as executor of the last will and testament of Bernard Bischof, deceased, is the plaintiff and Henry Berg is the defendant. It relates to a sale by the former to the latter of certain lots designated in the will of the decedent as his Verona property, and of which he died seized. The executor, in his petition to the orphans’ court for an order to sell said property for the benefit of the owners, averred, inter alia, that he had received an offer from Henry Berg to purchase said property at the price of $1,000, and that the same was a fair and reasonable price, and more than could be realized at a public sale. It was also averred therein that all the heirs and parties in interest, except William Bischof, who was a nonresident, absent from the state and unheard of since 1884, desired that the sale should be made. There was a debt of the estate secured by mortgage on the decedent’s Pitts-burg property, and it was the intention of the heirs and parties in interest that the money arising from the sale of the Verona property should be applied to the payment of this debt. This intention was therefore in accord with the manifest intention of the’testator, who in the sixth clause of his will said: “It may be necessary to sell my Verona property to pay off debts of my Pittsburg property.” All debts not of record, and some that were, have been paid, and the mortgage debt alone remains. There is therefore no question raised concerning a debt which has lost its lien by the failure of the creditor to comply with the 24th section of the Act of February 24,1834, P. L. 77, nor any warrant for an inference or suggestion in Kirk v. Carr, <a href="/pa/54/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="54 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="1006296" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0265-01">54 Pa. 265</a>, in Myers’s App., <a href="/pa/62/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="62 Pa. 104" data-case-ids="1017233" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0104-01">62 Pa. 104</a>, or in Bell’s App., <a href="/pa/66/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="66 Pa. 498" data-case-ids="432347" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0498-01">66 Pa. 498</a>, which in any degree collides with or obstructs the proceeding in the orphans’ court or invalidates the order of sale. The proceedings in said court were under the act of April 18, 1858, commonly known as the Price Act, and in conformity therewith. It plainly appeared in the petition and the testimony supporting it that the heirs and parties in interest would be materially benefited by the sale, and the court upon due consideration entered on March 3, 1896, an order in accordance with the petition, which order was followed on March 7, 1896, by a contract between the plaintiff and defendant in the case stated.</p>
