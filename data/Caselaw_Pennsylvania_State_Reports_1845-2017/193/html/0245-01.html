A close examination of these cases will show that they do not go to the extent claimed by the court below. The construction we place upon the term manufacturing, in the act of 1878, is not inconsistent with the decision in either of above cases. In them was involved a class of manufacturing corporations exempt from taxation under the tax statutes of the state, and the only question there decided was that they were not of the class so entitled. They were distinguished from other manufacturing corporations. There are manufacturing corporations exempt from taxation in the state under our revenue acts and there are other equally certain manufacturing corporations not exempt. And further, there are portions of the capital stock of manufacturing corporations exempt while other portions are taxable.</p>

L. 145, to reorganize the company. This depends upon whether an electric light, heat and power company is a manufacturing company within the meaning and intent of the act. The learned judge of the common pleas who decided the case felt that he was concluded upon the subject by the decision in Commonwealth v. Northern Electric Light &amp; Power Co., <a href="/pa/145/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="145 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="825906" data-case-paths="/pa/145/0105-01">145 Pa. 105</a>, followed in Commonwealth v.

L. 112, in so far as it related to manufacturing corporations. In the common pleas it was held, (1) that the defendant had not so clearly shown itself to be a manufacturing corporation as to warrant the court in holding that it was exempt from taxation on its capital stock; (2) that corporations of the kind to which the defendant belonged did not come within the policy of the legislation exempting manufacturing corporations from taxation on their capital stock.</p>

The judgment was affirmed on the second finding, and on the ground stated by Judge Simonton, although other reasons were given, that exemptions from taxation are to he construed strictly, and that electric light companies do not come within the policy of the legislature in enacting section 20 of the act of 1885, which was to encourage manufacturing companies to carry on their business within the limits of the state rather than heyond its borders. In the opinion of this Court it was said that companies performing a quasi-public or municipal function “ are not included in any of the legislation provided for the encouragement and protection of manufacturing corporations, and they have no right to share in the benefits of such legislation. They really form a class by themselves.”</p>

Clause 11 of section 2 of the Act of April 29, 1874, P. L. 73, provides for the incorporation of companies for the manufacture and supply of gas or the supply of light or heat to the public by any other means ; and as amended by the Act of May 8, 1889, P.

The power to supply includes the power to manufacture.” Clause 1 of section 34 of the act of 1874 authorizes companies incorporated under it to erect and maintain <em>“ </em>the necessary buildings, machinery and appliances for manufacturing gas, heat or light from coal or other materials; ” and the word “ manufacture ” is used in the Act of May 20, 1891, P. L. 90, which authorizes boroughs to manufacture electricity. The Act of June 25, 1895, P. L. 302, makes it unlawful “ to connect or disconnect electrical conductors belonging to any company engaged in the manufacture and supply of electrical currents for the purpose of light, heat or power.”</p>

Electric light, heat and power companies are manufacturing corporations within the meaning of the act of 1874 and its supplements. They are not exempt from a tax on their capital stock under section 20 of the act of 1885, because they are not within the policy of the legislature in passing that act, and it ivas not intended that they should share in its benefits.
