In 1794 and again in 1860 it enacted a law on that subject, as follows : “ All murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison or by lying in wait or by any other kind of wilful', deliberate and premeditated killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate any arson, rape, robbery or burglary, shall be deemed murder of the first degree, and all other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder of the second degree.”</p>

Voluntary manslaughter is the killing of another upon a sudden heat of passion or quarrel, where there is sufficient cause or provocation and a state of passion resulting therefrom, without time to cool and reason to interpose, which places the slayer beyond the power of reason and impels him to the deed.

No period should have been used until at the end of the paragraph. Where the two intervening periods are used semicolons should have been. As punctuated the middle one of the three sentences is incomplete. The purpose of the whole paragraph was a statement to the jury of what “ the commonwealth alleges ” rebutted the contention of the prisoner that the killing was in the heat of passion. The punctuation of it might indicate that we stated to the jury as a conclusion of law that “ the cutting of the deceased and the deliberate wiping the blood off the knife upon his trousers ” did rebut the contention of the prisoner that the killing was in the heat of passion, which is wholly inconsistent with other parts of the charge.

The trial only proceeded when we were satisfied by consultation with the physician that the jurors were comfortable and capable of giving their attention wholly to the trial.

In other words, they must have found that the killing was not done in justifiable self-defense, nor in a sudden transport or heat of passion generated by adequate provocation, but that it was done wilfully and maliciously, and with intent to take life. These conclusions were not unwarranted by the evidence as to what occurred at and about the time the stabbing was done, and also as to the nature and character of the wound and the manner in which it was inflicted. As shown by the evidence, after the prisoner was knocked down and after Dougherty walked away from him, he appears to have opened his knife, and thus armed with the open knife in his right hand behind his back he approached Dougherty, who was still standing at the stable door, laid his hand on his shoulder, asked him why he hit him, and without further warning drew the knife from behind his back, plunged into Dougherty’s left thigh—nearly severing the femoral artery—and drew it across his abdomen. According to the physician’s testimony, the wound was ten inches long, about five inches of it in the thigh, and about the same length across the <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>abdomen, deep enough in the thigh to partially sever the femoral artery, and deep enough in the abdomen to reach the peritoneum. The mortal wound thus inflicted was in a vital part of the body, and death speedily ensued. It has been said by this court that, “ He who uses upon the person of another, at some vital part, with manifest intention to use it upon him, a deadly weapon, such as an ax, a gun or a knife, must, in the absence of qualifying circumstances, be presumed to know that it is likely to kill, and, knowing this, must be presumed to intend the death which is the probable and ordinary consequence of such an act: ” Lanahan v.
