Since the removal of the track from Fifth street to the river and the discontinuance of the use of the turntable and buildings thereat, the track from Ninth street south, a distance of about 1,900 feet, has not been used as a main track, but has been used at occasional times for switching trains and for the delivery and receipt of carloads of freight at long intervals to and from different persons, the testimony indicating that the use for either purpose would not exceed on the average once in a month. In addition to this use it has been used for some five or six years, chiefly, however, since the commencement of <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>these proceedings, for the shipment of railroad ties, delivered and stacked at a point near Fifth street.

From the point where the track enters upon Buffalo street near Ninth street to a point about midway between Eighth and Seventh streets the conformation of the natural surface of the ground is such that, in order to obtain a grade for the railroad, an enbankment was necessary in the street, the same, as constructed, being four and a half feet high at the highest point, and diminishing in height therefrom towards the points indicated. No grade for the street having been established by the city, and no filling having been done to any extent on either side of the track, it is not practicable to pass from one side of the track to the other, except at the intersections of the cross streets, where it is difficult if not dangerous to do so, and, except on the lower part of the street in question, there is no open driveway along the westerly side of the street, while that on the easterly side is narrow, rendering it difficult for teams to pass. There is not sufficient drainage for water under the track, resulting at times in the accumulation of water on the westerly side thereof, between Eighth and Ninth streets. As to this, however, the evidence indicates that the railroad company is not alone at fault.</p>

The Franklin and Jamestown railroad located its tracks on Buffalo street in the city of Franklin in 1867, with the express consent of the city, given by ordinance. It is conceded that the railroad company derived no additional authority from the ordinance, but a reference to it is relevant as bearing on the present equities between the parties. The court found that the entry on the street was made under and in conformity with the provisions of the general railroad act of 1849, and that the tracks were built and have been maintained “ as such roads usually are constructed and maintained,” with the exception of not now being in good repair. The railroad, however, owing to <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>the formation of the natural surface of the ground, was partly-built on an embankment which interferes with the general use of the street by the public, and there is not sufficient or proper drainage for water under the track, resulting at times in an accumulation on the westerly side. For this condition of things, however, the court finds that “ the railroad company is not alone at fault.” No grade of the street was ever established by the city until after these suits had reached final hearing and the first opinion of the court had been filed.</p>
    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[284,821,1174,1440]]]'>The facts are found very clearly and explicitly by the learned judge below, and the law in general correctly stated. But we are of opinion that its application was more severe on the appellant than the equities between the parties will sustain. The location of the track Avas with the express consent of the city, and the method of its construction had been acquiesced in for thirty years. For the present inconvenient condition of the street the court found that the railroad was not alone at fault, and further, that just prior to these suits the railroad proposed “ to place the track in proper condition, conforming to the grade of the street as established by the city, at any reasonable time the city might undertake the improvement of the street.” This was substantially all that the equities of the city entitled it to, and the offer should have been accepted. By its refusal the city made itself responsible for the subsequent litigation, and the relief now awarded to it must MIoav the general lines of the rejected proposition. So much of the decree therefore as requires the appellant to grade the entire Avidth of the street, and to proceed in advance of the city’s action, must be stricken out. The city should carry out the grade established by ordinance, and, concurrently or subsequently, the railroad should conform its tracks to such grade. In regard to drainage the duty is primarily on the city, but such additional Avork or expense in providing an adequate system as may result from the presence of the tracks in the street should be done or paid for by the railroad. If the parties cannot agree on this the court may upon supplemental bill determine any questions arising in regard to the matter.</p>

The part of the track in dispute, though still claimed by the railroad to be part of its main line, is now used principally as a switch or <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>branch to move cars to and from its yard and to receive and deliver freight (and perhaps passengers) to points not easily reachable by the main line. This within reasonable limits is a legitimate use of the road, and the court found that it “ would not exceed on the average once in a month.” The second paragraph of the decree must therefore be altered so as not to make the prohibition absolute, but only against such use as will unnecessarily and unreasonably occupy the street and interfere with the use thereof by the general public.</p>
    <p id="b529-5" data-blocks='[["BL_529.5",529,[173,822,1179,149]]]'>The decree is reversed and directed to be modified in accordance with this opinion. Costs of the whole proceedings to be paid by appellees.</p>
