    <p class="summary" id="b419-13" data-blocks='[["BL_419.17",419,[133,1454,1181,712]]]'>In this proceeding the defendants, Kent and Blair, ask that judgment be opened and that they be permitted to defend against the note in suit, on the ground that it was given without any consideration and for a fraudulent purpose, which was known to Goodwin, the payee, and to Z. G. White, the principal, but which was not at the time known to either Kent or Blair who signed it as sureties, and as they allege in good faith as a bona fide transaction. There is, as we think, sufficient in the testimony to warrant us in directing an issue to determine the question of their liability. Since the case will go to the jury, we deem it unnecessary to further discuss at this time the merits of the defense, any more than to say that we think the reasons relied upon would be adequate if sufficiently established at the trial. The rule will therefore be made absolute.</p>
