The first statement of plaintiffs’ demand against defendant was to recover on his indorsement the amount called for in two certain promissory notes drawn by W. W. Weston to the order of G. E. Ramsey, each of which were indorsed in the order hereinafter stated by the following named parties, viz : by G. E. Ramsey, W. H. and D. 0. Conklin, Pitts-burg Vehicle and Harness Co., D. O. Hutchinson, treasurer, and J. B. Forker, the last indorser of said notes. The defendant filed his affidavit of defense thereto, in which he alleged in substance that he indorsed and delivered the same to the plaintiffs on Sunday, September 10, 1893, and received a check of said plaintiffs, for the amount of said notes, less the discount at the rate of ten per cent per annum, which check was executed and delivered by the plaintiffs to Forker, the defendant, on September 10, 1893, but was dated on September 11, 1893; that he, Forker, was not liable on his indorsement because it was executed and delivered on Sunday, September 10, 1893, and by reason hereof his indorsement was invalid and void, and that no recovery could be had in said action. On plaintiffs’ motion for judgment therein, in default of a sufficient affidavit of defense, a rule to show cause was granted and the rule was argued by counsel. On February 15, 1896, the opinion of the court was filed, in which the first rule was discharged without prejudice and the motion for judgment was refused. On April 13, 1896, the following motion and amended statement were presented to the court.</p>

We cannot agree with counsel in such a proposition. The payment of a check to the payee is presumed to have been received on account of a debt due from the payer of the check to the payee, or for money or cash given for said check. A contract will not be implied when an express contract would for any reason be invalid. It is clear in the case at bar that there is no antecedent debt or contract upon which to base the action. All that was performed in regard thereto, so far as the plaintiffs and defendant are privies, was done and completed on Sunday. . . .</p>

The defendant indorsed the check on the Sunday it was given, but the money was drawn on it by the indorsees on the following Wednesday. This is the money had and received which is the cause of action declared upon in the amended statement. The court properly held that there could be no recovery on the note, but the action for the money stands on different ground. As to it the contract was not complete or executed on Sunday. Its object on the part of the defendant was to obtain the money on the discounted notes before their maturity, and it was not carried out until the money was obtained. The check in the mean time was merely a part of the incomplete Sunday agreement, and as such either party could have refused to go further with it. But when the holder presented and the plaintiff paid it both parties ratified and reaffirmed the transaction with all its consequences. This was done on a legal day, and made a legal and binding loan of the money.</p>

It was accordingly held in the latter case that an agreement made on Sunday to extend the time of payment of a note, in consideration of the anticipation of part of the amount, became binding by the'agreed prepayment on a legal day, Chief Justice Lewis saying, “ It is not the intention of the law that its regard for the Sabbath day shall be made the means of perpetrating a fraud.” So in Whitmire v.
