C. L. Flaccus, the defendant, a glass manufacturer, entered into the articles of agreement upon which this suit is brought, dated October 8,1895. It is averred in the agreement that an application for a patent on the power press had been made, under date of , 1895, but said application was not in fact filed until December 28, 1895. The contract included in its grant all improvements which Haley might thereafter make upon said patent, or upon said power press. Haley warranted in the contract that he was “ the exclusive owner and first discoverer of the said patent, as well as the said power press, for which a patent has been applied for, that each of them was original in him and patentable.”</p>

The evidence does not show that that was made to Haley. There is nothing that would indicate that he was absolutely estopped even by the opinion that he had or- the expression that he might have made use of <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>as to the satisfactoribility, if I may make a new word, of this machine at the time he ordered the five new machines, but it is strong evidence of the fact that he had become satisfied—not conclusive, but such as would require him to prove by testimony satisfactory to the jury that he had been misled in some manner so as to account for that which appeared to be his actual state of mind, his entire satisfaction with the machine at the time he so expressed himself. It does not follow because he was then satisfied that he might not afterwards change his mind. We are very frequently satisfied with the state of affairs to-day, and yet in a very few days or hours be thoroughly convinced that the opinion we had was based upon wrong views, or something may have transpired that would compel us by that fact itself to change the opinion we had arrived at, so that even assuming that, at the time he accepted these machines, it was the exact expression of his opinion upon that subject, if the evidence satisfies the jury that by the operation of the machine afterwards within a reasonable time he discovered that he had been misled and that it would not work to his satisfaction, in other words, would not do the work that it was expected and guaranteed to do, he would still have the right to say to the plaintiff: “ Take away your machine ; it is not what you guaranteed it to be, and although I did accept it in one sense so as to make myself liable for the payment to those who manufactured it, I am not bound to pay this royalty because I am not satisfied and I should not be satisfied, for it does not do the work that you guaranteed.” Having expressed his satisfaction he has no right to turn around and say, “ I have changed my mind,” and in that way terminate the lease; but if the evidence shows that he was misled; that the machine kept breaking down from time to time; that it did not accomplish the purpose that was guaranteed, he is not precluded, when he discovered that fact, from saying, “I am not satisfied; take your machine away and I will pay you no rent for the use of it.” [Upon that question you have to determine by the testimony what the state of facts was. If the evidence fairly satisfies you that he had a right, in view of what occurred after he had ordered these five machines and expressed satisfaction with them, to change his mind because of the operation and effect of this machine and the manner in which it did its work, then you <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>ought to hold that having expressed an opinion of satisfaction in that way he was bound for the rent for the current year, and he could only relieve himself from that by giving notice three months preceding the commencement of the next term.] [4]</p>
