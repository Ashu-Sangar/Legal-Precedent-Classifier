In 1890 the plaintiff purchased a lot of ground, now in the borough of Espíen, in the county of Allegheny, and soon thereafter erected a dwelling house thereon, which he has occupied as a residence ever since. It is averred in the plaintiff’s bill that the sole and unqualified ownership and right of ownership in this house and lot were and still are in the plaintiff. The answer of the defendant specifically denies this, and avers that, with the exception of an inconsiderable amount contributed by the plaintiff, the lot was purchased and the house built with the money of the defendant, the greater portion thereof being proceeds of sale of another property, in like manner bought with the money of the defendant. No testimony was given on this subject, except to the effect that the house and lot now in question were purchased with the proceeds of another house and lot which stood in the name of the plaintiff and which were sold. The answer in this respect appears to be responsive to the bill.</p>

She accordingly went with him to the office of a real estate agent by whom a deed was written, and thence to a magistrate’s office where the deed was acknowledged, the deed being made directly from the husband to the wife.
