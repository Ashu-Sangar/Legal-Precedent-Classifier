By the terms of the agreement the land described in the agreement is to be divided into lots, and a plan thereof made, which was done, and the plan offered in evidence in the case. The agents, the plaintiffs in this case, were directed to sell a sufficient number of these lots to realize the sum of $5,500, and the defendant agreed to convey the remainder of the lots to the plaintiffs. It may always be shown by parol that the plaintiffs in a bill for specific performance of the conveyance of real estate has performed his part of the agreement; for instance, if the consideration of the sale were the payment of money, the tender of the money could be shown by parol; and in this case, where <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>the consideration for the conveyance- of the land was the procuring of purchasers for a sufficient number of lots to aggregate the purchase price-of 15,500, it is competent to show by parol that the plaintiffs did so procure purchasers for certain lots at prices which aggregated $5,500 or more. That being shown, the agreement itself clearly points out what land remains, and the plaintiffs are not compelled to resort to parol testimony to show it; .in other words, the agreement points out the method by which the land to be conveyed to the plaintiffs can be ascertained and described; and our courts have always held, under such circumstances, that parol evidence may be admitted to so describe the land. This was clearly ruled in Peart v. Brice, <a href="/pa/152/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="152 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="838115" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0277-01">152 Pa. 277</a>.
