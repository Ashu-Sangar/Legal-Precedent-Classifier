The Board recommended removal of Respondent.

On October 23, 1986, a federal grand jury sitting in Philadelphia returned a sixty-one count indictment charging nineteen individuals with, <em>inter alia, </em>using kickback money from the Union’s Prepaid Legal Services Plan to make cash payments to public officials, including a number of judges. Pursuant to the public disclosure of this activity, the Board initiated the instant inquiry. The J.I.

A hearing was held on April 13, 1987, before a Hearing Committee comprised of three members of the Board. Based upon evidence elicited at this hearing, the Board found insufficient clear and convincing evidence to support a finding that Respondent received a gift from the Union in 1983 or 1984. The Board also concluded that as a matter of law Respondent’s invocation of his privilege against self-incrimination before the grand jury could not support an imposition of discipline, and thus dismissed the charges related to this conduct.</p>

      <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>With regard to the remaining charges, the Board made the following factual determinations. Respondent was elected to the Philadelphia Municipal Court for a six-year term commencing in January 1982. Thomas Brown, a former employee of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, distributed Christmas envelopes to judges of that court and the Philadelphia Municipal Court on behalf of the Roofers Union in the years 1983, 1984 and 1985. Brown testified during a videotaped deposition that, in December of 1985, he delivered two identical envelopes, each identified by three hash marks, to Respondent’s chambers, placed them on the desk where respondent was working at the time, and said to Respondent, “Merry Christmas from the Union.” William Markert, special assistant to Judge Glancey, informed the federal grand jury<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> that the judge had told him, also in December 1985, that there was an envelope for him from “Browny” on the judge’s desk. That envelope contained $300. Despite this contact between Brown and Judge Glancey, the latter told FBI agents, during an official investigation of the matter, that he had not seen Brown for a year prior to December 1985, and that he had never received any cash from Brown or officials of the Union. He further told agents that acceptance of cash under these circumstances would be a “very improper thing” for a judge to do and that he would not do anything like that.</p>
    <p id="b377-5" data-blocks='[["BL_377.4",377,[220,1669,1151,416]]]'>Based upon these facts, the Board found that Respondent had accepted $300 cash from the Roofers Union in 1985, and that he deliberately misinformed federal investigators upon denying receipt of cash from the Union. The Board concluded that this conduct warranted discipline under the constitutional and Code provisions charged, and a majority of the Board (with three members dissenting) recommended the removal of Respondent from his judicial office.</p>

Subsequent to the filing of these petitions but prior to oral argument, this Court filed its decision in <em>In the Matter of Cunningham, supra, </em>removing or suspending eight judges for improper conduct involving the Roofers Union. Thereafter Judge Glancey tendered his resignation to the Governor on March 16, 1988, effective March 31, 1988. The Respondent then filed a Motion for Summary D isposition of this matter acknowledging his resignation and consenting to the entry of an order declaring him ineligible for election to judicial office in the future. The basis for the request was that the intervening resignation rendered the pending charges moot. We reserved judgment on the motion until the time of oral argument. The matter was argued before this Court on April 13, 1988, and the issues are now ripe for disposition.</p>

This is a clear mandate of the people that ineligibility for future service must be part of the sanction imposed. Thus, the mere termination - of the present term of office does not comply with the constitutionally mandated punishment if the established conduct requires the imposition of the sanction of removal. Moreover, the binding effect of a gratuitous promise by a respondent not to seek or hold judicial office in this Commonwealth in the future is at best questionable.

While resignation would satisfy the first part of that responsibility, it does not satisfy the latter. Therefore, if our mandatory review of the record results in a judgment that removal would be the “proper and just” remedy, even accepting the fact of resignation as satisfying the termination of the present term, we must enter an order <em>based upon our finding </em>declaring a permanent ineligibility to hold judicial office in the future.</p>
