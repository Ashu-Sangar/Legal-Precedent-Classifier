The court took particular notice of the number of burglary charges then pending against Moss and the evidence of how the burglaries had been committed. From their timing and location, the court determined that the burglaries were not isolated incidents; in their planning and execution the court discerned a “high degree of sophistication.” The court stated at the hearing that, “I don’t think we have ever had a youngster with this number of arrests, burglary arrests, to say nothing of the seriousness of the three cases that I have before me, where a Court has sent him to Saint Gabriel’s [one of the facilities that had “accepted” Moss].” N.T. Certification Argument, p. 13. This alone rebuts Moss’s argument that the nature of the crime was the sole basis for the court’s decision. Instead, the court emphasized the degree of criminal sophistication Moss had apparently developed, and found secure detention necessary, which was unavailable at any facility. It is also rather clear that the court gave limited weight to the letters of acceptance as evidence of amenability to treatment, <em>see </em>N.T. Certification Argument, p. 15. Another court hearing the same evidence might have arrived at a decision more favorable to Moss. However, as have the trial court and Superior Court, we find no indication that the certifying judge abused her discretion in ruling as she did.</p>

Rather, the circumstances under which the information was given are part of the information that should be available to the magistrate so that he might make a neutral and detached decision about whether all the information shows probable cause.

The inference that the informant was unreliable remained just that, an inference, that might, but need not, be drawn.

    <p id="b444-9" data-blocks='[["BL_444.8",444,[240,900,1153,759]]]'>We do not accept Moss’s argument that his mother’s testimony that he asked for an attorney remains uncontradicted when fairly read in the context of the record as a whole. Much of the import of the detective’s responses depends on their inflection and tone, characteristics not subject to review from a transcript. It is well within reason to interpret the detective’s words as being a definite negative, subject only to the acknowledgment of a possible fault of memory — in essence, “Maybe what you say is true, but I don’t recall it that way.” Giving due deference to the conclusions of the suppression judge, who heard all the witnesses, was best able to pass on their credibility, and rejected Moss’s claim, we must likewise reject this argument.</p>
    <p id="b444-10" data-blocks='[["BL_444.9",444,[235,1736,1154,655]],["BL_445.1",445,[192,320,1149,425]]]'>Even were we to assume that Moss did ask for counsel, <em>Edwards </em>would not compel the suppression of his statement. The kind of police misconduct that resulted in suppression in <em>Edwards </em>was badgering, harassing insistence that the suspect make a statement during a long interval of incarceration when counsel was unavailable. In <em>Commonwealth v. Hubble, </em><a href="/pa/509/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="509 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1795316" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0497-01">509 Pa. 497</a>, <a href="/pa/509/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="509 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1795316" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0497-01">504 A.2d 168</a> (1986) (plurality opinion), it was noted that <em>Edwards </em>does not erect a “cone of silence” around a suspect with the simple utterance of the word lawyer. Courts must still determine, from all the circumstances, whether the suspect intentionally relinquished a known right. In <em>Edwards, </em>the Court sup<a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>pressed the fruits of a police initiated interrogation undertaken hours after the suspect had clearly stated that he wanted legal counsel, and only moments after he had said he didn’t want to talk to anyone. The police response was that he had to talk to them. The present facts reveal no similar insistence by the police that Moss answer questions despite a previous invocation of his rights to counsel and to remain silent.</p>
    <p id="b445-5" data-blocks='[["BL_445.4",445,[190,818,1150,1149]]]'>It cannot be ignored that at the time Moss was arrested, <em>Commonwealth v. McCutchen, </em><a href="/pa/463/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="463 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1708038" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0090-01">463 Pa. 90</a>, <a href="/pa/463/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="343 A.2d 669" data-case-ids="1708038,1708098" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0090-01,/pa/463/0089-01">343 A.2d 669</a> (1975), required that he be provided with an opportunity to confer with a parent or other informed, interested adult before being questioned. In compliance with this rule, the detective read the warning card to Moss in the presence of his mother, and then gave them an opportunity to confer in private before questioning Moss as to his understanding of the rights. It would require mechanical jurisprudence of the worst sort to find that the latter set of questions, designed to insure that Moss understood the rights that had been read and to ascertain whether he wished to invoke them, constitute police-initiated interrogation of the sort forbidden by <em>Edwards. </em>Nor can we accept Moss’s implication that by having him confer with his “distraught” mother, after which he waived rights he allegedly had previously asserted, the police improperly pressured him to reconsider. The suppression court’s determination that Moss understood his rights to remain silent and to have counsel present, and freely waived them, is supported by the record and will not be disturbed.</p>

It would appear, however, that the approach suggested would greatly expand the rule of the case on which it is premised, <em>Commonwealth v. Dixon, </em><a href="/pa/475/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="475 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1734071" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0017-01">475 Pa. 17</a>, <a href="/pa/475/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="475 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1734071" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0017-01">379 A.2d 553</a> (1977). There we invalidated a confession as the product of a waiver of rights not knowingly and intelligently given. Dixon was arrested for failure to abide by a restitution order imposed for a summary conviction, but questioned about the death of her son. Given the ambiguity of the situation, we held that the Commonwealth had not proven she had sufficient "awareness of the <em>general nature </em>of the transaction giving rise to the investigation,” citing <em>Commonwealth v. Richman, </em><a href="/pa/458/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="458 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="479711" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0167-01">458 Pa. 167</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=320%20A.2d%20351" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="320 A.2d 351">320 A.2d 351</a> (1974). We did not hold in <em>Dixon, </em>and we have never held, that a suspect must be informed of each and every crime under investigation. On the contrary, we have consistently held that the Commonwealth, in meeting its burden of proving a waiver was knowing and intelligent, may establish the circumstances attending the interrogation and the lack of ambiguity as to the questioning’s direction and purpose.</p>
