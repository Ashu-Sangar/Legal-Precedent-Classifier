Mr. Guerrero detained the two men and waited for the police to arrive. While doing so, Mr. Guerrero’s gun, which he had pointed at the throat of one of the robbers, accidentally discharged and severely injured the man.

      <em>Uncontrollable impulse has to do with the will; knowledge of consequences has to do with the understanding. </em>It is abundantly evident that the second element is traceable to the criminal law test of insanity in <em>M’Naghten’s Case. </em>But there is a decisive difference between the role of “insanity” in criminal law murder cases and in workmen’s compensation suicide cases. It can well be argued in a criminal case that the accused’s <em>understanding </em>is a crucial element, since it is necessary to the establishment of <em>mens rea </em>or criminal intent. But in the compensation suicide defense, the only legal issue is causation, and that in turn depends on the <em>will, </em>not on the understanding. If the injury so acts upon the will that it is not operating independently at the time of the suicide, then the chain of causation is clear, since there is no independent intervening cause. Whether the decedent knew the physical consequences of his act is utterly irrelevant to the question of causation.</blockquote>
