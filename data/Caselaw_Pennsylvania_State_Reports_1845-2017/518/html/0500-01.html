We hold that a strict liability standard is inappropriate and that at least some degree of scienter is required. When violations of the Liquor Code and its attendant laws and regulations are not the conduct under review, a licensee is liable only if he knew or should have known of the illegal activity and if he fails to prove substantial affirmative measures taken to eliminate a known pattern of illegal activity.</p>

In January, 1984, Ron Jacobs was employed as a doorman at Peter P’s, the licensed premises. On January 25, inside the restaurant, an informant and an undercover agent arranged to purchase heroin from Jacobs for $30. Jacobs refused to deliver the heroin in the restaurant, so the parties left and the exchange was made off the premises.</p>

The PLCB found: “The licensee, by its servants, agents or employes permitted the use of its licensed premises in the furtherance of the traffic in or use of a controlled substance, on January 25, 1984____” On appeal, a de novo hearing was held, and the court of common pleas sustained the license revocation. The Commonwealth Court, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the order of the common pleas court, reasoning that the violation occurred on the licensed premises.

We decline, however, to apply the rigid standard of strict liability when the subject conduct does not violate the liquor laws, but instead involves conduct prohibited by the Crimes Code, the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, or other penal legislation.

Two principles in particular are expressly approved. The first is that if a licensee knew or should have known of illegal activities by an employee or patron, the licensee is liable. The second principle is that a licensee may defend his license by demonstrating that he took substantial affirmative steps to guard against a known pattern of illegal <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>activities.

Defining “permitted” as “acquiesced by failing to prevent,” the court held that Bates had permitted the drug trafficking, due to the obvious nature of the activity <em>and </em>due to his failure to prove he took “substantial affirmative measures ... to eliminate a known pattern of use of and traffic in controlled substances on his premises____” <em>Id., </em>40 Pa.Cmwlth. at 431-32, <a href="/citations/?q=397%20A.2d%20851" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="397 A.2d 851">397 A.2d at 853</a>.

Only when the violation involves the Liquor Code or its related laws and regulations may a license be revoked without scienter on the part of the licensee.

Assuming, as he testified, that the licensee did not know of Jacobs’s activity, the record nonetheless establishes the existence of a pattern of drug trafficking at the establishment. A six-month investigation of Peter P’s had been conducted by Donald Way, an undercover narcotics agent. Agent Way testified that he was able to purchase drugs from a patron of the establishment, and that he observed drug sales between patrons, sales of stolen goods, the use of drugs in the bathroom, and a drug sale take place in the presence of the bartender. Due to the pervasive nature of this illicit activity, it may be said that the licensee should have known of the misconduct of his employee. That being the case, he is deemed to have permitted or acquiesced in the misconduct unless he proved that he took substantial affirmative measures to prevent it.</p>

He testified that he posted signs warning against drug use and instructed his employees that they should keep their eyes open for drugs and should bar any drug user from entering the establishment. Even this evidence was contradicted by the testimony of agent Way, who denied seeing any signs prohibiting drug sales or use at any time during his six-month investigation. The licensee himself provided further evidence that his remedial measures were insubstantial; he testified that although he hired Jacobs as doorman to stem the obvious drug trafficking, he had no personal knowledge of Jacobs’s character nor did he ask for character references. The record manifestly fails to prove that the licensee took the substantial affirmative steps necessary to avoid license revocation in the face of an obvious pattern of misconduct under the drug laws.</p>
