There was also evidence that his hotel received no benefit as a result of the new Pittsburgh convention center. The effect of the tax was to require Monzo to subsidize his downtown competition in exchange for no observable benefit. Further, Monzo was able to show that because the tax increased the cost of an Allegheny County room, he lost business to competing hotels in Westmoreland County. In addition, officials of the <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>Allegheny County Authority and the Pittsburgh Convention and Visitors Bureau testified that the convention center would only benefit hotels and other businesses in downtown Pittsburgh. They also testified that distance from the convention center was a critical factor and the further a hotel was from the center of Pittsburgh the less convention business it could expect. There was no proof of any kind— either legislative findings or factual evidence — that the Pittsburgh Convention Center would benefit the county. Moreover, the Allegheny County tax was levied upon all hotels in Allegheny County which encompasses several municipalities surrounding the City of Pittsburgh, in contrast to Philadelphia where the City and County are one and the same.</p>

These are virtually the same claims as were raised in <em>Monzo. </em>However, in contrast to <em>Monzo, </em>neither the facts upon which the claims are based, nor the evidence presented at trial here support these claims. Appellant has failed to provide any evidence that the Tax or the new convention center will cause actual harm to the Partnership business. The evidence of record shows that even Appellant’s expert concedes that Appellant receives some benefit in the form of some convention business and displaced commercial demand. (Laventhol Report, App. 7a, 20a.) Appellant has also failed to show that the taxing scheme imposes unequal tax burdens upon persons otherwise similarly situated. <em>Commonwealth v.

While Appellant claims that the Tax reduces its revenues and that the Tax has discouraged it from ráising its rates, the trial court found that there was no evidence to substantiate these claims. The trial court further found that Appellant “failed to prove that the three percent (3%) differential (resulting from the Tax) between its rates and the rates of its airport area competitors affects its business. Given Plaintiff’s high occupancy rate, the Tax cannot be said to have resulted in an actual loss of business.” <em>Leventhal v. The City of Philadelphia, </em>June Term, 1987, No. 1849 (slip opinion at 11). The trial court also noted that this was in stark contrast to <em>Monzo, </em>where there was evidence that <em>Monzo’s </em>hotel had lost considerable business because <em>of </em>that tax and the Pittsburgh Convention Center.</p>

In <em>Monzo, </em>the evidence showed that Monzo would receive no convention business. Another critical difference between this case and <em>Monzo </em>is that here the Tax applies only to hotels in Philadelphia, whereas in <em>Monzo, </em>hotels in municipalities outside of Pittsburgh, but within Allegheny County, were subject to the tax; The record here clearly establishes that the Partnership will benefit from the proposed convention center, and that the burden imposed upon Appellant by the Tax is not palpably disproportionate to the benefit received. Nor do the Act and the Tax violate the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution or the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution.

The Legislature made specific findings that: (a) the general welfare of this Commonwealth is dependent upon the continual encouragement, development, growth and expansion of business, commerce and tourism within the Commonwealth; (b) the development of a major convention center is most appropriate in a city of the first class; (c) the purpose of such a center should be the promotion of business and tourism in such a city; and (d) the development of such a convention center will provide benefits to the hotel industry throughout the entire area of such a city where such a <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>center is developed. <em>53 </em>Pa.S. § 16202.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

In contrast to <em>Monzo, </em>the Philadelphia Convention Center is not a special purpose project from which only a small group will benefit, rather it will benefit all of Philadelphia. Further, in <em>Monzo, </em>all hotels in every, city, borough and township in- Allegheny County were taxed to support a Convention Center for the City of Pittsburgh, which is only one of 127 municipalities in the County of Allegheny, while here only hotels in Philadelphia are taxed to support the Philadelphia Convention Center.</p>
