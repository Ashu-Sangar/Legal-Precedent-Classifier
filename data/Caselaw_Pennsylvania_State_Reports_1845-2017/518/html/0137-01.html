    <p id="b240-10" data-blocks='[["BL_240.11",240,[224,1604,1152,465]]]'>I respectfully dissent. In my view, the trial judge acted in accordance with the expressed intent of statutory provisions governing equitable distribution of marital property by taking into consideration certain impending tax ramifications relevant to the process of determining a valuation for the shares of stock in question. The judge applied a 10% factor to reflect the likelihood and amount of income tax liability, and, in doing so, it cannot be said that an abuse of discretion occurred.</p>
