In connection with the murder conviction, a separate sentencing hearing was held, as required by 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711, and appellant was sentenced to death. The instant direct appeal ensued.</p>

Specifically, on August 11, 1984, at approximately 5:30 A.M., the victim’s ground floor apartment in the Northeast section of the City of Philadelphia was forcibly entered through a window screen. Upon entry, the burglar ripped the telephone cord from the wall and proceeded to the victim’s bedroom. A bizarre and brutal attack followed. Over a period of time, the victim was stripped, tied about the wrists and legs with a Venetian blind cord, stabbed numerous times with an onion peeler and another knife, jabbed with straight pins about her feet, and sexually assaulted. The apartment was ransacked, and a small amount of money was taken. A neighbor, upon hearing the victim’s cries for help, summoned the police. Two patrol cars soon arrived at the scene, whereupon one of <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>the police officers saw a man fleeing from beside the apartment building. The officer did not, however, succeed in apprehending the man at that time. Appellant was arrested and charged with the crime three days later. The victim died two weeks after the crime as a result of the injuries sustained.</p>

    <p id="b506-7" data-blocks='[["BL_506.6",506,[218,1434,1154,853]]]'>The evidence linking appellant to the crime consisted of, inter alia, the following. The police officer who was summoned to the crime scene and saw a man beside the victim’s apartment building made a positive in-court identification of the man as appellant, and testified that the man ran away as soon as a police searchlight was aimed at him. The identification was based upon the officer’s observation of the man for twenty seconds in the light of dawn, as well as light from the searchlight, at a distance of thirty feet. The observation included a frontal view of the man’s face. At the time of the incident the officer described the man as a white male, of thin build, approximately 5'8" to 5'10" in height, with a receding hairline. That description corresponded to one later given by the victim, who described her attacker as a white male, of slight build, approximately 5'7" to 5'9" in height, wearing a mask.</p>

The resident reported that, just hours before the crime in question, she saw “Bill” looking through her apartment window. She told police that “Bill” resided in an apartment building behind that of the victim, and described “Bill” as a white man, weighing 140 pounds, approximately 5'7" to 5'9" in height, with a receding hairline. Plainclothes police officers went to the apartment building to examine the mailboxes, hoping to learn the surname of “Bill.” While examining the mailboxes, one of the officers was approached by appellant, and appellant inquired about the officer’s purpose in being there. The officer, realizing that appellant matched the description of “Bill,” said he was looking for another individual, and gave as the name of the individual a name randomly selected from the mailboxes. Appellant offered to go and get the individual, but then disappeared behind a locked door and fled from the scene. The plainclothes officers gave pursuit, identifying themselves as police officers and ordering appellant to stop. Appellant ignored their commands, however, and escaped.</p>
    <p id="b507-5" data-blocks='[["BL_507.4",507,[200,1475,1153,637]]]'>Subsequent investigation revealed that “Bill” was actually named William Holland, appellant herein, and that appellant resided in the apartment building with his mother. On August 14, 1984, three days after the crime, appellant was located by police at the nearby home of his grandmother. Appellant voluntarily accompanied police to a police station and made a number of incriminating statements, including two confessions that were later introduced at trial. The confessions included very detailed and complete admissions as to appellant’s role in the crime. Based upon this evidence, it is clear that appellant’s guilt has been established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

It is alleged that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the instruction on voluntariness, inasmuch as it did not include <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>elements such as the burden of proof as to voluntariness, the duty to disregard statements involuntarily issued, etc. The charge given by the court was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.4",508,[275,497,1108,420]]]'>There was some talk, too, about the statement that was given. Of course, a statement must be voluntary. Now, to be voluntary, a defendant’s statement must be the product of an essentially free will and choice after being warned of his rights. If a defendant’s will and ability to choose are overborn by physical or mental pressure, any statement which he then makes would be then involuntary.</blockquote>
    <p id="b508-6" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[232,934,1151,526]]]'>There is no need, however, to discuss this charge in detail, for the circumstances of this case are such that no charge on voluntariness was required. Thus, any alleged inadequacies in the charge were necessarily of an inconsequential nature. Examination of the record reveals that the trial court provided the instruction relating to voluntariness merely as a comment upon some of the matters mentioned in counsel’s arguments to the jury, rather than on grounds there was evidence in the record placing the question of voluntariness before the jury.</p>

    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[176,761,1153,738]]]'>At trial, the Commonwealth introduced extensive testimony regarding the circumstances under which appellant confessed to the crime. According to that testimony appellant voluntarily accompanied officers to the police station, whereupon he was fully informed of his constitutional rights and proceeded to admit his guilt, under circumstances that provided not even a trace of coercion. The sole basis relied upon by appellant in asserting that a full instruction on voluntariness should have been given is the fact that trial counsel argued to the jury that the confessions were not voluntarily given. Counsel’s arguments, however, cannot be employed to create trial issues for submission to the jury, when the issues lack any basis in the record.</p>
    <p id="b509-6" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[174,1527,1153,851]],["BL_510.1",510,[263,332,1154,792]]]'>Trial counsel’s argument in this case, insofar as it addressed the matter of voluntariness, was based solely upon one fact. Specifically, earlier in the day on which appellant issued his confessions, before appellant was located by police, appellant’s mother spoke on the telephone with her other son, who happened to be a police officer in the same district where the crime occurred. She told him that police had been to her apartment in connection with an investigation of the crime in question, with reference to appellant’s possible involvement. In response, he expressed concern for his brother, the appellant, and told his mother that if appellant continued to run from police, the consequence could be that appellant would eventually be injured or shot. There is <em>no </em>evidence that the possibility of such a consequence was ever communicated to appellant. Further, when appellant arrived at the police station where he subse<a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>quently issued his confessions, his brother was there but said nothing to him, other than perhaps “hello,” and refrained from being present while appellant spoke to the other officers. In short, there is not a scintilla of evidence that the expression of concern by appellant’s brother related in any way to the confessions obtained. Under the circumstances, there was no basis in the record to support charging the jury on the voluntariness of the confessions. Trial counsel was not, therefore, ineffective for failing to object to the charge, inasmuch as a charge relating to voluntariness would have been without proper foundation in the record. See <em>Commonwealth v.

Specifically, two police officers testified regarding the circumstances under which the confessions were obtained, describing in detail matters such as appellant’s behavior, the conduct of the officers who were present, the manner in which appellant was informed of his constitutional rights, etc. After testifying to these matters, each officer was asked whether the confessions were the product of appellant’s free will. Both officers gave their opinions that the confessions were indeed the product of free will.

    <p id="b515-5" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[195,492,1153,1122]]]'>The next contention raised by appellant is that the trial court erred in instructing the jury at the sentencing hearing with regard to the manner in which aggravating and mitigating circumstances were to be considered, and, thus, that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the charge. The sentencing statute provides that, if the jury finds one or more of the aggravating circumstances enumerated in the statute to be present, and at the same time finds one or more of the enumerated mitigating circumstances to be present, then the jury must return a sentence of death if the aggravating circumstances “outweigh” the mitigating circumstances. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(c)(l)(iv). In instructing the jury on this aspect of the sentencing statute, the trial court committed an error. Instead of instructing that aggravating and mitigating circumstances were to be “weighed,” which would permit qualitative considerations to be taken into account, the court instructed that a quantitative approach should be applied. Specifically, the court informed the jury that the sentence should be death if there were “more” aggravating circumstances than mitigating circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b515-6" data-blocks='[["BL_515.5",515,[193,1633,1154,746]],["BL_516.1",516,[239,321,1149,148]]]'>The instruction was, indeed, erroneous, but it is clear that appellant would have suffered no prejudice thereby. The jury in this case found three aggravating circumstances and <em>no </em>mitigating circumstances. Thus, there were no mitigating circumstances to be “weighed” against aggravating circumstances, and, accordingly, any error in instructing the jury as to the manner in which a “weighing” process should be conducted was necessarily harmless. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Morales, </em><a href="/pa/508/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="508 Pa. 51" data-case-ids="1794010" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0051-01">508 Pa. 51</a>, <a href="/pa/508/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="494 A.2d 367" data-case-ids="1794010,1794053" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0051-01,/pa/508/0050-01">494 A.2d 367</a> (1985) (death penalty need not be vacated where deficiencies at sentencing stage would not have prejudiced the defendant). In short, this is a case where a sentence of death was plainly required by the sentencing statute, and considerations involving “weighing” were simply not relevant. When one or <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>more aggravating circumstances are present, and no mitigating circumstances are found, a jury is <em>required </em>to return a verdict of death. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(c)(1)(iv).</p>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[230,494,1158,1322]]]'>Further, we find no merit in appellant’s argument that the defective instruction on “weighing” could have caused the jury to refrain from conducting any deliberations on the question of whether mitigating circumstances were present. In essence, appellant contends that once the jury determined that three aggravating circumstances were present, it may have ceased deliberations in the belief that there was no possibility of finding three or “more” mitigating circumstances. However, the question of whether mitigating circumstances are present is separate and apart from the question of whether, once they are found to exist, the mitigating circumstances are sufficient to prevail over the aggravating circumstances. The record shows that the jury was thoroughly and competently instructed on the subject of what would constitute mitigating circumstances, and there is no reason to believe that the instructions on that subject were ignored. To no extent did the instructions convey an impression that mitigating circumstances were not to be reported if the aggravating circumstances were such as to result in a sentence of death. Further, in announcing the verdict, the jury foreman expressly stated the jury’s finding that <em>no </em>mitigating circumstances were present. Thus, we find no basis to believe that the jury failed to conduct deliberations on the subject of mitigating circumstances.</p>

We have examined the record, and, in view of the factual circumstances of this crime, described supra, and the fact that appellant has been convicted of numerous robberies involving threatened use <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>of a gun in the past, it is clear that the evidence establishes the relevant aggravating circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.

Testimony from appellant’s mother and grandmother indicated that appellant had, years previously as a child, been troubled with loneliness and nervousness, and that he was basically a good and helpful child who started to get in trouble as he got older, and that appellant never met with much acceptance or success in life. At the time of the instant crime, appellant was approximately twenty-six years of age. The testimony indicated that, during his life as an adult, appellant had never been successful in gaining employment, due to his prison record. One of appellant’s friends testified, too, stating that appellant had been good to her and expressing her hope, therefore, that appellant would not be put to death. Thus, the evidence offered on appellant’s behalf was directed primarily at an attempt to prove the mitigating circumstance set forth in 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(8), consisting of “evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.”</p>

We do not agree. The charge informed the jury that an issue to be considered was “whether the killing in this case was accompanied by aggravating or mitigating circumstances,” and it described the verdicts that should be rendered, based upon whether the crime was “accompanied” by various combinations of <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The charge then instructed the jury to determine “what circumstances caused this killing.” Appellant contends that there may have been circumstances that did not play a causative role in the killing, but which nevertheless “accompanied” the killing, and that such circumstances would not have been considered by the jury as a result of the manner in which the charge was phrased. We are not convinced that, when read as a whole, the charge did have that effect, but, even assuming arguendo that the charge focused the jury’s attention on causative factors, the record of the instant case provides no basis for belief that appellant was prejudiced.</p>
    <p id="b518-4" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[233,987,1159,1231]]]'>Appellant has not specified or even suggested any mitigating circumstances, of a non-causative nature, that might have been supported by the record in this case. Indeed, appellant’s brief for the present appeal merely argues that the charge improperly burdened appellant with respect to “whatever” mitigating circumstances he was trying to establish. An examination, of the record reveals no basis for finding that the defense met its burden of proving the existence of non-causative mitigating circumstances. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(c)(l)(iii) (“[Mjitigating circumstances must be proved by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence.”) Testimony offered by the defense at the sentencing hearing focused almost exclusively upon appellant’s background, and was offered for the inference that appellant’s troubled background was a causative factor in the instant crime. Although appellant’s mother, grandmother, and another friend indicated that they hoped appellant would not be put to death, their hopes alone certainly did not constitute evidence of mitigating circumstances. Thus, we do not believe that appellant could have been prejudiced by the charge, even if the charge was understood by the jury as emphasizing circumstances having a causal relationship to the crime.</p>

Frey, </em><a href="/pa/504/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="504 Pa. 428" data-case-ids="1787710" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0428-01">504 Pa. 428</a>, 443, <a href="/pa/504/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="504 Pa. 428" data-case-ids="1787710" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0428-01">475 A.2d 700</a>, 707-708 (1984), cert. denied, <a href="/us/469/0963-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="469 U.S. 963" data-case-ids="12034269,12034334" data-case-paths="/us/469/0963-01,/us/469/0963-02">469 U.S. 963</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20S.%20Ct.%20360" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="105 S.

Our review of cases wherein the aggravating circumstances set forth in subsections (d)(6), (d)(8), and (d)(9) were present, and where no mitigating circumstances were present, such being the circumstances of the present case, discloses that a death sentence has been imposed in every case. Thus, appellant’s sentence of death is neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases. Further, the record does not provide any basis for belief that the sentence imposed was the “product of passion, prejudice or any <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>other arbitrary factor,” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(h)(3)(i). Accordingly, the sentence must be affirmed.</p>
