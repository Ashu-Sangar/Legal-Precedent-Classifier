They operate their business at several loca<a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>tions in Pennsylvania. The one at issue here is a 160 acre facility in Chartiers Township. The physical characteristics of this tract are such that the landfill contains two distinct valleys surrounded by a buffer area of varying dimensions no less than 25 feet at any given point. The west valley is comprised of approximately 30 acres and the east valley totals approximately 50 acres. Until the time of this litigation waste disposal had occurred exclusively in the west valley, with soil cover operations primarily taking place in the. east valley. However, Chambers had prepared the east valley for eventual dumping, and is presently utilizing this valley in its operations.</p>

Martin, Inc., presently a subsidiary of Chambers, operated the property as a sanitary landfill. Chambers subsequently converted the landfill into a modern waste treatment plant facility, fully licensed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (hereinafter “DER”). Under the present DER permit, which covers the entire 160 acres and calls for the landfill operations in both valleys, Chambers is authorized to process a maximum daily volume of 2,000 cubic yards or its equivalent in tonnage.</p>

This resulted in an increase in daily tonnage intake at the landfill. Disposal sites are at a premium everywhere, and those localities that have them are jealous of their use. The first to respond to the new contracts was the DER, who notified respondents that they intended to issue new regulations restricting the intake volume of solid waste that a landfill might accept, and that a significant increase above the daily allowed volume of <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>2,000 cubic yards or its equivalent in tonnage would require permit modification. Accordingly, respondents filed for a new permit with DER, and filed an equity action in Commonwealth Court challenging the legality of the new regulations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> For the present it is sufficient to say that those contentions are now being pursued and argued in their natural course, and are not the issues presently before us. What is before us is the basic contention of Chartiers Township that the increased use of the trash site is an expansion of a pre-existing nonconforming use that requires a zoning variance.</p>

Zoning Hearing Board, </em>36 Pa. Cmwlth. 509, <a href="/citations/?q=388%20A.2d%20347" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="388 A.2d 347">388 A.2d 347</a> (1978); <em>Casilio and Sons v.

However, it appears to contradict what this Court has previously said; that is, that the operator of a nonconforming use may incorporate modern technology into his business without fear of losing that business. <em>See Davis Appeal, supra; Firth v. Scherzberg, supra.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b285-6" data-blocks='[["BL_285.5",285,[192,1123,1152,580]]]'>Perhaps the motivation behind <em>Putkowski, </em>i.e., that in today’s fast changing world a modern innovation can alter a use so dramatically as to place it beyond what was ever intended to be allowed, will force us one day to reconsider our prior decisions. However, the fact remains that at the time of this litigation the controlling law in this subject favored Chambers’ position. Thus, in its application for a stay, Chambers did successfully satisfy the first prong of the <em>Process Gas </em>criteria, since it appears that the Township had no actionable claim against Chambers for the accelerated use of its property.</p>
    <p id="b285-7" data-blocks='[["BL_285.6",285,[191,1722,1152,203]]]'>We now must proceed to consider the other criteria of <em>Process Gas. </em>As noted above, the second prong of that criteria is whether the petitioner for the stay, Chambers in this case, has shown that it will suffer irreparable injury.</p>
    <p id="b285-8" data-blocks='[["BL_285.7",285,[190,1945,1152,418]],["BL_286.1",286,[272,303,1152,536]]]'>At the hearing before the trial court, a vice-president of operations for Chambers testified that the company would be affected severely and suffer irreparable harm should it be precluded from accepting the New Jersey waste. In the past Chambers has used increased revenues to help offset the escalating costs associated with the operation of the landfill. Without this additional revenue, Chambers contended, this would be impossible and consequently the com<a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>pany could foresee an increase in price to local communities utilizing the site. Furthermore, Chambers maintained that the above scenario would necessitate a reduction in personnel hired to accommodate the increased business. Finally, the company argued that it will suffer both loss of reputation and future business should it be unable to comply with these contracts. Since these allegations were not challenged by the Township at the hearing we will accept them as evidence of the irreparable harm Chambers will suffer should the stay not be granted.</p>
    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[267,872,1155,638]]]'>The remaining criteria of <em>Process Gas </em>require the court to determine whether the issuance of the stay will substantially harm other interested parties, and whether it will adversely affect the public interest. In essence what Chambers is required to show at this stage is the converse of what the Township was required to demonstrate at the preliminary injunction hearing; namely, that without the requested relief, the Township would suffer immediate and irreparable harm. To this end we must again look to the record before the .trial court to determine what, if any, harm would inure to the Township if the injunction is denied.</p>
    <p id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[263,1552,1153,810]]]'>A review of the record reveals that the only evidence offered by the Township of potential harm was directed solely towards the reduction of the useful life of the landfill from approximately 38 years to 20 years. Since the operation of this landfill is a private concern Chambers’ accelerated dissipation of its principal asset, the land, is not an assertable claim of the Township. Nothing more was offered by the Township. Absent from the record was testimony that the increase in operations by Chambers would either adversely affect the surrounding neighbors in the enjoyment of their property or that traffic congestion would increase due to the additional trucks using the site. At no time was it demonstrated to the court that the increased activity would adversely affect the health, safety or welfare of the community.</p>

In addition to the equity complaint Chambers concurrently filed with the court an application for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin DER from implementing and enforcing its new daily volume program as it applied to Chambers. Two days later, Commonwealth Court granted the injunction. DER appealed the order to this Court and also filed preliminary objections challenging the failure of Chambers to exhaust its statutory remedies. On October 26, 1987, Commonwealth Court sustained DER's preliminary objections, and also dissolved the injunction entered against DER. <em>See Chambers Development Company, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Resources, </em>110 Pa.Cmwlth. 432, <a href="/pa-commw/110/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="532 A.2d 928" data-case-ids="1364556" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/110/0432-01">532 A.2d 928</a> (1987). In light of that this Court on November 24, 1987, issued a <em>per curiam </em>order dismissing DER's appeal of the injunction as moot. Chambers also appealed the October 26, 1987, Commonwealth Court order sustaining DER’s preliminary objections to this Court. We in turn treated this appeal as a petition for allowance of appeal, and denied the petition on November 24, 1987.</p>
