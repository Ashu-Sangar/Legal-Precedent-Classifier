As such, claimant asserts that the possibility of correctibility by reasonable surgery is irrelevant to and has been eliminated by the stipulated inquiry. This reasoning is erroneous, since the correctibility of the injury is critical to determining whether the loss of the use of the eye is permanent and thus compensable as a specific loss. This is especially clear in light of the requirement that the specific loss must be “permanent” in order for a claimant to prevail under the Act. <em>See </em>Section 306(c) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 513. In short, whether claimant sustained a specific loss of his eye is dependent upon whether he sustained “the permanent loss <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>of use of the injured member for all practical intents and purposes.” The loss of use of a member is not permanent where medical procedures will restore some or all of its function.

In <em>Muse, </em>the employer sought to terminate the claimant’s disability benefits on the theory that the claimant refused reasonable medical treatment that would have corrected his injury and would have enabled him to return to work. The statutory authority for the employer’s action in this regard was Section 306(f)(4) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 531(4).</p>

There is no longer a statutory requirement that the employer actually <em>tender </em>the services to the employee before the forfeiture provisions of Section 306(f)(4) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 531(f)(4), apply.

Thereafter, the employer may seek to terminate disability benefits on the authority of Sections 306(a) and 306(b) of the Act, 77 P.S. §§ 511, 512, which specifically provide that compensation shall be paid so long as the disability continues. A termination proceed<a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>ing will then be commenced, perhaps on the basis of Section 306(f)(4) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 531(4), or simply on the ground that the employee is no longer disabled. In a specific loss case, there is no need for a subsequent proceeding after a determination that a qualifying specific loss has been sustained. However, since the legislature included specific loss cases within the context of Section 306(f)(4) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 531(4), it is clear that the issue of an employee’s refusal of reasonable medical services may be considered at the appropriate forum, <em>i.e., </em>at the entitlement hearing.

If an injury can be corrected with reasonable medical treatment, it is axiomatic that the use of the injured body part is not permanently lost. A claimant who declines to avail himself of reasonable medical or surgical procedures to ameliorate his condition should not at the same time be permitted to collect benefits for a permanent loss.
