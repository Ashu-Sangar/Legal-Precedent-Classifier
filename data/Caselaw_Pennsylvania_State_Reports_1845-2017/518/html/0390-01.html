The plaintiffs therefore avoid the possibility of an unfavorable result against the settling defendant, and recovery to the extent of the settlement agreement is assured.

The DeFazios contended that as a result of the negligent treatment of Mr. DeFazio by the named doctors it became necessary to amputate his left index finger and part of his left hand. Before trial, the DeFazios executed a joint tortfeasors release with Dr. Labe. At the close of their case, the DeFazios made a motion for voluntary non-suit as to Dr. Labe pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 230.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> However, the motion was denied on grounds that a <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>cross-claim had been filed against Dr. Labe by Dr. Guttman. Dr. Labe was represented by counsel and participated in the trial; the DeFazios, however, presumably because of the settlement, presented equivocal evidence to suggest negligence by Dr. Labe. Rather, the evidence focused on Dr. Guttman’s claimed negligence. The DeFazios’ theory of liability was centered on Dr. Guttman’s alleged negligence in failing to remove a tube which he had placed in Mr. DeFazio’s finger to irrigate it and rid it of infection. The DeFazios’ expert witness, Dr. Mark Nissenbaum, testified that Dr. Guttman deviated from the standard of orthopedic surgeons practicing in the community by leaving the irrigation tube in Mr. DeFazio’s finger for an extended period of time even though there was no sign of improvement. Dr. Martin Beller, an orthopedic surgeon, testified as a defense expert and disputed Dr. Nissenbaum’s contention, stating that Dr. Guttman did, in fact, conform to the medical standards of the community.</p>

The DeFazios sought judgment n.o.v. on the ground that the percentage of negligence assessed against Dr. Labe was legally unsupportable.

Subsequently, the trial judge stated in his opinion that his decision to dismiss Dr. Guttman’s motion for judgment n.o.v. was not predicated on the procedural deficiencies of the motion, that <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>is, a violation of Local Rule 240. Rather, Judge Wright determined that the motion was equally without substance on the merits. (Slip opinion at 4). The parties cross appealed and the Superior Court affirmed the trial court’s dismissal of DeFazios’ post-verdict motion. However, the Superi- or Court found that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing Dr. Guttman’s post-trial motions on the basis of a Rule 240 violation. The Superior Court reversed and remanded for determination on the merits of the issues set forth in Dr. Guttman’s motions for judgment n.o.v. and/or new trial.</p>

      <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>Regarding the first issue, the DeFazios contend that the Superior Court misread the trial court’s order and opinion. In reversing the trial court, the Superior Court stated in its opinion that “[t]he trial court, acting <em>sua sponte, </em>interpreted the rule [Philadelphia Local Rule 240(c)(4)] to require dismissal of post-trial motions where counsel failed to forward to the court reporter a monetary deposit required for transcription of the notes of testimony.” <em>Defazio v.

DeFazios argue that the trial court’s dismissal was not an automatic dismissal under Rule 240. Rather, referring to the trial court’s order of April 26, 1984<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">3</a>, they aver that the dismissal was a permissible exercise of discretion expressly authorized by Rule 240 in light of Dr. Guttman generally proceeding in a dilatory fashion. Clearly, until the notes of testimony are transcribed and filed, the matter is delayed and cannot proceed to a final determination. The court reporter is not required to furnish a transcript until satisfactory arrangements for payment are made.</p>

The trial court concluded that an “order” without payment was not an “order” under the Rule. The Superior Court held, however, that the word “order” did not adequately advise counsel that a transcript had to be paid for or that sanctions would follow for non payment. This reading of the rule gives no attention to its obvious purpose. A transcript order is required to be placed promptly so that there will be a transcript and a prompt disposition of the pending motions. Under the Superior Court’s reading, an attorney can comply with the Rule merely by requesting the transcript and then control the timing of the procedure by delaying payment. This is contrary to the spirit of the Rule which is intended to permit the court to exert a measure of control over post-trial proceedings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">4</a>
