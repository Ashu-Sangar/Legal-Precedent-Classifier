That section, added to the Code by Act 1979-97, provides that “a school entity shall realign its professional staff so as to insure that more senior employes are provided with the opportunity to fill positions for which they are certificated and which are being filled by less senior employes.” The New Castle Area School District appeals by allowance a Commonwealth Court order reversing an order of the Lawrence County Court of Common Pleas on the basis of Section 1125.1(c) 93 Pa.Cmwlth. 28, <a href="/citations/?q=500%20A.2d%20922" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="500 A.2d 922">500 A.2d 922</a>.

Gibbons was reassigned as assistant principal at the senior high school, a position carrying the same salary as principal.</p>

Lack of administrative experience with a high school or program of similar size was thought to be detrimental to the efficient operation of the high school, especially during the transition period when the ninth grade was being added.</p>

The trial court read Section 1125.1(c) to require realignment only where the complaining professional was certified to assume a position being held by a less senior professional. The court also stated in dictum that even if a more extensive realignment was required by Section 1125.1(c) to accommodate the seniority of the staff members, the impact of such a realignment on the educational process was a valid consideration for the school board.</p>

    <p id="b544-7" data-blocks='[["BL_544.6",544,[255,1263,1155,632]]]'>Since <em>Shestack, </em>the first case involving application of Section 1125.1(c), Commonwealth Court has relied heavily on the fact that the words of the statute are clear and free from ambiguity. In that case, the court determined that the procedural protections of Section 1125.1, that is, a hearing in accordance with the Local Agency Law, are available to challenge a <em>demotion </em>inconsistent with the seniority preference stated in subsection (c), even though the title of the section refers only to “Persons to be <em>suspended </em>” (emphasis added).

There is, ordinarily, a purposeful distinction between a <em>sub </em>section and an independent section of a statute. The former, by its nature, is placed within a context, and thereby limited to a degree that the latter is not. Section 1125.1, like its predecessor, established a legislative policy on how school districts are to reduce staff while protecting the job security interests of <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>tenured professional employees. It would give undue weight to the seniority preference of subsection (c), which is only a constituent part of this policy, to remove it from this context and treat it as an overarching statement of the primacy of seniority in the placement of professionals generally. Nothing about Act 1979-97 indicates that it was intended to alter the longstanding statutory grant of discretion to school boards to appoint professional staff on the basis of the educational needs of the district, <em>see, </em>24 P.S. § 5-508, beyond requiring that the diminishment of professional employees’ status be accomplished according to seniority. We will not impute to the General Assembly an intention to so drastically change (and reduce) the authority of school boards over such matters, requiring them to “assign positions to their professional staff strictly on the basis of seniority,” <em>Appeal of Cowden, </em><a href="/pa-commw/87/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="87 Pa.

We likewise reject, as unreasonable, a reading of Section 1125.1(c) that would produce the same effect, but trigger its implementation only when a school district finds it necessary to “realign” its staff.</p>

We agree with the view expressed by <em>amicus curiae </em>Pennsylvania Association of Elementary and Secondary School Principals that Section 1125.1 operates to allocate only the <em>adverse </em>effects of employment changes in order of seniority from least to greatest, allowing, even requiring if necessary, a more senior employee to “bump” a less senior one of equal or lesser status. It is beyond the purpose of that <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>section, however, to require a professional to be promoted or advanced in status. By returning the two administrators with least seniority to teaching positions, and giving Gibbons the opportunity to fill one of the positions thus vacated, the board fully complied with Section 1125.1(c).</p>

In reversing that court, we recognize that the matter is far from free of doubt.

Clearly, the Legislature added demoted professional employees to its law regarding the reinstatement of suspended professional employees (section 1125.1(d)(2)) because the Legislature recognized that demotions due to staff realignment were already subject to the seniority law set forth in section 1125.1(c), and the legislators were seeking to make clear that all suspensions or demotions for whatever reason <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>are to be determined solely on the basis of seniority and certification.</p>
    <p id="b548-4" data-blocks='[["BL_548.4",548,[236,441,1152,584]]]'>The purpose of section 1125.1 was to put certainty into the law by making seniority and certification the <em>only </em>factors to be considered when staff changes are required due to reduced student enrollment and course offerings, consolidation, reorganization or staff realignment. This issue was debated at length in the Legislature. <em>See </em>Legislative Journal-House at 1117-45, 1191-1200, 1203-16 (June 4 and 6, 1979). A minority of legislators attempted, by amendment, to retain the old rating system, which was subject to the whim and discretion of local administrators, but these attempts were soundly defeated. <em><a href="/citations/?q=437%20A.2d%201059" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="437 A.2d 1059">Id.</a></em>
