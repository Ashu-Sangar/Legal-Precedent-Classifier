Counsel was appointed, an amended petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA) was filed, and a hearing was scheduled for July 28, 1981. Appellant, who had by then been released on parole, failed to appear at the hearing, and the PCHA judge dismissed the petition for want of prosecution. The judge later vacated his dismissal order and held a hearing on November 23, 1981, to determine whether the appellant had been properly notified of the July 28 hearing which he had failed to attend. Following the hearing, the judge found that the appellant had received notice of the July 28 hearing and had no excuse for his absence. The dismissal order was thus reinstated. The appellant’s counsel then filed an untimely appeal from the dismissal of the PCHA petition, and the appeal was quashed by the Superior Court. <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, the implication by Superior Court that the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and <em>McClendon, <a href="/pa/495/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="495 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1770748" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0467-01">supra,</a> </em>governed the withdrawal of counsel in this case is erroneous. When, in the exercise of his professional judgment, counsel determines that the issues raised under the PCHA are meritless, and when the PCHA court concurs, counsel will be permitted to withdraw and the petitioner may proceed pro se, or by privately retained counsel, or not at all. The same procedure should be followed at any stage of the collateral proceedings, whether in a trial or appellate court. Inasmuch as the United States Supreme Court decided in <em>Pennsylvania v.
