Clemmer (Clemmers) and Dawn Lenore Kratz to demolish and remove a building on their property, and ordered the Clemmers to pay the sum of $36,000 as damages, fine and civil penalty for violations of municipal ordinances. The Township raises three principal questions: (1) whether the appellee, Dawn Lenore Kratz, was properly joined as an additional defendant and therefore, within the jurisdiction of the court; (2) whether the lower court order directing appellees to demolish the “residential structure” under construction on their property was within the power of the court to order; and (3) whether a court sitting in equity may impose damages, fine and penalty for violations of municipal ordinances. The Commonwealth Court held that Dawn Lenore Kratz was not properly joined; that the lower court did not have the authority to order the residential shell demolished; and that the lower court lacked the authority to impose damages, fine and civil penalty for local ordinance violations. 101 Pa.Cmwlth. 341, <a href="/pa-commw/101/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="516 A.2d 412" data-case-ids="1354256" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/101/0341-01">516 A.2d 412</a>.

The Clemmer property is located on Gravel Pike in Lower Frederick Township in an R-2 zoning district. The R-2 zoning classification permits one principal single <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>family use and accessory uses. At the time building began, the Clemmers already had their principal family residence on the property. Shortly after learning of the construction activity, the Township notified Mr. Clemmer, in writing, that he was violating the Township building code. He was informed that all construction work must cease forthwith.</p>
    <p id="b413-4" data-blocks='[["BL_413.4",413,[186,633,1151,777]]]'>On September 24, 1979, the Clemmers applied for and received a building permit.

In a letter dated February 19, 1980, the Township notified the Clemmers that if they intended to use the structure as a residence, it was necessary for them to comply with the applicable subdivision ordinance. The Township requested that all construction stop immediately and that the Clemmers take the steps required to obtain complete subdivision approval. The Clemmers ignored the Township’s notice and request, and continued with construction of the building.</p>

The resolution called for by the terms of the consent decree was that the Clemmers were to commence necessary action to end the described violations by May 29, 1983. The evidence produced at the hearing on the Township’s petition showed that the Clemmers did not in good faith abide by that requirement and continued in violation after that date. The consent decree, by its terms, only resolved any violations up to May 29, 1983. Violations that existed after that date were not covered by the decree and could be dealt with in a reasonable manner by the chancellor. Where damages are claimed in an equity action and the evidence shows that such facts exist, it is proper for the court to order such relief. <em>Meth v. Meth, supra.</em>

      <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>I agree with the majority’s holding that Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure 2251 through 2274, Joinder of Additional Defendants, do not define the procedure governing the joinder of Ms. Kratz. Rules 2251 et seq. apply only when a <em>defendant </em>seeks to join an additional defendant, not when a <em>plaintiff </em>seeks the joinder, as in this case. Rule 2232(c) empowers a court to join an additional party under circumstances such as were presented in this case, but the rules do not outline the specific steps which must be followed when a plaintiff is required to add another person as a party defendant.</p>
    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[228,921,1156,854]]]'>Inasmuch as a detailed procedure is not specified for joinder under these circumstances, it seems appropriate to examine all the rules which govern service of process upon defendants. Although Rule 425 did not exist at the time of the trial court proceedings, the explanatory comment which precedes the rule explains clearly that Subpart C (Rules 420-425) <em>consolidates </em>rules governing service of process upon special parties rather than setting forth new criteria. Rule 425(a) states: “Original process shall be served upon an additional defendant who is not already a party to the action in the same manner as if he were an original defendant. Copies of all pleadings filed in the action shall be <em>served with the complaint against the additional defendant.” </em>(Emphasis added.) The obvious inference is that any person joined as a defendant is always entitled to a complaint which sets forth a cause of action against him.</p>

They insure that a person who is to be subjected to the court’s pervasive authority will first be presented with a complaint which alleges his wrongdoing and delineates his potential liability. He will not be ordered to tear down his house, bulldoze the foundation, and pay a penalty of $100 per day, without being served with a pleading which explains, in simple terms, why he should be subjected to such draconian measures. The ma<a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>jority upholds these sanctions against Ms. Kratz without according her the right to receive a complaint.</p>

It is a declaration of the minimal requirements under the due process clause of the federal Constitution— not a statement of what is required under the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. In addition, the quotation was not followed in <em>Spica </em>itself, and cannot be taken literally in any event.</p>
    <p id="b431-5" data-blocks='[["BL_431.5",431,[248,1244,1152,636]]]'>Were we to take the statement literally, the only necessity would be a method of notification reasonably calculated to inform a defendant of the proceeding and give him an opportunity to be heard; we might well dispense with all the procedural rules relating to service of process. If a petition and rule satisfies the requirement in the case of Ms. Kratz, perhaps a letter will be sufficient in the next instance. We might later conclude that only a telephone call is necessary. So long as we need only a method of notification reasonably calculated to inform a defendant of the proceeding and give him an opportunity to be heard, we would never need such a formality as a complaint.</p>
