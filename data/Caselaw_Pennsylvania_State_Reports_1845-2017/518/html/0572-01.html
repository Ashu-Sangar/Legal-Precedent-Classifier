The trial court reversed the award with regard to the percentage of pension benefits payable and in the reduction of the minimum age for retirement without the arbitrators first considering an actuarial study, but affirmed the award in granting pension benefits to a policeman not injured in the course of his employment.

Pursuant to § 217.1 of the Collective Bargaining Act, Act of June 24, 1968, P.L. 237, No. 111, 43 P.S. § 217.1 et seq., a board of arbitrators was empaneled in the Fall of 1974 following an impasse in negotiations between the Newton Township Police Department and Board of Supervisors. Upon due consideration, the arbitration panel determined for calendar year 1975 that any officer permanently and totally disabled whether service or non-service related was entitled to receive 65 percent of his salary as a pension until his death. Because the township would not implement this provision on the grounds that this provision was illegal and unenforceable, the police department instituted an action in mandamus in Common Pleas Court. Thereafter, in 1975 another impasse occurred. Another panel was commissioned under § 217.1 <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>of the Act resulting in an award reducing the retirement age from 55 to 53 after 25 years of service after the completion of an actuarial study the cost of which was to be borne by the township. The complaint in mandamus was amended to include the disagreement over the 1976 award. As previously indicated, the trial court, as well as the Commonwealth Court, affirmed in part and reversed in part the 1975 and 1976 arbitration awards. We granted allocatur to determine the proper interpretation of § 771 of the Police Pension Fund Act (Act 600) Act of May 29,1956, P.L. (1955) 1804, 53 P.S. § 771 and now affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>

The first issue raised under this section is whether a pension is permissible for a disability not incurred during the course of a policeman’s employment. Nothing in § 771 explicitly permits or prohibits the payment of such a pension. In <em>City of Washington v. Police Department of Washington (Washington Arbitration Case), </em><a href="/pa/436/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="436 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1926078" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0168-01">436 Pa. 168</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=259%20A.2d%20437" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="259 A.2d 437">259 A.2d 437</a> (1969), we held that an arbitration award may not require the implementation of an illegal act, nor require a public employer to do that which it cannot do voluntarily. However, implicit in the analysis of determining an illegal act is consideration of the authority to act. For if a public employer has no authority to act, any action by the public employer may be an illegal act.</p>
    <p id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.5",671,[165,1797,1154,474]]]'>Section 767 of Act 600 provides that benefits may be paid to a member of the police force who, “shall receive honorable discharge therefrom by reason of age and service, or disability ...”, 53 P.S. 767. The Act clearly contemplates the payment of a disability pension. It does not, however, articulate whether the disability must be the result of an injury suffered during the course of one’s employment (i.e. service v. non-service disability) before triggering the payment of pension benefits.</p>

Thus, § 771 sets forth the mechanism for calculating age and service benefits as well as service related disabilities. No mention is made in this provision or any other provision of Act 600 for calculating benefits for a police officer disabled by a non-service related injury. We must therefore conclude that the legislature did not contemplate compensating police officers injured while not on duty.

The fact that the legislature in one instance used a phrase “in service” and in another used a phrase “in <em>the </em>service” connotes a distinction in the phrases themselves. “The” by its very nature restricts the word “service”, to a particular “service”. Thus, “in the service” permits benefits to be paid to a fireman who suffers injuries while a member of a department, while “in service” permits benefits to be paid to a member of a department who suffers injuries while performing his duties. Thus, the language differences presents a meritorious distinction.</p>

When the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, the clear meaning cannot be disregarded to achieve a different desired result. 1 Pa. C.S.A. § 1921(b). As can be seen from the quoted provision, the legislature provided an exception to the payment of 50 percent of the police officer’s monthly salary in the case of a permanent disability or death. The last cited section would be unnecessary and mere surplus-age if it did not mean something different than the former general section. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(2).
