He went to the emergency room of the East Suburban Health Center where the wounds were covered by a bandaid and two tetanus shots were administered. Mr. Boggavarapu filed suit for pain and suffering and medical expenses of some $9,000. His wife as co-plaintiff sued for loss of his consortium.

A jury is not compelled to believe that a dog bite or puncture by a needle causes compensable pain. They may believe that it is a transient rub of life and living, a momentary stab of fear and pain, or neither. Indeed, too loud a cry of pain, on small occasion, may dilute belief even in the occasion itself. Jurors may <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>perceive interests beyond the momentary pain: interests of opportunity that to the jurors’ minds become oppressive even for an obvious tortfeasor. In this case the appellee did not complain that the dog bite itself caused his injury. All his complaints were the product of the tetanus needle which he complained pierced his sciatic nerve. Whether it did or not was vigorously contested by both sides. The jury chose to believe it did not because it could not, according to the medical testimony of the appellants.</p>

That rejection reduced the issue from one of obvious injury to one of subjective pain. Jurors are not compelled to find pain where there was no objective injury. They could have but they did not, and it is not a fact of human experience that <em>every </em>tort produces <em>compensable </em>pain. Indeed, by verdict the jurors found no tort on the hospital that could have caused the pain alleged. They found a tort in the dog bite, but found no pain because the pain alleged was the needle and not the dog. A tortfeasor is not obliged to answer for what he did not cause simply because he is a tortfeasor.</p>
