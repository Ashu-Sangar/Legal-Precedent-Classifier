For the reasons set forth below, we have determined that the decision of the Commonwealth Court, 95 Pa.Cmwlth. 536, <a href="/pa-commw/95/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="505 A.2d 1368" data-case-ids="1345025" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/95/0536-01">505 A.2d 1368</a> (1986), must be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b605-6" data-blocks='[["BL_605.6",605,[168,988,1154,686]]]'>The facts are as follows. Appellee, Overlook Medical Clinic, Inc., was a nursing home facility that participated as a provider in the Pennsylvania Medical Assistance Program. The nursing home was sold, effective April 11, 1983 (R. 2a, 29a). On May 3, 1983, Overlook requested an extension of time to file its final cost report, which, pursuant to <a href="/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201181.73" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="55 Pa. Code § 1181.73">55 Pa. Code § 1181.73</a>(a),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> was then due on May 11, 1983 (R. 2a, 32a). When it requested an extension, Overlook was cognizant of the fact that previously extensions had been granted to two other facilities (R. 32a-33a). Overlook’s request for an extension of time did not specify the amount of time it would need, but suggested that more than 45 days was necessary.</p>

Overlook sent in a final cost report on June 9, 1983; <em>i.e., </em>29 days late and 59 days after the date of sale (R. 42a). DPW deemed this final report late and “settled” Overlook’s costs without regard to the final cost report under authority of <a href="/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201181.73" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="55 Pa.

The settlement was issued on January 5, 1984, and indicated that Overlook had been overpaid some $10,146.60, which it was obligated to reimburse to DPW. Based on Overlook’s letter of appeal to DPW dated February 1, 1984 (R. 5a-8a), Overlook apparently argued that if the data in its final report had been taken into account, it would have been entitled to a substantial final reimbursement, although no firm figure is set forth.</p>

Upon the recommendations of the hearing officer, DPW’s Office of Hearings and Appeals determined that Overlook’s final cost report was untimely and that the settlement correctly applied <a href="/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201181.73" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="55 Pa. Code § 1181.73">55 Pa. Code § 1181.73</a>. The hearing officer’s recommendation adopted by the Office of Hearings and Appeals specifically stated that DPW regulations do not make any provision for extensions for filing final cost reports (R. 12a, Finding of Fact No. 3), even though two such extensions had been granted to others in the past. It was concluded that such past errors did not estop DPW from literally applying <a href="/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201181.73" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="55 Pa.

On May 9, 1985, Overlook’s request for reconsideration was denied by DPW.</p>
    <p id="b607-4" data-blocks='[["BL_607.4",607,[168,484,1152,570]]]'>On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed DPW’s order.

    <p id="b607-5" data-blocks='[["BL_607.5",607,[167,1080,1154,835]]]'>We granted DPW’s petition for allowance of appeal because we were concerned over the contention that the Commonwealth Court improperly attempted to exercise here a power (which they do not possess) to create a rule or regulation for an administrative agency. Indeed, there is language in the Commonwealth Court’s opinion from which some might draw, the unfortunate and erroneous conclusion that the Commonwealth Court has such power. DPW also argues that the consequence of the Commonwealth Court opinion in this case is that an administrative agency may be compelled to grant relief merely because it has the inherent power to do so; and that the Commonwealth Court, in any event, does not have the power to usurp DPW’s rule-making authority. Upon a careful review of the record, we have concluded that the Commonwealth Court’s decision in this matter must be affirmed. Our reasons are as follows.</p>
