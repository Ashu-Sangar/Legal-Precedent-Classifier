Ms. Maunus is an Assistant Counsel and Mr. Thau is a Deputy Chief Counsel to the Board. On May 3,1984, both were advised that they were required to file a Statement of Financial Interest pursuant to the State Ethics Act, 65 P.S. § 401 <em>et seq. </em>Appellees notified the Chief Counsel to the State Ethics Commission (“Commission”) on August 14, 1984, of their refusal to comply with this requirement, based on their belief that the ethical conduct of attorneys was governed solely by the Supreme Court and hence, the Ethics Act is inapplicable to them. The Chief Counsel advised appellees on October 23, 1984, that the Commission did not recognize an exception to the filing provision for attorney-employees of the Commonwealth. Appellees thereafter sought and were granted a hearing before the full Commission, which by opinion dated December 27, 1984, concluded that appellees were not exempt from the financial reporting and disclosure requirements of the Ethics Act. However, on September 12, 1986, the Commonwealth Court reversed the decision of the Commission, finding that the financial disclosure provisions of the Ethics Act are invalid as applied to publicly employed attorneys for the reason advanced by the appellees, 100 Pa.Cmwlth. 494, <a href="/pa-commw/100/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="515 A.2d 83" data-case-ids="1352436" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/100/0494-01">515 A.2d 83</a>.

This Court held that the disclosure requirements are unconstitutional as applied to the judiciary, in that the statute, <em>vis a vis </em>the judiciary, infringes on this Court’s constitutional mandate to regulate and supervise the Pennsylvania courts. <em>Kremer, </em><a href="/pa/503/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="503 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1785881" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0358-01">503 Pa. at 363</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="503 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1785881" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0358-01">469 A.2d at 595</a>.

As members of the bar of <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, <em>all </em>attorneys admitted to practice in this Commonwealth, regardless of their employer, are uniformly obligated to meet and to maintain certain professional and ethical standards promulgated by this Court. These presently include satisfactory completion of bar admission criteria, and adherence to the Code of Professional Responsibility. In addition, failure to comport with these standards may result in disciplinary action being taken against the attorney pursuant to our Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement. Thus, what is contemplated by the exclusivity provision contained in Pa.R.D.E. 103 is that this Court is the only governmental body entitled to regulate and discipline the professional class of attorneys. No other component of our state government may impose duties applicable to every attorney admitted to practice in the Commonwealth, nor may another Commonwealth entity admit to practice or discipline an attorney. These prerogatives are within this Court’s exclusive jurisdiction. However, notwithstanding our substantial authority in this area, it is ludicrous to suggest that employers are constitutionally precluded from imposing ethical and professional requirements on their employees, some or all of whom may be attorneys. This is equally true where the employer is the Commonwealth or one of its subdivisions.</p>
    <p id="b693-4" data-blocks='[["BL_693.4",693,[224,1592,1153,786]],["BL_694.1",694,[256,317,1153,973]]]'>Employers in the private sector may properly adopt professional and ethical standards and in pursuit thereof, may require certain conduct of its employees, including attorneys, without running afoul of this Court’s supervisory authority over the bar of this Commonwealth. Any intrusion upon the power of this Court to prescribe general rules governing the practice, procedure and conduct of judicial proceedings is viewed with the greatest of skepticism. <em>See In re 42 Pa.C.S. § 1703, </em><a href="/pa/482/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="482 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="1749683" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0522-01">482 Pa. 522</a>, <a href="/pa/482/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="394 A.2d 444" data-case-ids="1749598,1749683" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0521-01,/pa/482/0522-01">394 A.2d 444</a> (1978). However, a lawyer who contracts his or her services to an employer is like any other employee subject to the terms and rules of that employment, provided that they are in no way inimical to the ethical standards prescribed by this Court. For example, in order to avoid the appearance of impropriety, a law firm specializing in securities law may <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>find it prudent to require its employees, including the attorneys on its staff, to disclose their personal securities holdings on a periodic basis. Likewise, public employers may find it appropriate to prohibit certain conduct or to eliminate conflicts of interest or such an appearance by requiring government employees to provide a financial disclosure statement on an annual basis. Such a requirement is to be distinguished from a legislative effort to prescribe rules of disclosure for members of the judiciary. <em>See In re 42 Pa.C.S. § 1703, supra. </em>Members of the judiciary are not lawyers acting on behalf of private employers. They are constitutional officers subject to the mandate of Article 5 and the rules prescribed pursuant thereto under section 10 of that Article. Even though instant appellees are governmental employees, they are nonetheless subject to the reasonable regulation of their governmental employer as long as it does not conflict with the authority of this Court.</p>
