    <p id="b327-6" data-blocks='[["BL_327.5",327,[197,1012,1154,824]]]'>Appellant does point to what at first appears to be an inconsistency. The guilty but mentally ill statute creates a category of reduced culpability or diminished capacity that does not affect the determination of guilty itself. It is therefore logical to argue that such a finding, when it occurs, may affect both the right to treatment and the total length of incarceration (which may also be reflected in the terms of probation and parole). Obviously, where a mandatory minimum sentence is involved, a finding of guilty but mentally ill could not affect a reduction in the mandatory minimum sentence without doing violation to the mandatory requirements of that statute. On the other hand, adherence to the mandatory minimum sentencing requirements would mean that a finding of guilty but mentally ill could never effectuate a reduction in sentence in those cases where the mandatory sentencing statute was applicable.</p>

The language contained in the statute at issue is clear and explicit. The criminal act of "voluntary manslaughter” is listed as one of the seven offenses subject to a mandatory sentence if the offender visibly possessed a firearm during the crime____ When the statute’s meaning is plain, there is no occasion for resorting to rules of statutory interpretation or looking to the legislative history when doing so would alter the plain meaning of the statute____</blockquote>
      <p id="AdO" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[243,2074,1118,311]]]'>We reversed the trial court in <em>Bell. </em>That court had concluded that the minimum sentencing statute dealing with firearms had not been intended to apply to a heat of passion killing committed by an emotionally involved, otherwise law abiding, citizen who succumbed to rage or panic and killed a lover or a family member. We did not permit considerations of diminished capacity or judicial compassion to serve as a warrant to ignore the clearest of statutory mandates. Our conclusion in the instant case is entirely consistent with <em>Bel!.</em>
