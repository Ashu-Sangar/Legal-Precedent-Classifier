Appellee was convicted by a jury on three counts each of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3123, indecent assault, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3126, and corruption of minors, 18 Pa. C.S. § 6301.

Ora Thomas moved in with appellee in 1981 along with her three minor children. She married appellee in 1982. Thereafter, there were numerous sexual contacts between appellee and the children between 1982 and 1984. The eldest, Gypsy, alleged that appellee had repeatedly touched her chest and vaginal area and subjected her to anal intercourse on many occasions. The next oldest, Angel, testified that appellee also touched her vaginal area and forced her to have anal intercourse with him on many occasions. The youngest, Orin, testified that <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>appellee forced him to engage in oral and anal intercourse, and appellee touched his penis on several occasions. In addition, Orín testified that on one occasion appellee had anal intercourse on him and his sister Angel in succession and then forced him to lick her “private part.” On another occasion as testified by Gypsy appellee forced the two girls to lick each other’s “privates” and then had anal intercourse with Angel.</p>

The Superior Court held that the crimes charged were neither temporally related, nor did they share common issues of law and fact, and therefore were not part of a single criminal episode. As a consequence the court concluded that the charges were not subject to the statutory bar of serial prosecutions for offenses arising in the same criminal episode, 18 Pa.C.S. § 110.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

The court reasoned that while there were similarities in the evidence of the offenses, they were not so singular as to rise to the level that proof that appellee committed one would have made it likely he had committed the others. It determined therefore that the evidence did not fit the <em>modus operandi </em>exception to the rule that the evidence of one crime is inadmissible against a defendant being tried for another.</p>

His identity was not at issue. What was at issue was whether he did as the children said he did. The Superior Court searched for connecting peculiarity, singularity or distinctiveness: evidence relevant to show <em>modus operandi, </em>a predicate to prove identity of an alleged perpetrator for more than one act. This was a totally irrelevant analysis, because who was the perpetrator of the acts was offered and was definitively not at issue in this case.</p>
