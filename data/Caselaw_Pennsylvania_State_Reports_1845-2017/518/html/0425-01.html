The issues presented arise from evidentiary rulings by the trial court. Review was granted because the issues herein implicate the relationship between the federal and state constitutional provisions relating to free speech and reputation and the statutorily created privilege conferred upon a media defendant, commonly known as the “Shield Law.” It has become increasingly apparent that the confines of that privilege must be more clearly delineated. It is appropriate to begin with a summary of the procedural history which provided the setting for the trial rulings that are here for consideration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Sprague, Esquire, commenced a libel action against Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. (“PNI”), publisher of the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer, </em>a daily newspaper of general circulation. Sprague’s complaint, filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, alleged <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>that he had been falsely and maliciously defamed by two series of articles published by the newspaper in late March and early April 1973. Also named as defendants in the suit were various reporters and editors of the <em>Inquirer, </em>as well as the corporate owner of PNI. Of the reporters named as defendants, Greg Walter, Howard F. Shapiro and Kent Pollock were the actual authors of the allegedly defamatory articles. At the time the newspaper articles were published Richard Sprague was First Assistant to the District Attorney of Philadelphia. Prior to attaining that position, he had been chief of the homicide division of the District Attorney’s Office.</p>
    <p id="b524-5" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[252,976,1155,854]]]'>The first series of <em>Inquirer </em>articles concerning Sprague, published in late March of 1973, indicated that he, while First Assistant District Attorney, had participated in a certain illegal wiretapping scheme. In April of 1973, the <em>Inquirer </em>followed with a series of articles which related that Sprague, at a time ten years prior when he was chief of the homicide division, had prevented the bringing of homicide charges against the son of a certain high official of the Pennsylvania State Police. This second series of articles conveyed the impression that Sprague’s treatment of the homicide case was motivated by personal favoritism toward the official. The <em>Inquirer </em>articles implicating Sprague in the wiretapping episode were written partly by reporter Greg Walter and partly by reporter Howard Shapiro; the articles about the ten-year old homicide case were co-authored by Walter and another reporter, Kent Pollock.</p>
    <p id="b524-6" data-blocks='[["BL_524.5",524,[248,1848,1154,530]],["BL_525.1",525,[219,323,1151,419]]]'>The libel action here involved proceeded to trial before a jury; those proceedings lasted more than six weeks and generated over four thousand pages of transcribed testimony. The plaintiff, Sprague, presented evidence tending to show that the imputations of wrongdoing set forth about him in the <em>Inquirer </em>articles were false. He also produced evidence which, if believed, would support an inference that the newspaper articles were published with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard of their truth or falsity, <em>i.e., </em>that the statements were made with “actual <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>malice.” As part of his proof on the issue of malice, Sprague disclosed that, several months before the appearance of the articles in question, he had successfully prosecuted reporter Greg Walter on criminal charges for illegal wiretapping. In that regard, the defamation plaintiff also presented testimony from Walter’s former girlfriend which indicated that the reporter had expressed a desire to “get Sprague” because of the prosecution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[219,760,1152,518]]]'>To meet the case put on by the plaintiff, PNI sought to negate an inference of “actual malice.” To that end, the defense undertook to establish that the newspaper articles were not statements made with knowledge of their falsity, or made with reckless disregard of whether they were false or not, but rather were good-faith statements honestly based on information supplied by reliable and confidential “sources.” In support of this contention, the first witness called by the defense was reporter Kent Pollock, co-author of some of the articles.</p>
    <p id="b525-6" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[218,1304,1153,849]],["BL_526.1",526,[243,321,1149,151]]]'>In the course of Pollock’s testimony on direct examination, defense counsel alluded to one of the articles concerning the homicide case and asked the witness to relate how he obtained the information put forth in the article. In response, Pollock began by stating that the information had come from “an individual” to whom he had spoken. When the reporter sought to continue by recounting <em>what </em>the unnamed person had told him, the trial judge interrupted with an inquiry as to <em>the informant’s identity. </em>Pollock answered the court’s question by stating: “This is a person who was very close to [the suspect’s] family, sir, who is a source of mine.” At that point, counsel for the plaintiff demanded that the witness reveal the identity of the mentioned informant. Defense counsel objected to the demand, asserting that reporter Pollock had a legal privilege, embodied in Pennsylvania’s Shield Law, not to divulge his confi<a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>dential sources. The trial judge then recessed the proceedings, to conduct an <em>in camera </em>hearing as to the merits of the objection.</p>
    <p id="b526-4" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[236,491,1155,1062]]]'>During the <em>in camera </em>hearing before the trial court, defense counsel asserted • that the Shield Law permitted reporter Pollock to testify fully as to the information obtained from his source without having to disclose the source’s identity, and that no adverse inference or other sanction should result from the exercise of the privilege. The defendant further contended that the privilege conferred by the Shield Law is one mandated by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, and that if the exercise of the privilege impedes a plaintiff’s ability to question the reliability or genuineness of a newsman’s source the balance should be struck to favor the free flow of information to the media. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that the Shield Law did not demand the interpretation sought by the defendant, and that the privilege is merely an investigative tool which is dissipated once the information from the source is put into print and published. Counsel for the plaintiff further argued that the remedy for failure to reveal a source should be an “adverse inference” charge by the court.</p>
    <p id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[234,1572,1152,359]]]'>Upon considering the competing arguments, the trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff. The court concluded that the Shield Law was inapplicable and that the defendant had no constitutional right to conceal the identity of its sources. Based on that determination, the court ordered the defendant to disclose its sources. The order further stated:</p>

    <p id="b527-4" data-blocks='[["BL_527.4",527,[233,696,1152,466]]]'>Because the defendant had elected not to disclose its sources, the trial judge, at the time of charging the jury, applied the sanction prescribed in his order: all evidence derived from such sources was to be excluded from the jury’s consideration.

The plaintiff would have had the court go further with its charge, and instruct that the failure to reveal sources would warrant a finding “that there were no sources.” The court refused that request.</p>
    <p id="b528-4" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[241,591,1156,1121]]]'>As noted, <em>Inquirer </em>reporter Greg Walter had authored some of the allegedly defamatory articles and had co-authored others. He also had been credited with doing most of the investigative work which preceded them. According to the plaintiff, the articles were shaped in large part by Walter’s ill-will toward him. It is thus apparent that Walter was a key figure in the litigation. However, he was never called as a witness at trial. Prior to the commencement of trial, defense counsel stated to the court that Walter could not appear as a witness, for reasons of health. Because of that representation, plaintiff’s counsel, in his case-in-chief, resorted to reading into the record segments of a partially completed deposition which had been taken from Walter. However, at a later point in the trial, counsel for the plaintiff expressed doubts about Walter’s physical infirmity; and indicated to the court that the reporter was then currently travelling about the state and writing newspaper articles. At the plaintiff’s request the trial court issued a subpoena to secure the courtroom presence of Greg Walter, so that a determination could be made as to his physical condition.</p>
    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[235,1732,1155,629]],["BL_529.1",529,[211,307,1148,201]]]'>Walter complied with the subpoena and appeared in court at the requested time with his physician, Dr. Fred D. Holford. At that point, the defense presented the court with a letter from Dr. Holford stating that he had performed a second arterial coronary bypass on Walter, and that it would be medically inadvisable for the reporter to undergo the stress of being a trial witness. The defense also offered to have Dr. Holford testify <em>in camera; </em>but that request was denied by the court, ruling that such evidence had to be presented in open court before the jury. In the view of the trial judge, the question of whether Walter should be deemed unavailable for reasons of health <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>was for the jury to determine. Notwithstanding the court’s ruling in this regard, the defendant declined to have Dr. Holford testify before the jury to substantiate its assertion about Walter’s condition.</p>
    <p id="b529-4" data-blocks='[["BL_529.4",529,[210,532,1151,688]]]'>Although Walter himself remained in the courtroom for the rest of the trial, neither party called him to testify about the newspaper articles. However, the trial court accepted the plaintiff’s argument that Walter was within the control of PNI, that Walter’s testimony properly would have been a part of PNI’s case, and that PNI had failed to establish that the reporter was medically unavailable as a witness. The court, having accepted the above assertions, proceeded to grant the plaintiff’s request for a “missing witness” or “adverse inference” charge. That is, the court instructed the jury that the failure of the defendant, PNI, to call Walter as its witness permitted an inference that his testimony would have been unfavorable to the defendant.</p>

      <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>Traditionally, the recognition of privileged information in this Commonwealth has been designed to permit uninhibited disclosure between parties sharing a unique relationship. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 Pa.C.S. §§ 5916, 5928 (attorney-client); 42 Pa.C.S. § 5923 (husband-wife); 42 Pa.C.S. § 5929 (physician-patient); 42 Pa.C.S. § 5943 (priest-penitent). Because our society is also one that encourages an open interchange of ideas between its members and seeks to maintain the free flow of such ideas to the media, there is an equally strong societal purpose in fostering uninhibited disclosure between individuals and the media. <em>See, e.g., Hatchard v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., </em><a href="/pa/516/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="516 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1808614" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0184-01">516 Pa. 184</a>, <a href="/pa/516/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="516 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1808614" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0184-01">532 A.2d 346</a> (1987); <em>In re Taylor, </em><a href="/pa/412/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="412 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1887190" data-case-paths="/pa/412/0032-01">412 Pa. 32</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=193%20A.2d%20181" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="193 A.2d 181">193 A.2d 181</a> (1963). The language of our Shield Law reflects this purpose by protecting the media against the forced disclosure of the identity of its sources. This particular privilege was clearly designed to be an absolute one in that it immunizes the media against any legal compulsion directed at requiring disclosure of the source of the information. However, it is not a necessary corollary to such a privilege that its exercise also carries with it a verification of the reliability of the information received or the reliability of the source from which the communication was received. Nor does the language of the Shield Law reflect that such was the intention of the legislature.</p>

In contrast, the Shield Law privilege was designed to encourage communication from even the most unsavory sources. To assume the veracity of the information supplied would presume the trustworthiness of the source and the validity of the informant’s judgment in assessing the facts upon which the information was based. Such a proposition would require not only a blind faith in the integrity of the informant but also in the accuracy of his judgment. The bearing of false witness has always been abhorrent to <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>our Judaic-Christian concept of fairness. The requirement of an oath or affirmation, and our laws protecting against perjury or false statements, reflect our continuing concern for the trustworthiness of assertions of fact offered in judicial proceedings. To accept the Shield Law privilege as attesting to the reliability of the source as well as protecting its identity not only extends the plain language of the provision without justification, but would also sanction the creation of an inference entirely lacking in foundation. Such a result is offensive to settled rules of statutory construction, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1), and would undermine the integrity of our fact finding process.</p>

The redress provided under our body of substantive law is an action in tort for defamation. To gratuitously embellish upon the stringent requirements of current federal constitutional law, by means of an overly broad interpretation of a state statute, would be in conflict with the recognition given by our state’s constitution to a citizen’s right to protect his or her reputation. Moreover, to create fictional inferences to aid a party who does not bear the burden of proof would impermissibly undercut the state constitutional interest in providing redress for defamation.

We need only address the objections raised relating to the testimony of Kent Pollock for the disposition of this appeal. Witness Pollock was offered to show that the defamatory statements in the articles he participated in were not recklessly <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>made without regard to the truth of the assertions contained therein.

Pollock then proceeded to articulate various pieces of information he had received from unidentified sources which formed the basis for the statements made in the challenged articles. The trial court ultimately ruled that, if the defendant failed to disclose the sources of this information, it would be precluded from defending on the grounds of any information supplied by these unidentified sources. We note that the trial court in a very difficult and complex area attempted to adjust competing interests in a fair and judicious manner. The difficulty arose from the prevailing uncertainty as to the proper application of our Shield Law in the context of present defamation law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Nevertheless, <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>we are constrained to agree with the Superior Court that the ruling was erroneous and that the error requires the grant of a new trial.</p>

When the original statute was enacted in 1937, the law of defamation was such that the plaintiff had the benefit of several evidentiary and procedural advantages. For example, a defamatory statement was presumed to be false. <em>E.g., Corabi v. Curtis Publishing Co., </em><a href="/pa/441/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="441 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="1933943" data-case-paths="/pa/441/0432-01">441 Pa. 432</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=273%20A.2d%20899" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="273 A.2d 899">273 A.2d 899</a> (1971) (recognizing proposition as long standing rule); <em>Hartranft v.

If the defendant wished to defend on the ground that the defamatory communication was true, he had the burden of proving it. <em>Montgomery v. Dennison, </em><a href="/pa/363/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="363 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="1221629" data-case-paths="/pa/363/0255-01">363 Pa. 255</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.2d%20520" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="69 A.2d 520">69 A.2d 520</a> (1949); <em>Mulderig v.

Moreover, unless the statement came within some legal privilege, it was presumed to have been made with malice. <em>Corabi, supra; Neeb v. Hope, </em><a href="/pa/111/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="111 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="545487" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0145-01">111 Pa. 145</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.%20568" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="2 A. 568">2 A. 568</a> (1886); <em>Barr v.

For a defendant to have the protection of a privilege, such as the one that existed for statements about matters of public concern, he had to first establish, <em>inter alia, </em>that the statement was made with a reasonable belief in its probable truth, <em>E.g., Morgan v. Bulletin Co., </em><a href="/pa/369/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="369 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1232392" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0349-01">369 Pa. 349</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=85%20A.2d%20869" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="85 A.2d 869">85 A.2d 869</a> (1952); <em>O'Donnell v.

      <p id="b537-8" data-blocks='[["BL_537.3",537,[236,2087,1118,311]]]'>Given the state of defamation law when the 1937 Shield Law was enacted, the conclusion must be drawn that there was no contemplation on the part of the legislature that the statute would present any obstacle to a person seeking redress for injury to his reputation. It was only with the advent of <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em><a href="/us/376/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="376 U.S. 254" data-case-ids="379234" data-case-paths="/us/376/0254-01">376 U.S. 254</a>, <a href="/us/376/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="376 U.S. 254" data-case-ids="379234" data-case-paths="/us/376/0254-01">84 S.Ct. 710</a>, <a href="/us/376/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="376 U.S. 254" data-case-ids="379234" data-case-paths="/us/376/0254-01">11 L.Ed.2d 686</a> (1964), and its decisional offspring, that Pennsylvania’s Shield Law presented a problem for plaintiffs suing media defendants for defamation.</p>

When this Court decides that a new trial must be granted for reason of a particular error, we do not, as a rule, address other issues that have been presented. However, because the instant matter is a complex one and must be retried, we consider it appropriate to resolve another question which is likely to arise again, namely, the trial court’s “adverse inference” charge relating to reporter Greg Walter. In our view, the issue of whether Walter was medically incapable of being a witness for PNI was one that the trial court itself should have determined, not the jury. <em>Farley v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, </em><a href="/pa-super/279/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="279 Pa. Super. 570" data-case-ids="149016" data-case-paths="/pa-super/279/0570-01">279 Pa.Super. 570</a>, <a href="/pa-super/279/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="279 Pa. Super. 570" data-case-ids="149016" data-case-paths="/pa-super/279/0570-01">421 A.2d 346</a> (1980). Clearly, if the question were one of a witness’ mental competency to testify, the determination would be one for the trial court to make. <em>E.g., Commonwealth v. Goldblum, </em><a href="/pa/498/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="498 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1776151" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0455-01">498 Pa. 455</a>, <a href="/pa/498/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="498 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1776151" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0455-01">447 A.2d 234</a> (1982). We see no reason to apply a different rule where the issue relates to a person’s physical capacity to testify as a witness. In sum, we agree with the Superior Court’s conclusion that the trial judge in the instant case erred in ruling that it was a jury question.</p>
