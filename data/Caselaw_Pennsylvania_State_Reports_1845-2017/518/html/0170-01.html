    <p id="b268-4" data-blocks='[["BL_268.4",268,[254,448,1153,693]]]'>The record of the proceedings before the Commission discloses the following. In February of 1982, the Philadelphia Police Department (the Department) began an investigation to identify which police officers were responsible for excessive interference with police car radio broadcasts in its North Central Division. This interference primarily occured in the form of “clicking” when officers pressed the transmission switch on their microphones. The Department considered the interference to be potentially life threatening because it prevents legitimate transmissions from being broadcast.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The purpose of the investigation was to curtail this improper use of police radio by surreptitiously catching an offender and making a disciplinary example of him.</p>
    <p id="b268-5" data-blocks='[["BL_268.5",268,[250,1162,1153,474]]]'>The Department’s plan was to install a silent secondary broadcast system or “channel guard radio” to replace the existing radio in randomly selected police vehicles. The channel guard radio would enable the Department to monitor and record radio transmissions from a particular police vehicle because it gives off a subaudible tone making the receipt of that radio’s output distinctive from other transmissions. In this case, the output went into a relay system where it was electronically recorded.</p>
    <p id="b268-6" data-blocks='[["BL_268.6",268,[247,1657,1151,420]]]'>On February 9 and 10, 1982, appellant Edward M. Lewis was on duty in radio patrol car 227 during the 11:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. shift. Unbeknownst to Officer Lewis, the radio normally in car 227 was replaced with the channel guard radio. During this time, the department taped clicking noises and an inaudible shout on February 9, and clicking noises on February 10, allegedly emanating from the channel guard radio in patrol car 227.</p>

      <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>The channel guard tape gave no indication of the exact time of the interference but merely the shift during which the transmissions occurred. Therefore, the department secured a master tape from police radio dispatch of all radio transmissions and computer printouts showing the times of various assignments broadcast from the dispatch center on these dates. Mr. Connors, a civilian police communications dispatcher, compared the channel guard tape with the master tape to locate the “clicking” on the master tape. Using the times from the computer printouts for a reference point, he then placed the master tape on a tape reader that was equipped with a digital clock to determine the exact time of the channel guard transmissions. Mr. Connors prepared an edited version of the master tape on which he narrated the exact time of the interference. This re-recording contained only selected portions of transmissions from the master tape. After ten days the master tape was erased and reused.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Finally, a transcript of the edited tape was prepared by Mr. Connors indicating that the interference occurred at 2:49 a.m. on February 9, 1982 and at 3:03 a.m. on February 10, 1982.</p>

This was approximately one minute after the alleged interference on that date as indicated by the edited tape and transcript. Officer Lewis also stated that he was in his vehicle at approximately 3:00 a.m. on February 10 and was in the process of checking his radio before leaving his vehicle to issue a traffic citation to a taxi cab driver. Following the interview, Officer Lewis, a fourteen year veteran of the Department, was discharged for disobedience of orders, neglect of duty and conduct unbecoming an officer for intentionally interfering with police radio broadcasts.</p>

At the hearing before the Commission, the Department offered as evidence both the channel guard tape and the edited version of the master tape, along with the transcript prepared therefrom. This evidence was admitted by the Commission which relied soley upon it in finding that Officer Lewis intentionally interfered with police radio broadcasts and thus, the Commission upheld Officer Lewis’ discharge.</p>

The trial court held that the admission of the edited tape was improper and that, without the tape, substantial evidence did not exist to support Officer Lewis’ discharge. Thereafter, the Department appealed the order of the trial court to the Commonwealth Court, arguing that appellant had failed to object to the introduction of the tape at trial. The Commonwealth Court reversed the order of the trial court on the grounds of waiver and reinstated appellant’s dismissal. We granted allocatur and we now reverse.</p>

Sergeant Aquino testified that the Department had previous problems with the channel guard radio’s low output. He explained that if two officers were transmitting simultaneously the system would filter out the weakest of the signals, in this case, the channel guard transmission. Thus, that which was recorded on the channel guard tape would have been from another radio, located in another car.

Officer Lewis stated that at approximately 3:00 a.m. he had pulled over a taxi cab driver for a traffic violation in the 1600 block of Lehigh Avenue. Before leaving his vehicle to issue the traffic citation he turned on the outside speaker of his radio in order to be able to hear broadcasts from his radio. Since it was early in the morning, he did not want to disturb the neighborhood and tested the volume of the outside speaker by pressing the transmission switch and blowing into the microphone to achieve an appropriate volume.

The Commission accepted this excuse even though the charges against Officer Lewis were brought within the ten day period during which the tape would have ordinarily been saved. We fail to see the Department's reason for taking the trouble to reproduce an edited version of the master tape and, at the same time destroy the master tape as a matter of course, when it provided the only method for determining the exact time of interference. By erasing the master tape the Department prevented Officer Lewis’s expert from verifying the test done by Mr. Connors or from conducting his own test of the time of interference.</p>

Additionally, without contravening our scope of review we note that Mr. Short opined that the transmission on February 9, at 2:49 a.m. during which Officer Lewis allegedly clicked his radio and shouted an inaudible word was not from the channel guard radio. He determined this by making voice prints of the channel guard transmission on an oscilloscope. Mr. Short compared other transmissions from the channel guard tape in which Officer Lewis identified himself in some manner with the alleged improper transmissions. The voice print of the channel guard transmissions showed a continuous dark line of the same intensity. This continuous dark line was not present on the voice print of the transmission of February 9, at 2:49 a.m. and thus, could not have been transmitted from Officer Lewis’ vehicle. This evidence was uncontradicted by the Department.</p>

Moreover, Officer Lewis testified at the hearing, that after leaving the North Central Detectives Division Building he discovered that his patrol car was not in the parking space where he had left it but had been moved by another officer or Department employee. He had parked his car near the walkway to “prisoner lock-up” because the parking lot was full. He stated that it was common for police vehicles to be moved when the parking area became congested. The two men in charge of the cell block and gas pumps had keys to all the vehicles. Officer Lewis' car was unlocked because its electronic door locks were not working. This would suggest that he was not the only one with access to car 227.</p>

Although Officer Lewis has waived the issue of excessive punishment, <em>See </em>note 3. <em>supra., </em>it is apparent that the punishment of discharge is manifestly disproportionate to the charge of two isolated instances of improper interference with police radio, which the Department attributed to Officer Lewis, who otherwise had a long and distinguished police career. <em>See, Borough of Bristol v. Downs, </em>48 Pa.Cmwlth. 46, <a href="/citations/?q=409%20A.2d%20467" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="409 A.2d 467">409 A.2d 467</a> (1979) (permanent reduction in rank and suspension was an abuse of discretion where the offense charged was a technical violation of the officer’s official duties).</p>
