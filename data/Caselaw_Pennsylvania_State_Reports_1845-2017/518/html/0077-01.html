Abundant case law existed at the time of trial in 1984 which would have supported an objection to the testimony of Mannarino. In briefing this issue on post-verdict motions, counsel relied on <em>O’Searo, <a href="/pa/466/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="466 Pa. 224" data-case-ids="1714948" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0224-01">supra,</a> </em>to argue:</p>

Short of prohibiting the testimony altogether, the appellant would undeniably have been entitled to a jury instruction known as a “low grade” charge which would have informed the jury that expert opinion evidence is considered of a low grade when the expert testifies not from personal observation but expresses an opinion in response to a hypothetical question. <em>Commonwealth v.

He justified his trial “strategy” as follows:</p>
