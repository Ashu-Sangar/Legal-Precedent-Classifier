    <p id="b309-7" data-blocks='[["BL_309.6",309,[226,1041,1151,848]]]'>The statute defines “public adjuster” as a person or entity who adjusts loss claims on behalf of an insured, and “public adjustor solicitor” as a person who solicits contracts for public adjusting services. 63 P.S. § 1601. The Bureau claims that insured property owners, following a loss, often fail to take necessary steps to protect their property and receive a prompt and fair claim settlement. An insured may be emotionally distraught, he may be too busy or otherwise committed, or he may not have the ability or understanding necessary to process his own claim. In any event, public adjusters typically arrange emergency protection of damaged property, secure temporary lodging for displaced persons, advise insureds regarding their rights and duties under their insurance contracts, consult with insurance companies, and commence inventory and appraisal of the loss.</p>

They assert that contacting the victims of a disaster within twenty-four hours of the disaster is often necessary in order to locate the property owner before he moves to an unlisted, temporary location because of the disaster.</p>
    <p id="b310-4" data-blocks='[["BL_310.4",310,[276,646,1153,636]]]'>The Commonwealth, on the other hand, claims that the statute prohibiting solicitation of business by public adjusters or public adjuster solicitors within twenty-four hours of a disaster or fire is permissible, in part, because it is only a time, place and manner regulation. Additionally, the Commonwealth argues that if public adjusters and public adjuster solicitors are allowed to solicit business within twenty-four hours of a disaster they may utilize fraudulent practices at a time when victims of disaster are especially vulnerable, and they might, in the course of pursuing their commercial interests, destroy evidence or otherwise impede a criminal investigation.</p>

Public adjusters and public adjuster solicitors are licensed by the Commonwealth, subject to revocation or suspension of their license, and bonded. They may not conduct business without a signed, written contract, and the form of the contract must be approved by the Insurance Commissioner. The statute requires that any contract secured by a public adjuster or public adjuster solicitor may be rescinded within four days of signing, and there are civil and criminal penalties for violation of any provision of the act, including provisions of the act which prohibit, inter alia, misrepresentation, misappropriation of money, or fraudulent practices. 63 P.S. §§ 1603-1608.</p>

That some public adjusters and public adjuster solicitors may mislead potential customers does not, of course, establish that all persons in the public adjusting business commit fraud. In fact, in the absence of evidence that the overwhelming volume of public adjusting activity in Pennsylvania is based on misleading speech, we will treat public adjustings as a lawful business activity, just as we would any other business activity, which may be subject to abuse by a few individuals. <em>See </em>p. 1321, n. 5 supra.

Moreover, the public is protected by the fact that public adjusters and public adjuster solicitors must be bonded, by the fact that their sales contracts must be in a form approved by the Insurance Commissioner, and by the fact that any person entering into a contract with a public adjuster or public adjuster solicitor may rescind the contract within four days of signing. 63 P.S. § 1605.</p>

It is plain that persons who have been victimized by misleading speech of public adjusters or public adjuster solicitors have at their disposal a number of administrative, civil and criminal remedies.

Although it is true that the restriction in this case affects only twenty-four hours, the period of time immediately following the disaster may be the only time during which the property owner can be located before moving to an unknown address because of the disaster which has affected his property. Balancing the governmental interest of protecting persons who have just suffered the trauma of losing their property from potentially misleading speech of <em>some </em>public adjusters against that of the public adjusters and public adjuster solicitors in informing a likely prospect of the nature and value of their services, we find that the private business interests are more significant in light of the other remedies available, should there be fraud or misleading speech.

      <p id="b315-8" data-blocks='[["BL_315.8",315,[228,1311,1117,617]]]'>The Commonwealth claims, in effect, that some speech at issue in this case has been and might in the future be false or deceptive. There is no evidence, however, that public adjuster speech within twenty-four hours of a disaster is so pervasively false that contacts within this time frame could generally be characterized as false or deceptive. Every business activity is occasionally abused by dishonest individuals, but that does not make business activity generally false or deceptive. For these reasons, it is our view that the record does not support the claim that the speech at issue was false or deceptive, and since the case involves commercial speech, the Commonwealth should have had the burden of justifying the restriction on speech. Commonwealth Court, therefore, was in error in applying the traditional standard of review for constitutional challenges to statutes: viz., that "enactments of the General Assembly enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality with all doubts resolved in favor of sustaining the constitutionality of the legislation.”</p>
      <p id="b315-9" data-blocks='[["BL_315.9",315,[227,1930,1118,463]]]'>If Commonwealth Court’s analysis were accepted, it would have the effect of emasculating the four-part test just cited from <em>Bolger. </em>Future Pennsylvania courts handling commercial speech cases, therefore, should be careful to require the party seeking to uphold the restriction to justify it, and not, in this area at least, to apply any presumptions in favor of constitutionality. If the case involves a claim that the commercial speech activity in question is false or deceptive, the court must receive evidence on that issue and, depending on its determination as to whether falsehood and deception are involved, apply the appropriate standard of proof. If the court is satisfied that the speech in question is false or deceptive, then the usual presumption in favor of constitutionality of the regulation would apply.</p>

In <em>Ohralik </em>an attorney personally visited accident victims for the purpose of offering his professional services.

      <blockquote id="Ah4" data-blocks='[["BL_318.8",318,[318,1562,1085,471]]]'>Unlike a public advertisement, which simply provides information and leaves the recipient free to act upon it or not, in-person solicitation may exert pressure and often demands an immediate response, without providing an opportunity for comparison or reflection. The aim and effect of in-person solicitation may be to provide a one-sided presentation and to encourage speedy and perhaps uninformed decisionmaking; there is no opportunity for intervention or counter-education by agencies of the Bar, supervisory authorities, or persons close to the solicited individual. The admonition that "the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones" is of little value when the circumstances provide no opportunity for any remedy at all.</blockquote>
