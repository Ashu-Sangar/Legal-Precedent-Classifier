Mindala and Vickie Lee Mindala were killed and their infant daughter Tracy Lee Mindala severely injured as a result of an intersectional collision on Schoeneck and Indiantown Road in West Cocalico Township, Lancaster County. The collision occurred on November 25, 1979 at 7 p.m. Schoeneck and Indiantown Road are state-designated highways which run respectively in a north/south and east/west direction. However, on the west side of the intersection, Indiantown Road is a township road. For over forty years, this intersection has been controlled by stop signs situated on both the state and township sides of Indiantown Road. On the night in question, the Mindalas were travelling west on Indiantown Road while Harry Good was operating his vehicle in a southbound direction on Schoeneck Road. Ordinarily, westbound traffic on Indiantown Road is controlled by a stop sign erected at the intersection of Schoeneck and Indiantown Road. Unfortunately for the Mindalas, at the time that they reached the intersection of Schoeneck and Indiantown Road the stop sign was missing.</p>

By way of deposition, that resident testified that the Schoeneck-Indiantown Road intersection is not easily recognizable by motorists travelling westbound on Indiantown Road and on the day that the stop sign was missing she observed a vehicle enter the Schoeneck-Indiantown Road intersection without stopping, almost causing an intersectional collision. Since she was unable to contact either a township official or the police chief upon reaching home, she reported the missing stop sign to the Ephrata Communications Center, which takes calls for the township police. The Communications Center attempted to contact PennDot on two occasions without any success. Around midnight, approximately eight hours after the stop sign was reported missing, the township police chief contacted the Communications Center and was informed of the missing stop sign and that prior efforts to notify PennDot were unsuccessful. Notwithstanding, the police chief did not attempt to contact PennDot or the state police barracks which was situated only four miles from this dangerous intersection.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">3</a> The police chief did, however, proceed to the intersection to check the report and to attempt to locate the stop sign. Failing to find the stop sign, the police chief did nothing more although his patrol car was equipped with warning devices which could be used to alert motorists of the upcoming dangerous intersection. In addition, an affidavit was filed in response to the township’s motion for summary judgment which indicated that the township had available a portable stop sign which could have been used at the intersection on a temporary basis.</p>

After discovery had been completed, the township filed a motion for summary judgment alleging that it had no statutory duty to take corrective action of any kind or alternatively that the Appellants’ claim was barred by the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, Act of November 26, 1978, P.L. 1399, 53 P.S. § 5311.-101 et seq.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The trial judge denied the motion but certified the issues as controlling questions of law. In denying the motion the trial judge held that the township owed a duty to motorists to at least notify the Commonwealth of the condition and undertake safety measures until such time as the Commonwealth could rectify the situation and that the Appellants’ cause of action was not barred by the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act.</p>

In <em>Bergen, </em>the Court held that a township may be liable for a broken traffic control device on a state-designated highway if a police officer learns of a hazardous and emergent condition on the state highway which was not likely to be observed by a motorist and which presents an unusual risk of injury. A municipality may avoid liability by proving that the police failed to act because of competing demands upon the police force and such inaction was not palpably unreasonable.</p>

In <em>Rinaldi, </em>the Commonwealth Court held that a township may not be held liable for failure to warn the Commonwealth of a missing traffic control sign on a state-designated highway, nor may a municipality be held liable for failing to correct a hazardous condition on a state highway because the exclusive responsibility for traffic control lies with the Commonwealth. Furthermore, the Commonwealth Court determined that the township did not have “care, custody or control” of the stop sign at the Schoeneck-Indiantown Road intersection thereby making the § 8542(b)(4) exception to governmental immunity inapplicable.

Thus, our case law establishes that in those instances the victims must demonstrate a special relationship which warrants protection. <em>See, Chapman v.

In police protection, it is not for the courts but for the executive and legislative branches to determine in the first instances the allotment of financial resources and manpower. Therefore, those prior decisions which require a special relationship between the individual and the police prior to creating any duty under the general police powers are correct. The justification for the requirement of a special relationship is the general nature of the authority for the protection of the public at large and the determination that manpower and resources limit the ability to provide constant protection for all. The police are charged generally with protecting the public at large. This requires decisions impacting upon resources and manpower.

In the appeal sub judice, one of the harms complained of was the failure of the township police to actively regulate the flow of traffic to protect motorists within its jurisdiction. Since the township police possessed statutory authority to regulate traffic, had knowledge of a dangerous situation, and the capability to rectify the problem, a duty was created to reasonably exercise that authority and the failure to do so violated that duty.

The legislature has not provided us with a definition for “traffic sign” but common word usage would mandate that a “stop sign” be considered a traffic sign. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a). In addition, § 8542(b)(4) requires that “traffic sign” be in the “care, custody or control” of the local agency and it is here that the Appellants’ argument fails. The legislature could not have been more clear in its requirement that to impose liability upon the local agency, that agency must have the specific authority to act. For this cause of action to survive, the local agency must have had the authority to install a <em>stop sign </em>in order to come within this exception. As the previously cited testimony of the township officials and the police indicated, PennDot had specifically instructed the township that it had no authority under § 6122 to maintain traffic devices on state-designated highways within the township. Although the trial court was correct in its conclusion that each statutory exception in the act is to be narrowly interpreted, we are not free to change the clear meaning of the words to reach a desired result if a statute is unambiguous. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b).

    <p id="b464-8" data-blocks='[["BL_464.8",464,[239,1251,1155,1001]]]'>Under the provisions of section 6109, the Township is authorized to exercise police powers on state-designated highways within its boundaries. <em>See Commonwealth v. Mercer, </em><a href="/pa-super/294/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="294 Pa. Super. 544" data-case-ids="178414" data-case-paths="/pa-super/294/0544-01">294 Pa.Super. 544</a>, <a href="/pa-super/294/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="294 Pa. Super. 544" data-case-ids="178414" data-case-paths="/pa-super/294/0544-01">440 A.2d 599</a> (1982). Although Section 6109 does not impose an absolute affirmative duty on the Township to exercise its police powers on state roadways, it is clear that the Township did have the power and authority to act in this case. Further, under the facts of this case, the Township police chief, with full knowledge of the dangerous situation that resulted from the missing stop sign, had a duty to act with respect to the danger then and there existing. The failure to so act amounted to a breach of that duty. I would hold that where a local municipality learns of an emergent road condition on a state highway within its borders which is unlikely to be observed by motorists and which involves a foreseeable risk of harm, that local municipality has a duty to act reasonably to police and control traffic on that highway. <em>See Bergen v.

The question that arises from this statutory provision is not whether the Township had custody and control of the missing stop sign. The pertinent question is whether the Township had control of the <em>dangerous condition </em>of the missing stop sign. There is little question that the Township had control over the condition at the intersection which was caused by the missing stop sign. The Township had the power and authority under Section 6109 to take the steps necessary under the circumstances to regulate traffic and police the intersection in the face of the missing sign.</p>

I would reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this dissenting opinion.</p>
