Immediately prior to the events which culminated in the rape and attempted rape charges under consideration herein, the complainant was living with her brother Gary and his wife and child in one-half of a double house in Vintondale, Cambria County. The complainant’s father and her other siblings resided in the other half of the house; her mother was apparently institutionalized during the time of the relevant occurrences in this matter. When a diamond ring belonging to his wife disappeared, Gary asked the complainant if she had taken it, which she admitted. She asserted, however, that she had “lost” the ring, which prompted Gary to file criminal charges against her to teach her a lesson, apparently believing that the experience would lead to the recovery of the ring. As a result, the complainant was committed by court order to the custody of the Cambria County Detention Home.</p>

Appellee was sixty-three years old and suffered from emphysema and heart trouble. He was retired but his wife, who was considerably younger, worked as a nurse’s aide. Appellee and his wife had known the complainant’s family for approximately six years, and the complainant had done housework for appellee’s wife. After the complainant was committed to the detention home, appellee’s wife suggested that the complainant live with her and appellee. The complainant’s father considered this to be an acceptable arrangement, and, after a juvenile hearing, the complainant was released into the custody of appellee’s wife pending further proceedings.</p>

Appellee engaged in similar conduct towards the complainant “[a] couple times a week,” RR. 147, over her protestations, desisting only if she began to cry.

During one incident, which led to a charge of attempted rape, appellee asked the victim to disrobe and, when she did not remove her bra and under garments, he ordered her to undress completely. When she refused, appellee threatened to send her back to the detention home if she did not comply. The complainant obeyed, and appellee removed his clothing. When she insisted that she “did not want to do anything,” RR. 154, appellee repeated his threat to “send [her] back.” RR. 155. Appellee then proceeded with an unsuccessful attempt at penetration, during which the complainant experienced pain and “scream[ed], holler[ed]” and cried. RR. <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>157. A similar encounter on June 19, 1981, resulted in a second charge of attempted rape.

In contrast, a sexual assault under section 3121 does not reflect an intent to accommodate the minority of the victim.

An “objective” test has been established to determine whether the pressure generated upon the victim by the threat would be such as to overcome the resolve and prevent further resistance of a person of reasonable resolution. Thus any uniqueness in the emotional makeup of the victim is irrelevant in determining whether the threat possessed the requisite force to satisfy this element of the offense. What is germane is its impact on a person of reasonable resolve.</p>

The same source instructs us that the adjective “forcible” may be employed to convey that something is “effected by force used against opposition or resistance____” Unlike the preceding discussion, isolating the words utilized by the legislature to convey the intended thought does not provide the precision that would justify an invocation of the “fair import” approach mandated by the Crimes Code. The term “forcible compulsion” does not describe either the intensity of the force nor does it tell us the source of the opposition or resistance that must be overcome. Fortunately, the impact of the force has been described as one sufficient to overcome the “resistance by a person of reasonable resolution.” The meaning of that clause has already been discussed. Thus the only question remaining is the source of the opposition or resistance, <em>i.e., </em>the will or the intellect. A clarification of this issue is best assisted by the historical development of the underlying offense of rape in this Commonwealth.</p>

The standard was demanding. Thus, one court held that a woman must resist to the utmost unless the actor’s threats or behavior put her in “ ‘fear of death or great bodily harm,’ a ‘fear of great personal injury’ or ‘serious personal injury,’ a fear that ‘so overpowers her that she dares not resist,’ a ‘fear and terror so extreme as to preclude resistance.' ” In addition to emphasizing that the woman’s fear must <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>encompass harm of extreme gravity, the courts often required that her reaction be reasonable or, in indirect statement of the same idea, that the actor have present capacity to inflict the harm feared.

The departure from the common law formulation was to direct the focus upon the conduct of the alleged offender rather than upon the response of the victim. Thus the degree of compulsion created by the conduct was measured against an objective standard rather than attempting to evaluate the resistance of the particular victim in each instance. The degree of resistance, by that objective standard, was modified to remove the requirement that the victim continue the struggle when struggle would be useless and dangerous. This is reflected in our present standard requiring only that the conduct by the actor <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>“would prevent resistance by a person of reasonable resolution.”</p>

The changes in the language in the formulation set forth under the 1939 Crimes Code and the present statute were merely to accommodate the complaints that had been articulated. The focus of the inquiry has been removed from the victim’s actions to a scrutiny of the conduct of the offender. Moreover, the test of the degree of compulsion is now judged on an objective standard as opposed to a subjective one. However, the conclusion that the will was overborne is still critical to a finding that the offense has been committed. We are therefore satisfied that the adjective “forceful” was employed to establish that the assault must be upon the will. Nor does the modification of the former requirement appearing in some of our earlier cases requiring that the victim resist “to the utmost” in any way undercut this conclusion.

In considering the importance of the minority of the victim to the legislative scheme incorporated in our present Crimes Code it is to be noted that the present act reduced the presumptive age rather than maintain or increase the former age of 16 years for sexual intercourse. Where the sexual contact is deviate sexual contact, the General Assembly has conclusively presumed a lack of consent where the victim is under the age of 16 years.</p>
