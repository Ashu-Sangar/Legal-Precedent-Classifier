Super. 504" data-case-ids="667120" data-case-paths="/pa-super/361/0504-01">361 Pa.Super. 504</a>, <a href="/pa-super/361/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="361 Pa. Super. 504" data-case-ids="667120" data-case-paths="/pa-super/361/0504-01">522 A.2d 1144</a>. The action for equitable distribution arose from the divorce of appellant, Gregory L. Sutliff, and appellee, Carlene Sutliff, after their marriage of nearly 25 years. Appellant filed a complaint in divorce in 1982, and, after numerous hearings were held before a master, a report was filed in 1984. Subsequently, in December, 1984, the parties filed a stipulation providing for, inter alia, a bifurcated divorce. A final divorce decree was then immediately entered. On May 7, 1985, the Court of Common Pleas filed an order providing for equitable distribution. An appeal and cross appeal were taken to the Superior Court, whereupon certain elements of tbe equitable distribution scheme were affirmed and others were remanded for further determinations and/or modifications to be made. The instant appeal ensued.</p>

The Court of Common Pleas utilized October 21, 1981, the date when the parties separated, as the valuation date. The Superior Court concluded, however, that valuation of marital assets should reflect values as of the distribution date, rather than the separation date, and, accordingly, the case was remanded for revaluation of <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>certain business interests, including automobile dealerships, that were subject to distribution. The basis for the Superi- or Court’s action was that, because there had been a considerable passage of time between separation of the parties and distribution of their marital assets, substantial fluctuations in the values of those assets may have occurred, which, from an equitable standpoint, should be reflected in the distribution order. We agree.</p>

It is implicit, however, in the statutory provisions governing equitable distribution that a valuation date reasonably proximate to the date of distribution must, in the usual case, be utilized.

Indeed, it is inconceivable that the requirement that the distribution be made in such proportions as the court deems “just” could be satisfied without reference to the current values of the assets. The statute, in its enumeration of factors to be considered in making a distribution of marital property, sets forth a number of factors which focus on the <em>present </em>needs and financial situations of the parties, including their “amount and sources of income,” “employability,” “estate, liabilities and needs,” chances for “future acquisitions of capital assets and income,” “sources of income,” the “value of the property set apart” as non-marital property, “standard of living,” and the “economic circumstances of each party at the time the division of property is to become effective.” In view of these factors, and with particular reference to the last one which encompasses generally all of the former, and which expressly focuses on the parties’ financial circumstances <em>at the time </em>when marital property is to be distributed, it is inconceivable that the legislature intended marital property to be valued at some <em>other </em>time. Granted, there may be situations where marital assets have been consumed or disposed of by one of the parties, thus rendering a current valuation impossible and making it necessary to rely on data that <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>would otherwise be considered stale, but such is not the case here. See generally <em>Sergi v. Sergi, </em><a href="/pa-super/351/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="351 Pa. Super. 588" data-case-ids="649828" data-case-paths="/pa-super/351/0588-01">351 Pa.Super. 588</a>, 594, <a href="/pa-super/351/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="351 Pa.

In the usual case, however, given that the parties’ present needs and circumstances are to be a major factor in distributing marital assets, it would be impossible to construct a distribution scheme that would be fully responsive to those needs and circumstances if the court were to act without taking cognizance of the current values of the assets being distributed.</p>

It cannot be said that distributions based upon stale valuations are based on value, for value is by no means a constant.</p>

Volatile market conditions and changing economic circumstances can render assets that had been valuable months or years earlier virtually worthless in the present, and vice versa. Publicly traded securities may be worth a fortune one day, and a pittance the next. Privately owned business interests may be valued as a gold mine, or as a scrimption, depending on the times. Automobiles that were once of considerable worth may, through abuse or neglect, rapidly become valueless. Other examples too numerous to mention scarcely require enumeration. In view of these com<a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>monly recognized aspects of valuation, it is difficult to conceive justification for the view that stale valuation data, i.e., data that does not reflect values reasonably proximate to the date of distribution, should be used by the court in setting a distribution scheme.

The parties separated in October of 1981, a complaint in divorce was filed in February of 1982, and distribution of marital assets was ordered by the Court of Common Pleas in May of 1985. Clearly, the time lapse between the former dates and the latter date, when distribution was ordered, is such that highly significant value fluctuations may have occurred. To distribute property without regard to those fluctuations would be illogical, and would undermine the legislative intent of making the equitable distribution process responsive to the contemporaneous needs and financial situations of the parties. We conclude, therefore, that the Superior Court properly remanded this case for determination of revised asset valuations, thereby negating the Court of Common Pleas’ reliance upon values fixed as of the date of separation.</p>

See also 32A C.J.S. Evidence § 1023 (clear and convincing evidence required in a limited number of civil cases). In short, the Superior' Court focused only upon those civil cases where the more demanding standard of proof has been applied, rather than upon the predominant number of civil cases where the evidentiary burden requires only proof by a preponderance of the evidence. It is not apparent what connection is to be perceived in comparing the present case to those cited, for the issues presented and considerations <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>involved are clearly distinct. Indeed, the present case is one where the presumption in question was created by an express statutory provision in the Divorce Code, and where the “showing” necessary to rebut the presumption has likewise been referenced by statute. 23 P.S. § 401(f).</p>

Yet, in any case where economic interests of the parties are to be adjudicated, as is the case where rights to marital property are to be determined, it is obvious that the parties involved will incur the effects of the adjudication. It is not clear, however, that the effects are any greater in this realm than when other economic and property interests are at stake, and, thus, it does not appear that a higher standard of proof is, of necessity, required.</p>

Instead, the legislature created a rule of substantive law that property acquired during marriage is to be deemed marital in nature, absent a “showing” that the property was acquired by one of the methods enumerated in subsection (e). 23 P.S. § 401(f). Certainly, the mere fact that a statutory presumption has been enacted, with provision for the presumption to be rebutted upon a proper showing, is not basis in itself for inferring that clear and convincing evidence is needed to rebut the presumption. See, e.g., <em>Fawcett Estate, </em><a href="/pa/449/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="449 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1945622" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0497-01">449 Pa. 497</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=297%20A.2d%20799" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="297 A.2d 799">297 A.2d 799</a> (1972).

Appellant challenges the master’s determination that one-half of the marital residence was the separate property of appellant’s wife, and, hence, that such one-half interest was not subject to equitable distribution. The master’s determination was based upon a finding of an interspousal gift in the form of a conveyance made in 1978 by appellant to his wife, in her sole name, of a one-half interest in the marital residence, which, until then, had been held as tenants by the entireties.

But once it is determined that donative intent was present, inquiry into the reason or motive for a gift becomes meaningless. A transfer motivated by an attempt to avoid inheritance taxes is "not inconsistent with a donative intent, but rather positively suggests such an intent.” <em>Clay </em>v. <em>Keiser, </em><a href="/pa/460/0620-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="460 Pa. 620" data-case-ids="482801" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0620-01">460 Pa. 620</a>, 626-627 n. 3, <a href="/pa/460/0620-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="460 Pa. 620" data-case-ids="482801" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0620-01">334 A.2d 263</a>, 266 n. 3 (1975). It cannot be said that the master erred in finding an interspousal gift in this case, and even appellant does not deny that the conveyance should be regarded as an effective gift for federal tax purposes. In essence, appellant requests that two categories of gifts be recognized, i.e., those made for reasons of "love and affection,” and those made for other reasons, so that, depending on the occasion presented, appellant could assert or deny a gift as best suits his interests. Such a position is clearly untenable. The Divorce Code does not contemplate that, after a gift has been made, an inquiry will be conducted into whether the reasons for the gift were sufficiently "loving” as to warrant recognition.</p>

However, I write separately to emphasize that the distribution date is the date the common pleas court enters an order of distribution, and that the disposition date of post-trial motions or appeals does not affect the use of that original date as the valuation point. Therefore, a litigant cannot contest the relative value of assets on the grounds that they substantially changed while the case was being further litigated.</p>

Likewise, under Pa.R.Civ.P. 1920.33, we require each party who seeks distribution of property to file a detailed inventory, listing the marital property valued as of the date of the complaint, within sixty days after service of a pleading containing a claim for distribution of property.

It would seem somewhat of an anomaly to require the parties to set values as of a certain date, yet ignore that valuation at the time of distribution. Nowhere else in the Divorce Code are the parties required to set forth the values of the property at a different time. Furthermore, using the date that the action was commenced as the time for valuation not only provides certainty, but is also consistent with the Divorce Code’s attempt to expedite an otherwise emotional or explosive period.</p>

Either party can file a complaint at any time. Therefore, each party has the equal opportunity of setting the time for which the property will be valued.

Using the time requirements set forth in our Rules will result in an orderly procedure and timely distribution of property.
