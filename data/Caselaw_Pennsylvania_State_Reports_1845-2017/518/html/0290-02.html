While a fugitive from justice, appellant continued his pattern of threats and intimidation. On November 26, 1979, Mr. Cunningham, who was coordinating the investigation of the Cho murder and the search for appellant, received a telephone call from a man identifying himself as Robert Lark, who said he wanted to congratulate the prosecutor on a job well done, and that “You’re a real aggressive guy and so am I and I want you to know that I will not let bygones be bygones.” N.T.

Where the defendant moves to sever offenses not based on the same act or transaction that have been consolidated in a single indictment or information, or opposes joinder of separate indictments or informations, the court must therefore determine: whether the evidence of each of the offenses would be admissible in a separate trial for the other; whether such evidence is capable of separation by the jury so as to avoid danger of confusion; and, if the answers to these inquiries are in the affirmative, whether the defendant will be unduly prejudiced by the consolidation of offenses. The trial court gave due consideration to each of these inquiries and refused to grant appellant’s application for severance of the three distinct offenses that had been consolidated in a single indictment by the Commonwealth. This Court must affirm that determination in the absence of manifest abuse of discretion or prejudice and clear injustice to appellant.</p>

Trial, June 21, 1985 at 54, 57, and a reference by the prosecutor during examination of a witness, a police detective, to appellant's “other arrests,” N.T. Trial, June 21, 1985 at 166. For the reasons given in the preceding section, the evidence of other threats made by appellant and the statement to Ms. Morris was admissible as it was relevant to establish motive and intent, it had a logical connection to the crimes charged, and additionally, such evidence constituted admissions by conduct showing consciousness of guilt. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Not surprisingly, criminal defendants always wish to excise evidence of unpleasant and unpalatable circumstances surrounding a criminal offense from the Commonwealth’s presentation at trial. Of course, the courts must make sure that evidence of such circumstances have some relevance to the case and are not offered solely to inflame the jury or arouse prejudice against the defendant. The court is not, however, required to sanitize the trial'to eliminate all unpleasant facts from the jury’s consideration where those facts are relevant to the issues at hand and form part of the history and natural development of the events and offenses for which the defendant is charged, as appellant would have preferred.</p>

This alleged incident was brought to Judge Geisz’ attention by the deputy sheriff who had been escorting appellant. The court officer who had been escorting the jurors to the elevator in the hallway that day questioned the jurors individually, and apparently found that nothing noteworthy or prejudicial had happened. Defense counsel asked for a mistrial based solely on this vague information before the court, stating specifically that this motion was made “without requesting that [the court] poll any jurors to determine <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>whether or not they saw Mister Lark.” N.T.

During closing argument, the prosecutor indicated that appellant “has a manner of carrying his gun in the same fashion as the murderer; that is, stuffed down in the middle of his back under his belt.” N.T. Trial, June 26, 1985 at 175-76. The record indicates that this fact — appellant’s habit of tucking his gun in his pants in back — was <em>in fact </em>introduced to the jury by the Commonwealth through the out-of-court statement of a witness, Michael Johnson. Mr. Johnson had given a written statement to the police on September 14, 1979 which indicated that appellant carried his gun “in the back, tucked in his pants.” N.T. Trial, June 14, 1985 at 113. The witness could not recall this specific statement when called to testify at trial (he explained he had been hit in the head with a baseball bat, and had trouble remembering past events), although he did authenticate the signed statement of September 14, 1979 as his own and stated that he told the truth at that time. Accordingly, the court allowed the out-of-court declaration to be read to the jury under the “past recollection recorded” exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See Commonwealth v. Cooley, </em><a href="/pa/484/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="484 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="1753742" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0014-01">484 Pa. 14</a>, <a href="/pa/484/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="484 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="1753742" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0014-01">398 A.2d 637</a> (1979).
