The sole issue presented is whether items obtained by police during the search of an automobile driven by appellee were properly suppressed. The relevant facts are the following.</p>
    <p id="b570-4" data-blocks='[["BL_570.4",570,[234,799,1156,1305]]]'>On September 7, 1984, at approximately 5:00 p.m., Detective Ceceóla of the Upper Darby Police Narcotics Unit met with Cindy Wood after having received a phone call from Wood professing knowledge as to illegal drug dealing. Wood stated that she had received medical treatment for injuries inflicted by her boyfriend, the appellee herein, and that the injuries were inflicted earlier that day in the course of an argument relating to appellee’s involvement with illegal drugs. In addition, Wood reported that appellee had been dealing in drugs for the past year at the apartment where she and appellee resided, and that, following the argument that day, appellee departed from the apartment to purchase drugs. Detective Ceceóla was told by Wood that appellee was driving a certain automobile that Wood purportedly owned, and that appellee was expected to be returning with the drugs in several hours. Wood also told Ceceóla that, following her argument with appellee, she had discarded some of appellee’s drugs and related paraphernalia in the apartment’s trash receptacle. This information was of timely importance to Detective Ceceóla because, just two days prior, on September 5, 1984, Ceceóla had received a phone call from a confidential informant of known reliability indicating that the informant had purchased drugs from appellee at the apartment in question.</p>
    <p id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.5",570,[232,2137,1151,261]],["BL_571.1",571,[201,336,1149,96]]]'>After talking with Wood, Detective Ceceóla immediately applied for and received a search warrant, at approximately 6:00 p.m., covering the person of appellee and the apartment. No application was made for a warrant to search the automobile that appellee was known to be driving, however, <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>despite its known role in transporting the drugs that were being purchased.</p>
    <p id="b571-5" data-blocks='[["BL_571.4",571,[199,452,1153,1070]]]'>Later, around 7:00 p.m. that same day, Detective Ceceóla stationed two plainclothes police officers in an unmarked vehicle at the end of the dead-end street where the apartment was located, such that appellee would have to pass by on the way back to the apartment. Ceceóla and Wood then went to the apartment where they waited more than two hours for appellee’s return, and, ultimately, the plainclothes officers called Ceceóla by radio to inform him that appellee had arrived. Approximately twenty minutes before that arrival, Wood had mentioned to Ceceóla the exact location in the automobile where appellee usually stored drugs, namely, under the hood. As soon as Ceceóla was alerted to appellee’s arrival, he left the apartment and met the plainclothes officers in the street. Appellee had already parked and stepped out of the automobile by the time the officers approached him. The officers noticed that another individual, unknown to them at the time but later identified as a security guard for the apartment building, was a passenger in the automobile. That individual exited from the automobile at the request of the officers.</p>
    <p id="b571-6" data-blocks='[["BL_571.5",571,[196,1542,1153,844]]]'>Next, Detective Ceceóla looked through the open driver’s door of the automobile and noticed a brown bag and a small brown box on the front seat. The box, which was approximately five inches by eight inches in size, had a lid which was closed. Ceceóla was not able to determine from that vantage point what was in either the bag or the box, but he noticed glassine bags protruding from the lid of the box. A search of the automobile was then conducted. It was discovered that the box on the front seat contained empty glassine bags, of a type sometimes used for packaging methamphetamines, and a scale of a sort commonly used for weighing drugs. The bag on the front seat contained fifteen hypodermic syringes. In addition, bags of methamphetamines were found under the hood of the automobile. At the conclusion of the search, appellee was placed under arrest.</p>

      <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>The Commonwealth argues in the instant appeal that, because appellee concedes that ample probable cause existed to have obtained a warrant to search the automobile, the search was permissible even in the absence of a warrant. Specifically, it is asserted that exigent circumstances are never necessary to justify a warrantless search of a motor vehicle in Pennsylvania. Such an assertion is plainly without merit, in view of well established constitutional principles governing vehicle searches.</p>
    <p id="b572-5" data-blocks='[["BL_572.4",572,[228,823,1157,1011]]]'>In clarification of the applicable analytical framework, it is to be noted that the present case does not fall within the bounds of traditionally recognized exceptions to search warrant requirements.

In this regard, it is claimed that probable cause to search the automobile did not arise until twenty minutes before appellee returned to the apartment, because that was when Wood told Ceceóla <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>the exact location, under the hood, where drugs were often stored. Further, the Commonwealth contends that the presence of a passenger in the automobile contributed to the exigencies presented.</p>
    <p id="b574-5" data-blocks='[["BL_574.4",574,[267,546,1151,407]]]'>The burden is upon the Commonwealth to establish that exigent circumstances were present, such that it was not reasonably practicable to obtain a search warrant. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 323(h) (Commonwealth has the burden of establishing that challenged evidence was not obtained in violation of a defendant’s rights). The courts below held that the Commonwealth failed to meet that burden. We agree.</p>
    <p id="b574-6" data-blocks='[["BL_574.5",574,[262,971,1153,820]]]'>At least four hours prior to the instant search the police had information, supplied by Wood, that appellee would be transporting drugs in a particular automobile when he returned to the apartment. Information supplied by Wood later stating the location in the automobile where drugs would likely be located was cumulative, and, although helpful to the police in conducting the search, it did not alter the fact that probable cause had already existed for a number of hours. Similarly, the presence of a passenger in the automobile added nothing to the presence of probable cause, and, further, the Commonwealth introduced no evidence at the suppression hearing to the effect that the passenger was in any way involved with appellee or with the contraband, or that the presence of the passenger was viewed by the officers as an inducement to conduct a warrantless search.</p>

In their zeal to make an arrest, however, the officers approached appellee as soon as he had exited from his parked vehicle, but before appellee had been given adequate opportunity to move any of the drugs onto his person or into his apartment, i.e., to the areas covered by the search warrant. A search warrant for the vehicle would have been obtainable at the same time a warrant was <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>secured to search the apartment and person of appellee. By neglecting to obtain a warrant covering the vehicle, and by approaching appellee immediately upon his arrival, the officers inexplicably took the risk that appellee would at least temporarily have kept the drugs in the automobile, and, thus, they took the risk that appellee would not yet have moved any of the contraband into areas covered by the search warrant.</p>

Indeed, it would be difficult to conceive of a case where the circumstances surrounding a challenged search would be more clearly non-exigent than those presented here. Thus, inasmuch as obtaining a warrant would certainly have been practicable, suppression of the items seized in the instant search was entirely proper.</p>

    <p id="b576-7" data-blocks='[["BL_576.7",576,[258,1121,1152,456]]]'>Today, those in support of affirmance suppress drugs seized as part of an automobile search and in so doing overrule our own precedent. There is no question that Cindy Wood, the informant in this case, and estranged girlfriend of Appellee, told the police that Appellee was a drug dealer, and that he was using <em>her </em>car to pick up and transport drugs. During the police investigation of this matter, she even told the police that he hides the drugs under the car hood.</p>
    <p id="b576-8" data-blocks='[["BL_576.8",576,[253,1604,1154,782]],["BL_577.1",577,[177,327,1152,86]]]'>Based upon this information, the police obtained a search warrant for Appellee’s person and his apartment. The police continued their investigation by waiting for Appellee to return with Wood’s car. The police watched Appellee park the car and exit from it. Seconds after he exited the car, the police approached Appellee. In fact, the police were so quick in accosting Appellee that a passenger was still in the car. The police immediately asked the passenger to get out of the automobile and then conducted the subject warrantless search which resulted in the finding of a cache of methamphetamines under the hood of the automobile. The affirmers rule that the search of the vehicle under these circumstances does not fall squarely into one of the traditionally recognized exceptions for warrantless searches, and therefore the seized drugs must be sup<a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>pressed. We disagree with this conclusion and would reverse the lower courts.</p>
    <p id="b577-5" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[174,439,1155,1191]]]'>We recently held that where the police have independent probable cause to believe that a vehicle has been used in furtherance of the commission of a felony, or that evidence of a crime is concealed within, they may conduct a warrant-less search of the automobile. <em>Commonwealth v. Milyak, </em><a href="/pa/508/0002-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="508 Pa. 2" data-case-ids="1794023" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0002-01">508 Pa. 2</a>, <a href="/pa/508/0002-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="493 A.2d 1346" data-case-ids="1794023,1794072" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0002-01,/pa/508/0001-01">493 A.2d 1346</a> (1985). In <em>Milyak, </em>an informant described to police a van that had been used in the perpetration of a felony and that inside the van they would find stolen televisions. Two and one-half hours after this information was given to the police, a van matching the informant’s description was spotted pulling into a restaurant. The passengers exited the van and entered the restaurant. At that point, the police looked inside the van and saw televisions with tags on them indicating that they had come from the hardware store in question. The police spotted a crowbar in the van. We held that independent probable cause existed to believe that the van had been used in the perpetration of a felony because it matched a description given by a witness, was found within a mile of the burglary, and because the police observed items in the van confirming the connection of the van to the burglary. Accordingly, we affirmed legitimacy of the search of the van, even though the occupants of the van had exited.</p>
    <p id="b577-6" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[174,1647,1151,306]]]'>Our holding in <em>Milyak </em>also parallels the Federal Standard enunciated in <em>U.S. v. Johns, </em><a href="/us/469/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="469 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="11959884" data-case-paths="/us/469/0478-01">469 U.S. 478</a>, <a href="/us/469/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="469 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="11959884" data-case-paths="/us/469/0478-01">105 S.Ct. 881</a>, <a href="/us/469/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="469 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="11959884" data-case-paths="/us/469/0478-01">83 L.Ed.2d 890</a> (1985), which similarly allows the police to conduct the warrantless search of a vehicle if the police have independent probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband. Such is clearly the case here.</p>
    <p id="b577-7" data-blocks='[["BL_577.6",577,[172,1970,1153,305]]]'>Cindy Wood supplied all the information the police needed to satisfy the police’s probable cause requirement for search at that time. She gave them an exact description, told them that Appellee was using it to pick up and transport illegal drugs, and that he usually hides them under the hood. All this was learned during a police investigation.</p>
    <p id="b577-8" data-blocks='[["BL_577.7",577,[171,2292,1152,96]],["BL_578.1",578,[239,326,1151,516]]]'>The police and Wood waited for Appellee to return with the car and it was after Appellee exited the car that the <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>police stopped him and looked in the car. At that point, they saw in plain view glassine bags protruding from the lid of a box. It is not uncommon that these bags are used for packaging drugs. At this point the police had independent probable cause to believe that the car had been used in the perpetration of a felony. As in <em>Milyak, </em>the car exactly matched the description given by the informant, was found in a place which bolstered the informant’s story, and the police saw evidence in plain view confirming the connection of the van to the transportation of illegal drugs.</p>
    <p id="b578-5" data-blocks='[["BL_578.4",578,[238,861,1151,457]]]'>Under these circumstances, we have no trouble in concluding that <em>Milyak </em>controls and that the suppression of the drugs confiscated by the police was improper. Finally, we note with some incredulity that the author of <em>Milyak </em>who spoke so eloquently for this Court, now summarily distinguishes that case to reach the unwarranted result endorsed by the affirmers today. For the reasons already stated, we would reverse the orders of the Superior Court and the trial court.</p>
