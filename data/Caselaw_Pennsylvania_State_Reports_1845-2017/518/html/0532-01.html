Commentators have noted the differing societal functions of the civil and criminal laws, as well as their stigma on members of society. The aim of the criminal law is to protect the public against harm by punishing conduct. The function of tort law is to compensate someone for harm that he or she has suffered. <em>See </em>1 W. Lafave &amp; A. Scott, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>§ 1.3, at 17 (1986). As a result, "even aside from differences in moral condemnation, it would seem that criminal punishment, with its emphasis on imprisonment, is on the whole more drastic than the sanctions, with emphasis on paying money, imposed by the civil law____” <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. A conviction for vehicular homicide carries such a moral condemnation. <em>See Commonwealth v. Heck, </em><a href="/pa-super/341/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="341 Pa.

It is the <em>behavior </em>of a victim which is of relevance to the element of causation, and the behavior of the victim in this case was fully presented to the jury. What motivates such behavior, however, is entirely irrelevant. I do not believe that a driver who kills a pedestrian, who may be intoxicated, while that driver operates his or her vehicle in a manner which violates the Motor Vehicle Code, is any less culpable than a driver who kills a pedestrian suddenly stricken by an epileptic seizure.</p>

As the majority notes, the Appellant also suffered a “panic stress reaction’’ at that time. The Appellant now claims that he is entitled to offer proof of the victim’s own intoxication in order to demonstrate that the victim fell into the path of his car rather than the driver running down the victim. In effect, the Appellant seeks to prove under the Motor Vehicle Code that the death was not the probable result of a Code violation.</p>

Under the proposed rationale, the Appellant would be allowed to introduce evidence of the victim’s intoxication, <em>although </em>the central issue is whether the victim fell in front of the car. In order to make the evidence of intoxication relevant, however, the Appellant must make at least an offer of proof that the victim actually fell in front of him. Only then would the evidence of intoxication and the fall connect in a coherent manner. The majority would have us <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>believe that because the victim was intoxicated, it could be reasonably inferred by a jury that he caused his own death. Such argument makes no sense, and I presume that the trial judge came to the same conclusion for the same reason. The mere fact of the victim’s intoxication becomes relevant as a matter of law only where there is proof in the first place that the victim himself fell into the path of the swerving car. At that point, the victim’s intoxication would be used to explain the basis of the fall.</p>
