Hubbard, </em><a href="/pa/472/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="472 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1727744" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0259-01">472 Pa. 259</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="472 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1727744" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0259-01">372 A.2d 687</a> (1977).

In his retrial, Paskings attempted to introduce his expert testimony, which refuted the Commonwealth’s theory of the fire’s origin. The expert did not testify at the first trial, but based his opinion upon the notes of testimony from the first trial. However, at the retrial, the expert did not highlight which facts he was relying upon, nor did Paskings’ trial counsel read the notes of the first trial into the record. In affirming the trial court’s exclusion of Paskings’ expert testimony, we stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b304-6" data-blocks='[["BL_304.5",304,[290,1503,1111,419]]]'>As with all expert opinion, however, it is essential that the salient facts relied upon as the basis for the opinion be in the record.

The evidence, therefore, was properly excluded.

Daniels, </em><a href="/pa/480/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="480 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="1745036" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0340-01">480 Pa. 340</a>, <a href="/pa/480/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="480 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="1745036" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0340-01">390 A.2d 172</a> (1978), we were again faced with the issue of the admissibility of an expert’s opinion. In <em>Daniels, </em>the Commonwealth’s expert, a forensic pathologist, referred to various sources in reaching his conclusion as to the cause of the victim’s death. Those sources included interviews with witnesses acquainted with the decedent, hospital records, death certificate, police reports and testimony heard during <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>the trial. Although the medical expert did not relate every fact he considered in reaching his conclusion, he did indicate the sources he reviewed in reaching his conclusion. All of these sources were part of the record either as live testimony or documentary evidence. Unlike in <em>Paskings, </em>the jury in <em>Daniels </em>had the facts upon which the expert’s opinion was based before them, thereby permitting the jurors to either accept or reject the expert’s medical opinion based on the jury’s determination of the veracity of the facts which he relied upon. Thus, we had no problem in permitting the admission of the forensic pathologist’s opinion.</p>
    <p id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.4",305,[220,904,1153,958]]]'>It is clear from <em>Paskings </em>and <em>Daniels </em>that expert opinion testimony is proper if the facts upon which it is based are of record. This requirement for admissibility of opinion testimony is crucial. The purpose of expert testimony is to assist the factfinder in understanding issues which are complex or go beyond common knowledge. An expert’s function is to assist the jury in understanding the problem so that the jury can make the ultimate determination. If a jury disbelieves the facts upon which the opinion is based, the jury undoubtedly will disregard the expert’s opinion. Likewise, if a jury accepts the veracity of the facts which the expert relies upon, it is more likely that the jury will accept the expert’s opinion. At the heart of any analysis is the veracity of the facts upon which the conclusion is based. Without the facts, a jury cannot make any determination as to validity of the expert’s opinion. To hold otherwise would result in a total and complete usurpation of the jury’s function in our system of justice.</p>
    <p id="b305-6" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[220,1885,1151,475]],["BL_306.1",306,[263,314,1151,258]]]'>Based upon the foregoing, we must conclude that trial counsel was ineffective. There is no reason that can be offered for permitting the damaging opinion of Dr. Fagenholtz to be admitted without the facts upon which it was based being considered. How could a jury evaluate the expert opinion without even knowing the facts upon which it was based. Dr. Fagenholtz testified that the case history was the single most important factor in reaching her conclusion. If the jury believed that the case history she received <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>was inaccurate or false, surely this would affect the validity of her opinion. When an expert definitively testifies to the ultimate conclusion, as in this case, the improper admission of that evidence must by its very nature be so prejudicial as to require a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b306-5" data-blocks='[["BL_306.4",306,[259,597,1153,366]]]'>Finally, as in <em>Daniels, </em>we have reviewed the entire record to discern whether the void in Dr. Fagenholtz’s testimony could be filled by other evidence. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Accordingly, we must reverse the order of the Superior Court, <a href="/pa-super/356/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="356 Pa.
