These charges stemmed from the shooting death of Davis Kelly on North Twenty-first Street in Philadelphia on June 23, 1979. The following day, February 7, 1985, the <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>same jury sentenced appellant to death in a separate sentencing proceeding conducted pursuant to the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711. Post-verdict motions were denied by the Honorable Eugene Gelfand and, on May 6, 1986, Judge Gelfand formally sentenced appellant to death and to consecutive terms of imprisonment of five to ten years and two and one-half to five years, respectively, for the conspiracy and possession of an instrument of crime convictions (the terms of imprisonment to run concurrently to the death sentence). This direct appeal automatically followed. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(h)(1); 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 722(4); Pa.R.A.P. Rule 702(b).</p>
    <p id="b116-5" data-blocks='[["BL_116.4",116,[258,991,1153,907]]]'>The evidence adduced at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the verdict winner, discloses the following. On the evening of June 22, 1979, appellant and Levi Rucker met at Kimberleigh Green’s residence in the 6400 block of North Twenty-first Street to plan the killing of Davis Kelly. Davis Kelly was suspected by these conspirators of having killed Michael Green, Ms. Green’s brother, several months earlier. The plan was for Ms. Green to lure the victim from 6410 North Twenty-first Street, where he was visiting his young daughter, on the pretext of purchasing a quart of beer for Ms. Green. (Ms. Green was not of legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages at this time.) The victim would purchase the beer at the Tropical Lounge which was just down the street. When the victim left the lounge, Levi Rucker was to lock the door of the lounge behind him, and appellant was to emerge from an adjacent alley and shoot the victim with his gun.</p>

Ms. Green gave the victim two dollars to purchase the beer. He walked to the nearby Tropical Lounge and purchased a quart of beer. He then left the lounge and walked back toward 6410 North Twenty-first Street where Ms. Green waited outside. As the victim approached Ms. Green, appellant emerged from the adjacent alley and shot the victim from behind. The victim fell to the ground and, as he attempted to get to his <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>feet, appellant came closer to him and, from about three feet away, pumped three more rounds into him. The three conspirators then fled.</p>
    <p id="b117-4" data-blocks='[["BL_117.4",117,[209,491,1150,628]]]'>Davis Kelly died shortly thereafter as a result of his wounds which severely damaged most of his internal organs. He had been shot four times, one of the bullets exiting his body (the spent bullet was never recovered) and the other three lodging in and recovered from his body. One of the bullets had been severely distorted by an impact with a hard object which, the Commonwealth’s firearms expert testified, demonstrated that the bullet had richocheted, probably off of the sidewalk. The forensic medical evidence corroborated that one of the victim’s wounds was caused by a richochet. The remaining two bullets were identified as .32 caliber ammunition.</p>
    <p id="b117-5" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[207,1145,1153,637]]]'>Betty Harris was present at her mother’s house at 6410 North Twenty-first Street when Kimberleigh Green asked the victim to purchase some beer on the night of the shooting. Betty Harris and two friends were on the porch when he returned, and she witnessed the shooting which took place on the sidewalk in front of the house. Ms. Harris had known appellant from the neighborhood for “about ten years.” However, because she was fearful of appellant, she did not identify appellant as the shooter until January, 1985 on the eve of trial. Prior to that time, she had consistently told police investigators that she was unable to identify the shooter.</p>

When she arrived at the scene, she saw a large number of men outside the bar, one of whom had an object which appeared to be a handgun visibly sticking out of his waistband. That man was appellant. Officer O’Donnell patted appellant down, and confiscated from him a .32 caliber “Llama” semi-automatic pistol and a bag containing approximately 25 rounds of .32 caliber ammunition. Appellant was arrest<a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>ed and subsequently charged with receiving stolen property (the gun had been reported stolen), carrying firearms without a license,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and carrying firearms on public streets or public property in Philadelphia.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> He was subsequently acquitted of those charges.

She was arrested and charged with murder, and on April 28, 1983, she pled guilty to conspiracy and murder of the third degree, and agreed to testify against Rucker and appellant. The two men were then arrested: appellant on May 3, 1983 and Rucker on May 24, 1983.</p>

After a jury was selected, but before testimony was taken, Levi Rucker, who had given an inculpatory statement to police implicating himself and appellant, decided to plead guilty to conspiracy and murder of the third degree, and he agreed to testify against appellant. After co-defendant Rucker pled guilty, Judge Richette recused herself from appellant’s trial, declared a mistrial, and the case was assigned to Judge Gelfand.</p>

At trial, the Commonwealth presented, inter alia, the testimony of appellant’s co-defendants, Green and Rucker, and of eyewitness Betty Harris, in addition to ballistics, forensic and police investigatory evidence. The defense consisted of attempts to discredit and impeach the testimony of the eyewitnesses and to show the co-defendants to be the sole perpetrators of the conspiracy and murder. Defense witnesses included appellant’s sister, Barbara Smith, who testified that appellant was not at Kimberleigh Green’s house on the night of the shooting, and one Darnell Holland, who testified that he was at the Tropical Lounge and witnessed the shooting and that appellant was not there and did not participate. Additionally, appellant took the stand and denied .shooting Davis Kelly. Appellant explained that he purchased the .32 caliber pistol and ammunition from “two guys” at the bar in North Philadelphia for $55.00 the night of his arrest on June 25, 1979. He did not know who the “two guys” were.</p>

The jury found that the Commonwealth had proven the existence of two aggravating circumstances, namely that in the commission of the offense, the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(7), and significant history of felony convictions involving the use of violence, 42 Pa.C. S.A. § 9711(d)(9), and it found no mitigating circumstances. Accordingly, the sentence of death was mandated by statute. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(c)(1)(iv) (“the verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance ... and no mitigating circumstance____”).</p>

Appellant’s acquittal of violating section 6106 might well have been based upon the Commonwealth’s failure to demonstrate that he had no license for the firearm or to convince the fact-finder that he had it <em>concealed </em>on his person (it was readily visible to the arresting officer). The acquittal might also have resulted from his presentation of the defense that he was exempt under one of the numerous exceptions of section 6106(b), say for example subsection 8 regarding transporting a firearm unloaded from the place of purchase. Appellant gave an exculpatory statement following his June 25, 1979 arrest which was <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>consistent with his trial testimony (in the instant prosecution) that he had just purchased the gun in the bar at which he was arrested. <em>See </em>Notes of Testimony (N.T.) November 29, 1983 at 252, Pretrial Suppression Hearing before Judge Richette, <em>and </em>N.T. January 1, 1985, Trial at 99-102; Brief for Commonwealth at 18. Appellant’s acquittal of violating section 6108 may well have been based upon the Commonwealth’s failure to prove he carried the handgun on public property or streets (the record does not disclose whether the June 25th arrest took place on a public sidewalk or on private property adjacent to the bar), or upon appellant’s establishing a defense under § 6108(1) or (2). Appellant’s acquittal on these possession charges did not, therefore necessarily prove that he did not actually possess the handgun on June 25, 1979, nor did it dispose of the issues to be litigated in the subsequent prosecution for the inchoate crime of possession under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 907, wherein the Commonwealth was required to show that appellant was in possession of an instrument of crime <em>on June 23, 1979 </em>and that he intended to employ it criminally. Appellant, despite the former acquittal, could well have possessed the handgun on both June 23rd, and June 25th, and the Commonwealth’s failure to establish that he violated sections 6106 and 6108 of the Uniform Firearms Act did not preclude the Commonwealth from proving that, on June 23rd, he possessed an instrument of crime (a handgun) and employed it criminally (to kill Davis Kelly). Collateral estoppel did not therefore prevent the subsequent prosecution of appellant under section 907, nor his prosecution for murder and criminal conspiracy, as the acquittal did not “necessarily require a determination inconsistent with a fact which must be established for conviction of the second offense.” 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 110(2).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Appellant’s acquittal of the charges for possession under the Uniform Firearms Act did not necessarily determine that appellant was not in actual physical possession of the gun on June 25, 1979. Moreover, the suppression court at C.P. 79-07-0413, the first prosecution, denied appellant’s motion to suppress the gun and bullets on October 31, 1979.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> In the instant, subsequent prosecution, Judge Richette reheard the suppression motion, considered the court’s prior ruling (of non-suppression) in the previous case, and properly denied appellant’s motion to suppress, finding that the evidence was legally obtained.

Trial, January 29, 1985 at 33, 37. Appellant concedes that prior consistent statements of a witness are admissible to rebut a defense suggestion of corrupt motives or recent fabrication. <em>Commonwealth v. Griffin, </em><a href="/pa/511/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="511 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="1798761" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0553-01">511 Pa. 553</a>, 568-69, <a href="/pa/511/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="511 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="1798761" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0553-01">515 A.2d 865</a> (1986). However, he takes issue with admitting such statements where “no challenge to Rucker’s testimony had yet been made.” The order of proof is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court the exercise of which will be upheld on appeal absent an abuse thereof. <em>Commonwealth v. Smallwood, </em><a href="/pa/497/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="497 Pa. 476" data-case-ids="1775296" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0476-01">497 Pa. 476</a>, 484, <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a><a href="/pa/497/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="497 Pa. 476" data-case-ids="1775296" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0476-01">442 A.2d 222</a> (1982). The court did not abuse its discretion in this case in admitting prior consistent statements of a witness before that witness was actually impeached on cross-examination, because appellant’s entire line of defense centered around impeaching the credibility of the co-defendants and attempting to portray them as the sole perpetrators of the shooting and conspiracy. Kimberleigh Green’s testimony had already been attacked on the basis of her corrupt motives for fabricating evidence against appellant in return for pleading guilty to a lesser offense. Defense counsel’s opening argument suggested that Levi Rucker had motives to fabricate evidence against appellant in order to obtain a lenient sentence. That the prosecution was allowed to introduce prior consistent statements to rebut a charge of corrupt motives in anticipation of the announced defense, rather than following cross-examination of this particular witness, was a matter well within the discretion of the trial court.</p>

(1/29/85, N.T. 142).” This is a frivolous issue. Ms. Harris did not tell police that appellant was the shooter she saw on June 23, 1979 until the eve of trial, in January, 1985. She was asked at trial why she chose to tell the police at that time, and she responded “At. the time I was scared, I didn’t want to get involved and after I knew he [appellant] was in jail I felt safer.” In no way does this response suggest that appellant had been in jail on an <em>unrelated </em>offense; to the contrary, the only reasonable inference is that appellant was in jail awaiting this trial which was already scheduled to commence in a matter of days.</p>

We fail to see how this vague reference to “informants” implied the existence of any evidence against appellant at all, especially since he was not arrested for another three years; much less do we see how appellant suffered any harm by the detective’s remark.

This assertion would appear to be another attempt to mislead this Court <em>(see </em>note 6, <em>supra) </em>by referring to a remark twisted far out of context.

While appellant, once again, fails to supply us with particulars, his record reference is to an oral statement given by defense witness Barbara Smith to detectives, which oral statement was brought out by the Commonwealth on cross-examination of the witness. The trial court properly refused appellant’s request for a mistrial due to prosecutorial misconduct in withholding discovery. The challenged statement was not a written statement in the possession of the Commonwealth, nor was it a statement of an “eyewitness” as appellant implies disingenuously. Moreover, we agree with the trial court that the challenged statement “is so transient in <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>nature that it could not affect this matter.” N.T.

N.T. Sentencing Hearing, February 6, 1985 at 54-55. These convictions stemmed from an incident at the Swan Bar in Philadelphia on December 11,1981 wherein appellant shot a young lady in the left chest area and shot a man in his <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>elbow.

This evidence demonstrated that one of the bullets fired at the victim had richocheted off a solid surface and that another had passed through the victim and was, in fact, never recovered.

These witnesses testified that appellant was of “defective intelligence,” was highly unskilled, and that he had an I.Q. of 76. Counsel argued to the jury that there were three mitigating circumstances shown: that appellant was “under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance;” the diminished “capacity of [appellant] to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law;” and that the “character and record of the [appellant] and the circumstances of his offense” were such that the death penalty was unwarranted. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(2), (3) and (8), respectively.

As with most of appellant’s assertions, he offers very little in the way of specific averments; i.e., he fails to specify the factual issues that were determined at the previous prosecution for possession and he fails to explain with any specificity how the issues decided at that prosecution “necessarily determined" (and therefore precluded relitigation of) any issues at his subsequent prosecution for murder, conspiracy and possession. Instead, he merely makes the general <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>assertion that "In both cases, possession of the firearm is essential,” and "it is clear that there was a decision [in the prior prosecution] on the issue of possession.” Brief for Appellant at 12-13.</p>

Counsel blatantly misrepresents the record on this point, stating “since the evidence had been suppressed at the suppression hearing in C.P. 70 [sic]-07-0413, no mention of it at trial is allowed.” Brief for appellant at 13. This is flatly contradicted by the record, and by counsel’s statement to Judge Richette that "I concede, based upon my review of the Quarter Sessions file, that a motion to suppress the firearm was litigated before Judge Cain and denied.” N.T., Pretrial Hearing before Judge Richette, November 28, 1983 at 50. We are disturbed by this misrepresentation by counsel and by other aspects of appellant’s brief, as will be discussed more fully in text, <em>infra.</em>
