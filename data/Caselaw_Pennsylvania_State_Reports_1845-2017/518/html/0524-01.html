Donald Kennelly, David Martelli and their friends appeared to have been uninvited guests at the party. A fight ensued during which the Appellant was struck in the face. He responded by securing a kitchen knife. What happened after the acquisition of the knife is in dispute. The Appellant claims that he was confronted by Martelli holding a crowbar and, in self-defense, fatally stabbed him. He then saw a friend being beaten by Kennelly, resulting in the Appellant stabbing Kennelly once and then throwing the knife over a fence. The Commonwealth argues that the Appellant first stabbed Kennelly and then Martelli. The order of the stabbings is critical in refuting the perceived justification defense.</p>

For some unexplained reason, the motion was never considered until October 19, 1983, the same time the trial court was conducting a hearing on the Appellant’s motions to sever and to suppress certain statements of the Appellant. After taking testimony, the trial court granted the motion to sever, denied the motions to suppress and consolidate, and, after extensive oral argument, restricted the Commonwealth’s use of to the facts of the aggravated assault charge in the voir dire process. The Commonwealth then appealed the trial court ruling to the Superior Court, believing that the trial court ordered the Commonwealth not to offer any evidence regarding the aggravated assault charge in the homicide trial. The Superior Court reversed the trial court, <a href="/citations/?q=350%20Pa.%20Super.%20635" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="350 Pa.

Our reason for permitting these interlocutory appeals was the finality aspect of a suppression order and the unfair position in which the Commonwealth was placed if it were required to establish its burden of proof without all of the evidence it deemed necessary.

After the conclusion of the suppression hearing at which time the learned trial judge denied the suppression motion but granted the severance motion, the parties commenced jury voir dire. A dispute arose during voir dire for the homicide trial as to whether questions with regard to the aggravated assault charges were relevant. The parties then sought clarification from the trial judge as to whether the evidence regarding the aggravated assault would be permitted to be used at the homicide trial. After lengthy oral arguments, the trial judge ruled that based upon the evidence presented during the suppression hearing and the Commonwealth’s offer of proof, the Commonwealth lacked any evidence to substantiate its position that <em>Kennelly </em>was stabbed by the same knife as Martelli. As such, the trial judge concluded that the resulting prejudice to the appellant of the introduction of any evidence of the aggravated assault in the homicide trial would outweigh its probative value.</p>

On remand, the Commonwealth may still attempt to demonstrate relevancy by the introduction of additional evidence to the trial court, subject, however, to any motion in limine the appellant may file.</p>
