Post-verdict motions were denied and these appeals followed.\nAppellant contends (1) that a stenographic statement given to the police should have been suppressed as the product of unnecessary delay in violation of Rule 130 and because it was taken in violation of appellant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent, and (2) that the trial judge abused his discretion in permitting a prosecution witness, on redirect examination, to clarify a statement made on direct examination.\nWe have considered appellant\u2019s arguments, and find them to be without merit. We therefore affirm the judgment of sentence.\nJudgment affirmed.",
