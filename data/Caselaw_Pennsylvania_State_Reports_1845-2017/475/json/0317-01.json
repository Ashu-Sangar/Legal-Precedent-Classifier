Post-verdict motions were denied and he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of the second degree; five to ten years\u2019 imprisonment for the robbery; five to ten years\u2019 imprisonment for criminal conspiracy (this term was to be consecutive with the robbery sentence). Appellant was also sentenced to two and one-half to five years\u2019 imprisonment on the weapons conviction (this sentence was to be concurrent with all of the other sentences).\nOn this appeal appellant claims that he is entitled to a new trial on the basis of after discovered evidence. Having examined appellant\u2019s claim, we find it to be without merit.\nJudgment of Sentence affirmed.",
