Appellant was found guilty of murder of the third degree. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one and one-half to eighteen years. This appeal followed.\nAppellant\u2019s only argument is that there was insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction of murder of the third degree. We have reviewed the evidence in the instant case and find sufficient evidence to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction of murder of the third degree. See Commonwealth v. Rose, 463 Pa. 264, 344 A.2d 824 (1975).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.",
