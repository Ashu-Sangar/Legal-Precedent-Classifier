They observed three individuals on the sidewalk near a tavern. The officers made a U-turn some twenty-five feet beyond the bar at an intersection where there was a break in an island dividing the avenue. The officers then double-parked the automobile<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and exited the vehicle “with the intention to confront the [three] individuals.” As the officers approached and were about ten (10) feet from the individuals, one of them (Hall) was observed reaching into his pocket and dropping “a white Kleenex ball to the ground.” At the same time, Hall began <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>to cross the avenue where he joined two other individuals standing in front of a second tavern.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b519-5" data-blocks='[["BL_519.6",519,[156,367,1153,549]]]'>I dissent. The Court today holds that police officers may, on no more than the faintest suspicion, openly confront citizens in order to investigate possible criminal conduct, and absent some overt show of authority, such as a brandished weapon or a command to freeze, the Fourth Amendment is not relevant in assessing the legality of the police activity. Today’s decision not only runs afoul of the United States Supreme Court’s major pronouncements on investigatory stops, but seriously debilitates Fourth Amendment rights heretofore selfishly guarded by this Court.</p>

      <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>Under <em>Adams, </em>it was illegal for these police officers to forcibly stop appellant. Appellant was merely walking down the street — completely innocent behavior — and could harbor a perfectly legitimate expectation to be let alone. If the Fourth Amendment means anything, it is that our society puts a premium on the sanctity of individual freedom and security in the face of unwarranted government encroachments.</p>

    <p id="b520-6" data-blocks='[["BL_520.6",520,[282,1051,1160,814]]]'>These officers made a “U-turn” a mere twenty-five feet beyond where appellant was standing, and immediately double parked their car, “with the intention to confront” appellant and his companions. Even assuming that at this point appellant did not know or suspect that these men were law enforcement officers, the fact that three men pull up in and exit a car “with the intent to confront” three other individuals, and do so in the manner in which the police officers here confronted appellant, would cause a reasonable person in appellant’s position to believe that he should not walk away, but should submit to any forthcoming questions these persons might have. I have no doubt that an innocent citizen would feel that his freedom to walk away was being restrained if these men approached as they did here within ten feet of the individual.</p>

The officers were doing precisely that, and since they had absolutely no grounds for accosting this individual, the stop was illegal. In this Commonwealth, the primary responsibility and duty of giving force and effect to constitutional liberties lies with this Court. I think we abdicate that responsibility when we allow citizens to be <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>stopped and searched at the whim of police officers who have only a slight suspicion of improper conduct.</p>
