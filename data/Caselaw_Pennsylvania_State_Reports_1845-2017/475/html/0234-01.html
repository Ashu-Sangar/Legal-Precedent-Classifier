Again there was no misrepresentation on this score. The attorney testified that he did not recall discussing this but that he had given it thought, including the full-grown age and the reasonable education of the defendant. It cannot be said that it is a manifest injustice to warrant a withdrawal of a guilty plea because counsel has not discussed a conceivably possible mitigation factor with respect to the punishment for the crime. This follows, <em>a fortiori, </em>from the defendant’s expressed attitude that, “The only thing I had on my mind was the death sentence and I would have, and I still will, say anything to beat the death sentence.” This is not a case of reliance upon misinformation with respect to the punishment, as was true in <em>Commonwealth v.

The evidence was that the appellant <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>had cut off the head and hands of the dead victim and had thrown the torso into a river to avoid identification. It is agreed that this gory story would have a great impact on the jury but it was in fact the gory acts of the appellant to which he had confessed.

    <p id="b270-4" data-blocks='[["BL_270.5",270,[250,683,1156,200]]]'>A troublesome factor which does not appear in appellant’s brief but is shown by the record of the hearing on the withdrawal of the guilty plea is the following testimony of appellant’s trial counsel:</p>

The trial court found, and the majority does not dispute, that the primary motivation for appellant’s guilty plea was his fear that he might be sentenced to death following a trial by jury. Appellant contends that this plea was not knowing and intelligent because his trial counsel failed to discuss either the weakness of the aggravating circumstance alleged by the Commonwealth or the existence of “age, lack of maturity, or youth of the defendant”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> as a possible mitigating circumstance. Apparently conceding the factual validity of these claims, the opinion of Mr. Justice Packel nonetheless concludes that appellant’s guilty plea was knowing and intelligent. This conclusion that competent advice on possible defenses to the imposition of the death penalty is unnecessary to establish a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to trial by jury is entirely unjustified and contrary to our case law.

The charge arose from the June 9, 1974, shooting death of Jesse Ingram. Appellant pled not guilty and trial by jury was set for March 24, 1975. On the day of trial, appellant’s trial counsel had a conference with the district attorney who <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>stated that he intended to seek the death penalty.

Trial counsel then withdrew and appellate counsel was appointed. Appellate counsel filed motions with the trial court for a new trial and for leave to withdraw appellant’s plea of guilty. The appeal lodged with this Court was remanded to the trial court for consideration of these motions. After a hearing, the trial court denied appellant’s petition to withdraw his guilty plea but held he was entitled to file motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial.

The only evidence which the Commonwealth contended established an aggravating circumstance was some evidence that the victim’s wallet was removed by the defendant before the body was concealed. Removal of the wallet, in the circumstances of this case, was as consistent with an intent to conceal the crime as with an intent to rob. While our cases state that, to establish a felony-murder, the Commonwealth need not establish that the intent to commit the robbery or other enumerated felony existed prior to the killing, the rationale of this rule is based on “the difficulty in attempting to ascertain when the intent to rob was conceived in a given factual situation.” <em>Commonwealth v.

No such finding can be implied, as it clearly appears that Wright received his advice prior to our decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Littlejohn </em>and <em>Commonwealth v.

Trial counsel stated, with regard to the alleged aggravating circumstance, that if the Commonwealth supported its “opinion . that the decedent was robbed of forty some dollars or something of that sort” the death penalty would have been a “very real possibility.” Concerning appellant’s youth and lack of maturity as possible mitigating factors precluding imposition of the death penalty, the opinion of Mr. Justice Packel states that trial counsel was impressed by appellant’s “full-grown age” (20 years) and “reasonable education” (ninth grade).</p>

I know of no authority which would permit this Court to uphold an invalid plea based upon such speculation.</p>

Melton, </em><a href="/pa/465/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="465 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="1712662" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0529-01">465 Pa. 529</a>, 535, <a href="/pa/465/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="465 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="1712662" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0529-01">351 A.2d 221</a>, 224 (1976). The majority goes on to conclude it is not ineffectiveness for defense counsel to advise his client to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty without ever mentioning that the jury might have considered mitigating circumstances in deciding whether or not to impose a death sentence.</p>

Age, youth, and lack of maturity are three specifically enumerated statutory mitigating circumstances. Even if we were to assume that the defendant would have pleaded guilty notwithstanding his being informed of possible mitigating circumstances, this should not relieve defense counsel of the need to inform a defendant that although the prosecutor is going to seek the death penalty, there is a possibility that the jury will find that the existence of mitigating circumstances, here age, youth, and lack of maturity, precludes imposition of the death penalty. We do not know if appellant would have been so intent on “saying anything to beat the death sentence” had he been fully apprised in this regard; had he <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>known that mitigating circumstances was a possible means of avoiding the death penalty, he may have decided not to plead guilty.</p>
