Wigmore, Evidence § 980(a) (Chadbourn Rev. 1970). The Commonwealth does not point to any exception to this rule within which the cross-examination of Charles Slaughter would fit. The Commonwealth suggests that Mr. Slaughter’s arrest is relevant to whether he is biased against the entire criminal justice system and therefore likely to lie on the witness stand. It is true that there may be an exception which would allow impeachment of a prosecution witness by an arrest for crimes related to the case being tried, where evidence of the arrest would tend to show a particular bias of the witness. See <em>Commonwealth v. Coades, </em><a href="/pa/454/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="454 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="579865" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0448-01">454 Pa. 448</a>, 452, <a href="/citations/?q=311%20A.2d%20896" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="311 A.2d 896">311 A.2d 896</a>, 898 (1973). However, to hold that an arrest for an unrelated crime could be used to show a general bias would effectively vitiate the rule against impeaching on the basis of arrests alone, at least in criminal cases. Further, the rule that the Commonwealth proposes can only be based on the impermissible assumption that any arrest automatically destroys the arrestee’s faith in the criminal justice system.</p>
    <p id="b152-5" data-blocks='[["BL_152.5",152,[246,1566,1158,530]]]'>The impeachment was highly prejudicial and requires reversal of appellant’s conviction. If the jury had believed the testimony of Charles Slaughter, it would have concluded appellant was not the man who killed Bruce Benn. The jury did not believe the testimony and convicted appellant. The knowledge that this witness was currently facing murder charges may very easily have contributed to the jury’s refusal to accept the testimony. For this prejudice, we must grant a new trial. See, e. g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em><a href="/pa/475/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="475 Pa. 564" data-case-ids="1734099" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0564-01">supra;</a> <em>Commonwealth v.
