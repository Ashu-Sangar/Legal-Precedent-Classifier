Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder conviction. Appellant was also sentenced to prison terms of three and one-half to seven years (assault and battery, aggravated assault and battery, and assault and battery with intent to murder), five to ten years (possession of explosives), one and one-half to three years <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>(weapons offenses) and one to two years (conspiracy).

    <p id="b378-5" data-blocks='[["BL_378.5",378,[227,589,1161,309]]]'>Appellant’s convictions result from the shooting death of Philadelphia Park Police Sergeant Francis Von Colin and wounding of Park Patrolman James Harrington during an “attack” on the Cobbs Creek Guardhouse of Fairmont Park. In this appeal, he raises various issues, but finding none to be of merit, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b378-6" data-blocks='[["BL_378.6",378,[226,926,1160,416]]]'>Appellant first argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. We do not agree, as the evidence presented at trial showed that appellant, his brother, Alvin Joyner, Richard Thomas, Frederick Burton, Hugh Williams, and Russell Shoats participated in the planning and carrying out of the attack which resulted in the death of Sergeant Van Colin and the serious wounding of Officer Harrington.</p>
    <p id="b378-7" data-blocks='[["BL_378.7",378,[222,1366,1164,844]],["BL_379.1",379,[201,300,1151,99]]]'>Appellant raises three issues concerning the admissibility of statements- given by him to the police. The facts surrounding the statements are as follows. Appellant was arrested at 1:40 p. m., on August 30, 1970, the day after the incident. He was taken to the Police Administration Building and was placed in an interrogation room. At 2:50 p. m., appellant was given his full <em>Miranda </em>warnings, which he waived. He originally denied any complicity in the incident, but by 5:20 p. m., he began to make an inculpatory statement. Because the detectives had been on duty for over twenty-four hours, a stenographer was called in, who typed appellant’s statement as he gave it. An eight-page “informal” statement was completed by 7:45 p. m. Following a polygraph examination, appellant gave a “formal” statement. One of the detectives read back appellant’s informal statement and appellant made a few minor changes in the <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>wording.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Appellant was arraigned at 2:00 p. m., on August 31, some twenty-four hours after his arrest.</p>
    <p id="b379-5" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[203,443,1154,854]]]'>Appellant first claims that the statement must be suppressed because of an unnecessary delay between arrest and arraignment. We need not, however, reach the merits of this claim. While the confessions in the instant case were obtained prior to our decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Futch, </em><a href="/pa/447/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="447 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1942994" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0389-01">447 Pa. 389</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=290%20A.2d%20417" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="290 A.2d 417">290 A.2d 417</a> (1972), we have held that the rule espoused in <em>Futch </em>is applicable to all confessions obtained after January 1, 1965, the effective date of Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 118 (Now Rule 130). <em>Commonwealth v.

We further held in <em>Mitchell </em>that to preserve a <em>Futch </em>claim, a defendant had to raise the issue of unnecessary delay between arrest and arraignment. No such claim was raised at the suppression hearing in the instant case and the issue had not been preserved for appellate review. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, <a href="/pa/464/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="464 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1710349" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0117-01">supra.</a></em>

We do not agree, as the suppression court specifically found that appellant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.

These include: the duration and methods of the interrogation; the length of delay between arrest and arraignment; the conditions of detainment; the attitudes of the police toward defendant; defendant’s physical and psychological state; and all other conditions present which may serve to drain one’s power of resistance to suggestion or to undermine one’s self-determination.
