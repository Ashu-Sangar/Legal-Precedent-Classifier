Deiss.</p>

On January 6, 1975, petitioner accepted a job with the Gordon Service Terminal Company (Gordon). His job was to remove molded plastic bottles from a production line and place them into shipping boxes. On January 10, 1975, appellant terminated his employment. It was appellant’s contention that he left his employment for a “cause of necessitous and compelling nature” and thus remained eligible for benefits under § 402(b)(1) of the Unemployment Compensation Law, 43 P.S. § 802(b)(1). According to appellant, he had no choice but to <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>terminate his employment with Gordon because of the anxiety and emotional stress which were caused by the pressures of working on a production line.</p>

However, by the time of the hearing before the board, he had secured an attorney from Neighborhood Legal Services, who petitioned for a remand for a second hearing before a referee. At the second hearing, appellant presented the testimony of Edward Wimberly, a psychotherapist for the Northern Communities Mental Health and Mental Retardation Center (the “McClure Center”), the community mental health program in appellant’s neighborhood. According to the witness, appellant had been a patient at the McClure Center for over a year at the time he left the employ of Gordon. According to Wimberly, appellant had a longterm psychiatric problem which he called “a character disorder.” The witness said that appellant was “an awfully sincere and capable person, he is very meticulous ... he cares very much for people and for himself. He is a perfectionist in ways of things that he does, he wants everything to be just so, not only the things he does but his life, his relationship with people, his parents. Often he is a very hard taskmaster about that.”</p>
    <p id="b580-5" data-blocks='[["BL_580.6",580,[248,1567,1159,363]]]'>Wimberly further testified that he was familiar with reports of the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which indicated that appellant would not be suited for work which required either fine motor co-ordination or close social interaction. When asked how Wimberly would expect appellant to perform in a job which required fine motor co-ordination, the witness replied:</p>

According to the witness, appellant’s anxiety would have led to an emotional breakdown. The witness concluded that he would have advised appellant to quit his job if he had been asked and that when appellant did quit it was “the psychologically healthy thing to do.”</p>

The psychotherapist testified that at the time of termination, appellant would have suffered a nervous breakdown had he continued his employment. This opinion was based on the results of over one year of analysis prior to appellant’s termination of employment. We believe that the referee, the board of review and the Commonwealth Court all erred in holding the psychotherapist’s testimony was of little evidentiary value. As appellant offered competent evidence to support his claim that he terminated employment for cause of a necessitous and compelling nature, he is entitled to benefits under the act.</p>
