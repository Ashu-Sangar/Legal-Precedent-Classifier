The second category permits judicial review to determine whether there was “evident partiality or corruption on the part of the arbitrators.” Appellee never raised that issue. The third category <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>permits judicial review if it is claimed that there was “misconduct” in certain respects or “misbehavior” prejudicing rights.

The fourth category allows judicial review if the arbitrators “exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a final and definite award . . . was not made.” It is only this fourth category under which appellee’s claims could conceivably fall.</p>
    <p id="b448-5" data-blocks='[["BL_448.5",448,[257,734,1158,411]]]'>Appellee, however, does not claim that the arbitrator “exceeded his powers.” If we allowed a claim of improper interpretation of an agreement to fall under the category of “exceeded powers,” binding arbitration would be a useless procedure. The determination of whether an arbitrator “exceeded proper powers” depends upon whether the arbitrator decided a dispute over which he had no jurisdiction, or granted an award which is prohibited by law.</p>
    <p id="b448-6" data-blocks='[["BL_448.6",448,[256,1166,1159,515]]]'>The claim that a court should interpret an agreement differently than did the arbitrator would convert binding arbitration into “unbinding” arbitration. If binding arbitration has any meaning, the arbitrator must be considered the court of last resort except in the very limited categories specified in the Act of 1927. Where an arbitrator has jurisdiction, and where the arbitrator’s award is not contrary to any legislative enactment, and where the arbitrator is not attacked as being corrupt, partial, or having engaged in misconduct or misbehavior, the award must stand.</p>

Appellee contends that the arbitrator’s award is illegal because it is in direct conflict with Section 706 of PERA, 43 P.S. § 1101.706. Section 706 states:</p>
    <blockquote id="b448-9" data-blocks='[["BL_448.9",448,[298,2196,1116,150]]]'>“Nothing contained in this act shall impair the employer’s right to hire employes or to discharge employes for just cause consistent with existing legislation.”</blockquote>

      <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>Appellee appears to be arguing that this statute gives the District the exclusive right to “hire employees” on whatever salary terms the District and the individual employee agree to. Section 706, however, must be read in the context of other sections of PERA. PERA provides for the recognition of exclusive collective bargaining representatives. In this case, the Association is the exclusive bargaining agent for the teachers in the Leechburg Area School District. Accepting appellee’s argument would destroy the authority of the Association as exclusive bargaining representative. Were appellee’s view to prevail, a school district could effectively emasculate any salary scales contained in collective bargaining agreements by entering into individual agreements with each teacher. This is exactly the evil intended to be eliminated by the recognition of exclusive bargaining agents, agents who act for all employees the moment they are hired. As the United States Supreme Court recognized over thirty years ago, to allow individual contracts to interfere with the functioning of the collective bargaining agreement would reduce laws providing for collective bargaining to a futility. <em>J.

      <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>According to the appellee, section 1142 authorizes a school district to agree with an individual teacher as to a salary-scale and ignore the collective bargaining agreement. We reject such an interpretation. If the word “agreement” in section 1142 was interpreted to an agreement with an individual teacher rather than the collective bargaining agreement, section 1142 would completely emasculate PERA’s recognition of exclusive bargaining representatives.</p>
    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[256,755,1160,520]]]'>A collective bargaining agreement would eventually become ineffective if a district could, over a period of years, hire new teachers, without adhering to the wage salary scale in the collective bargaining agreement. After a period of time, the same evils would be present which brought about the need for PERA. Employees in a given district could all be paid wage levels totally unrelated to their background, qualifications, or experience, but related only to the particular personal or financial pressures of the employee or the employer at the time of hiring.</p>
    <p id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.6",450,[258,1296,1158,256]]]'>As in this case, the two teachers desiring employment were willing to accept a lower wage rather than lose the employment.

The first part of section 11 requires some miscalculation. None has been alleged in this case. The second part of section 11 deals with the situation where the arbitrators have decided a matter not submitted to them. No such claim is made in this case. The third part of section 11 deals with the claim that the award is imperfect in form. No such claim has been made in this case. The fourth part of section 11 involves a claim that “the award is against the law.” As indicated earlier, however, we are unable to conclude that the arbitrator’s award in this case was prohibited by any legislative enactment.</p>

The arbitrator found that the parties intended the former interpretation and not the latter. Since the arbitrator’s finding, which stands on the same footing as a jury’s resolution of a question of fact, is one that can be rationally derived from the agreement, the award should be sustained. <em>Beaver County, supra, </em><a href="/pa/473/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="473 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="1730315" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0576-01">473 Pa. at 592</a>, <a href="/pa/473/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="473 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="1730315" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0576-01">375 A.2d at 1274-75</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> I therefore agree with the result reached by the <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>majority, <em>viz., </em>that the Commonwealth Court erred in reversing the arbitrator’s award.</p>

The opinion states that because the school district is seeking a vacation of the arbitrator’s award, a court must confine its scope of review to the ground stated in Section 10 of the Arbitration Act, <em>see </em>note 1, <em>supra, </em>which section deals with the vacation of arbitrators’ awards.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_6" id="ref_footnote_3_6">6</a> This analysis ignores the rationale <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>of our recent decision in <em>Beaver County, <a href="/pa/473/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="473 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="1730315" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0576-01">supra,</a> </em>while purporting to apply it; the Court gives inordinate attention to the single word “vacate.”</p>

This interpretation is consistent with the other grounds for vacation mentioned in Section 10, <em>viz., </em>fraud, corruption, or procedural abuses. <em>See, e. g., Majcher v.
