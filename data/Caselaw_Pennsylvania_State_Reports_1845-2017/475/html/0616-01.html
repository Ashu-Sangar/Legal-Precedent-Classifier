    <p id="b649-5" data-blocks='[["BL_649.5",649,[143,641,1152,1197]]]'>The record discloses that on August 7, 1974, Irwin drove his automobile onto the grounds of the Equipment Corporation of America in Aldan, Pennsylvania for the purpose of seeking employment. At that time, and for some months prior thereto, the employees of the Equipment Corporation had been on strike. Pickets were stationed at the sides of the entrance gate and were displaying placards. Irwin proceeded to the company’s office and made application for employment. He then returned to his car and started to drive out of the plant grounds. He proceeded very slowly and stopped his car at the front gate. Two of the pickets, Les Kiesel, the decedent, and Michael Detweiler, walked over to appellant’s automobile and informed Irwin that he had crossed a picket line. Irwin replied with an obscenity and pulled a gun which he pointed at the individuals. Kiesel told Irwin that he was “crazy.” At that point Detweiler pushed Kiesel away from the side of the car where appellant was seated. Irwin then opened the door of the automobile and fired a shot into the ground, followed immediately by a second shot which struck Kiesel in the chest, killing him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Soon after this encounter Irwin disposed of the gun, shaved his mustache and changed the license plate on his car. He was, nevertheless, apprehended and charged with murder.</p>

    <p id="b650-5" data-blocks='[["BL_650.5",650,[271,535,1158,732]]]'>Appellant’s first contention is that the trial court erred in not admitting into evidence a series of newspaper articles and by restricting the direct examination of the appellant with regard to his knowledge of the articles. The newspaper articles in question appeared in the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin on July 15 through July 18, 1974 and on July 31,1974; they pertained to acts of violence by members of a different union (the Roofer’s Union) at times and locations other than those here involved. Appellant claimed the articles were relevant to his belief, reasonably held, that he was in imminent danger of serious bodily injury and that there was a necessity to kill in order to avoid those consequences.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The trial court, however, disagreed and ruled the articles irrelevant to any of the issues in question.</p>

Whether particular exhibits, offered to corroborate a defendant’s asserted belief, should be admitted into evidence is, however, a matter within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Commonwealth v. Mennyweather, </em><a href="/pa/458/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="458 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="479762" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0012-01">458 Pa. 12</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=329%20A.2d%20493" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="329 A.2d 493">329 A.2d 493</a> (1974); <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>
      <em>Commonwealth v. Amos, supra. </em>In the present case, the articles sought to be introduced were in no way probative of any propensities to violence of the decedent or other members of his union; their admission into evidence would, as the trial court found, raise collateral issues concerning the content of the articles not germane to the case at hand. Irwin was permitted to testify as to his having read such articles and as to how they affected his perception of union activities. We believe the trial court acted properly and well within its discretion in refusing admission of the articles themselves.</p>
    <p id="b651-5" data-blocks='[["BL_651.5",651,[154,924,1149,421]]]'>Irwin’s second assignment of error is that the trial court wrongly denied defendant’s request for a mistrial. The motion was made following a response by a Commonwealth witness which appellant alleges suggested to the jury that Irwin had a prior criminal record. The challenged statement, given by a police witness for the Commonwealth in response to a question concerning the appellant’s demeanor at a preliminary hearing, was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b651-6" data-blocks='[["BL_651.6",651,[197,1361,1107,151]]]'>“The defendant was very calm. He showed no emotion at all. At one point he looked at his wife and said, well, I did it again.”</blockquote>

Under the facts of this case, the reference to “I did it again” did not, we believe, either expressly or by any reasonable implication convey the possibility of a prior criminal offense unrelated to the criminal episode <em>sub judice. </em>See <em>Commonwealth v.
