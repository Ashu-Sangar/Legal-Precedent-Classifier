The woman was armed with a pistol and the man had a sawed-off shotgun. During the course of the robbery, the <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>male intruder shot a patron in the chest killing the victim instantly.

It is argued that under the 1972 Crimes Code, Dec. 6,1972, P.L. 1482, No. 384, § 1 et seq., 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq., one cannot be held guilty for a criminal homicide, Section 2501 (and therefore also cannot be held accountable for murder, Section 2502) where that person does not actually <em>cause </em>the death. In short, appellant’s argument is premised upon the view that the 1972 Crimes Code eliminated vicarious responsibility for criminal homicides. We disagree and for the reasons set forth below affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>

While we applaud the scholarship in that regard it regrettably fails to provide illumination upon the issue she has actually raised in this appeal. Appellant has failed to distinguish between the common law concept of felony-murder, which provides a basis for implying malice, and the requirements for accomplice liability in criminal law. As we noted in <em>Commonwealth v. Redline, </em><a href="/pa/391/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="391 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1276839" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0486-01">391 Pa. 486</a>, 495, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.2d%20472" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="137 A.2d 472">137 A.2d 472</a>, 476 (1958), “In adjudging a felony-murder, it is to be remembered at all times that the thing which is imputed to a felon for a killing incidental to his felony is <em>malice </em>and <em>not the act of killing.” </em>This doctrine may be applicable whenever a death occurs during the perpetration of or an attempt to perpetrate a <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>felony, whether or not the accused actually inflicted the mortal wound. Restated, the felony-murder concept was a judgment by our courts at common law that the willingness to participate in conduct amounting to a felony exhibited the recklessness of consequences, the callous disregard and the hardness of heart which evidenced a malicious state of mind.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> This reasoning was applicable to the actual slayer as well as to those who participated in the felony with him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

While the application of the felony murder doctrine often presents novel and complex questions of causation, <em>see Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redline, supra, </em>such a question is not present in the instant case. In the <em>Redline </em>type of case the causation problem arises, because <em>neither </em>co-felon committed the lethal act, although the lethal act arose out of the commission of the underlying felony.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In the case at bar, the appellant’s companion in the robbery clearly inflicted the mortal wound, so it is important to recognize that-the controlling issue as to <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>appellant’s criminal liability for the killing is not causation but accomplice liability.

First, the relevant statutory law imputes the malice necessary for first degree murder to a felon who causes the death of another person during the perpetration of arson, rape, robbery, burglary, or kidnapping. However, since this statutory classification merely categorizes murder into two degrees, it is to the common law that one must look for the definition of murder. As enunciated in the landmark case of <em>Commonwealth v. Drum, </em><a href="/pa/58/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="58 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1013212" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0009-01">58 Pa. 9</a>, 15 (1868), ‘[t]he distinguishing criterion of murder is malice aforethought.’ With this ‘criterion’ as the basis, the doctrine of felony-murder became firmly imbedded in the common law. As applied in Pennsylvania, common law felony-murder ‘is a means of imputing malice where it may not exist expressly. Under this rule, the malice necessary to make a killing, even an accidental one, murder, <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>is constructively inferred from the malice incident to the perpetration of the initial felony.’ <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

Therefore, in analyzing a homicide committed in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate a felony ‘the basic determination of the fact of murder is to be made according to the rules of the common law, including the felony-murder theory of imputed malice, and, upon a finding of guilt, the degree statute automatically raises the murder to first degree if it happened, inter alia, to have been committed in the perpetration of arson, rape, robbery, burglary or kidnapping.’ <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Almeida we </em>had indicated that a felon could be held responsible for a death caused by police or a victim resisting the commission of the felony. The rationale for both of these decisions was based upon the view that the death would not have occurred “but for” the attempt to commit the underlying felony. In essence, our holding in <em>Redline </em>stands for the proposition that the mere willingness to commit the underlying felony would not result in criminal liability for a death that was a “coincidence” but not a “consequence” of the felony. <em>Commonwealth v.

The Comment to the Tentative Draft of the section defining murder, see, Tentative Draft No. 9, p. 28, indicates that the drafters intended the felony-murder doctrine to be restricted as a basis for establishing the criminality of homicide to a rebuttable presumption of recklessness from the fact that the actor was participating in an inherently dangerous-to-life felony. There is, however, no expression of an intention in that discussion of limiting criminal responsibility in felony-murder to the actual slayer. We do concede, however, that a reading of Article 210 in toto might well support the conclusion that the 210.1 definition of criminal homicide is intended to be the sole and mandatory definition that must obtain when construing the subsequent types of homicide set forth thereafter. Accepting such a conclusion, there would be a basis for reasoning that only the one who <em>actually caused the death </em>could be criminally responsible of any type of criminal homicide.
