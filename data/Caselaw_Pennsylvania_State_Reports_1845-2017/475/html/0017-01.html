The motion was denied. Thereafter appellant was convicted of murder in the second degree in a trial before a judge sitting without a jury. Post-verdict motions, which again challenged the admissibility of appellant’s confession, were denied, and sentence of 6V2 to 13 years imprisonment was imposed. This appeal followed.

The ensuing investigation by the police soon focused upon appellant, the child’s mother. Shortly before 10:00 a. m. on August 14, 1973, three detectives (two state police officers and a Stroud Township policeman) called at the apartment of Rita Delessio, the person with whom Linda Dixon was then residing in Easton, Pennsylvania. Ms. Dixon was present and assented to the police request to accompany them to the Easton State Police Barracks. No reasons for this request were given. Linda Dixon informed Rita Delessio that no help would be necessary inasmuch as she, Linda, could handle the situation herself. The four then drove to the barracks in a police car, no conversation taking place between appellant and the three officers during the twenty minute ride.</p>

She was asked if she knew why the officers sought to question her and answered “yes.” One of the policemen then read aloud from a prepared form the constitutional warnings required by <em>Miranda v.

Five months earlier, on March 14,1973, appellant had been adjudged guilty of the crime of malicious mischief <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>by a justice of the peace of Stroud Township.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> As a result, she was ordered to make restitution at the rate of $50 per month until a total of $500, the estimated amount of property damage, had been paid to the injured person. Appellant was informed at that time by the justice of the peace that in the event she should default in making a required payment, a warrant would issue for her arrest; she was specifically told that the police would be dispatched to make the arrest. Nevertheless, Ms. Dixon failed to pay the first $50 installment falling due in late March, and each of the subsequent four installments owing for the period preceding August 14. In consequence, a warrant for Linda Dixon’s arrest was delivered to the Stroud Township Police by the justice of the peace on July 26, 1973. The policemen were in fact armed with this warrant at the time of their arrival at the Delessio apartment on August 14 and the interview with Dixon which followed at the police barracks.</p>

Appellant was shown a small black and white photograph of her deceased child, Christopher, taken at the age of ten months. One of the police officers asked Ms. Dixon, “Where is Chrissy?”, whereupon she broke into tears and wept for ten minutes. At the end of this time appellant stated, “I did it.” The police then asked, “How did you do it?”, and appellant related the details of the incident, seeking to explain her conduct as the desperate act of a mother no longer able to care for her child.</p>

Cf. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. at 475</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.Ct. 1602</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">16 L.Ed.2d at 724</a>. This burden may sometimes be satisfied by the establishment of circumstances attending the interrogation, such as the prior statements of the suspect, see <em>Commonwealth v. Cooper, supra, </em>or the fact that interrogation follows hard upon the criminal episode and there is no circumstance lending ambiguity to the direction and purpose of the questioning.</p>
    <p id="b53-5" data-blocks='[["BL_53.5",53,[183,1739,1151,361]],["BL_54.1",54,[276,282,1160,768]]]'>Applying <em>Richman </em>to the facts of the case at bar, it is apparent that the Commonwealth failed to establish Linda Dixon’s awareness at the time of her written “waiver” that the death of her son was to be the subject matter of the interrogation. Although appellant’s answer of “Yes” to the officer’s inquiry as to whether she knew why she was being questioned, coupled with other evidence in this case,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> might <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>normally have sufficed to show awareness of the nature of the investigation, an inference of such an understanding cannot stand in the face of the reasonable assumption on appellant’s part that she was about to be interrogated with regard to a wholly different matter, namely, her default in making restitution for the malicious mischief conviction, a default which she had been expressly warned by a justice of the peace would result in her arrest. In view of the palpable ambiguity as to Linda Dixon’s understanding of the situation, an ambiguity which went unclarified by appellant’s interrogators, we are unable to conclude that she “knowingly and intelligently” relinquished the exercise of her constitutional rights. Accordingly, we hold that it was error not to suppress appellant’s inculpatory statement.</p>
    <p id="b54-5" data-blocks='[["BL_54.6",54,[275,1076,1160,871]]]'>The Commonwealth contends that because appellant’s “waiver” of her <em>Miranda </em>rights was freely revocable, <em>see </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. at 473-74</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.Ct. 1602</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">16 L.Ed.2d at 723</a>, she did not truly waive these rights until she uttered an inculpatory statement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> According to the Commonwealth, therefore, the point of time to which a suppression court should look to determine whether a suspect was aware of the subject matter of the interrogation — the prerequisite under <em>Richman </em>to the finding of a knowing waiver — is not when the <em>Miranda </em>waiver card is signed, but the later time when a confessional utterance is made. See <em>Collins v. Brierly, </em><a href="/f2d/492/0735-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="492 F.2d 735" data-case-ids="474568" data-case-paths="/f2d/492/0735-01">492 F.2d 735</a> (3 Cir., 1974). Thus the Commonwealth argues that when Dixon made the fatal statement, “I did it”, this constituted a valid waiver because at that time she knew that it was her child’s death as to which she was to be questioned.</p>

Nor is our view in the present case altered by the fact that the police waiver form signed by Dixon expressly advised the accused that she had the right to call a halt to the questioning.
