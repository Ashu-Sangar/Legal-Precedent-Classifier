At a preliminary hearing held March 7, 1977, defendants pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 141 sought to make tape recordings of the proceedings. The municipal court prohibited the recordings. On April 11, 1977, defendants filed with this <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>Court applications for leave to file petitions for a writ of prohibition. We granted the applications and treated the petitions for writs of prohibition as petitions requesting this Court to assume plenary jurisdiction. We accepted plenary jurisdiction to resolve the question of whether a defendant may make a tape recording at a preliminary hearing when the proceedings are officially recorded.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We hold that defendants are entitled to make such recordings.</p>

    <p id="b659-7" data-blocks='[["BL_659.8",659,[179,1009,1150,306]]]'>The municipal court expressed the view that the Rule was designed to ensure defendants an accurate record of the proceedings and concluded that a defendant is prohibited from making any record of the proceedings, other than notes by counsel, whenever the court provides an official stenographer. Rule 141(c)(4) cannot justifiably be read so narrowly.</p>
    <p id="b659-8" data-blocks='[["BL_659.9",659,[180,1330,1151,516]]]'>The Rule allows a defendant a variety of means to prepare an accurate account of the preliminary hearing. The Rule says a defendant <em>“may, if he desires” </em>make use of any of the enumerated means of transcription. It does not say that he may make those transcriptions only when the court fails to provide an official stenographer or when he is permitted to do so in the discretion of the court. Such an account prepared by the defendant at his own cost permissibly supplements any official, court authorized record to which the defendant may have access.</p>

The United States Supreme Court has recognized that information presented at a preliminary hearing may bear crucially upon the accused’s defense. See <em>Coleman v. Alabama, </em><a href="/us/399/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="399 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167869" data-case-paths="/us/399/0001-01">399 U.S. 1</a>, <a href="/us/399/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="399 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167869" data-case-paths="/us/399/0001-01">90 S.Ct. 1999</a>, <a href="/us/399/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="399 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167869" data-case-paths="/us/399/0001-01">26 L.Ed.2d 387</a> (1970) (plurality opinion) (preliminary hearing is “critical stage” at which accused is entitled to counsel). Accordingly, it would promote no jurisprudential policy to deny defendants this tool, particularly when to grant it neither prejudices the Commonwealth nor interferes with the court’s management of the proceedings. Rule 141(c)(4) serves as a salutary device for enabling a defendant to preserve the proceedings of his preliminary hearing in the form he deems most suitable for his particular purposes.</p>
    <p id="b661-4" data-blocks='[["BL_661.4",661,[180,294,1151,534]]]'>
      <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>The Commonwealth argues that the Rule entitles a defendant to a single means of transcription, and that once some means of recording has been provided, as here, other recording may be prohibited by the court. In view of the purposes of the Rule, this strained interpretation is arbitrary and unreasonable, and must be rejected. Rule 141(c)(4) confers upon a defendant the right to record the proceedings at his preliminary hearing by any of the means enumerated, even when an official stenographer is present. Any other interpretation would defeat the purposes served by the Rule.</p>
    <p id="b661-5" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[181,849,1152,639]]]'>The Commonwealth also contends that <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Minifield, </em>the Superior Court held that a defendant is not denied due process when the Commonwealth fails to furnish a transcript of the preliminary hearing. <em>Minifield </em>is clearly inapposite. Our interpretation of Rule 141 does not rest upon principles of due process; we hold that appellants are entitled by Rule 141 to make tape recordings of their preliminary hearing regardless of whether due process permits a contrary result.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
