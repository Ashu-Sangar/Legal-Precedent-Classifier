To the argument that this effect was merely incidental to a scheme intended to mitigate the severity of the punishment, the Court responded: “The question is not whether the chilling effect is ‘incidental’ rather than intentional; the question is whether that effect is unnecessary and therefore excessive.” <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="18 U.S.C. § 1201">Id.</a> <a href="/us/390/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="390 U.S. 570" data-case-ids="6174728" data-case-paths="/us/390/0570-01">390 U.S. at 582</a>, <a href="/us/390/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="390 U.S. 570" data-case-ids="6174728" data-case-paths="/us/390/0570-01">88 S.Ct. at 1216</a>. It is clear that our sentencing scheme, at the time appellant came to trial, suffered the same constitutional infirmity.

United States, </em><a href="/us/168/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="168 U.S. 532" data-case-ids="6141481" data-case-paths="/us/168/0532-01">168 U.S. 532</a>, 542-43, <a href="/us/168/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="168 U.S. 532" data-case-ids="6141481" data-case-paths="/us/168/0532-01">18 S.Ct. 183</a>, 187, <a href="/us/168/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="168 U.S. 532" data-case-ids="6141481" data-case-paths="/us/168/0532-01">42 L.Ed. 568</a> (emphasis added). I believe the same standard applies here. The sentencing scheme as it existed when appellant was brought to trial “had no other <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>purpose or effect than to chill the assertion of constitutional rights by penalizing those who [chose] to exercise them . .” <em>United States v.

The Court stated that <em>“Jackson </em>ruled neither that all pleas of guilty encouraged by the fear of a possible death sentence are involuntary pleas nor that such encouraged pleas are invalid whether involuntary or not.” 397 U.S. at 747, 90 S.Ct. at 1468. The first part of this holding — that all pleas motivated by fear of the death penalty are not per se involuntary — I agree with. The second part, however, seems merely to beg the question regarding the effect of an <em>unconstitutional </em>encouragement on the voluntariness of a guilty plea. The result in <em>Brady </em>appears to be correct, in that the district court had found that Brady’s plea was motivated by considerations other than the unconstitutional sentencing scheme. See <em>Parker v. North Carolina, </em><a href="/us/397/0790-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="397 U.S. 790" data-case-ids="12058675" data-case-paths="/us/397/0790-01">397 U.S. 790</a>, <a href="/us/397/0790-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="397 U.S. 790" data-case-ids="12058675" data-case-paths="/us/397/0790-01">90 S.Ct. 1458</a>, <a href="/us/397/0790-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="397 U.S. 790" data-case-ids="12058675" data-case-paths="/us/397/0790-01">25 L.Ed.2d 785</a> (1970) and <em>Brady v.

Thus, to the extent the language in <em>Brady </em>supports the proposition that even an unconstitutional inducement to plead guilty, which in fact results in a plea, does not render that plea involuntary, it would appear to be dictum. Moreover, the dictum does not appear to be supported by the rationale of the Court in <em>Brady. </em>The majority reasoned:</p>
      <blockquote id="b465-6" data-blocks='[["BL_465.6",465,[236,1380,1089,812]]]'>“Insofar as the voluntariness of his plea is concerned, there is little to differentiate Brady from (1) the defendant, in a jurisdiction where the judge and jury have the same range of sentencing power, who pleads guilty because his lawyer advises him that the judge will very probably be more lenient than the jury; (2) the defendant, in a jurisdiction where the judge alone has sentencing power, who is advised by counsel that the judge is normally more lenient with defendants who plead guilty than with those who go to trial; (3) the defendant who is permitted by prosecutor and judge to plead guilty to a lesser offense included in the offense charged; and (4) the defendant who pleads guilty to certain counts with the understanding that other charges will be dropped. In each of these situations, as in Brady’s case, the defendant might never plead guilty absent the possibility or certainty that the plea will result in a lesser penalty than the sentence that could be imposed after a trial and a verdict of guilty. We decline to hold, however, that a guilty plea is compelled and invalid under the Fifth Amendment whenever motivated by the defendant’s desire to accept the certainty or probability of a lesser penalty rather than face a wider range of possibilities extending from acquittal to conviction and a higher penalty <em>authorized by law </em>for the crime charged.”</blockquote>

All of these examples involve situations where the motivating factor in entering a plea agreement, or pleading guilty, is to avoid the possibility of greater punishment which the state could legitimately <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>impose after trial. The rationale may legitimately extend to the situation where a defendant pleads guilty to avoid greater punishment which might result after trial, but, because of an unanticipated change in the law, it later appears that the likelihood of such greater punishment would have been remote. But see <em>Commonwealth v. Wright, </em><a href="/pa/444/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="444 Pa. 588" data-case-ids="1938618" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0588-01">444 Pa. 588</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=282%20A.2d%20266" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="282 A.2d 266">282 A.2d 266</a> (1971). However, in my view the comparisons offered by the Court in <em>Brady </em>are not apposite to the situation where a statutory scheme has a direct and unconstitutional coercive effect on the decision whether to stand trial, and it is shown that this impermissible coercive effect did in fact result in the decision to plead guilty. It seems ironic, at least, to hold that the very factor which renders such a statutory scheme unconstitutional — the needless chilling of the exercise of constitutional rights — will be ignored when it has in fact had its impermissible effect.</p>

In neither case was it alleged that the decision to plead guilty was compelled by a statutory scheme which needlessly chilled the exercise of the right to stand trial, or that the death penalty could not legitimately have been imposed if that right had been exercised.

In <em>Melton, </em>this Court rejected the argument that a guilty plea was coerced as a result of an allegedly unconstitutional jury selection system which tended to make juries more conviction-prone. This allegation, based on a change in the law after appellant’s guilty plea regarding jury selection, see <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/391/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="391 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="1767501" data-case-paths="/us/391/0510-01">391 U.S. 510</a>, <a href="/us/391/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="391 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="1767501" data-case-paths="/us/391/0510-01">88 S.Ct. 1770</a>, <a href="/us/391/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="391 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="1767501" data-case-paths="/us/391/0510-01">20 L.Ed.2d 776</a> (1968), was not based on a claim that an inherently coercive statutory scheme had its constitutionally prohibited effect in inducing the plea. The speculative concern of the defendant in <em>Melton </em>cannot be compared to the situation of the defendant squarely faced with a statutory scheme which declares that he must risk the possibility of death if he wishes to exercise his right to stand trial, but ensures him that no greater penalty than life imprisonment can be imposed if he foregoes his rights.</p>

The Commonwealth asserts another basis for finding the state’s interests are compromised by a holding that the appellant’s waiver was invalid because induced by the sentencing scheme. The Commonwealth argues that defendants would, in effect, be given the right to two trials, one before a judge, and one before a jury, and that, in the second, death could not be imposed because of the original life sentence. This argument has little merit. It overlooks the basic fact that the sentencing scheme, as it existed when appellant was tried, was patently unconstitutional and, thus, a sentence of death could not legally have been imposed. <em>U. S. v. Jackson, supra. </em>Once the unconstitutional system has been remedied, there is no longer any basis for setting aside the waiver of a defendant who elected to be tried by a judge. The fact that appellant will receive a new trial can hardly be a basis for denying him relief, once it is determined that his waiver of a trial by jury was in fact unconstitutionally coerced.</p>
