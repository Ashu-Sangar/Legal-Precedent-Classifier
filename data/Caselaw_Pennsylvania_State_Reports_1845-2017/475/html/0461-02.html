In <em>Washington, </em>the defendant had testified that he had twice refused to accede to the requests of one Gisondi that he participate in a burglary, that he had finally agreed to participate after Gisondi had urged him a third time, and that, when he broke into the house designated by Gisondi as the site of the burglary, the police were waiting to arrest him; there was also evidence that an informer had notified a Beaver County detective of the planned burglary the day before it was to take place, that two weeks previously the detective had told the informer that his co-operation would be made known to the court if and when he should be brought before the court, and that this detective had known Gisondi for many years. In this context, the defendant sought to ascertain whether Gisondi was the informer. We concluded, in the words of Mr. Justice Manderino:</p>

Although the defendant plainly cannot be expected to show that such information will actually be helpful to his defense, the record should at least suggest a reasonable possibility that the information might be helpful, so that it would be unfair to withhold it. Thus, in <em>Carter </em>it was unfair to deny the defendant access to a relatively disinterested eyewitness who might have lent support to his defense of mistaken identity, and in <em>Washington </em>it was unfair to prevent the defendant from establishing a fact which, together with other evidence on the record, might have convinced the jury that he had been induced by improper police conduct into committing a crime he would not otherwise have been inclined to commit.</p>

Since there was no evidence of improper police conduct or of reluctance on the part of Herron on the record, and since Herron was in a position to know what took place between himself and both the police officer and the police informer with regard to the transaction, we conclude that at a minimum Herron through his counsel should have informed the court in an offer of proof of facts indicative of entrapment which would have <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>suggested the possibility that disclosure of the informer’s identity might indeed have been relevant and helpful to the defense.

      <em>Roviaro </em>adopted a balancing test when faced with the question of determining whether the government’s so-called right to withhold the identity of an informer should prevail over a defendant’s right to prepare a defense. The right to prepare a defense necessarily requires that one be afforded access to those persons who are witnesses, or who otherwise have knowledge relevant to, the alleged crime. Such access <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the.United States Constitution:</p>

      <em>“Carter </em>is particularly applicable to the instant case where the sole defense raised by appellant was that of entrapment.

In <em>Washington, </em>the defendant chose, as a matter of trial strategy, to take the witness stand and testify as to his version of the incident. In <em>Washington, </em>the defense was able to supply the court with specific facts as to what it expected to accomplish once the prosecution revealed the identity of the unnamed informer. That higher degree of specificity was possible, however, because the defendant in <em>Washington </em>had already testified as to his version of the circumstances allegedly amounting to entrapment. <em>Washington </em>does not stand for the proposition that an accused must surrender the constitutional right not to testify in order to secure the identity of a prosecution informer, or that he “testify” indirectly through his attorney first. All that is necessary is that the possibility of entrapment exists, and some indication that the informant’s testimony might aid that defense. As stated in <em>Roviaro,</em>
