The watch was flecked with what looked like paint. A warranty for Byn brand watch was found in Robert Morgan’s wallet.

The trial court, in ruling on post-trial motions, concluded that the cross-examination concerning the arrests was proper. It relied on the Act of March 15, 1911, P.L. 20, 19 P.S. § 711 <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>(1964)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> and a case decided thereunder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> We cannot agree.

If the jury disbelieves Ezra Dobson’s testimony that appellant owned the watch and instead believes the Commonwealth’s theory that the watch belonged to Robert Morgan, then appellant is placed at the scene of the crime. But, if Mr. Dobson’s testimony is believed, the most important link between appellant and the crime disappears. Further, if appellant owned the watch, then he did not steal it from Robert Morgan. No evidence was produced that anything else was stolen from the victim. The improper impeachment of Ezra Dobson gave the Commonwealth an opportunity to strike an unfair blow at a key aspect of appellant’s defense. The remedy for this error is a new trial.</p>
