On August 13th of the same year, following at least three apparently unrelated instances of physical abuse of Melissa by Roland D., the child was admitted to the Coatesville Hospital with severe bruises and discolorations on her body. Chester County Children’s Services, the instant appellee, was contacted and thereafter filed a petition in the Court of Common Pleas requesting temporary custody of the child. An order was entered on September 20, 1974, fixing temporary custody of the child in the appellee agency. Later, on October 1, 1974, a hearing was held and the court found that the child was “deprived” within the meaning of the Juvenile Court Act of December <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>6, 1972, P.L. 1464, No. 333, 11 P.S. § 50-101 (Supp. 1977-78) and temporary custody was again awarded to Children’s Services. A third such order was entered on January 30, 1975, which additionally directed a review of the child’s progress within six months upon the petition of any party.</p>

She resided there with her husband until January, 1976, when she returned to Pennsylvania for the involuntary termination proceeding which is the basis of this appeal. During the sixteen-month period between the time the child was taken from her custody and the date the involuntary termination proceeding commenced, appellant saw her child only once — in January, 1975, at the offices of the appellee agency. During the same interval the appellant corresponded by mail with the agency twice, once in November, 1974, and once in March, 1975. In both letters she expressed love and concern for her daughter and in the latter said she hoped to regain custody of Melissa. In the November letter she invited the agency to investigate her Ohio home to ascertain “what kind of parents we are.” As a result of this communication, Children’s Services of Chester County contacted an Ohio children’s agency and from January, 1975 to August, 1975, (approximately three months prior to the filing of the involuntary termination petition) this Ohio agency made numerous unannounced visits to appellant’s home. Additionally, during this time appellant and her husband participated in several prearranged counseling sessions with the Ohio agency. The court found that at no time during the sixteen-month period had appellant actually sent any “money, gift or other remembrance” to the child through the Chester County agency, noting, however, that for most of that time appellant and her husband were living on a $170.00 per month public assistance grant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Once <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>a month Melissa’s maternal grandmother and aunt (appellant’s sister) visited the child at the agency bringing presents, such as clothing, toys and food. Christmas and birthday parties were also given for the child on these visits. Barbara P., appellant’s sister, requested more frequent visiting privileges but this proposal was denied due to the difficulties in arranging additional visits with the foster family with whom Melissa was living. Since January, 1976, until at least the date of the hearing, Mrs. D. has been living with her sister, Barbara, in a two-bedroom apartment in Downingtown with the intention of remaining apart from her husband.</p>

First of all, appellant argues that the court failed to properly consider the “particular circumstances” of appellant’s situation and to recognize that appellant had utilized the resources at her command in declining to yield to obstacles preventing her from performing her affirmative parental duties. Secondly, Mrs. D. maintains that the court incorrectly ascertained that appellant’s mother and sister were not acting as her “proxy” in appellant’s absence and in concluding that even if they were, appellant did not act reasonably under the circumstances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> We believe that the lower court failed to properly apply the facts of the case to the law and that, as a result, we agree with the appellant that the agency fell short of proving by a clear preponderance of the evidence <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>that the parental rights of Patricia D. to her daughter Melissa should be terminated.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

We believe that, in light of the totality of circumstances, appellant did exercise reasonable firmness in declining to yield to obstacles which prevented her from protecting, supporting and maintaining communication and association with Melissa. In this regard it is critical to remember that Melissa had been taken by court order from the custody and care of her mother and there is no evidence on the record that this action was taken as a result of any fault or misconduct on the part of appellant. To the contrary, it is uncontested that the child was separated from her mother due to the cruelty of her stepfather. This is, therefore, unlike the situations in which a parent has voluntarily surrendered his or her child to the care of another, thereby electing to forego the exercise of important affirmative parental duties. <em>Adoption of Baby Girl Fleming, supra; In re Lumiere Castel Cassen, supra; Wolfe Adoption Case, supra; Matter of Kapcsos, <a href="/pa/468/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="468 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1719663" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0050-01">supra.</a> </em>At approximately the same time her daughter was taken from her, appellant moved with her husband to Ohio where he was promised a job.

Although she did not actually see Melissa on these dates these efforts on her part must be viewed as an attempt to prevent the forfeiture of her rights to Melissa and as an expression of her love, concern and interest for the child’s well-being. <em>Compare, In re Adoption of McCray, <a href="/pa/460/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="460 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="482775" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0210-01">supra.</a> </em>In addition to these trips, Mrs. D. also communicated at least twice with Chester County Children’s Services advising them of her affection for Melissa and her desire to have her daughter returned.</p>

Although appellant did not communicate with the Chester County agency for over six months, she was, during most of this time, working with the Ohio agency. In fact the record shows that appellant was relying on the instructions of the Chester County agency to cooperate with the Ohio agency and was reasonably led to believe that such action would preserve her rights to her child. These efforts on the part of appellant were clearly made in order that she could establish an environment suitable for the return of Melissa.</p>

To support this assertion, they cite the fact that she failed to send cards, gifts or other remembrances.

They established a pattern of providing the child with gifts and remembrances. The record also indicates that appellant was in communication with her mother and sister with reference to her child’s situation. In view of the child’s age it would appear that the means employed by appellant to keep advised as to the well-being of her child were at least as effective and probably more effective than the means of communication suggested by appellee and the court below.

This language has been used in a context where the parent has voluntarily sought the services of an agency to provide custody during a period where the parent is, for some reason, unable to do so. We can conceive of no reason why the surrogate concept should not be equally applicable to the discharge of parental responsibilities of a parent who has lost custody of the child involuntarily. Although a parent who does not have custody must express in a positive manner, her affection for the offspring and her interest in maintaining the parental relationship, it might well be under the circumstances of a given case that the use of a surrogate would be in the most feasible and effective means to accomplish that end. In our view, such is the case here.</p>

It does not follow that the grandmother’s and aunt’s affection for Melissa excludes the possibility that they were also acting on appellant’s behalf. It was erroneous to accept their personal attachment for Melissa as determinative of the question. It would be only normal for a natural grandmother and a natural aunt to possess their own reasons, in addition to the desire to fulfill appellant’s expectations, for loving and caring for this child. These independent inducements may not be used to nullify the mother’s own care and concern. The important inquiry is whether Mrs. D. reasonably relied on her family, and whether they were in fact aware of this reliance, to discharge some of the responsibilities that comprise the composite of parental tasks.</p>

In addition, letters were exchanged bi-weekly and Barbara P. testified the only purpose was the transmittal of requested information about and pictures of the child. This reliance on the part of appellant was eminently reasonable in view of her circumstances and the regularity with which the mother and sister visited Melissa and the obvious interest in her welfare which they shared.

Furthermore, even though she was living separately and apart from the child she continued to maintain communication with that child albeit through the use of surrogates.

Melissa, then ten months old, was hospitalized on that date as a result of severe physical abuse. On September 20, 1974, the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County granted temporary custody of Melissa to appellee, Chester County Children’s Services. On October 1, 1974, pursuant to juvenile proceedings,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> the court of common pleas found by clear and convincing evidence that Melissa had been physically abused and assaulted in August, 1974, by her stepfather, Roland D. The court also found that in September, 1974, while in the custody of appellant and her husband, Melissa was further abused and assaulted, resulting in her hospitalization. Based on these findings, the court determined that Melissa was a deprived child within the meaning of the Juvenile Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> and continued her custody with Children’s Services. At a dispositional hearing held January 30, 1975, custody was again continued with Children’s Services, with a review ordered to take place in six months, upon request of any party. No request for review of this order has been made.</p>

The Ohio agency submitted medical evidence to an independent local physician who concluded, consistent with the findings of the Chester County Court of Common Pleas, that the marks and bruises could not have resulted from a fall or play, and could not have occurred on one day. Even when confronted with this independent medical opinion, appellant and her husband adhered to their earlier claims that they were not responsible and that they had no knowledge of any marks or bruises on Melissa before she was hospitalized.

Contrary to the majority’s assertion that appellant was working continuously with the Ohio agency to secure Melissa’s return, the record is clear that appellant was advised in February, 1975, eight months before the termination petition was filed, that the agency could not recommend Melissa’s return until appellant faced up to the abuse problem and took affirmative steps to deal with it. This same information was conveyed to appellant by letter from Chester County Children’s Services in May, 1975, which recommended that appellant either return to Chester County or make a new effort to work with the Ohio agency. The record does not indicate that appellant made any further effort to seek assistance in creating an environment suitable for Melissa’s return after the counseling ended unsuccessfully. Although appellant did not attend the January, 1975, juvenile proceedings which continued Melissa’s custody with Children’s Services, she was advised by the agency and, presumably, her attorney, that the custody order could be reviewed in six months upon her request. Appellant never sought review. In these circumstances, I cannot conclude that appellant utilized all available resources to preserve the parental relationship.

Although the evidence suggests that appellant’s husband, rather than appellant, abused Melissa, it also indicates that appellant felt herself incapable of preventing this abuse and protected her husband by denying that he was responsible for the abuse. A witness, with whom appellant and her family had been living, testified to one incident in which appellant’s husband kicked Melissa eighteen inches off the floor. Appellant was upset by the occurrence, but told the witness that “there is nothing she could do when something like this happened.” Shortly after this incident, the witness observed Mr. D. hit Melissa with a rubber mallet and ordered him to move out of her house. Appellant remained with Melissa at the witness’ house for a short period, but later rejoined her husband.

However, the sincerity of appellant’s statement of her intention to separate from her husband might reasonably be questioned. Appellant stated for the first time that she intended to live apart from her husband at the termination hearing. Two weeks before the hearing, she advised the court that her address was in Ohio. Nothing in the record indicates that this hastily conceived plan to separate from her husband was based on a recognition that appellant’s husband was a threat to Melissa’s safety. Both of appellant’s letters to Children’s Services expressed her desire that Melissa be returned to both herself and her husband, and related that her husband shared this wish. Appellant steadfastly denied to the Ohio counselor that her husband had ever abused or mistreated Melissa. Despite the fact that it made visitation with Melissa extremely difficult, appellant remained with her husband in Ohio for over a year prior to the hearing, even though he lost his Ohio job a month after <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>they moved.

Appellant did not indicate why, within two weeks of the termination hearing, she first decided that it warranted separation from her husband. Nor did appellant indicate why her unemployed husband would not return to Chester County to be with her and Melissa, or why she would not rejoin her husband should the financial problems be resolved. These factors are not intended to imply that appellant had an obligation to leave her husband in order to regain custody of her child. Rather, they are intended to point out that the majority’s conclusion that the abuse problem no longer exists because appellant intends to remain apart from her husband rests on a question of fact which the court, on this record, could reasonably have resolved against appellant.</p>

Recognizing that section 311(1) is intended to further the interests of children who, as a result of parental choice or abdication of responsibility, are without an effective parent-child relationship, see note 7, supra, the six month limit is not unreasonable.

In her brief, appellant argues that the Ohio counseling failed because appellant was asked to admit falsely that she had personally abused Melissa. This argument has no support in the record. It is clear from the Ohio agency’s letter that the counselor’s concern was that appellant would not admit that <em>any </em>abuse had occurred, by herself or her husband. Appellant’s protestations in this regard were wholly contradicted by medical evidence, examined by an independent local physician in Ohio as well as physicians in Chester County, and the findings of the Chester County Court of Common Pleas in the Juvenile proceedings. Moreover, testimony at the termination hearing, credited by the court, established that appellant witnessed at least one incident of abuse of Melissa by her husband and said there was nothing she could do about such things when they occurred. See note 4, supra.</p>

The majority also mischaracterizes the unannounced home visits by the Ohio agency, which continued through August, 1975, as part of a rehabilitative plan aimed at establishing conditions which would enable Melissa to return to appellant’s custody. The letter from the Ohio agency reveals that the home visits were not part of a plan established with appellant to permit Melissa to be returned, but were made because the Ohio agency was concerned for the safety of appellant’s other infant child, who was bom shortly after appellant moved to Ohio. After the initial attempt at counseling ended unsuccessfully in February, 1975, both the Ohio and the Chester County agencies informed appellant that Melissa would not be returned until appellant recognized the abuse problem and took steps to deal with it.</p>

It may be that appellant believed, as the Ohio counselor put it, that she need only “put in time” with the counselor in order to have Melissa returned. However, such an attitude does not bespeak a responsible effort to meet Melissa’s need for a safe and secure home, and deserves no approval from this Court.</p>

This unfortunate practice may occur because it is administratively more convenient, because resources for assisting parents are limited, and, it has been suggested, because of an unconscious bias on the part of caseworkers against the lifestyles and home conditions of the poor.

Chester County Children’s Services offered to provide appellant with counseling shortly after Melissa was hospitalized. When appellant wrote Children’s Services, after having moved to Ohio, of her desire to regain custody of Melissa, Children’s Services contacted the Ohio agency on her behalf. The Ohio agency initiated counseling for appellant, which was discontinued only when appellant refused repeatedly to acknowledge the existence of an abuse problem in her home. The Ohio counselor offered to resume the counseling if appellant or her husband requested it. After learning of the failure of the Ohio counseling, Children’s Services wrote to appellant, recommending that she either return to Chester County to work with that agency on a plan to regain custody, or resume counseling with the Ohio agency. The record indicates that Children’s Services acted in good faith to involve appellant in efforts to develop a plan for Melissa’s safe return to her custody.</p>

The majority bases its conclusion on the testimony of appellant and her sister that they frequently communicated concerning Melissa. Several factors appear in the record, however, which support the orphans’ court’s conclusion that this testimony should not be credited. Although appellant carefully preserved copies of all her communications with the agency, neither she nor her sister introduced any of the letters allegedly exchanged bi-weekly over a thirteen month period. Appellant advised the orphans’ court that her mother, who presumably could have corroborated her testimony, was ill and unable to appear. However, appellant made no request for either a continuance to permit her mother to testify, or leave to introduce by affidavit or otherwise a corroborative statement from her mother. Appellant’s sister had a strong personal motive to support appellant’s testimony. The sister had developed close personal ties to Melissa while the child was in foster care, and had expressed a desire to obtain custody of Melissa if the child was not returned to appellant. This hope was discouraged by the agency. In her testimony, the sister revealed her concern that “if they give her out for adoption I will never see her again . ...” Although the sister admitted often discussing Melissa with Children’s Services personnel during her monthly visits, she did not explain why she had never mentioned to them any of the alleged communications with appellant concerning the child.</p>
