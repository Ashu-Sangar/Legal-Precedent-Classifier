As expressed in <em>Firing, </em>a term of office is considered to have ended upon reaching age 70 or upon the expiration of six years, whichever occurs first. Article V, sections 15(a) and 16(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution. If a justice of the peace reaches age 70 first, the term is ended and thus there is no basis for a claim for further compensation. The factual posture in <em>Firing </em>bears no similarity to the instant situation where the result of the dispute establishes that appellee was <em>in fact entitled to have held the office from the commencement of the stated term.</em>

Of all of the common pleas court judges in the Commonwealth, only appellee will receive both a judicial salary and income from the private practice of law for the period during which his election was in dispute. The anomalous result is that appellee will receive substantially greater income from this period than did any of his brethren, even though, unlike the other common pleas court judges, he performed no judicial services. Such a result is not only illogical, but holds considerable potential for impairing the orderly administration of judicial services.</p>

This seems compelled both by considerations of fairness and by the statutes and cases discussed by the majority and which are unchallenged by appellant. Nor do I dispute the majority’s conclusions that by engaging in the practice of law while the contest concerning his election was pending, Judge Reed did not violate either Article V, Section 17(a) of the Pennsylvania Constitution (judges “shall not engage in the practice of law”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> or Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, <em>supra </em>note 1, 455 Pa. at xxx (“A judge should avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all his activities”).

And the Code, in my view, does not permit a judge to receive a judicial salary for a period of time when he performed work that was incompatible with the judicial office from which he now seeks earnings <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>As suggested above, the fact that there was an <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>election contest imputes no blameworthiness to Judge Reed, and it would be unrealistic and harsh to demand that one in his position must, if he needs income on which to live, suddenly convert to another occupation. On the other hand, as I see it, the fact of the contest did nevertheless confront Mr. Reed with the necessity to make a choice as between his prospective judicial salary and what he might earn as a practicing lawyer during the period that the election remained in doubt. He should not be able to have it both ways, which is what the Court’s decision allows. To permit one whose entitlement to office is finally vindicated to turn his temporary disability into a permanent windfall, through the addition to the fruits of his law practice of judicial salary for the same period, presents, in my view, an “appearance of impropriety” that is clearly within the prohibition of Canon 2(A) of the Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> See and compare <em>Matter of Dandridge, </em><a href="/pa/462/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="462 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="485175" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0067-01">462 Pa. 67</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="462 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="485175" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0067-01">337 A.2d 885</a> (1975) (retention by a judge of monies received from a testimonial dinner held to create an “appearance of impropriety”).</p>

An alternative argument raised by appellant, and also rejected by the Court, is that if the salary demanded by Judge Reed is to be paid, it should be reduced by the amount he earned from private practice. Thus, under the facts of this case, Judge Reed would receive some $13,000 in judicial salary, rather than the approximately $31,000 he claims. The difficulty with this approach is that while it would lessen the vice inherent in allowing full double compensation, it would nevertheless fail to remove the appearance of impropriety which comes from sanctioning the payment to a judicial officer of earnings from incompatible sources for the same period of time.</p>
