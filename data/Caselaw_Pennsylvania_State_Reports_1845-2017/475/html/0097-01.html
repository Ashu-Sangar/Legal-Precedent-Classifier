He voluntarily appeared in response to an administrative subpoena which carried no sanction for failure to appear except non-payment of the questioned expense vouchers and he was free to leave the interview at all times.

Since the Superior Court did not reach the question of voluntariness, the normal procedure on review by this Court would be to remand the matter for their consideration of this issue. However, since the record clearly establishes that this claim was not raised in the trial court, judicial economy is best served by our disposing of the question and avoiding the necessity of a second remand in this case.</p>

Whereas appellee was acting under the influence of a subpoena, and had to report to the Comptroller’s Office, Beck-with was politely approached by IRS agents and questioned at his home. In both a real and practical sense, there was compulsion for appellee to appear before the Comptroller and answer questions; noncompliance meant certain nonpayment of the disputed vouchers and possible criminal indictments. This is in contrast to <em>Beckwith, </em>where the defendant’s refusal to answer any questions had no such immediate and prejudicial consequences. More fundamentally, <em>Beckwith </em>was fully apprised of his Fifth Amendment rights, as well as his right to have any attorney present; that fact attenuated his claim that his statements should have been suppressed because he was not administered <em>Miranda </em>warnings.
