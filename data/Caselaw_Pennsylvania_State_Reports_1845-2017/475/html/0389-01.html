According to appellant’s confession, in the early evening of August 21, 1973, he was informed that Leroy Skinner, the victim, was standing outside appellant’s home in Philadelphia, flicking a knife. Appellant and his co-defendant, Tyrone Pearsall, went looking for the victim and found him standing on 24th Street near Dickerson Street. The victim ran into a bar. As appellant and Pearsall entered the bar, appellant handed a gun to Pearsall, who fired one shot at the victim. As the victim ran out of the bar, both Pearsall and appellant gave chase. Pearsall continued firing at the victim. Appellant then took the gun and fired one shot. Skinner was subsequently pronounced dead at Graduate Hospital. An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was three gunshot wounds to the trunk.</p>

Trial was commenced on April 18, 1974, with appellant pleading not guilty. After five days of voir dire, a jury was empaneled on April 24, 1974. During the second day of the presentation of the Commonwealth’s case, appellant informed the court that he wished to plead guilty to murder generally. A plea agreement had been worked out with the Commonwealth certifying that the degree of guilt was no higher than murder of the second degree. During the colloquy between appellant and his attorney, however, appellant denied that he was guilty of murder. The court refused to accept the proposed <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>plea and ordered the jury trial to proceed.

While appellant’s guilt may very well be predicated upon his participation in the homicide short of actually killing the victim, he could be, and, in fact, was, found guilty of murder. While many laymen might not realize that they may be found guilty for the acts of another, we believe a defendant must demonstrate such an understanding before a court will accept a tendered guilty plea.

Immediately prior to appellant’s attempt to plead guilty, Pearsall pled guilty to murder generally pursuant to a plea agreement with the Commonwealth, certifying that the crime rose no higher than murder of the second degree and recommending a nine-to-twenty-year prison term. The court, however, deferred sentencing until a presentence report could be completed to assist the court in determining whether to follow <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>the recommendation. Appellant called Pearsall as a defense witness, but in an <em>in camera </em>hearing, Pearsall indicated he would not answer any questions, asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Appellant nonetheless put Pearsall on the witness stand, but Pearsall refused to answer any questions. Appellant claims that Pearsall should have been compelled to testify. We do not agree.</p>
    <p id="b425-4" data-blocks='[["BL_425.5",425,[175,706,1154,800]]]'>Appellant argues that Pearsall waived his privilege against self-incrimination by pleading guilty. We believe, however, that this waiver does not go into effect until, at the very least, sentence is imposed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> One reason for this rule is clear from the facts of the instant case. The court had ordered a presentence report so that he could decide whether to follow the recommended sentence. The court could very well have decided that a more severe sentence was called for. Pearsall then would have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea and demand a trial. Had Pearsall been forced to testify at appellant’s trial, his testimony could have been used against him at his own trial, thus circumventing the Fifth Amendment privilege. We believe the court below acted correctly in refusing to compel Pearsall’s testimony.</p>

This confession was almost identical to appellant’s, except that Pearsall admitted firing all the shots, while appellant had admitted to firing one shot. The trial court refused to admit Pearsall’s confession, and appellant claims that this refusal was error. We do not agree, as the proffered statement did not meet the test of relevancy. <em>Commonwealth v.

It is clear, rather, that appellant’s guilt was predicated upon an accomplice theory. Even if Pearsall’s statement had been admitted, it would have shown that appellant and Pearsall together went looking for the victim and once they found him, appellant gave Pearsall the gun to shoot the decedent. Further, when Pearsall started chasing the victim, appellant ran along. The confession was not relevant,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> because it did not tend to prove that appellant did not participate in the crime and was not guilty of murder of the first degree.

The confession would have been relevant if introduced by the Commonwealth, as it would have tended to prove that appellant was a participant in a crime which amounted to murder of the first degree. Appellant, however, was attempting to establish his innocence, and from this point of view, the confession was irrelevant.</p>

    <p id="b428-11" data-blocks='[["BL_428.12",428,[247,1098,1159,203]]]'>I dissent. My examination of the record convinces me that the appellant was entitled to a mistrial when Officer McGlotten stated before the jury that appellant had failed a polygraph test.</p>
    <p id="b428-12" data-blocks='[["BL_428.13",428,[243,1325,1161,633]]]'>This reference to a polygraph was the second made by this witness. The first, less damaging to the appellant, was to the effect that appellant has taken a polygraph test. Appellant’s counsel moved for a mistrial at that time, and the trial judge denied the motion. The trial judge also refused defense counsel’s request that he instruct the witness to answer questions directly. The trial judge stated, “I do not see any justification for criticizing this witness in the reply that he made.” He further told defense counsel to formulate his own solution to the problem of witness statements that prejudice his client, and that “I [have] no suggestions as to what you should do”</p>
    <p id="b428-13" data-blocks='[["BL_428.14",428,[241,1983,1161,366]]]'>The witness’ second reference to the polygraph test was more prejudicial to the appellant, the witness stating that appellant failed the test. Counsel’s motion for a mistrial was denied, notwithstanding the trial judge’s admission that the answer was not a responsive one. At that point the judge cautioned the witness, and informed the jury that the witness’ statement was to be disregarded, saying,</p>

    <p id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[160,593,1151,259]]]'>I utterly fail to see how the majority can conclude that an answer was “elicited by defense counsel” when the trial judge stated that the answer was unresponsive to the question! Such a conclusion defies reason, ignores the record, and denied appellant due process of law. I dissent.</p>
