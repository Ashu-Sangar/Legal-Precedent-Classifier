    <p id="b655-5" data-blocks='[["BL_655.5",655,[181,665,1147,317]]]'>The Authority appealed to the Commonwealth Court on May 20, 1974. On June 12, 1974, that Court granted a supersedeas and reinstated the permit. After exceptions were filed, the Court, on June 29,1974, affirmed the order of supersedeas. On July 18, 1975, the Commonwealth Court reversed the Board and ordered reinstatement of the permit.</p>
    <p id="b655-6" data-blocks='[["BL_655.6",655,[182,1011,1150,698]]]'>On appeal to this Court briefs were filed by the parties; by an intervening party, Township of Marple; and by the following amici curiae, Department of Environmental Resources, Environmental Law Council of the University of Pittsburgh Law School, Western Pennsylvania Conservancy and Pennsylvania Municipal Authorities Association. We are asked to affirm or to reverse. The amicus brief of the Department of Environmental Resources requests us to modify, reverse or narrow the decision of the Commonwealth Court. All the briefs raise serious questions of broad significance with respect to the impact of Article I, Section 27, of the Pennsylvania Constitution upon the functioning of an administrative agency.</p>
    <p id="b655-7" data-blocks='[["BL_655.7",655,[184,1737,1150,316]]]'>At the oral argument in which all the interested parties participated this Court was informed that the sewer extension involved is built and in operation, and no one objects to its continued use by the Community College. Accordingly, there arises the question as to whether there is any longer an issue as to the propriety of the construction of the sewer.</p>

No reason has been urged upon this Court for adjudicating an issue which has not been considered in prior proceedings. The grant of a right to construct a sewer extension is an entirely different question from the right to make additional connections to an existing sewer.</p>
    <p id="b656-4" data-blocks='[["BL_656.5",656,[265,681,1157,761]]]'>The issue of the propriety of the grant of a sewer permit is not before us because no request or demand is being made for the undoing of what was done under the permit. Counsel for the appellants orally suggested that the case be remanded to the Environmental Hearing Board to restrict the use of the sewer by future applicants. That is a new issue that can be raised at any time by seeking an appropriate administrative order, followed up by an appeal if necessary. In <em>D. E. R. v. Boro. of Carlisle, </em>16 Pa.Cmwlth. 341, 349, <a href="/citations/?q=330%20A.2d%20293" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="330 A.2d 293">330 A.2d 293</a>, 298 (1974), it is pointed out: “Where it is found necessary to meet the objective of the Act the DER may issue appropriate orders including orders to prohibit additional sewer connections. Section 5 of The Clean Streams Law, 35 P.S. § 691.203(b) (Supp.1974-1975).”</p>

They are entitled to a review as to whether the permit was properly issued. If the permit was not properly issued, they are entitled to a remedy. The remedy could be an order that the sewer be torn out or a <em>lesser </em>remedy that the sewer be limited in use. Because appellants are asking for the less drastic remedy is no reason to deny them appellate review of whether the permit was properly issued in the first place.</p>
