The questions are not reprinted on the interview sheet; instead, seven spaces are provided on the sheet for the recording of the suspect’s answers. After appellant had answered the first six questions in such a way as to indicate that she wished to waive her <em>Miranda </em>rights, Detective Winston asked her the seventh and last question: “Are you willing to answer questions of your own free will, without force or fear, and without any threats or promises having been made to you?” To this, Detective Winston testified, appellant answered “yes,” but he mistakenly entered “no” on the interview sheet.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The suppression judge at this point asked several questions to clarify the testimony. Appellant’s counsel asked no questions about this matter on cross-examination, but did bring out that there was a second officer, Detective Michael McKay, present during some of the interrogation. When the suppression judge learned in response to his own questions that Detective McKay had also filled out an interview sheet and that Detective Winston had not noted McKay’s presence on his chronology sheet, the judge remarked that these circumstances were “a bit unusual in my experience.” N.T.

The suppression judge then began a series of questions, to which appellant’s counsel objected. In answer to one question McKay testified that he had recorded Ms. Seabrook’s response to the seventh <em>Miranda </em>warning as “yes.” The court then asked additional questions concerned with what the detective had heard and the accuracy of his record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Appellant argues that this and other conduct of the <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>suppression judge reveals his pro-prosecution bias and his advocacy of the Commonwealth’s case.

      <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a> In essence, then, the question is whether the trial court has abused its discretion. <em>Commonwealth v. Myma, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patskin, supra. </em>“It is always the right and sometimes the duty of a trial judge to interrogate witnesses, although, of course, questioning from the bench should not show bias or feeling nor be unduly protracted.” <em>Commonwealth v.

See, e. g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em><a href="/pa/401/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="401 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1294486" data-case-paths="/pa/401/0100-01">401 Pa. 100</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.2d%20636" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="162 A.2d 636">162 A.2d 636</a> (1960); <em>Commonwealth v.

That consideration, of course, is not present in a bench trial or a suppression hearing. Nevertheless, even in those situations, “questioning from the bench should not show bias or feeling nor be unduly protracted,” <em>Commonwealth v. Watts, supra. </em>This is not because of what might be intimated to a non-existent jury but because the parties are entitled to a fair fact-finder who, while not allowing himself to be put in a straight jacket by the adversary system, does not attempt to banish the restraints of that system from the courtroom.</p>

We need not and do not decide whether we would have drawn the inference, as the suppression judge apparently did, that the waiver which Detective McKay recorded was what he actually heard; it is enough that he could rationally draw that inference. And it is hard to see how any finding of bias can be made when the judge immediately followed up certain questions, the answers to which helped the Commonwealth’s case, with questions that focused further on the accuracy of Detective McKay’s recording, the answers to which did the Commonwealth’s case no good.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

But the adversary process should not be regarded as sacred, and it is the proper role and function of the trial judge to exercise his judicial powers in such manner as to give the jury opportunity to decide the case free from irrelevant issues and appeals to passion and prejudice. In addition, it is appropriate for him from time to time to intervene in the conduct of the case. Thus, when it clearly appears to him that for one reason or another the case is not being presented intelligibly to the jury, the judge is not required to remain silent. On the contrary, he may by question to a witness elicit relevant and important facts. He may interrogate a witness after a cross-examination which appears to be misleading to the jury. . . . The judge should be aware that there may be greater risk of prejudice from over-intervention than from under-intervention. While he should not hesitate to exercise his authority when necessary, he should avoid trying the case for the lawyers.” <em>Id. </em>at 26-27 (citations omitted).</blockquote>

It is noteworthy that appellant does not contend that counsel’s cross-examination of Detective McKay, which followed the court’s • questions, was improperly restricted. Nor could the record support such a contention. In addition, we do not read the comments of the suppression judge during and at the conclusion of the hearing as showing bias. Although the judge’s expressions of his inferences might raise a problem had they been made during a jury trial, they cannot be deemed to show a predisposition at a suppression hearing to decide against appellant no matter what the evidence was.</p>
