Post-verdict motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than two nor more than ten years in a state correctional institution. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[189,619,1154,578]]]'>The facts surrounding this appeal are as follows. On January 20, 1975, James Gaddy and Daniel Lee, members of the “Clang Gang,” solicited the decedent to buy a bottle of wine for them. This group proceeded to a state liquor store at Stenton and Ogontz Avenues in Philadelphia. Flowers entered the store while Gaddy and Lee remained outside. Before Flowers could buy the bottle of wine, members of “Sommerville,” a rival gang, approached Gaddy and Lee. Both Gaddy and Lee urged Flowers to hurry, but these urgings went unheeded. The Sommerville Gang attacked Gaddy and Lee, during which attack Lee was stabbed.</p>

Gaddy and Lee decided that Flowers had delayed his departure from the state store in order to set them up for the Sommerville attack. Gaddy promised Lee that he would get Flowers. Upon leaving the store, Gaddy met four other members of the Clang Gang, appellant, Mark Savage, Miguel Garcia and Bernis Shelton. Gaddy informed the other gang members about the incident and then stated: “We’re going to get him, now, going to go up and get him.” The five then proceeded to search for Gerald Flowers. The Clang members encountered Flowers at 66th and Ogontz. Gaddy interrogated Flowers as to why he had delayed his departure from the state store and thus caused Lee’s stabbing by the Sommerville gang. Flowers denied prolonging his stay in the store for the purpose of aiding the Sommerville gang to attack. This explanation was unsatisfactory to the Clang members. Flowers was then knocked down and all five individuals proceeded to punch and kick Flowers about the head and stomach. During the altercation Garcia pulled a knife and stabbed Flowers. The Clang gang was then <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>frightened away from the scene by the arrival of a mail truck.

The facts today’s majority claims the Supreme Court relied upon in <em>Harrison </em>were, in the express words of the Supreme Court, unnecessary to the Supreme Court’s decision.</p>
    <p id="b573-8" data-blocks='[["BL_573.9",573,[173,2029,1150,309]]]'>In <em>Harrison v.

Thus, the majority’s effort to distinguish <em>Harrison </em>reflects a complete misreading of the Supreme Court's opinion. The Supreme Court did not require that Harrison assert his fifth amendment privilege before trial to prevent the government from using his trial testimony against him; it was enough to prove that the illegally obtained confession was admitted into evidence before Harrison testified. Once it was shown that the confession was illegally obtained, the burden was on the government to prove that the confession did not “impel” the defendant’s testimony.

In this case, by contrast, appellant’s pre-trial application to suppress was denied almost three months before trial. Thus, appellant knew well before trial the contents of his in-custody statement, and that it would be admitted at trial. If anything, a statement by appellant at the beginning of trial that he would not testify would make it appear less likely that his trial testimony was impelled by admission of his in-custody statement. A defendant’s decision to change his tactics and testify at trial would appear to be the product of some unanticipated evidence, rather than an attempt to explain a statement he had known about for three months. To hold that a defendant must announce at the beginning of trial that he does not intend to testify is to require the defendant to perform a meaningless formality in order to preserve his suppression claim.</p>

In his trial testimony, Gaddy named appellant as one of five youths who attacked the victim. In a statement to the police, Gaddy had also named five youths, but did not include appellant among them. Three of the youths Gaddy named at trial were different from those Gaddy identified in his statement to the police. In ruling on appellant’s demurrer at the close of the prosecution’s case, the tried court made clear the importance of appellant’s in-custody statement:</p>
      <blockquote id="b576-8" data-blocks='[["BL_576.3",576,[316,1348,1088,308]]]'>“at this stage of the demurrer, Gaddy had testified in court specifically putting the defendant at the scene.

      <p id="b576-10" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[278,1662,1125,466]]]'>As appellant had waived jury trial the trial court was also the finder-of-fact. Thus, the court’s statement, recognizing that Gaddy’s credibility was questionable and emphasizing the importance of appellant’s in-custody statement, highlights how the admission of appellant’s in-custody statement may have induced appellant to testify at trial, or to testify as he did. While the court’s recognition of the importance of appellant’s statement adds additional support for the conclusion that the Commonwealth has failed to meet its burden of proof, I would not require a defendant to point to such statements by the court. <em>Harrison </em>holds that once it is shown the defendant’s statement was admitted into evidence the burden is on the Commonwealth to prove the statement did not induce the testimony.</p>
