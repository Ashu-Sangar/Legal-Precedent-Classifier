Hardick, was convicted after a jury trial of possession of instruments of crime<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two years to five years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Superior Court affirmed without opinion and <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>we allowed the present appeal to examine Hardick’s contention that the Commonwealth failed to sustain its burden of proving that the instruments were possessed with the requisite criminal intent. We shall affirm.</p>
    <p id="b507-5" data-blocks='[["BL_507.5",507,[196,547,1153,918]]]'>The record discloses that on October 4, 1973, at approximately 12:30 A.M., a Pennsylvania state trooper, Robert E. Miller, observed the appellant, on a well-lit street in a commercial area of Punxsutawney, demonstrating to an unidentified individual a suction device known as a “tinplate”. This was being done by applying the device to the door of Hardick’s automobile, and showing its suction ability by way of a lifting motion applied to the device which resulted in a rocking of the vehicle. Later that morning, the appellant was arrested for an unrelated burglary incident, in connection with which he gave a written authorization to Trooper Miller and Joseph Volpe, Chief of Police of Punxsutawney, to search his automobile. During that search the police confiscated the tin-plate as well as a hacksaw blade, a drill bit and a metal punch. The finding of these instruments precipitated the lodging of the present charge against appellant.</p>
    <p id="b507-6" data-blocks='[["BL_507.6",507,[198,1493,1151,861]]]'>At trial, Chief Volpe stated that he was familiar with the tin-plate; he said it was a specialized tool commonly used by professional burglars to crack safes. Using a blackboard, Volpe illustrated how the tin-plate is attached by its suction cups to the face of the safe door after the combination dial has been removed. The drill bit is placed in the disc of the tin-plate and driven through the door of the safe with a hammer in order to release the tumblers and open the lock. Volpe further testified that he was aware of no other use for such a device. Trooper Miller stated that the hacksaw blade and drill bit were for use on heavy metal and agreed with Volpe that the tin-plate, to his knowledge, had no other purpose than safe-cracking. The defendant presented no evidence, but rather sought to impeach Trooper Miller with his prior testimony in which the officer had indicated such a device might be used for the repair of dented automobiles.</p>

Both prosecution witnesses denied that this was a function of the device, although Trooper Miller’s earlier statement to the effect that the instrument could be used for such a purpose was admitted into evidence. Trooper Miller did, nevertheless, state that the particular make-up of the tin-plate here involved, which was equipped with numerous suction cups, was unlike one that might be used for automobile repair purposes. We do not have, then, in the instant situation, a case where the Commonwealth has failed to introduce evidence as to the criminal nature of the tools (compare <em>Commonwealth v. Clinton, </em><a href="/pa/391/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="391 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="1276884" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0212-01">391 Pa. 212</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.2d%20463" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="137 A.2d 463">137 A.2d 463</a> (1958)). The Commonwealth has established a prima facie case that the tin-plate and other tools were found under circumstances not manifestly appropriate for lawful uses. See <em>Commonwealth v. Allen, </em><a href="/pa/466/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="466 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="1714959" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0474-01">466 Pa. 474</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="466 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="1714959" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0474-01">353 A.2d 452</a> (1976); <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant was in no way acting in a furtive or clandestine manner, was demonstrating the instrument in plain view of anyone interested, and was not acting in any way to indicate that a property crime was imminent. Every citizen who transports tools in a city at night, tools that conceivably could be used to gain entrance <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>to another person’s private property, cannot be convicted of a crime. The prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the individual intended to use those tools for a criminal purpose. I think the prosecution’s evidence in this case fails to meet that standard of proof. I therefore dissent.</p>
