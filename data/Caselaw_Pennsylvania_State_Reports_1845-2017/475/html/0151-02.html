Appellant contends that the compensation at issue actually constitutes a “fee” for every arrest a police officer makes since he then is obliged to appear as a witness on behalf of the Commonwealth. This intertwining of the important exercise of police discretion with the possibility of financial gain, he asserts, must not be tolerated. The appellees, on the other hand argue that the per diem payment is not a “fee” within the proscription of the statute but is basically compensation for the performance of police duties beyond normal working hours.

Section 636 is addressed to municipalities and prohibits them from expending monies in certain ways on behalf of police officers. Section 37008, on the other hand, relates to what types of police persons’ remuneration, other than compensation provided by ordinance, are authorized from sources other than the employer-municipality. Thus we cannot conclude, as the trial did implicitly, that there is a conflict between section 636 and section 37008. Section 636 merely excludes fines, rebates of fines, or fees as determinants in the compensation fixed by law. Section 37008 can be fairly read as incorporating this exclusion as to any police persons’ compensation established by ordinances of cities of the third class. Therefore, the two sections taken together require that the police persons’ compensation set by such ordinances must not include fines, rebates of fines, or fees.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">6A</a> It is unquestioned <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>that the proposed payment in this case is to be paid out of the city treasury of York.

Secondly, they assert that the anticipated payment is in reality a “witness fee” for an appearance in a court of record which has been “provided by law” in the form of a city ordinance. Initially we note that the assertion that the compensation has been provided by city ordinance and is, therefore, <em>a fortiori </em>legitimate is defeated by our conclusion that it is a “fee” which the municipality is forbidden under Section 636 to provide to its police officers.

It is unpersuasive that the fee is unrelated to, and independent of, what the officer actually testifies to in court. It is sufficient that the decision to arrest or not, to interrogate or not, for instance, might directly be influenced by temptations of financial gain.

Another possible evil strenuously pointed to by the appellant is the possibility of unnecessary police witnesses being subpoenaed. While it is true that the District Attorney ultimately decides upon the witnesses to be called in a given case, it is a logistical fact that generally all of the witnesses suggested by the police officials are subpoenaed to appear at the appropriate proceeding. Not only would the practice of listing and calling unnecessary witnesses create an inexcusable drain on public monies, it also would diminish the effectiveness of the police force by unjustifiably removing officers from their primary responsibility of ferreting out and preventing crime. While we recognize that the payment in question only is made if the court appearance occurs on off-duty hours, the time of that appearance cannot be anticipated in advance. Therefore, this “padding” syndrome would have a significant impact by diverting officers who otherwise would be performing normally assigned duties.</p>

I can find no basis to conclude that this is unlawful compensation under either provision.</p>

This payment of $15.00 per diem, they say, is a “fee” because it is paid at irregular and uncertain periods for a particular service rendered — a policeman’s appearance in court.</p>
    <p id="b194-5" data-blocks='[["BL_194.5",194,[258,535,1158,884]]]'>I must disagree with this reasoning. The compensation is to be paid for the “day or portion thereof . . . during off-duty hours” which the policeman must give up to spend in court. It is payment for the <em>overtime </em>which is necessitated by the responsibilities of his employment, not for any special <em>services </em>rendered. Payment for the service of an appearance would logically be based upon the number of cases in which the officer testified, not, as here, based squarely upon the number of days off which have been consumed by official duties. That it is paid at irregular and uncertain periods is no justification for calling it a fee. Although overtime payment takes many forms, all overtime payments have one characteristic in common — they are paid at irregular intervals, whenever overtime is actually earned. I must therefore conclude that this is not a “fee” within the prohibitions of § 636, but overtime paid for the time put in on required police functions.</p>
    <p id="b194-7" data-blocks='[["BL_194.6",194,[259,1441,1156,409]]]'>Although in § 37004 of the Third Class City Code there is a limitation upon the number of hours that a city may require any police officer to remain <em>on duty, </em>there is no provision in this section or elsewhere prohibiting the payment of overtime. The only legislative reference to overtime is the provision in § 37004 that when duty beyond the 44 hour limit is required in emergency situations, overtime is to be paid at the same rate as for regular service.</p>
    <p id="b194-8" data-blocks='[["BL_194.7",194,[260,1872,1156,300]]]'>Nor can it be said that this is compensation prohibited by § 37008 of Third Class City Code.

Appearances in court frequently consume a complete day or, at the very least, a major part of a day. Fifteen dollars per day is much less than the normal earnings of a police officer. In many cases, the need to spend off-duty time in court is not an aspect of duty which is as desirable as indicated by the majority.</p>
