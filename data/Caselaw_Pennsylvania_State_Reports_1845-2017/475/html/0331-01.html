The indictment charged appellant with “intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or negligently” causing the death of another human being, but the indictment indicated that such conduct violated sections 2502(a) and (b) of the Crimes Code (first and second degree murder), rather than 2502(a) and (c) (first and third degree). It is clear, however, that the words used encompass the charge of third degree murder. It was thus within the power of the trial court to allow the amendment, which corrected a “defect in form” and did not “charge an additional or different offense.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 220.</p>

First, appellant claims it was error to admit into evidence a knife sheath which the investigating police officer found in the immediate area of the stabbing. The officer testified that he found it within one hour of the stabbing and that he had been at the crime scene continuously for that period. A witness to the stabbing testified that he saw appellant holding something in his hand that looked like a “knife holster,” but the witness was unable to positively identify the sheath in question.</p>

Testimony positively identifying the sheath as appellant’s is unnecessary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yount, </em><a href="/pa/455/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="455 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="582186" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0303-01">455 Pa. 303</a>, 316, <a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%20242" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="314 A.2d 242">314 A.2d 242</a>, 249 (1974). So long as a proper foundation is laid to show the relevance of the evidence, it can be admitted; the question then becomes the weight that should be assigned to it by the fact finder. See <em>Commonwealth v. Ford, supra, </em><a href="/pa/451/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="451 Pa. 81" data-case-ids="1948573" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0081-01">451 Pa. at 84</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20856" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="301 A.2d 856">301 A.2d at </a>857 (citing cases). On that point counsel was free to argue, as he did, that the sheath found by the officer was not clearly shown to have been appellant’s and that it could have been placed there by other witnesses to the stabbing. We think the trial court could, properly conclude that the jury was capable of assessing the probative value of the sheath in light of all the surrounding facts.</p>

The question whether this type of evidence is admissible is one we have frequently encountered and the test to be applied is well established.

The evidence was not highly inflammatory; the two pictures of the body, for example, were in black and white, the blood around the wound had been cleansed before the pictures were taken, and the pictures showed only the victim’s chest. As for its essential evidentiary value, an important factual issue in the <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>case was whether the victim was stabbed twice in deliberate fashion, or was killed in a struggle for the knife. The photographs showed two wounds close together and no additional scratches such as might have occurred in a struggle. The shirt, however, showed only one hole. This discrepancy was noted initially by defense counsel in cross-examining the coroner; the prosecution later introduced the shirt itself to show where the hole was in relation to the wounds. Given this evidentiary value of the items, and the very slim “likelihood of inflaming the minds and passions of the jurors” that the evidence in question shows, see <em>Commonwealth v. Powell, supra, </em><a href="/pa/428/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="428 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="1912356" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0275-01">428 Pa. at 279</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=241%20A.2d%20119" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="241 A.2d 119">241 A.2d at 121</a>, we cannot say it was error to admit into evidence the shirt and photographs.</p>

We do not reach the merits of this claim, however, because it has not been properly preserved for appeal. Our Rules of Criminal Procedure, and our case law, require that unless specific objection is made to an alleged error in the charge, the error cannot be raised on appeal.

It should not be overlooked, however, as Mr. Justice ROBERTS’ opinion does, that in gauging the possibility of prejudice, the court should bear in mind the role that cautionary instructions can play by way of forewarning the jury that what it will see is distasteful and unpleasant, but that these qualities are not to sway the judgment of the jury as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Such instructions, by focusing the jury’s attention on the reasons for which evidence is admitted, would go far to neutralize any emotional or prejudicial impact the photograph might have: <em>See </em>Shaffer, Judges, <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>Repulsive Evidence and the Ability to Respond, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20Notre%20Dame%20Law.%20403" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="43 Notre Dame Law. 403">43 Notre Dame Law, 403</a>, 509-10 (1968).</p>

More important, however, is the majority’s reluctance to sanction the use of a type of evidence that often speaks better than most witnesses can to crucial factual issues that juries sit to decide, as I think the photographs did in this case. Many of the results of homicide are distinctly unpleasant, but the jury must have evidence as probative as can be found to enable it to decide properly whether an accused is criminally responsible for those results. The majority’s apparent assumptions that jurors will forget about the presumption of innocence upon seeing a photograph of a corpse, and that, even if aided by trial court instructions, they will not be able to view such evidence and do their work dispassionately, are patronizing notions that I do not share.</p>
