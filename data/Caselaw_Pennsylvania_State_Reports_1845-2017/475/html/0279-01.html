In September of 1974, the teachers returned to work without a contract. The parties finally reached an agreement in early December, with both parties ratifying the agreement a short time later. The collective bargaining agreement, which was formally executed in January of 1975, was made effective retroactively to July 1, 1974.</p>

Both Moran, a teacher with eleven years seniority and Archie Perrin, a second year teacher, applied for the job. On July 8,1974, one week after the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement, the board of school directors named Mr. Perrin as assistant basketball coach.</p>

The School District appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which on June 18, 1976, reversed the arbitrator’s award and dismissed the grievance. <em>School District of City of Duquesne </em>v. <em>Duquesne Education Association, </em>25 Pa.Cmwlth. 216, <a href="/citations/?q=359%20A.2d%20850" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="359 A.2d 850">359 A.2d 850</a> (1976).
