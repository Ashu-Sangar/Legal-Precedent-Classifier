Appellant Charlotte Breyer Rodgers is the income beneficiary of three inter vivos trust established by Edith Breyer, two of which were settled in November, 1954, the third in November, 1958. All five trusts are still active. In July, 1974, appellee First Pennsylvania Bank (First Pennsylvania), the trustee of the five trusts, filed accounts in the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, seeking compensation from the principal of the five trusts. Appellants challenge the final decrees of the orphans’ court awarding $28,850 in interim commissions from principal. Appellants claim that, upon settlement of the trusts, First Pennsylvania entered into fee agreements barring interim commissions. We conclude that a fee agreement bars First Pennsylvania from collecting interim commissions from the principal of the Henry Breyer trusts but that no such agreement bars First Pennsylvania from collecting interim commissions from the principal of the Edith Breyer trusts. <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>Accordingly, we reverse the decrees affecting the Henry Breyer trust and affirm the decrees affecting the Edith Breyer trusts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

We cannot agree. The court’s interpretation might be possible, if not entirely plausible, if the provision were read in isolation. However, when read in context it is clear that, with regard to both income and principal commissions, the parties intended to fix the amount and the timing of payments.

A court must be careful not to “retire into that lawyer’s Paradise where all words have a fixed, precisely ascertained meaning; where men may express their purposes, not only with accuracy, but with fulness; and where, if the writer has been careful, a lawyer, having a document referred to him, may sit in his chair inspect the text, and answer all questions without raising his eyes.” Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence 428, quoted in 3 Corbin on Contracts § 535 n.16 (1960).</p>

Appellant Charlotte Breyer Rodgers contends that First Pennsylvania’s failure to seek interim commissions before this accounting evidences an agreement. We find this argument unconvincing. First Pennsylvania’s failure to seek interim commissions from principal before these accounts were filed cannot be said to constitute evidence of an agreement not to seek such commissions. Nothing in the statute requires a trustee to make regular demands on the principal; indeed this state does not provide for commissions from principal unless the trustee can demonstrate that he has not been <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>fully compensated for services. See 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 7185(b) (1975). First Pennsylvania’s failure to seek interim commissions from these trusts at an earlier date may simply indicate that previously, commissions from income were sufficient.</p>

Mr. McKean would have testified that the payment of interim commissions from principal would diminish the amount of principal and thus reduce the income of the beneficiaries. We agree with the orphans’ court that this evidence is irrelevant. The Legislature presumably has considered this problem and has authorized interim commissions nevertheless.</p>
