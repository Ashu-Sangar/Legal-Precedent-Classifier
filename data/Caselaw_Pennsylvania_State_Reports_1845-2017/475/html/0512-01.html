The black youths had arrived at the scene in a car operated by Otis Mack and its passengers were Marlon Matthews (the deceased victim) and Clifford McClure. The two white youths, Délo and Perrine, sent their girl friends to a telephone to call additional help to the scene. The call was placed to the clubhouse of a local motorcycle club known as ‘The Scorpions’ and in short order Robert Gartner, Randy Pfaff and Larry Steele arrived in a car at the scene. The car was parked and as Gartner, Pfaff and Steele arrived, the confrontation had come to an end and the group of blacks was leaving in their car. Some words were exchanged between the three new arrivals and the departing blacks, and there was testimony that the departing car narrowly missed Gartner as he was standing near the edge of a street.</blockquote>

He was told by Perrine that the blacks had been harassing them and following their car and were going to meet them at the clubhouse. Shortly, Gartner, Pfaff and Steele produced rifles from somewhere and set them in the corner of the clubhouse. The group sat around drinking beer for awhile. A short time later Gartner, Pfaff and Steele took their rifles and went outside the clubhouse. Gartner, armed with a loaded rifle, proceeded a short distance north of the clubhouse near some bushes where he had a clear view of the public highway and the driveway leading into the front of the clubhouse. The area was well lighted by an external building light and a street light. Pfaff, also armed with a rifle, proceeded to a location further from the highway and to the rear of the clubhouse and stationed himself on the hood of an abandoned car. The jury could easily have concluded that Gartner was to stand guard in the event of a ‘frontal’ attack or approach by the blacks and Pfaff was to guard against an attack from the ‘rear.’ The testimony is unclear as to where Steele was at the time of the shooting but he definitely left the clubhouse armed with a rifle at about the same time Gartner and Pfaff left.</blockquote>

Someone from the clubhouse yelled, ‘Hey, get out of here,’ and Mack then backed the car out of the driveway and north on the paved road in preparation to proceed on south past the clubhouse. None of the blacks got out of the car and as the car was momentarily stopped on the paved road in preparation to proceed on south, Gartner fired a round from his position beside the road. Gartner was using a 7 mm bolt action Spanish rifle. As the car started to move south on the road, Gartner fired a second round. The first round was fired from a distance of about sixty-eight feet and the second from one hundred and forty-seven feet. The first round hit the undercarriage of the car, passed through three metal parts of the undercarriage, hit the frame and disintegrated. The second round was higher and hit the rear window molding, shattered the rear window and lodged in the head of a passenger, Marlon Matthews. Matthews died the next day. Two <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>others were also injured by the second round, apparently from flying glass, bits of metal or small separate fragments of the second bullet that killed Matthews.</blockquote>

The rationale of this rule is that under the Crimes Code, involuntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of murder and thus is a permissible verdict when murder is charged. The court erred in its instruction because when an offense is a permissible verdict, the defendant is entitled to have the jury informed of its authority to return such a verdict. <em>Commonwealth v.

It is my general view that the decision as to which degree of homicide to charge is and should be á matter of prosecutorial discretion, and the exercise of that discretion should not be frustrated by this Court’s imposition of unwarranted jury instruction requirements. This general view is subject only to the qualification that where there exists a factual dispute as to an element of the greater offense, which element is <em>not </em>within the lesser offense, then and only then should there be a right to an instruction on the lesser <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>offense. Thus if the greater offense is comprised of elements A, B, and C and the lesser of elements B and C, a factual dispute going to element A would give rise to the right to an instruction on the lesser offense. I adopt this qualification, because the United States Supreme Court has suggested that the failure to so instruct in such a case might present serious constitutional questions. <em>See Keeble v. United States, </em><a href="/us/412/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="412 U.S. 205" data-case-ids="6171860" data-case-paths="/us/412/0205-01">412 U.S. 205</a>, <a href="/us/412/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="412 U.S. 205" data-case-ids="6171860" data-case-paths="/us/412/0205-01">93 S.Ct. 1993</a>, <a href="/us/412/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="412 U.S. 205" data-case-ids="6171860" data-case-paths="/us/412/0205-01">36 L.Ed.2d 844</a> (1973). It should be noted that this approach is not equivalent to the “rational basis” approach. Under this latter approach, a jury instruction on the lesser offense would be required whenever there was evidence going to elements B and C, regardless of whether element A was factually in dispute.</p>

I am eagerly awaiting the majority’s development of this concept to ascertain whether a judge, in a bench trial or on a plea of guilt, will be given a similar power (i. e., a mercy-dispensing power). If this power is not given to the judge where he undertakes the role of the fact-finder, then the constitutional problems would abound. If he is conferred with the same power, then the legislatively defined grades of homicide will be rendered meaningless.</p>
