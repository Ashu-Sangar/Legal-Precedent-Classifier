It has been accurately stated by a recent commentator that “[i]n the vast majority of cases . . . four basic requirements must be met before a court can issue a writ of prohibition. First, the court or tribunal against which the writ is directed must be exercising judicial or quasi-judicial power. Second, the exercise of this power must be an extension of jurisdiction unauthorized by law. Third, the exercise of power must threaten injury to the petitioner. Last, the threatened injury must be one for which no other adequate remedy exists.” Comment, <em>supra, </em>at 494. In the case at bar there is doubtless a threatened injury to petitioner, but none of the other three requirements for a writ of prohibition is present.</p>

Unfortunately, however, the taking of this case represents a clear distortion of our law and historic tradition in Pennsylvania, for no lower court or tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction or taken any egregiously offensive action; indeed, the basic trouble here is that no lower tribunal has been involved at all.

The current proportion of appeals, however, is even greater. A newly popular idea that appeal is a usual part of the judicial process moves more cases into the higher courts. In an earlier day, most citizens considered appeals to constitute an esoteric upper level in litigation, to be employed only when large amounts of money, serious injustices, or bitter disputes were involved. Today nearly every loser at the lower level thinks about appealing.”</blockquote>
