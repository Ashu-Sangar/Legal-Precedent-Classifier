    <p id="b89-12" data-blocks='[["BL_89.13",89,[178,1381,1151,359]]]'>The dispute in this case arose as a result of the appointment of a temporary receiver with control over the business interests of the appellants. The Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County appointed the receiver on petition of the appellee as secured creditor of the appellants. The appellants argue that the court erred in appointing the receiver under the facts and circumstances of this case.</p>

In order to secure funding for the purchase of the electronic equipment and to cover operational costs, the appellants entered into an agreement with the appellee whereby the appellee loaned money to the appellants in exchange for a security interest in the appellants’ inventory and assignment of the appellants’ accounts receivable. In August of 1974, the appellee became concerned with appellants’ ability to discharge their loan obligations. On September 30, 1974, at <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>the request of the appellee, a temporary receiver was appointed (pursuant to Rule 1533 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure) to control the assets of various enterprises owned by the appellants. After subsequent modifications of the appointment, the appellants appealed to this Court challenging the propriety of the receiver’s appointment. While this appeal was pending, the receivership was terminated after the parties settled a replevin action on September 18, 1975. The replevin action was not instituted by the appellee until the court had denied a permanent receiver, finding that the appellee had an adequate remedy at law based on the security interests.</p>
    <p id="b90-4" data-blocks='[["BL_90.5",90,[223,957,1158,204]]]'>The appellee first argues that since the receivership has been terminated the issue of the propriety of the receiver’s appointment is moot. We do not agree. Rule 1533 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure provides:</p>

In that rule it has been determined that liability on the bond may not rest on any cause unconnected with the propriety of the decree, such as mootness; such liability must rest on the merits. <em>See Romano v.

The same reasoning applies in construing Rule 1533. A decision on the merits is required in order to determine whether the appointment of a receiver was proper or improper.

Since the appellants did not agree to waive their right to challenge the propriety of the receiver’s appointment, this Court should not effectuate a waiver for them.</p>

In the case at bar, appellee did not request the receivership as relief ancillary to any action for ultimate disposition of the property. Its replevin action, as earlier noted, was not filed until after the court refused to appoint a permanent receiver. The record shows that in every instance prior to the order of January 10, 1975, appellee asked only that a receiver be appointed in order that rights of appellee and other creditors in appellants’ property might be protected and ascertained. It is clear in the record that no other action was being brought, no relief sought other than the receivership. Moreover, it is difficult to see how a receivership was necessary to ascertain appellee’s rights in appellants’ property, inasmuch as it had from the beginning a perfected security interest in all appellants’ inventory, equipment, and accounts receivable, and no other secured party appears in the record.</p>
