At the April 12 hearing Wood and Shultz filed preliminary objections to the complaint. Also at that hearing McNeely alleged that Wood and Shultz had been threatening and harassing the electors who had signed the complaint for their removal.

At this point, the court stated that it was treating this proceeding as an action for removal of all three supervisors.

Each of the checks transferring the funds was signed by Shultz, who was secretary and treasurer for the Township, and by either Wood or McNeely. At the January 27 meeting of the Board, the supervisors adopted a resolution to borrow $40,000 for six months.

They obtained a $50,000 tax anticipation loan due at the end of the year. No sinking fund was created when the loan was taken. Part of the loan was used to repay the $23,000 transferred from special funds. When the loan became due, $50,000 was transferred from special funds to repay the loan, again without any resolution authorizing the transfer.</p>

Here the injunction, which was to prevent Wood and Shultz from contacting and possibly harassing the electors who signed the complaint, was entirely separate from and collateral to the relief requested in the complaint, removal of Wood and Shultz for failure to perform their duties. An appeal from the issuance of a special injunction is authorized by statute. Act of February 14, 1866, P.L. 28, § 1, 12 P.S. § 1101 (1953); <em>Rosenzweig v.

    <p id="b106-4" data-blocks='[["BL_106.6",106,[266,446,1161,846]]]'>Wood and Shultz argue that the court erred in admitting an amended complaint, which was filed at the April 21, 1976 hearing, nine days after preliminary objections were filed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> See generally, Pa.R.Civ.P. 1028(c) (“A party may file an amended pleading as of course within ten (10) days after service of a copy of preliminary objections.”). They argue that the amended complaint should not have been admitted because it was not recirculated. This argument is without merit. The amended complaint was a verbatim copy of the original complaint. The only change was that a new affidavit, with the same wording as the first affidavit, was executed before a different notary, in an effort to eliminate any possible irregularities in the manner in which the affidavit was executed. We see no basis for requiring the electors to sign the complaint again before a new affidavit may be executed.</p>

This argument reflects a misunderstanding of the hearsay objection to the evidence offered. The objection was not that what these electors were told when they signed the complaint constituted inadmissible hearsay. If the electors themselves had appeared in court and testified as to what they were told when they signed the complaint, this testimony would have been admissible to prove their state of mind. Indeed, those electors who did appear in court were allowed to testify as to what they were told when they signed the complaint. However, Wood and Shultz wanted to testify about statements made to them by the electors some time after the electors signed the original complaint. These statements were out of court declarations, offered for the truth of the matter asserted, for which there is no exception to the hearsay rule.</p>
