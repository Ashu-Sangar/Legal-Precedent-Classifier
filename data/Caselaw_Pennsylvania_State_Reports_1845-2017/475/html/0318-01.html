The manufacturing process is one of compressing and purifying atmospheric air, cooling the air to a temperature sufficiently low so that it will pass to a liquid state, then distilling the liquid air into its constituent liquid elements; as a final step, the liquid oxygen and other elements are conducted through a heat exchanger where they are vaporized into gases.</p>

For customers having the greatest demand, such as steel manufacturers, an entire air separation plant is furnished on-site. To serve customers at the other end of the spectrum, the small or sporadic users, Air Products provides returnable gas cylinders filled at one of its own plants. For sales of intermediate quantities, appellee installs at the buyer’s location a complex of equipment termed a “customer station”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> This appeal relates to Air Products’ use of the equipment comprising these customer stations.</p>

The liquid conversion system feeds gas directly into the customer’s plant and operates automatically whenever the customer draws upon it; it works by a process which is essentially the application of heat to the liquid, the heating medium being either steam, electricity or the ambient air, for at standard temperatures the product will vaporize. Supplied by tank truck deliveries of the liquid, the customer station thus furnishes the buyer a convenient point-of-use source of supply of the finished product, all prior steps in the production process having been accomplished at Air Products’ plant.</p>

Air Products produces these gases by separating the constituent elements of air and purifying them to the levels required by industry. There <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>are some large industrial customers, such as steel manufacturers, who use so much of these gases that Air Products finds it practical to install on-site plants to carry out this entire production process. The Commonwealth concedes that these plants are equipment engaged in the manufacture of industrial gases. For small customers, Air Products provides bottled gas kept under high pressure in relatively small storage containers, which is released by the customer as needed.</p>
    <p id="b359-4" data-blocks='[["BL_359.5",359,[172,790,1152,631]]]'>The equipment involved in this case, however, is of a third type, used to supply Air Products’ middle-sized customers. These customers use more gas than can safely and economically be delivered in compressed gaseous form but not enough to be able to use full on-site plants economically. Air Products solves this problem by providing these customers with gas, for example oxygen, purified in Air Products’ own plants. This oxygen is provided in a liquid state in large storage tanks. Air Products also supplies equipment for warming the liquefied oxygen in order to return it to the gaseous state at a temperature and pressure at which it is useable by the customer.</p>
    <p id="b359-5" data-blocks='[["BL_359.6",359,[173,1445,1152,900]],["BL_360.1",360,[277,299,1158,203]]]'>These bulk storage systems — the tanks holding liquefied oxygen plus the equipment for evaporating the liquid — were developed to store quantities of oxygen too large for storage in ordinary gas bottles. The customers who use these systems find it uneconomical to manufacture purified oxygen from the air on site; therefore they must store purified oxygen at their plants until ready to use it. Assuming that conversion of oxygen from the liquid to the gaseous state is one step of a manufacturing process, it is clear that Air Products and its customers choose to carry out this step at the customer’s plant rather than at Air Products’ own facilities because this arrangement allows the customer to store more oxygen at its plant than it could economically store if required to obtain gaseous oxygen from Air Products. Thus the equipment is designed primarily to store for use that which has already been produced at Air Products’ facilities. The tanks and evaporating equipment to convert liquid <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>oxygen to gaseous oxygen are provided only because on-site storage of oxygen in its final, gaseous form is impractical.

    <p id="b360-5" data-blocks='[["BL_360.7",360,[271,915,1161,681]]]'>The majority’s fears are unfounded. Where a manufacturing process involves several steps, a manufacturer must often hold intermediate products pending completion of the process. The equipment used to hold the intermediate products will have a storage function, but it will have this function only as part of the manufacturing process in which it is primarily involved. It is there to assist the manufacturer in the process of manufacturing. It is not meant to store inventory for direct use by the customer, as Air Products uses the equipment in this case. If taxation of equipment is analyzed not <em>in vacuo </em>but in view of the relevant business and industrial environment, the absurd results the majority fears will be avoided.</p>
