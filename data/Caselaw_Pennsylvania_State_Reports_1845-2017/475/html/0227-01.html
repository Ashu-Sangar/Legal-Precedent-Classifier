Vaughn, Sr., was arrested and charged with homicide for the slaying of one Jay Zarilla, and with aggravated assault and battery against appellant’s wife. Both charges arose from the same episode.</p>
    <p id="b259-8" data-blocks='[["BL_259.8",259,[193,840,1152,575]]]'>Both the homicide and the assault and battery charges were scheduled to be tried on August 19, 1974, in York County Criminal Court. The cases were severed when appellant sought a protective order to prohibit his wife from testifying against him in the homicide case. Appellant did not request the severance. He did, however, request that both cases be continued to the October, 1974, term of criminal court. On October 29, 1974, the case charging aggravated assault and battery was called to trial. During the trial, the victim (appellant’s wife) fainted, and the Court ordered a mistrial.</p>

When called to trial, the case was continued at the request of the prosecution. Appellant was again tried on the aggravated assault and battery charge on March 24, 1975, and was acquitted.</p>
    <p id="b259-10" data-blocks='[["BL_259.10",259,[191,1784,1154,583]]]'>On May 2, 1975, appellant filed an application pursuant to Pa.R.Cr.P. 1100 for dismissal of the homicide complaint, alleging that the prosecution had failed to commence trial on that charge within 270 days as required by Rule 1100. (Because the complaint against appellant was filed prior to July 1, 1974, the relevant period of time under Rule 1100(a)(1) is 270 days.) A hearing was held on May 9, 1975, and the application was denied. Appellant’s trial on the homicide charge commenced on May 12, 1975, and on May 16, 1975, he was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Post-verdict motions were denied and this appeal followed.</p>

Our review of the record confirms counsel’s assertion that the Rule 1100 claim was made in the written post-verdict motions. Appellant’s counsel stated at oral argument on the post-verdict motions that the effect of the Superior Court decisions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em><a href="/pa-super/239/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="239 Pa.

Following the court’s order denying post-verdict motions, appellant filed a “Petition for Stay of the Order and Reargument,” so that our decisions in <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Mayfield </em>could be considered. This petition was denied. <em>Shelton </em>and <em>May-field </em>were ultimately decided by us on October 8, 1976. Under these circumstances, we conclude that appellant has preserved the issue and we will therefore consider its merits.</p>

    <p id="b262-5" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[243,534,1159,1055]]]'>The time period which elapsed between appellant’s arrest on June 12, 1974, and the filing of the application to dismiss on May 2, 1975, equalled 324 days. Appellant concedes that the delay in commencement of trial that occurred from August 19, 1974, until the October term of criminal court resulted from his request for a continuance. We need not now decide whether the delay occasioned by appellant’s request, and therefore excludable under Rule 1100(d)(2), extends from August 19, 1974, until the <em>commencement </em>of the October term of criminal court or to its <em>conclusion. </em>The October, 1974, term of criminal court in York County commenced on October 23, 1974 and concluded November 1, 1974. The period of time from August 19,1974, (the date on which appellant requested a continuance until the October term of court) to November 1, 1974, (the <em>last </em>day in that term) totals 74 days. Deducting 30 days from that period pursuant to Rule 1100(d)(2) leaves 44 days excludable as a result of appellant’s request for a continuance. Three hundred twenty-four days minus 44 days equals 280, still beyond the 270 day maximum prescribed by Rule 1100.</p>

During this period according to the prosecution, appellant was “unavailable” for trial on the homicide charge because he was being tried on the assault charge, and to also try him on the homicide charge would result in his being subjected to two trials before the same jury panel. Excluding this period, according to the prosecution, results in a period of time from arrest to the filing of the application for dismissal well within the requirements of the rule.</p>

The order did not preclude her from testifying in the assault case, however, and because of the order, the trial court concluded that the cases should not be tried together. The trial court therefore ordered that the charges be severed. At no time did defense counsel request a severance. The prosecution then elected to proceed with the assault case, apparently believing that the case against appellant was stronger on the assault charge. At the same time the prosecution concluded that it could not properly bring both cases to trial at the same term of criminal court (and before the same jury panel) without prejudicing appellant or without creating a serious issue which could form the basis of an appeal.</p>

See Comment, Pa.R.Cr.P. 1100.
