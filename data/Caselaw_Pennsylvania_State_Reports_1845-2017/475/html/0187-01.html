Judge Van der Voort, in an <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>opinion joined by President Judge Watkins, indicated the award should be vacated and the case remanded for appointment of new arbitrators, because they felt prior representation of a party by an arbitrator should require disqualification of that arbitrator upon objection by the opposing party, with no showing of actual bias required.

To so interfere — as the majority does here — is to impose an unnecessary and unwise additional burden on an already overburdened judicial system.</p>
