It provided that the jurisdiction of the several orphans’ courts shall extend to and embrace trustees who are accountable in any way for the property of a decedent. The Act of June 14, 1836, P. L. 630, awarding to the courts of common pleas jurisdiction over assignments by deed, will or otherwise, excepted from its provisions “trusts created by will, and vested in executors and administrators, either by the words of the will, or by the provisions or operations of law. ...” By the Act of June 16, 1836, P.

Both groups are constituents of City government but they are independent of each other. Judge Sharswood there said, the directors are “a board dissociated from the general government of the city.” It performs a part of the city’s duties and as such, could be considered a part of the City government, but its functions are apart from the general governmental powers exercised by the City itself.</p>

L. 581, does not authorize the Mayor, as Mayor, to assert the power here requested. The Act provides that the Mayor may “appoint three competent persons to examine, without notice, the accounts of any city department, trust, officer or employee. ...” Though the Board of City Trusts is nominated in the Act of 1869 as the agent of the City for the purpose of executing the trusts, the Act of 1919 in Article III, Sec. 1, as amended, provides explicitly what shall be considered the departments of the City. Judge Sharswood’s opinion so ably <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>demonstrates the complete severance of the Board of City Trusts as an administrative agency from the other agencies of City government that we need not dwell on this point at length. To contend that the Act of 1919 intended to invade the heretofore exclusive jurisdiction of the orphans’ court and subject the Board of City Trusts to a new supervision by reason of a statute which vested special powers in one of its members because of an official capacity he holds in another respect, would be to interpret that statute as amending the Act of 1869 as well as the Acts relating to the jurisdiction of the orphans’ court. The legislature itself indicated no intent to “amend, extend” or add to the earlier statutes as the Act of 1919 omits reference to the Act of 1869, to say nothing of the failure of compliance with constitutional methods of amendment. The city charter does not support any such conclusion; on the contrary, without elaborating in unnecessary detail, the opposite result clearly appears.</p>
    <p id="b583-3" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[167,1388,1154,639]]]'>While we recognize that the Act of 1919 does not place any concurrent power over testamentary trusts in the Mayor, which would interfere with the jurisdiction exclusively vested in the orphans’ court, nevertheless some effect must be given to the city’s right under that Act to inspect the books, papers and documents as prayed for in this petition. That right on the part of the city, through the Mayor, should be exercised through an application to the orphans’ court. We thus sustain the jurisdiction heretofore confided exclusively to the orphans’ court and make the Act of 1919, through the word “trusts,” a workable Act.</p>

We now consider how far the Mayor in his capacity as a member of the Board may force his fellow members to submit the trust records and documents to his examination, inspection and audit. In approaching this question we cannot disregard the fact that the Mayor is the duly elected execu<a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>tive of one of the beneficiaries, the City, and that he represents not only himself as an individual but to a certain extent the citizens of Philadelphia who constitute the beneficiaries of all the trusts. When elected to office he automatically assumes his position in the Board of City Trusts and it is his right and duty to have laid before him all the evidence necessary to successfully guide him as a member. By reason of his representative capacity, the request from such a person has an added force. In <em>Brown v. Brancato, </em><a href="/pa/321/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="321 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="1165815" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0054-01">321 Pa. 54</a>, we stated, “They [the Directors] possess both an individual and a common official interest in the preservation of the trust property.” To withhold the means of knowledge concerning that property is to withhold the pOAver to exercise the duty of preservation.</p>

This right may be exercised through a request to his fellow members as was done in this case and, if his request is refused, he may apply to the orphans’ court for relief.
