    <p id="b278-9" data-blocks='[["BL_278.15",278,[287,1416,1151,529]]]'>In this case indictments were returned against James, Arthur, Alfred, Paul and Philip Bruno, and Anthony Orlando, charging them with the murder of Dominick Perna, Frank Fiorelli, John Galosky and Andrew Kostishiun. All the defendants were acquitted save Philip Bruno who was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter on each indictment. Sentences of imprisonment for terms of six to twelve years, to be served consecutively, were imposed. A new trial was denied and judgments and sentences followed. Hence these appeals.</p>
