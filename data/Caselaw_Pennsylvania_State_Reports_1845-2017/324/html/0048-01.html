Smith, in the Court of Quarter Sessions of Allegheny County, charged with larceny, entering a building with intent to commit a felony and receiving stolen goods. Judge Smith was erroneously informed by a police officer that Sacco’s accomplices had been discharged by the magistrate. Without further verification of the facts by the magistrate’s docket, the Judge accused Magistrate David Turets of “fixing,” and issued a subpoena for him. The court also ordered that charges be preferred against those who, apparently, had been discharged. Magistrate Turets, being questioned by Judge Smith as to his disposition of these cases, en<a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>deavored to explain that three of the defendants had been held for juvenile court, one for criminal court, one had been discharged for insufficient evidence and another had been held over for further hearing. Judge Smith censured him for not demanding bail from those remanded to juvenile court who had pleaded guilty, for sending them to a court without jurisdiction for trial, and for holding one of the defendants without requiring bail for further hearing. The Judge, however, stated that he had no suspicion or reason to believe the Magistrate was influenced by bribery or other corrupt motive.</p>

The Judge also stated he had information that these practices existed not only with this particular magistrate but with others as well. In fact, the only other statements to the judge concerning previous discharges of men charged with felony were of matters occurring a year before, when three men accused of robbery were released by Magistrate Turets. Other charges, relied upon by Judge Smith, are so indefinite and vague as not to merit consideration.</p>

Elsewhere in the constitution, provision is made for the establishment of justices of the peace or aldermen for all other counties (Article Y, Sec. 11). In the City of Pittsburgh, in addition to such justices of the peace, by the Act of March 7, 1901, P. L. 20, Article XYI, Sec. 1, as amended by the Act of Apx‘il 13, 1927, P.

Within the sphere of their powers they have all the attributes of legally constituted courts of justice and are independent of any other tribunal except insofar as their action is reviewable on appeal: <em>Bowman’s Case, </em>supra. Generally magistrates and justices of the peace exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction but, in the City of Pittsburgh, the police magistrates’ courts have criminal jurisdiction only. Section 1 of the Act of 1891 provides that they shall have “full and complete jurisdiction, power and authority to receive and take criminal informations . . . accusing any person or persons of the commission of any felony or misdemeanor . . . administer oaths or hold preliminary hearings . . . and to commit to jail, bind over for trial ... or discharge such accused person or persons as the evidence produced at such hearing or hearings may warrant.” By Section 3 of the same <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>Act they are empowered to punish certain minor offenses and, by section 4, have jurisdiction of suits for penalties.</p>

When the magistrate believes that probable cause to hold the defendant has not been proven, he may discharge him; otherwise it is his duty to hold the prisoner for court or grand jury. But it is his discretion, his judgment, which must be exercised, for he is the officer entrusted by the law with the function of rendering a preliminary decision. In its performance he must be free from all external influences and, so long as he renders judgment in good faith, he is accountable to no one. If the Commonwealth deems itself aggrieved by his decision it may bring the matter again before any other officer empowered to hold preliminary hearings: Valentine, Subordinate Courts of Pennsylvania, page 1133; <em>Com. v. Sharpless, </em><a href="/pa-super/31/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="31 Pa. Super. 96" data-case-ids="864435" data-case-paths="/pa-super/31/0096-01">31 Pa.

In the conduct of these hearings, magistrates have the power to adjourn and to demand security for appearances at a future date in order that they may fully investigate the matter before them. <em>Com. v.

    <p id="b82-6" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[274,1682,1151,693]],["BL_83.1",83,[173,326,1152,1074]]]'>Where the prisoner is held for court the magistrate must admit him to bail (Act of June 16, 1891, P.

Superior Ct. 35</a>, 40) except in those cases where bail is expressly prohibited by the Constitution or the Act of 1891, namely, manslaughter, arson, rape, mayhem, sodomy, buggery, robbery and burglary. If a magistrate imposes bail it cannot be excessive under the Constitution of this State and the United States. However, as the purpose of bail is to assure the appearance of the defendant (1 Wharton, Criminal Procedure, Sec. 117) if bail is imposed it should be sufficient: <em>Respublica v. Burns, </em><a href="/yeates/1/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Yeates 370" data-case-ids="6775245" data-case-paths="/yeates/1/0369-01">1 Yeates 370</a>. No statute in this State makes it mandatory on <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>a magistrate to require bail even where the defendant is held for court or tbe grand jury, although this unquestionably is the universal practice. They may be compelled to require bail where their failure to do so amounts to a gross abuse of discretion: <em>Com. v. Bartilson, </em><a href="/pa/85/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="85 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="440528" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0482-01">85 Pa. 482</a>. Since the circumstances of individual defendants vary, considerable freedom must be allowed the magistrate in the performance of this function. Others may differ from his judgment, but in its exercise he is not subject to criminal liability unless bad faith or corruption be shown. Malfeasance in office cannot be charged except for breach of a positive statutory duty or for the performance of a discretionary act with an improper or corrupt motive: <em>Com. v. Poet, </em>14 Cambria 50; <em>Wilson v. Com., </em>10 S. &amp; R. 373; 2 Wharton, Criminal Law, Secs. 1894, 1897. That a magistrate required no bail of defendants held for court, as in this case, without more, constitutes no offense nor violation of his duties of office, though it is a practice not to be recommended or encouraged.</p>

Of course, like other public officers, they are amenable to mandamus proceedings to compel them to perform their duties: Act of May 13,1925, P. L. 664, See. 1. In certain instances their decisions are reviewable on appeal, but otherwise they must be left free to exercise an independent judgment in the conduct of their office. They cannot be subjected to liability, civil or criminal, for any of their judicial acts, no matter how erroneous, so long as they act in good faith. The reasons are fully set forth in <em>Com. v. Cauffiel, </em><a href="/pa-super/79/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="79 Pa. Super. 596" data-case-ids="651750" data-case-paths="/pa-super/79/0596-01">79 Pa. Superior Ct. 596</a>, where a full citation of authority will be found. It was there stated: “If a judge of an inferior jurisdiction has the power under authority of law to hear and pass on cases, to which the particular offense belongs, the same reason requires that he should be protected from liability for erroneous action, which exempts <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>judges of superior or general jurisdiction from such liability. If judges properly expected to be most learned in the law can plead official exemption for their blunderings in the law, a fortiori those from whom less is to be expected should not be compelled to respond in damages for their mistakes honestly made.” See also <em>Com. v. Yerkes, </em><a href="/pa-super/86/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="86 Pa. Super. 5" data-case-ids="569654" data-case-paths="/pa-super/86/0005-01">86 Pa.

Superior tribunals cannot arrogate the power to publicly reprimand or censure these subordinate judicial officers with whose judgment or discretion they may differ. Nor do they have the power of direct regulation or control over them. Thus in <em>Bowman’s Case, </em>supra, where the Act of 1907, authorizing the Courts of Common Pleas to remove justices of the peace for cause, was declared unconstitutional, the court stated “Under all our constitutions a justice of the peace has been a constitutional officer, and by the eleventh section of the judiciary article of the present one, he is a judicial officer. The appellant was as much a judge, though in a limited sphere, as the judicial officer by whose decree the appellees would have him removed from office.”</p>

      <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>The ordinary conception of the duties of a grand jury was to guard the rights and liberties of the people; it was so understood at its inception. Because of the method by which its deliberations are conducted and the secrecy surrounding them, it is a particularly suitable body to investigate misconduct of public officials and public evils. These inquisitorial powers were recognized as early as 1791 in this Commonwealth: Addison’s Reports (Pa. 1791), App. 71. In some states the power of <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>investigation is virtually unlimited, and the grand jury, of its own motion, may originate and conduct them: 2 Wharton, Criminal Procedure (10th ed.), Sec. 1268, and see <em>Blair v. United States, </em><a href="/us/250/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="250 U.S. 273" data-case-ids="3684300" data-case-paths="/us/250/0273-01">250 U. S. 273</a>. But in Pennsylvania the freedom of the <em>grand </em>jury is very much restricted: <em>Blair v. United States, </em><a href="/us/250/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="250 U.S. 273" data-case-ids="3684300" data-case-paths="/us/250/0273-01">supra;</a> Dession &amp; Cohen, The Inquisitional Functions of Grand Juries, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20Yale%20L.J.%20687" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="41 Yale L.J. 687">41 Yale L. J. 687</a>. Our courts, mindful of the danger that this body might, if unrestrained and unguided, encroach upon the very liberties which it was created to protect, have imposed definite limitations upon its investigatorial powers. An investigation by a grand jury directed by the court, involves all the powers and incidents necessary to a complete inquiry into the subject matter in charge. The jury may, through the court, subpoena books, papers, witnesses, and subject them to examination. Its powers are vastly broader than a committing magistrate’s. Its concern being of things rather than individuals,’ the scope of its investigation is very wide, including all the ramifications of the subject investigated and extending to all who may be brought within the field of culpability. Thus with a definite person to begin with it may spread as a fan and include many others. Therefore, it has been considered all important by this court that a grand jury should have no power to initiate an investigation. <em>Lloyd &amp; Carpenter’s Case, </em>3 Clark 188; <em>In re Alleged Extortion Cases, </em><a href="/citations/?q=29%20Pa.%20C.%20538" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="29 Pa. C. 538">29 Pa. C. C. 538</a>. It may do so only when charged by the court and then under prescribed limitations: <em>The Grand Jury as an Investigating Body of Public Officials, </em>10 St. John’s Law Rev. 219, 221. The power can be exercised only upon proper occasion. The grand jury is an arm of the criminal court and criminal acts alone must be the foundation of its deliberations. When a court orders an investigation it acts under its official responsibility and must answer for the step taken when it is not justified in the exercise of sound judicial discretion but is the result of an arbitrary capricious exercise of power. <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>

They requested the court to order an investigation by the grand jury through compulsory process for witnesses, but made no formal presentment. The court, in denying the request, called attention to the Bill of Rights, which provides that the people shall be secure in their persons, houses and property from unreasonable search and seizure; that the accused has a right to be heard by himself and counsel and to meet his accusers and witnesses face to face (to which may be added that he has a right to know who his prosecutor might be and to have some one on whom responsibility might be fixed for the action if it is unlawful).

If Magistrate Turets had admitted the commission of an offense the regular process of the law was ample to deal with it. The Judge, if he felt that a criminal act had taken place, should have turned the case over to the district attorney for action. As it was admitted there was no bad faith and the mis<a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>take was an error of judgment, neither the district attorney nor the grand jury under such conditions could impose criminal liability. We have discussed the matter of bail and need not further dwell on it. The most important consideration was the propriety of the disposition of these cases by the magistrate, and that involved the exercise of judicial discretion as to the proper course to be pursued. Unless there was criminal bad faith it was not the function of Judge Smith, a judge of the quarter sessions, to supervise or criticize that disposition, nor was it the province of the grand jury to embark upon an investigation criminal in nature merely because they or the Judge may have differed from the magistrate’s judgment. The use of the grand jury as an inquisitorial body is to be limited to the investigation of criminal conduct and is not to be extended to the review of judicial discretion.</p>

Our power to issue a writ of prohibition has never been doubted. Such a writ is proper not only wherever a court acts outside of its jurisdiction but also when there is an abuse of jurisdiction. As stated in High, Extraordinary Legal Remedies (2d ed.) 604, “The object of the writ being to restrain subordinate judicial tribunals of every kind from exceeding their jurisdiction, its use in all proper cases should be upheld and encouraged, since it is of vital importance to the due administration of justice, that every tribunal vested with judicial functions should be confined strictly to the exercise of those powers with which it has been by law entrusted.” As previously pointed out the circumstances which prompted the present investigation were such as to render it totally unauthorized and an abuse of discretion upon the part of the court below. It has resulted in the disruption of the police magisterial system, the seizure of records and other matters. The parties investigated are subjected to unjustified public suspicion. No other legal procedure than through the grant of a writ of prohibition is open to halt these apparently fruitless and pointless investigations, entailing great expense to the Commonwealth and inconvenience to the public at large. The authority of the district attorney and the grand jury to further pursue their investigations falls with that of the court which directed it in the first instance.</p>

Legal writers and historians disagree as to the time at which the grand jury first appears as an English institution. Some attribute its introduction to the Saxon Kings, particularly to Ethelred in the 10th century, and others to William the Conqueror, or his followers, in the 11th century. The English grand jury, whether of Norman or Saxon origin, appears at its inception to have been purely an accusatorial body without power to conduct wide investigations of the conduct of officials. According to Braeton, who wrote in the time of Henry II, each hundred, which was a subdivision of local government, selected twelve knights or freemen, who were to appear before the itinerant judges in eyre appointed by the king to <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>administer his laws. This meeting of the grand jury was held secretly. The judges presented to the jurors a list of crimes and offenses against the crown, taking each offense separately, and asking whether or not the jurors knew of any man in their own hundred who had committed this offense. The jurors replied upon the basis of their personal knowledge. It was within the discretion of the judges to determine whether or not the accusations by the jury were well founded and to interrogate the jurors as to the extent of their knowledge.</p>
      <p id="b85-6" data-blocks='[["BL_85.2",85,[190,1311,1152,495]]]'>Probably in the reign of Edward III the county grand jury or county inquest was inagurated. This grand jury did not immediately replace the jury for the hundreds, but co-existed with it. It likewise consisted of twelve knights or freeholders, and its jurisdiction was limited to the county rather than to the hundred. This inquest, because of its wider scope, gradually supplanted the hundred inquest and is probably the direct antecedent of our own grand jury. It was likewise limited to the making of accusations in answer to the questions propounded by the itinerant judges but it seems also to have sat as a petit or traverse jury to try the offenders against whom it made presentments.</p>
