As “for injury wrongfully done to the person” the action “must be brought within two years from the time when the injury was done” our inquiry must be, when was the “injury wrongfully done”? There was breach of defendant’s statutory duty to furnish a reasonably safe place to work during each and every day, from the time in 1928 when he resumed working on the grinding machine, to the time when he ceased. That period was continuous; the breach of statutory duty was continuous; it operated from the first working day to the last and, in dealing with the effect said to have resulted, must be treated as one tort, as one invasion of plaintiff’s legally protected interest in bodily security. Similar breach of the employer’s duty has been so regarded : <em>Fritz v.

If on the retrial of the case, the evidence establishes that plaintiff’s employment stopped prior to March 28th, as defendant contends, his action was not brought within two years from the time when he was subjected to defendant’s breach of duty and he will not be entitled to recover for the obvious reason that he did not bring suit within the time specified by the legislature. If, however, the evidence shows that the wrong continued until April 5th, as he contends, his suit is in time. To recover, it will of course be necessary for him to show that the disease was contracted on or prior to April 5, 1930, even if not then fully matured. In referring to the evidence, in passing, we may add that it is immaterial, in dealing with the point under consideration, that the first symptoms of the disease which manifested themselves in March, 1930, were misunderstood to indicate pleurisy, if they were so misunderstood; the ultimate fact to be determined is whether between March 28th and April 5, 1930, plaintiff was suffering with any disease caused by defendant’s requiring or permitting him to work in the conditions described above; if it now appears that as a result he was then suffering with incipient silicosis, even though it began prior to March 28th and matured afterward, he is entitled to recover all the resulting damages of which he can offer proof down to the time of trial as in other cases.</p>

It is well settled, as was said in <em>Moore v.

As some of those cases show, the application of the rule is not confined to violation of professional duty, but applies to breach of duty imposed by statute. The time when the injury has been wrongfully inflicted, when the cause of action accrues, and from which the limitation period begins, in actions of the class to which this belongs, is when the breach of duty to provide a reasonably <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>safe working place occurs. If the relation is continuous, as in that of master and servant, and the default is likewise continuous until the cumulative effect produces disability in the form óf occupational disease, total or partial, the master’s failure to perform his duty, as we said above, is regarded as a single wrong continuing so long as the employment continues. Such wrong must therefore be redressed by action brought within two years and not thereafter from the time when the employment terminates. It is conceivable that this may in some cases be a hardship but it is one which the court cannot correct. The subject might very properly engage the attention of the legislature, as it has in many other states that have included occupational diseases as compensable under Workmen’s Compensation Acts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The foreman directed him to return to work, that the dust was ‘doing him no harm.’ These misleading and concededly erroneous instructions caused plaintiff to continue in his employment until such time as he was unable to labor further.

Generally such assurance by an employer rebuts the charge of the contributory negligence, as the cases cited by plaintiff show <em>(Fritz v. Elk Tanning Co., </em><a href="/pa/258/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="258 Pa. 180" data-case-ids="1035050" data-case-paths="/pa/258/0180-01">258 Pa. 180</a>, 187, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.%20958" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="101 A. 958">101 A. 958</a>). All that we can now say is that the ruling appears not to have affected the result: the statement was made, as we understand it, before the employment terminated, before the wrongful injury was completed, on March 18th or April 5th. If on the re-trial the matter is developed the learned court below will doubtless consider it in the light of the rules governing fraud or concealment in such cases: see <em>Schwab v. </em>Cornell, <a href="/pa/306/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="306 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="1136858" data-case-paths="/pa/306/0536-01">306 Pa. 536</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.%20449" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="160 A. 449">160 A. 449</a>.</p>

Well, during the grinding, the dust would fly into my nose, ears, mouth, over my shoulders, and would settle there a quarter of an inch thick. Q. Where would this dust come from? A. From the steel and from the grinding wheel. Q. When you refer to the grinding wheel, do you mean the abrasive wheel ? A. Yes. Q. How thick would the dust be around the place where you were working? A. In the place where I stood, the dust would fall for about a half foot high. Q. Would the dust stay on the ground or go into the air or what? A. Well, the dust would be driven up in the air and then come down again, and be taken up again and come down again.”</p>
