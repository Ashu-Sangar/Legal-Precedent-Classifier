The court ordered partition and appointed a master to conduct the proceedings, dividing the land among the heirs if possible, if not, to value it and report. From this order an appeal was taken by defendants, which was non-prossed. The master’s preliminary report dividing the estate into six equal purparts was approved nisi by the court after exceptions filed thereto had been dismissed. A second appeal to this Court was taken from the order confirming the master’s report and it was affirmed. Three of the defendants jointly made bids for all purparts above the valuation and they were awarded to them by the master. The bidders made no effort to comply with the award, whereupon the master and counsel for plaintiffs petitioned the court to tax their fees as costs. The defendants protested the counsel fees, but the court taxed them in the sum of $2500, together with a master’s fee of &lt;$2000.</p>
    <p id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.4",392,[282,1270,1150,580]]]'>Thereafter the master presented what is termed an interlocutory report setting forth the award of the purparts to the three bidders, with a calculation of owelty, taxes, liens, charges and costs. This report was confirmed nisi, and, exceptions having been filed as to the calculations, the court sustained most of them and referred the report back to the master for further consideration, with the suggestion that additional testimony be taken to clarify the record concerning the exceptions. As the proceedings had been pending since 1931, the master also was ordered to close them promptly.</p>

The master reported this agreement in a petition and asked for a rule upon the parties to show cause why one of the properties of the estate, embracing three of the six purparts, should not be sold for the payment of costs, including the master’s and counsel fees. Defendants resisted the rule, contending that the court had not made a final award of the purparts of the estate to the bidders, the master had not filed a supplemental report, and the <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>agreement recited <em>by </em>the latter was not complete because the guardian of the minor plaintiff had not joined therein. The court ordered the three bidders to file a stipulation of their inability to comply with their bids and consent to public sale of the designated property for the payment of costs, otherwise the rule to be made absolute. Exceptions to the order were dismissed.</p>

While these proceedings have not been carried through to a final partition, that alone might not defeat the claim. Here, after an extended legal contest, the parties amicably settled their difference; the services during the contest could not have been for the benefit of all, though the institution of the suit and services directly connected therewith may have been. The second reason for denying counsel fees is that the petition to tax them as costs was made by counsel themselves, not by the plaintiffs. As stated, these fees go to the plaintiffs and counsel have no standing to prosecute a claim for them. Their client, the adult plaintiff, contended against the fee and is an appellant here. The order directing the payment of the counsel fee as costs, taxed as it was, is ordered stricken off.</p>

He is an officer of the court exercising quasi judicial duties; his fee is properly taxable as costs in partition regardless of whether or not the action is adversary. See <em>Playford’s Est., <a href="/pa-super/7/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="7 Pa.

His fee is on a footing with the fee of the protlionotary and other court officers, and the cessation of the proceedings does not affect his right. A court of equity may, within its sound discretion, fix the fee of the master and assess it as the justice of the case requires: <em>Penna. Co. for Ins., etc., v. Phila. Nat.

Although the plaintiff in partition is nominally entitled to such costs, he merely is trustee to collect the costs and turn over the proceeds to the master, who may act if plaintiff does not.

It is a recognized principle of law that a court of equity has the power to make any necessary and proper order for the payment of costs.

If the property is taken by the heirs and there is no public sale, the costs may be charged against their proportionate shares of the valuation and the payment of costs may be enforced against the heirs or purchasers. While the present proceedings have not been discontinued and there is no decree finally disposing of the case, it is within the power of the court, with the record in the shape that it is, to decree payment of the costs and enforce that order in any appropriate way it deems proper as long as there is no abuse of discretion.</p>
