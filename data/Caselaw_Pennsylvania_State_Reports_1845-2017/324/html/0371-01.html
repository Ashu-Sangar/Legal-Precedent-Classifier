    <p id="b403-3" data-blocks='[["BL_403.4",403,[179,922,1153,585]]]'>Since the undertaking business cannot be engaged in without a license, and the State Board is the only agency empowered to issue licenses, it is appellants’ contention that under the Act of 1931 appellants, as old licensees, are entitled to a license for a branch office. The Board denied the application on the ground that it could issue but one license to a single applicant, to be used at one place. It did not assume jurisdiction; but, rather, held it had none. Appellants insist that it has jurisdiction and must exercise it. The question can only be answered by a consideration of the enabling Act.</p>

To a State Board was committed the power to grant or refuse licenses to engage in the business. The Act designates who may receive licenses and what places may be operated. Applicants are a partnership. This partnership wished to secure two licenses, one for each of two locations. It already had one on renewal for its principal establishment and sought a new one for a branch office. The Act authorizes the Board to issue only one license to one person and provides that only one place can be operated by the licensee. Though the partnership consisted of two persons who were duly licensed undertakers, when they made a joint application as a partnership for a license, it was to be treated as a single applicant and a license issued to it could be issued <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>for only one place. The Board consequently held the Act prevented it from granting to appellants, as a partnership, two licenses, a renewal and a branch license, to operate undertaking establishments at two different places. It did not attempt to broaden the scope of its legislatively-granted powers; its decision construed the limit of such powers.</p>

Appellants requested the Board to issue a license to them. The Board had the exclusive power to issue licenses to undertakers, but it denied having the power to issue the type of license applied for. In so doing it construed its own power under the statute and its interpretation is jurisdictional. While it is true, as a general rule, that an administrative body may interpret the statute which confers upon it duties and functions, and its construction is persuasive upon the courts because it is the body entrusted with the execution of the statute (see <em>Heath v. Wallace, </em><a href="/us/138/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="138 U.S. 573" data-case-ids="3550317" data-case-paths="/us/138/0573-01">138 U. S. 573</a>; <em>Logan v.

S. 613</a>) nevertheless such a body cannot enlarge or diminish its own jurisdiction under the statute by erroneous construction, and determinations of this sort are always subject to judicial review. This is strikingly evidenced in the case of <em>Interstate Commerce Commission v. United States ex rel. Humboldt Steamship Co., </em><a href="/us/224/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="224 U.S. 474" data-case-ids="3669008,4853922" data-case-paths="/us/224/0474-01,/alaska-fed/3/0833-01">224 U. S. 474</a>. In that case the Commissioners refused to require certain Alaskan shippers to file rate schedules because, under their interpretation of the Act, Alaskan commerce was not within their jurisdiction. They based this conclusion upon an erroneous construction of the word “territory” in the Interstate Commerce Act. The party aggrieved sought a writ of mandamus to compel the Commission to act. The Commission pleaded that since it was the body principally charged with the enforcement of the Act, the preliminary question of its jurisdiction thereunder was as much within the scope of its authority as any other question of interpretation which could <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>arise, and that its decision thereon was binding upon the courts. The Supreme Court of the United States, holding mandamus a proper remedy, said, at p. 484:</p>

It may exercise judgment and discretion, and, it may be, cannot be controlled in either.

It made a square holding, based upon its interpretation of the statute, that it was without authority thereunder to issue branch licenses. This determination was jurisdictional and consequently subject to review by the courts as to the correctness of the construction placed by the Board upon the statute. However,’ the judicial tribunal given exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from that body is the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County. The appeal comes to us on certiorari, not from the ruling of the Board but from the decision of the court below. The record we examine on certiorari is the record of that court. In such case we are merely concerned with the question as to whether or not it had proper jurisdiction. The law of this State as to what is jurisdiction is well settled.

We should determine the necessity of the law, the prevailing mischief to be remedied and the object to be attained. The intention is to be taken or presumed to be according to what is consonant to sound reason and discretion. Evidently the mischief felt, and the evil to be corrected, was the presence in the undertaking business, prior to the passage of the Act, of a number of unauthorized persons performing such services under the color of branch licenses whereby they were not so easily detected and their supervision was impossible. It was the intention of the legislature to eliminate this evil, but in so doing they wished to save those licensed undertakers who were then legitimately engaged in branch business. Bearing in mind that the legislature sought to discourage branch offices, section 6 of the Act must be construed to further that purpose by embracing all classes of licenses whether original or renewal. If, as appellants contend, the provision applies only to new licenses awarded upon examination, then while an applicant will not obtain a branch license during the first year of his licensure, he can, upon making “the reneAval of his license” required by the statute, apply for and obtain a branch license. This con<a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>struction is so fallacious as not to require any further comment.</p>

The renewal license carried forward such branch office rights as they had under their old license. It was no different in effect from any other license with the exception, as stated, that it continued the right to retain branch office licenses lawfully acquired under the old license prior to the passage of the Act of 1931. All old licensees who did not have branch places or, having them, desired additional ones, were denied the right to obtain any new branch licenses.

The purpose of the Act was not to impose restrictions upon a trade or business-calling as such, but to protect the public health from the dangers attendant upon the inexpert conduct of undertaking by those not qualified by the necessary knowledge of principles of sanitation and disease prevention. While admitting that the business can be regulated under the police power because of its relation to health, appellants insist that the provision denying to the Board the right to issue new branch licenses is unconstitutional because it deprives them of a right guaranteed by the constitution, and is unreasonable, arbitrary and does not further the general purpose of the legislature to protect the public health.</p>

This possibility is sufficient to render the practice dangerous. It is not an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of the police power to require that each undertaking establishment be personally conducted by a licensed undertaker.

While that Act is not strictly analogous to the present one, because it expressly permitted the operation of branch offices in charge of a regularly licensed optometrist, it was the legislative purpose “. . .to prevent . . . the indiscriminate opening of offices nominally under the protection of a license, but in reality in charge of one who is not registered”: <em>Harris v. State Board of Optometrical Examiners, </em>supra, at page 538.</p>

The legislature is acting within its power in prohibiting it. A thing not in itself injurious may nevertheless fall under the ban of legislative prohibition because it affords opportunities for the frustration of a purpose well within the admitted governmental power.

This conclusion is not tenable. It is well settled that the Fourteenth Amendment “does not forbid statutes and statutory changes to have a beginning and thus to discriminate between the rights of an earlier and a later time”: <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. v. </em>Rhodes, <a href="/us/220/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="220 U.S. 502" data-case-ids="3658228" data-case-paths="/us/220/0502-01">220 U. S. 502</a>, 505. It is not improper to provide that those who have obtained a privilege prior to the passage of a statute shall retain it although the same privilege is denied to those seeking it thereafter. The legislature desired to protect those who had already availed themselves of the privilege of obtaining them. The appellants had no unqualified right to have a branch license issued to them prior to the passage of the Act of 1931; such licenses were issued at the discretion of the Board. The Act of June 10,1931, P. L. 485, prohibits the granting of future branch licenses to any class of licensees and this provision is constitutional as a proper exercise of the police power of the legislature, as an aid to the regulatory provisions and the general purpose of the Act.</p>

(2d) 155, 'no person can acquire a vested right to continue, when once licensed, in a business, trade or occupation which is subject to legislative control and regulation under the police power. The rights and liberty of the citizen are all held in subordination to that governmental prerogative, and to such reasonable regulations and restrictions as the legislature may from time to time prescribe. Regulations so prescribed and conformed to by the citizens may be subsequently changed or modified by the legislature wherever public interest requires it, without subjecting its action to the charge of interfering with contract or vested rights. This is elementary.’ As further stated, in a note on page 1273 of vol. 8, L. R. A. (N.
