      <p id="b538-6" data-blocks='[["BL_538.5",538,[273,1917,1150,407]]]'> It may be tbat tbeir meaning must be determined by the <em>ejusdem generis </em>rule; if so, tbe classification -which precedes them, furnishes the clue (cf. <em>Burns v. Coyne, </em><a href="/pa/294/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="294 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="1113412" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0512-01">294 Pa. 512</a>, 516, <a href="/citations/?q=144%20A.%20667" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="144 A. 667">144 A. 667</a>). And this seems to be the interpretation applied in practice; it is matter of common knowledge that the blank forms issued by the taxing authorities, for example, in Philadelphia County, requiring taxables to make returns of personal property, contain no blank space for returning “all moneys loaned,” etc., though such spaces are furnished for all the classes preceding it.</p>
