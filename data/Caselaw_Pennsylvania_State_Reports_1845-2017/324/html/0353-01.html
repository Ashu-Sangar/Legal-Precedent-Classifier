Their records showed the amounts received and from whom; as to them there is no dispute. Such payment is evidence of damage sustained: <em>Southern Pac. Ry. Co. v.

Not receiving payment of the excess, the appellees, pursuant to article V, section 5 of the Public Service Company Law (Act of July 26, 1913, P. L. 1374, 66 PS section 1, et seq., as amended), asked for orders of reparation directing payment by the railroads to petitioners (in the words of the statute) “of the amount of damages sustained in consequence of said unjust, unreasonable or unlawful collections”. Hearings were had and reparation awards were made April 18, 1933. When the awards were not paid, these actions were brought in accordance with provisions of article V, section 5, to recover the sums awarded. Section 5 also provides that “said order [of reparation] made by the Commission shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated and that the amount awarded is justly due the plaintiff in each suit, and the defendant public service company shall not be permitted to avail itself of the defense that the service was, in fact, rendered to the plaintiff at the rate contained in its tariff or <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>schedule in force at the time the payment was made and received.”</p>

Section 5 also provides: “No reparation as herein provided shall be awarded by the commission unless the complaint or petition shall have been filed with it within two years from the time when the cause of action accrued. ...” The cause of action accrued when the freight charges were paid: <em>Louisville Cement Co. v. I. C. C., </em><a href="/us/246/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="246 U.S. 638" data-case-ids="8289111" data-case-paths="/us/246/0638-01">246 U. S. 638</a>. The argument is that “the complaint or petition” was not filed “within two years from the time when the cause of action accrued.” The question then is what is meant by the words “complaint or petition”? Do they refer, as appellants contend, to a petition (the third one recited above) by which a shipper calls the commission’s attention to its findings that unlawful charges were collected and that the overcharge has not been refunded and for which the shipper asks an order of repayment, or do the words refer, as appellees contend, to the complaint or petition (the second one recited above) challenging as unreasonable, the collected rates?<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> We all agree that the words refer, as appellees <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>contend, to the initial proceeding challenging the rates, whether brought by a shipper or a body representing shippers generally or instituted by the commission of its own motion. The record gives no support for the defense that the cause of action accrued more than two years before complaints filed December 19, 1930, and January 6,1931, respectively; no allowance in damages was made for rates paid prior to two-year periods expiring December 19,1930, and January 6,1931. It is therefore immaterial, in disposing of these appeals, that the learned trial judge ruled (erroneously, we think) that this defense was not available at the trial; there was no evidence that earlier payments were included in the reparation awarded.</p>

The Public Service Company Law conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the commission to determine the unreasonableness of rates. One of the purposes of conferring this jurisdiction was to provide for uniformity of rates and practices and that the standard of what is reasonable might not vary with the views of different courts or different juries to whom isolated cases might be presented.

The learned court below was therefore correct in excluding evidence for the purpose suggested. The statute deprived the defendants of no rights. The effect of the finding and determination in the order of April 5, 1932, was to determine that the railroads had committed a tort and the obligation to make compensation. We think it was appealable<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> under article VI, section 17: <em>New York &amp; Pa. Co. v. New York Central R. R.

Any other conclusion would lead to such anomalous results that we think the legislature cannot have intended them. If we should adopt appellants’ argument that the order was not appealable, the result would be that the same defenses could be interposed in the common pleas in the action for reparation; that procedure would require trying the case de novo and again hearing the evidence which the commission had heard and passed on, and it would have to be done as many times as there were claimants bringing suits for reparation. We are certain the legislature did not mean this. Another reason for holding that the legislature intended such orders to be appealable lies in the requirement of judicial review; it is conceivable, for example, that the commission might find a rate to be reasonable which the railroads would be able to show was confiscatory. To meet that contingency due process requires a right of judicial review: <em>Ohio Valley Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, </em><a href="/us/253/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="253 U.S. 287" data-case-ids="189354" data-case-paths="/us/253/0287-01">253 U. S. 287</a> and cases <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>following it. The legislature intended to pass an act that was constitutional and not one that was unconstitutional. The order finding the rates unreasonable in the amounts specified was a declaration to which the law annexed the obligation to refund the overcharge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> It is immaterial, in this connection, that the statute also provided for a determination of the amount and for suit in the common pleas to recover it if the defendant failed to discharge the obligation. The right of appeal from the order declaring the rate unreasonable gave opportunity to appeal to the Superior Court for judicial review; from that court an appeal lay to this court, and from this court to the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
    <p id="b388-4" data-blocks='[["BL_388.4",388,[295,1046,1149,1012]],["BL_389.1",389,[199,353,1150,475]]]'>The effect of not taking advantage of the opportunity to appeal is specified in article VI, section 31, which provides : “Whenever the commission shall make any rule, regulation, finding, determination, or order under the provisions of this act the same shall be and remain conclusive upon all parties affected thereby unless set aside, annulled, or modified in an appeal or proceeding taken as provided in this act.” Having elected to reject the judicial review provided by the statute, appellants are bound by the finding of the commission that the rates were unreasonable in the amounts of the rate reductions specified. Under the same section, and for the same reasons, the defenses that the reparation orders would violate the long- and short-haul provisions and would unduly prejudice other shippers were not available in these suits to enforce the orders. The reasonableness of the rates, their relation to the long- and short-haul<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> provisions as disclosed by these records, the alleged undue prejudice to other shippers, are questions that have to do <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>essentially with general rate regulation which, to attain uniformity, the statute expressly confided to the exclusive jurisdiction of the commission. If the railroads’ tariffs disclosed violation of the long- and short-haul provisions, penalties may have been incurred, a subject which is not before us: Compare <em>Davis v. Portland Seed Co., </em><a href="/us/264/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="264 U.S. 403" data-case-ids="6141773" data-case-paths="/us/264/0403-01">264 U. S. 403</a>.

The defense that the rate was not unreasonable was therefore not open in these actions, nor, for the same reason, could the railroad show that the reduced rate would result in undue preference. It is, however, open to the carrier to show that the commission included in the amounts of the reparation order sums exacted outside the two-year period. As has been said, the evidence in this case shows that payments in question were all within the two years, so the appellants were not harmed by the rulings that the defense was not available in these suits; if there had been evidence to support it, the evidence would have been admissible.</p>
