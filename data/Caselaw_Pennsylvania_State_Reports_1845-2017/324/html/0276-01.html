We are unable to agree Avith its conclusion in this respect. While it is true that the answer is not as specific in its denials as is desirable, nevertheless, after setting forth the sheriff’s return, plaintiff does assert that the sheriff’s return “contains the truth.” As the return, which is made part of the answer, in effect controverts every essential averment of the petition, we deem the assertion of its truth a sufficient denial to place these matters in issue. Until resolved, an appeal to this court is premature, unless the issues were abandoned, which, apparently, they were not.

It has long been held that service of process must occur within the borders of the state which issued it. That the defendant’s presence there may be temporary or transitory is of no import; but the life or.force of a process in personam is limited to the territorial jurisdiction of the court that issued it, not beyond. The authority of state courts and their processes cannot be extended beyond the borders of the state and when a court or its officers seek to expand the reach of process beyond this, it is a nullity and judicial action may not be predicated thereon.

      <p id="b307-7" data-blocks='[["BL_307.6",307,[203,1459,1150,175]]]'> The Year Books of the fourteenth century show the birth of the rule. From a report of an anonymous caso (Horwood ed., p. 92) at the Michaelmas Term of the 33rd year of Edward I (1305) we quote verbatim:</p>
      <blockquote id="b307-8" data-blocks='[["BL_307.7",307,[202,1644,1151,167]]]'>“Hengham. If the Sheriff returns that I have land where I have not, shall not the party be received to an averment contrary to his return? (Indicating that he shall.) And the averment was received. Note this.”</blockquote>
      <p id="b307-9" data-blocks='[["BL_307.8",307,[202,1826,1152,130]]]'>Here was reasoning rejecting the claim of conelusiveness. But at the Easter Term in the 14th year of Edward III (1340) we find in case No. 33, Pike ed., p. 82:</p>
      <blockquote id="b307-10" data-blocks='[["BL_307.9",307,[201,1964,1153,173]]]'>“An <em>alias testatum </em>issued, to which writ the Sheriff returned that he had summoned the vouchee . . . the tenant said that the vouchee was and for a long time had been dead . . . Schardelowe. We must proceed according to the return of the Sheriff.”</blockquote>
      <p id="b307-11" data-blocks='[["BL_307.10",307,[204,2146,1151,268]],["BL_308.2",308,[272,1484,1152,83]]]'>These last ten words, reaching an absurd result under the facts, contain no reason for the result. Nor does any other of the numerous English cases we have examined. And <em>Sunderland, The Sheriff's Return, </em>16 Columbia L. Rev. 281, 282 (1916), states categorically: “None of the English cases discuss the reason for the rule.” The historical basis for the rule is probably accurately described in <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>Kitchin, Jurisdictions (5th ed., 1675), where in rationalizing the decisions of the early fifteenth century he states at p. 563:</p>
      <blockquote id="b308-7" data-blocks='[["BL_308.3",308,[274,1575,1150,83]]]'>“. . . one cannot have an averment to the contrary; for the sheriff is Officer, to whom credit shall be given ...”</blockquote>
      <p id="b308-8" data-blocks='[["BL_308.4",308,[271,1667,1152,128]]]'>The sheriff was indeed given credit, for in medieval England he was a remarkable person. Maitland, Constitutional History of English Law (1926) 233, says of the sheriff:</p>
      <blockquote id="b308-9" data-blocks='[["BL_308.5",308,[273,1803,1150,124]]]'>“In the twelfth century he is little less than a provincial viceroy. All the affairs of the county; justice, police, fiscal matters, military matters are under his control.”</blockquote>
      <p id="b308-10" data-blocks='[["BL_308.6",308,[272,1942,1151,303]]]'>There is a very noticeable decline in the duties and position of a sheriff from that which existed in early English history compared with his position today. He has shrunk from a ruler of a county to that of an attendant or servant of the courts, but he is still the enforcer of law and order and is the chief peace officer of the county, and can only be superseded when he calls on the governor for assistance.</p>

        <em> </em>There is one patent exception to this rule arising from extreme necessity in cases involving automobile accidents. We held in <em>Aversa v. </em>Aubry, <a href="/pa/303/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="303 Pa. 139" data-case-ids="1130087" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0139-01">303 Pa. 139</a>, that service on the Secretary of the Commonwealth was sufficient to give jurisdiction over the person of a nonresident defendant in a trespass case arising from an automobile accident. A similar statute was upheld in <em>Hess v. Pawloski, </em><a href="/us/274/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="274 U.S. 352" data-case-ids="81168" data-case-paths="/us/274/0352-01">274 U. S. 352</a>. See also <em>Stoner v.

The rule of personal service in actions in personam is, however, universal unless defendant “has by certain acts within the state subjected himself to its jurisdiction, within the constitutional limits whereby acts done within a state may subject one to its jurisdiction.” See Restatement, Conflicts, Sec. 77(e).</p>
