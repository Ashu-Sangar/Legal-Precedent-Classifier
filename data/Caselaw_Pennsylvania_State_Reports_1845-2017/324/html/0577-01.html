Defendant denied ownership of the truck and that the driver was his servant. It appeared that dealer’s license plates No. 3X547 for 1931 were on the truck at the time of the accident, and defendant was called by plaintiffs as on cross-examination and asked whether he had owned the license plates. Having admitted ownership, his counsel proposed to examine him further in connection therewith: whether they had been loaned to anyone and whether the truck was driven by his servant in the scope of his employment. The court below refused to permit the examination, holding that these matters were part of defendant’s case and could not be brought out under the guise of cross-examination. The defendant was forced to introduce this testimony as part of his own case. The issues having been submitted to the jury, it disagreed, and the refusal of defendant’s request for judgment on the whole record caused this appeal.</p>

See Wigmore on Evidence (2nd ed.), Sections 1885 to 1891. In this state it has been frequently stated that cross-examination must be strictly confined to matters touched upon in direct examination. This viewpoint originated in general statements which appear frequently in our cases discussing the permissible scope of cross-examination. “The cross-examination, as a general thing, is only regular when it is confined to testimony given by the witness in chief”: <em>Helser v.

But this rigid rule has not been closely adhered to, and we have created well defined exceptions. The conception that these general pronouncements are an accurate statement of the rule is erroneous. It disregards the limitations imposed on its operation and ignores the fundamental reasons for the imposition of any restrictions on the scope of cross-examination.</p>
    <p id="b609-3" data-blocks='[["BL_609.4",609,[152,842,1153,748]]]'>The underlying reason for confining the scope of cross-examination is to promote order and method in the presentation of a case. Each party must have an opportunity to present his side of the case without the introduction of matters unrelated to his case in chief and not touched upon in his evidence. The Pennsylvania rule makes the issues as clear as possible to the jury by reducing to a minimum the possibility of the intermingling of matters purely defensive in character with the facts of a plaintiff’s case. See Wigmore on Evidence (2nd ed.), Section 1887 (b). The issues are clarified and confusion eliminated to the greatest possible extent by the separation of their respective contentions and the testimony produced in support thereof.</p>

The result has been that, over this period of more than one hundred years, the effect of the general rule restricting the scope of cross-examination has been materially modified, so that our general rule can scarcely be said to accurately portray the present status of the law. The failure to give due weight to these modifications of the broad general rule misled the trial court in this case.</p>

It is equally established that where a plaintiff offers himself as a witness, he may be cross-examined as to anything relevant provided it is not purely a matter of defense, on the theory he should not withhold matters materially affecting his' rights <em>(Greenfield v.

Defendant’s testimony, on examination by plaintiffs, admitting ownership of the license plates, had much greater significance than the fact of ownership would seem to indicate and enabled them to meet this burden. The real purpose of a question may reach far beyond its apparent import: cf. <em>Kirschman v. Pitt Publishing Co., </em><a href="/pa/318/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="318 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="1159658" data-case-paths="/pa/318/0570-01">318 Pa. 570</a>, 575. Under our decisions with respect to dealer’s license plates, this admission had embodied in it not only the fact of ownership but inferences sufficient to take the case to the jury: namely, that the motor vehicle was owned by defendant; that the driver was his servant; and that the vehicle was being driven at the time on his business. It was not the fact of ownership which was harmful but the implications arising from it. Defendant proposed to cross-examine the witness as to the fact of ownership and <em>the inferences that flowed!, from it, </em>and, had he been permitted to do so, plaintiffs’ own testimony would have deprived them of the benefit of the presumption. It would have shown not only that he did not own the truck and that the driver had never been in his employ, but that the plates were taken from his place of business without his knowledge or consent or that of any one authorized to grant consent. This uncontradicted evidence would have rebutted the presumption in plaintiffs’ case by their own witness. The trial court refused to permit this examination and compelled defendant to produce this evi<a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>dence as part of Ms own case, thereby requiring submission of the issue to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b612-4" data-blocks='[["BL_612.4",612,[278,451,1152,893]]]'>The testimony given by defendant corresponded exactly with what his counsel had proposed to bring out on cross-examination. It revealed that the license plates were taken from his garage without his permission and given to one Samuels, an owner or operator of the Star Produce Company which owned the delivery truck, for use on the truck. Defendant had no interest in the produce company or the truck, and the driver of the truck had never been employed by him. The court below in refusing to permit this testimony on cross-examination proceeded upon the theory that it must be strictly and literally confined to the matter actually testified to in chief. It held that as defendant’s testimony had been limited to the question of <em>ownership of the license plates </em>on the truck at the time of the accident, his examination by his own counsel could not extend beyond this precise matter.</p>

This evidence was produced exclusively for the purpose of giving rise to a presumption of such relationship. The inferences flowing therefrom enabled plaintiffs to make out a prima facie case, and their probative value was the impelling and vital reason for securing from defendant an admission of ownership of the license plates. The fact of ownership standing alone and stripped of these inferences meant nothing to their case. The inferences are the damaging part of this testimony. Here is a patent case where cross-examination would be of little value if restricted to the actual facts elicited on direct examination. One of the purposes of cross-examination is to enable the jury to ascertain the truth of relevant facts deposed by a witness on direct examination and to properly guide them in drawing material inferences there<a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>from.

Having chosen to place defendant on the witness stand and examine him as to facts bearing on this question, plaintiffs were not at liberty to bring out only those matters favorable to them and ignore or otherwise suppress facts of an adverse and harmful character bearing a direct relation to it. To permit the concealment or suppression of facts which are germane or related to an issue touched upon in direct examination and are not purely matters of defense would be to bestow upon a plaintiff an unfair advantage and enable him to have the case submitted to the jury, in spite of the fact his own witnesses possessed knowledge of facts which would make it impossible for him to make out a prima facie case if these facts appeared on the record as part of his own case. This course would be simply juggling with judicial procedure. Any limitation on the scope of cross-examination opening the way for such an absurd situation would defeat one of the vital reasons for its existence. That the testimony on direct examination does not go sufficiently far to prove the ultimate fact in issue is immaterial. It is enough if it tends to establish it. Where testimony has been adduced relevant to a particular issue involved, cross-examination may embrace any circumstances pertaining thereto, though prej<a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>udicial to plaintiff’s case and reaching beyond the direct testimony. The chief reason for limiting cross-examination is to promote order and clarity in the presentation of a case and prevent confusion, but there are circumstances where inculpatory evidence may appear in one’s own case. To hold otherwise would be to give a party an opportunity to suppress and hide facts, intentionally or otherwise, which, though not affirmative defenses, would bar his right to recover. The Pennsylvania limitations on cross-examination were never designed to provide a cloak for the concealment of material facts pertaining to issues touched upon in direct examination.</p>
    <p id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.4",615,[155,1002,1154,1063]]]'>The refusal to permit defendant’s counsel to examine him regarding a master and servant relationship worked a serious injury constituting an abuse of the trial court’s discretionary power. Where a party has been improperly denied the right to cross-examine a witness, and the testimony (which should have been admitted as cross-examination) appears as part of his own case, on appeal it will be considered as though given on cross-examination: See <em>Hughes v. Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>supra, at p. 213; <em>Smith v. Standard Steel Car Co., </em><a href="/pa/262/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="262 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1044548" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0550-01">262 Pa. 550</a>, 557. While it is true that where plaintiff’s case rests upon a presumption he is entitled to have it submitted to the jury though rebutted by defendant’s uncontradicted parol evidence <em>(Coates v. Commercial Credit Co., </em>supra), where the presumption is rebutted by plaintiff’s own evidence, it disappears and a nonsuit will be granted: <em>Readshaw v. Montgomery, </em><a href="/pa/313/0206-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="313 Pa. 206" data-case-ids="1152707" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0206-01">supra;</a> <em>Felski v. Zeidman, </em><a href="/pa/281/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="281 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="1086977" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0419-01">supra.</a> Plaintiffs failed to carry the burden of proof and judgment should have been entered for defendant on the whole record.</p>

They cite in support of this contention the Act of April 20, 1911, P. L. 70, Sec. 1, as interpreted by Justice Mestre<a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>zat in <em>Lipsky v. Stolzer, </em><a href="/pa/236/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="236 Pa. 151" data-case-ids="986629" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0151-01">236 Pa. 151</a>. However, the act was not intended to be productive of unnecessary or unusual litigation. This case has been tried twice, and on the first occasion a new trial was granted on the ground the verdict for plaintiffs was against the weight of evidence. If there was conflicting evidence necessitating the determination of question of fact by a jury, undoubtedly the rule of the <em>Lipsky </em>case would require that the appeal be quashed. But as we have indicated, if the court below had properly decided the controverted legal question and allowed the cross-examination, the conflict in evidence would have disappeared, and plaintiffs’ own uncontradicted testimony would have entitled defendant to a judgment on the whole record. We consider the record in this light and here enter the judgment which the court below should have entered.</p>
