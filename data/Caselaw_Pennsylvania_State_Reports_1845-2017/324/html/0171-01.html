If the wife has the power to sell or mortgage her property and apply the money to the satisfaction of his debts, there is no reason why she may not subject it to a mere contingent liability for the same purpose. The liability following suretyship, guaranty, or endorsement, however, is general and personal, and is not limited to specific property. See <em>Frankford Trust Co. v. Wszolek, </em><a href="/pa/320/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="320 Pa. 437" data-case-ids="1163706" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0437-01">320 Pa. 437</a>; <em>Yeany, to use, v.

The agreement entered into by Mrs. Covitch, while in form a joint promissory note, was clearly intended to operate as an extension of her existing mortgage to include present and future debts of her husband, and to continue the lien of the mortgage for their payment. The agreement in suit is not a formal mortgage, but it nevertheless constituted a pledge of her real estate to secure the debts of her husband. The bank held the original mortgage as collateral security for the payment of the debts, its lien continued, and her equity of redemption was pledged thereunder. She could have properly executed a new mortgage to accomplish the same purpose but it was not necessary. Nor was it necessary for appellee to proceed against the husband on the note upon which this agreement was endorsed before enforcing collection on the mortgage and bond pledged by the wife as collateral. See <em>Lishy v. O’Brien, </em><a href="/watts/4/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="4 Watts 141" data-case-ids="1842691" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0141-01">4 Watts 141</a>.</p>
