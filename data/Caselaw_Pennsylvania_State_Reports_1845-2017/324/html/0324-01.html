At this point, traveling from 40 to 45 miles an hour, he turned from the new road onto the old and had proceeded about 75 feet when the car encountered a depression in the roadbed. It veered sharply to the right and the impact caused Jaffe to lose control and, to avoid a collision with a telephone pole he turned the car so rapidly that it overturned. Plaintiff, a passenger in the car, sustained severe injuries to the face which resulted in permanent disfigurement and loss of sight of her right eye. The depression was the result of an excavation by the York Engineering &amp; Construction Company for the purpose of placing a culvert beneath the roadbed. This action was brought against Jaffe and the Construction Company as joint defendants. At the conclusion of the trial, both defendants requested binding instructions which the court granted to the Construction Company but denied to Jaffe, submitting his negligence to the jury; it found against him. The court refused his motion for judgment n. o. v. and, on plaintiff’s motion, granted her a new trial. Jaffe appeals.</p>

The verdict was for $3,000, the jury specifying that $460 of this sum was for medical expenses, <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>$500 for loss of wages from October 10 to March 4, 1935, and $2,040 for loss of an eye, disfigurement, suffering and future expenses. The injuries to appellee were most serious and her visual ability has been greatly impaired. The testimony shows that, in addition to nose and facial injuries, she has permanently lost the sight of her right eye. A physician testified that the left eye may be sympathetically affected and, to prevent total blindness, the removal of the injured eye and its replacement with a false one may be necessitated. Prior to this accident she was employed as a bookkeeper and earned $100 a month. When she again found employment in March of 1935, she was forced to take an occupation of a different nature, due to her lack of visual ability, at a salary of $60 a month. The trial judge instructed the jury to take into consideration this loss of earning capacity and its prospective effect, but' the jury’s own apportionment of their verdict clearly shows-that they neglected to consider this item. It was for this reason that the court below deemed the verdict inadequate and, in view of the nature of the Injuries and the uncontroverted fact that her earning power has been impaired, no abuse of discretion in granting a neAV trial on this ground can be found.</p>

He was familiar with the road, having traveled over it on numerous occasions. His knowledge that construction was going on and that there was a possibility of obstructions or other hindrances to free passage, made it incumbent upon him to exercise even a higher degree of care than would ordinarily be required: <em>Brenton v.

ITe turned from the new highway into the old at a speed of approximately 45 miles an hour. While speed in itself is not conclusive of negligence <em>(Collichio v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/311/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="311 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="1146312" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0553-01">311 Pa. 553</a>), the condition of the highway must be considered. The road was dark, the grade downward and appellant knew that the intersection was one at which he would encounter a new and more hazardous road surface, as the road on which he was traveling was concrete and the road into which he turned was not. The angle of the turn was such that Ms headlights would not immediately reveal the condition <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>of the old road, although once on the straight-of-way they would show to the ditch and even beyond. Under the circumstances it is obvious that the speed of approach combined with carelessness of observation thrust him upon the danger which a more prudent man, having so great a familiarity with the road, would certainly have avoided. It further appears that this ditch was marked by the contractors with a red lantern. This was an additional circumstance which immediately compelled the exercise of a greater degree of care. The court would not have been justified in directing a verdict and the judgment n. o. v. was properly refused. The cases cited by appellant <em>(Ferrell v.

Our decisions have not clearly decided as to the right of a defendant in an action of trespass to object to the direction of a verdict in favor of a co-defendant. In <em>Vendig v.

The jury returned a verdict against both. The court entered judgment n. o. v. as to one of the defendants and refused it as to the other. Three appeals were taken; the first by one of the defendants as to the refusal to enter judgment in its favor; the second by the same defendant from the judgment n. o. v. in favor of the co-defendant; the third by plaintiff from the entry of the same judgment n. o. v. The court said (p. 539, 540) : “It is probable that the second of these appeals could not be sustained under any circumstances <em>(Cleary v.

The court held that it had no standing to appeal, but rested its decision principally on the fact that a non-suit does not make any of the issues res judicata. However, in <em>Stone v.

The court recognized the doctrine enunciated in <em>Cleary v. Quaker City Cab Co., </em>supra, but said: “As the whole record of the case is in this court, under the broad powers conferred upon us . . . ‘to minister justice to all persons/ we can make such an order as will enable plaintiff to reassert his claim against Levin [co-defendant] by moving the court below to take off the nonsuit as to him.

      <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>Our review of the record discloses no evidence that the depression caused by the excavation work by the Construction Company was a proximate cause of appellee’s injury, even if it be conceded that it was negligently done. It is well settled that where there has been negligence in the doing of an act, the result of which is the creation of a dangerous condition, no liability will attach to the one responsible for the condition if an injury results which was not caused directly by this act, but rather by the intervening negligent conduct of a third party. The negligence complained of must be the effective and active cause of the injury. If it is merely a pas'sive cause, it cannot give rise to liability.
