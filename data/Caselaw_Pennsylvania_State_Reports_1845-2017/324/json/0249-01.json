All the defendants were acquitted save Philip Bruno who was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter on each indictment. Sentences of imprisonment for terms of six to twelve years, to be served consecutively, were imposed. A new trial was denied and judgments and sentences followed. Hence these appeals.\nThe facts are nearly identical with those narrated in Commonwealth v. Bruno, 324 Pa. 236. Meritorious assignments of error common to both cases have been discussed there. No others are worthy of explicit consideration here. All the assignments are overruled.\nThe judgments and sentences are affirmed and the record is remitted to the court below for the purpose of execution.",
