But it is established that double taxation exists only where the subject of both taxes is the same. The capital stock tax is a property tax; the mercantile license tax is a tax on the privilege of doing business in a certain manner. This distinction has been previously noted in Commonwealth v. Bailey, Banks & Biddle Co., 20 Pa. Superior Ct. 210, where a similar contention was ruled upon adversely to appellant. See also Commonwealth v. Harrisburg L. & P. Co., 284 Pa. 175, 179. Appellant\u2019s other contentions are all fully answered in the opinion of the court below.\nJudgment affirmed.",
