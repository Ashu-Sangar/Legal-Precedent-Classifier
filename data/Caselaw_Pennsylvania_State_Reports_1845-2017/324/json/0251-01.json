A verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree was returned on each of the three indictments. Three sem tences of imprisonment for ten to twenty years were imposed. They are to be served consecutively. The appeals are from the judgments and sentences that followed the refusal of a new trial.\nThe operative facts here are to all intent the same as those set out in Commonwealth v. Bruno, 324 Pa. 236. No assignments of error worthy of specific attention are raised here that were not disposed of there. All of them are accordingly overruled.\nThe judgments and sentences are affirmed and the record is remitted to the court below for the purpose of execution.",
