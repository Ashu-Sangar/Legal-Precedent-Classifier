Risher and Joseph Wilson, partners as Risher &amp; Wilson, against Nicholas J. Bigley. The plaintiffs declared in all the common counts. Their claim was for a boat and cargo of coal. The boat was lying at the plaintiffs’ works on the Monongahela river; and remained in the possession of the plaintiffs. After the alleged sale there was a break up of the ice in the river, which carried the boat away from its moorings: — it was wrecked and both boat and cargo were lost. The questions which were considered in the court below were, whether there was a contract of sale; whether there was a delivery, and whether there was negligence in the plaintiffs in their care of the boat. The plaintiffs gave evidence by John C. Risher, a brother of one of the plaintiffs, that after he heard of the accident he went to the defendant’s office and informed him of it; he said to witness “ go on up and do what I could; that he considered the boat his; that he had bought it of my brother.” <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>At a conversation some weeks afterwards, the plaintiff Risher said to defendant he had come to know, whether in case. plaintiff should raise the boat, defendant would pay the balance; defendant said he did not wish to be identified with the boat, but did not care to give him a little, a few hundred dollars; said it was a pity he had not taken the boat away before the accident; “ according to what I understood was the agreement, it would have saved all this trouble.”</p>

Risher asked what he would give; defendant wanted Risher to name figures; Risher said he would let him know in a day or two what the figures would be, and left. Risher and defendant were next together about the boat at the time spoken of by J. C. Risher. Witness testified to what took place then somewhat different from Risher. There was other evidence bearing upon the question of sale, but none showing that any price had been agreed on. There was much evidence as to delivery, but it was undisputed, that no <em>actual </em>delivery of the boat was made to the defendant and that he never took possession of it.</p>

If they have, in your judgment, then there was a delivery, and your verdict must be for the plaintiffs; if not, your verdict must be for the defendant. In so determining, gentlemen, you must, however, go a step further and consider the character of the article to be delivered. A man could not deliver a ship at sea as easily as a wagon upon land. Nor could one deliver timber standing upon his farm with the same care and completeness, so to speak, that he could deliver a horse in his stable. You must, in determining the question whether all was done that could be done, take into consideration the nature, character and bulk of the article, bearing further in mind that these plaintiffs were not bound — nor is it so contended — to remove the boat, or take it elsewhere than where it was lying at the time of the sale. In other words, it is not contended that the plaintiffs wrere bound to take this boat anywhere in order to give the defendant possession; and, hence, the only question for your determination will be, did they do all they could have done to give possession of her as she there lay, or was there anything else in your judgment that they should have done in order to accomplish a perfect delivery. If they left anything undone which, in your conscientious opinion, they ought to have done, there was no delivery in law, and we so instruct you, and they cannot recover; but if they did all that could have been required of them, upon an examination of all the circumstances, and taking into consideration the nature, character, bulk, condition and location of the boat, then they are entitled to recover, and your verdict will be for them in such amount as the evidence in the case warrants. This we instruct you is the true test of delivery, and by this test you will determine in this regard and the particular facts of this case.” * * *</p>
