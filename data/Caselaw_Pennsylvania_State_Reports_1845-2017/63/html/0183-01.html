Thus land ordered to be sold is regarded as money for every purpose necessary to effectuate the intent of the devisor or donor. The parties to whom the proceeds are to be paid, whether heirs at law or strangers, take no estate in the premises which are to be the subject of the sale, as has more than once been held by this court after the most solemn and deliberate consideration. Thus it has been decided that a judgment recovered against one of several legatees, among whom the fund when made was to be distributed, will not bind his interest therein, for he is seised of no estate in the land which can be made the subject of alien, and consequently, that a sheriff’s sale of the legatee’s supposed interest in the land passes nothing to the purchaser: Allison’s Executors <em>v. </em>Wilson’s Executors, 13 S. &amp; R. 333; Morrow <em>v. </em>Brenizer, <a href="/rawle/2/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Rawle 185" data-case-ids="1820587" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0185-01">2 Rawle 185</a>. The principles upon which these decisions are based are familiar wherever the English system of equity prevails, and have been since frequently recognised by this court: Burr <em>v. </em>Sinn, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Whart.%20265" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Whart. 265">1 Whart. 265</a>; Smith <em>v. </em>Starr, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Whart.%2065" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Whart. 65">3 Whart. 65</a>; Rice <em>v. </em>Bixler, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 445" data-case-ids="1852623" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0445-01">1 W. &amp; S. 445</a>. It is very true the parties interested- in the fund may elect to accept the land unconverted, and if they do so, will immediately acquire an estate therein. But this must be some unequivocal act, and when there are more than one entitled, all of them must join in the act of election, otherwise it is nugatory.”</p>

The court below awarded a perpetual injunction, restraining and enjoining the executors, defendants in said bill, from proceeding to sell the real estate of their testator. In this we think the court were in error, for it is directly in the face of the positive directions of the will, and there are several legacies to be paid as well as debts, and money to be expended in the improvement of the burial lots belonging to the testator in the Prospect Cemetery. Some of the land is in other states, and it appears to have been the intention to turn all his property into money and to have it brought into the state of Pennsylvania. We therefore are of opinion that the executors have full power to sell the real estate and to distribute it to those persons who are entitled thereto by the laws of Pennsylvania.</p>
