    <p class="summary" id="b331-7" data-blocks='[["BL_331.7",331,[190,700,1174,1289]]]'>“ The first points made by the plaintiff involve the same matter. The pleading in the case admits the execution of the note, and under the plea of payment with leave, nothing but equitable matter can be alleged as defence. This alteration, as it is called, is not obligatory on the defendants unless they consented to the alteration. This consent is denied on oath by defendants, and is not proved by the plaintiff, and no recovery'can be had for any interest on the note before it became due. But if the plea <em>non est factum </em>had been put in, we would have held in answer to the defendants’ first and second points, that the alteration would not have affected the obligation of defendants to pay the note, as it was when they executed it. It appears if the evidence of Horner is r.elied on, that when the note was brought to him, signed by all the defendants, he would not receive it unless it contained an obligation to pay the interest semi-annually. Pennington then informed him that he had authority to add this, and did so, by making this alteration or memorandum, whereupon Horner gave him the money or bonds. It is true, Pennington denies this, and the defendants on oath say they gave no such authority. Now this writing below the body of the note is not an interlineation, nor in the judgment of the court is it an alteration of the body of the note, which had already been executed, signed and sealed, but a mere <em>side memorandum </em>which might as well have been on the back of the note. It is sufficient in our opinion, that it should be ruled that it is no part of the note, and that the plaintiff can derive no advantage from it. This we think, where no fraud was intended, is sufficient; the plaintiff gains nothing, and the defendants lose nothing, and we see no reason to be forced to say that the memorandum is a part of the obligation and releases the parties from an obligation admitted to be fair.” * * *</p>

The opinion declares on the general principle strongly, but makes the case an exception on the ground that the plaintiff had no hand in the alteration, and because the case being stated for the opinion of the court, they were met by no discrepancy between the <em>allegata </em>and <em>probata. </em>How far the grounds of distinction may be deemed satisfactory, it is of no importance, for it is sufficient that the case is made an exception expressly.</p>

He saw him do it. He would not take the note till Pennington did so. The latter said he had authority from his sureties, but this was untrue. The alteration was not accidental, and the plaintiff, though guiltless <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>of the fraud, was foolish to accept a note he himself saw altered by the principal without being certain he had authority to bind his sureties. The alteration was material, for it added interest to the principal. It was not out of the way, so as to be no part of the note, for its position at the foot of the note, and by way of continuation, would have bound the sureties to the payment of interest, had there been authority from them to write it there. It was material in the eyes of the plaintiff, for he refused to take the note without interest added to it, and brings the suit upon it in this altered state. The note was, therefore, avoided as to the sureties, and the court erred in holding that the plaintiff could recover the principal from all the parties, disregarding his claim for the interest. It is argued that a recovery of the principal sum does no harm, for to that extent the sureties bound themselves. But the conclusive answer is that stated by Mr. Greenleaf, <em>supra, </em>§ 565. The ground of the rule is public policy to insure the protection of the instrument from fraud and substitution. The writing goes into the hands of the party who claims its benefit, and the purpose is to take away the motive for alteration, by forfeiting the instrument on discovery of the fraud. When the sureties signed it they had a right to have it delivered unaltered to the plaintiff. He was bound to know that the alteration was rightfully done, and that the penalty of his negligence, or his wrongful act, was a loss of the security.</p>

But as the case was- submitted, a wrong was done to the defendant, which could be repaired only by a new trial; for the effect of disregarding the plea of <em>non est factum, </em>on the record, was to deprive the defendant of a defence which struck at the very marrow of the plaintiff’s case.</p>
