Leopold owing Bennington, pledged tools for the debt, borrowed them from Bennington to work with and. pledged them to Stewart for a debt to him. Stewart put them into one of Bremer’s coaches to be carried, and did not pay, or tender the freight. When the coach reached Bennington’s, he took the tools out, claiming them under the pledge, tendered Stewart the amount due him from Leopold, declaring that he took the tools on his own responsibility, and not as agent for Bremer. <em>Held, </em>that Bremer was not liable as common carrier to Stewart.</p>

One Moses Bennington, innkeeper in Brownsville, was the stage agent for Bremer. A man named Joseph Leopold had become indebted to Benning<a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>ton for boarding, and as a pledge for the debt had delivered his carpenter’s tools to Bennington; Leopold at the same time owed one Moffitt $6. After the tools had been in the possession of Bennington for some days, he lent them to Leopold to enable him to go to work. At Leopold’s request the plaintiff paid the debt due Moffitt, and also paid $1, Leopold’s stage fare to Uniontown, for the repayment of which sums Leopold pledged the tools to the plaintiff and delivered them into his possession. The plaintiff put the tools into one of the defendant’s stages before it had reached the station at which Bennington was agent, to be delivered in Uniontown, and told the driver that he would be over at the office (Bennington’s) and pay the freight. When the stage came to the office, Leopold was on the driver’s seat. Bennington seeing him there with the tools, upbraided him for going away with the tools, took them from the coach and put them into his bar under lock. The plaintiff came in and demanded them, saying he had advanced Leopold $7 for them. Bennington handed the plaintiff $7, which he returned, saying he would hold the defendant responsible. Bennington said he was acting on his own responsibility, the defendant had nothing to do with it. Leopold was present. The plaintiff did not pay or tender payment for the carriage of the tools.</p>

Here the claimants were face to face, contesting the matter. The tender of the seven dollars took away all hold which the plaintiff had to the tools. He was completely stopped of any right to the possession, and of consequence cannot maintain this action. But if we should be mistaken as to this, and we feel there is some doubt about it, we are sure that the plaintiff will be barred of his recovery on another ground. It is admitted the freight was not paid, and that it was to be paid to the agent. Now we say, and so charge you, that the freight not being paid, although the tools were on the hack —thebargain for carrying not being consummated — the agentmight refuse for any reason to carry them, and having refused to do so, his principal is not responsible. I think that if any one had stepped forward and said, ‘ I claim these articles and am about to <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>be defrauded,’ it would have been competent for the agent to refuse to assist in this fraud by carrying them away.”</p>

In the whole transaction in respect to the tools in question, Moses Bennington was acting in his own behalf, and not as agent for Bremer, and the plaintiff and Leopold, the owner of the tools, were so informed at the time of the transaction. Bennington was, therefore, not the servant of Bremer, and not liable over to him for negligence or breach of duty. If liable to any one, he was liable to the plaintiff in trespass for taking the tools out of his custody, or to Leopold the owner. Both were present and acting in the affair, and both understood Bennington to claim the tools in his own right, while as to Bremer they knew he had not been paid the freight, and that his liability as a carrier had not fairly begun. The tools were put aboard the stage at the upper end of the town, a short distance from the station, and Stewart was to come over and pay the freight. He did come over, made no tender of the money, at first took the amount he had advanced for Leopold, the owner of the tools, and then returned it at Leopold’s instance., The whole transaction plainly shows that the carrier’s duty had not fairly begun, and consequently that the contract for carriage was not fully consummated. If Bennington had no right to the possession of the tools, he was a trespasser and the remedy of the plaintiff is against him.</p>
