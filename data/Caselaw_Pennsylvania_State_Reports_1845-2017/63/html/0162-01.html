It appeared by the statements of the respective parties in their paper-books, that the plaintiffs were owners of an extensive oil-refining establishment on the Ohio river, and in 1865 had erected at their works a large tank of the capacity of 13,000 gallons made with iron sides and wooden bottom for storing crude petroleum. Before it was used a rise in the river forced the bottom up, and the tank became unfit for use. The tank being in this condition it was leased to the defendants by the above articles. It is the custom to put water into tanks with wooden bottoms, because the water remaining at the bottom prevents leakage of the oil. Shortly after the lease the defendants employed a tank-builder who repaired the bottom of the tank at cost of about f1000. The tank continuing to leak, another tank-builder put in an entirely new wooden bottom, which made the tank as secure as it could be made by a wooden bottom; but both the tank-builders were of opinion, that owing to the position of the tank and the nature of the ground, no wooden bottom could be put in that would not leak. The tank continued to leak, the leakage varying from 10 to 180 barrels per day. The plaintiff’s evidence wTas that it always leaked more than a tank “in good repair” should leak. The defendant’s evidence by experts was that the repairs were as thorough as time <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>and skill could make them. The defendants in their paper-hook stated that hy their uncontradicted evidence no oil had been lost from the tank whilst in the possession of themselves or their successors, On the trial the defendants offered to show that after they took possession and were about to make the repairs, Mr. O’Hara, the president of the company, said that their cost would not exceed from $200 to $500, as tending to show that the plaintiff did not intend by the agreement to exact the addition of an iron bottom costing several thousand dollars; also, to prove that Mr. O’Hara was present several times whilst the repairs were in progress, saw the work going on, and expressed his entire satisfaction with the repairs as they were being made; also, the amount expended by defendants in repairing the tank, for the purpose of showing performance in good faith of the provisions of the contract. These offers were all objected to by the plaintiffs, admitted by the court, and several bills of exception sealed.</p>

But if a wooden bottom could be made so as to meet the requirements of the contract; and if this bottom was not sufficient, then the question would arise, would, or would not, all the material put in by the defendants have to be taken out, and new material procured and put in, or could this bottom be made complete, so as to answer the demands of the lease, by adding thereto other materials, and carrying out and completing the work done by them ?

    <p class="summary" id="b167-9" data-blocks='[["BL_167.9",167,[203,862,1170,1337]]]'>“ There is one question of fact and of law in this case. The law of this contract is, that the defendants were bound to put the tank in perfectly good repair, and to leave it in the same condition at the expiration of the lease — and the question of fact is, have they done so ? The parties themselves made the law, by the very terms of the contract. The words ‘perfectly good repair,’ do not mean that any particular material must be used. Iron, brass, copper, zinc, lead, wood or stone may be used, if either will make such a job as was contemplated by the parties when they entered into this agreement. Now, what do they mean by the terms employed ? This tank had a wooden bottom at the time — many others had the same kind — but some had iron bottoms. The latter material has become, according to the testimony of an experienced tank-builder, much more common now than when this lease was made. We have no evidence, except the terms of the contract, that either party contemplated a change of the material from wood to iron — nor does it seem to me very likely, if it had been thought necessary by the plaintiff to make such a change, that this contract would have been silent on the subject. The words here are to receive a reasonable construction — and what is that ? Why, that the character of the materials and workmanship must be of such a quality — so adapted to the purpose for which these repairs were designed, as, in the estimation of men experienced in this business, would be presumed perfectly good. Every branch of business must be judged of by the rules of the trade, and the common sense of mankind. If a landlord should lease to a tenant a house with a shingle roof, which leaked badly, and bind the tenant to put the house in perfectly good repair, would it be the understanding of the parties that he was to repair the roof with the same kind of materials, although it might not be as tight, or as warm, as permanent, or as secure against fire, as a slate-roof?</p>

But if you should find otherwise, then your verdict should be for the <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>plaintiff, for such sum as would put the repairs in that' condition.

It had iron sides and a wooden bottom, and held about 13,000 barrels of oil. Before it had been used by the plaintiffs, by a rise in the river, and the water getting under it, the bottom was injured and it could not be used without repairs. The ground on which it stood had been selected by the plaintiffs, and it turned out from its position and the nature of the ground it would leak more than such a tank when in good repair would leak. If the plaintiffs had undertaken to repair it they would naturally have done so by repairing the injury to the wooden bottom by strengthening it and putting it in the same condition as nearly as possible as it was when completed before the rise in the river. This they would have considered as putting the tank in perfectly good repair.</p>
