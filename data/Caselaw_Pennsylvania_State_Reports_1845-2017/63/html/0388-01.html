Hart was burgess of Girard borough and Wright was a councilman; in April 1863 the borough resolved to pay f&gt;300 each for recruits under the call for July 1864: it was agreed that “each member should act as agent and hire a man if he could.” Hart and Wright procured seven recruits, but before they were mustered in the quota was filled; they then transferred the recruits to another district at a higher price. In a suit by Girard for the difference, the plaintiffs’point was: “The council were ex oifieio agents of the corporation, they may act as a body corporate, they may agree that each may represent the whole in any particular transaction, and if the council did so agree among themselves their authority was ample and both are bound by the transaction in putting the men in.” The court affirmed the point, “ provided that was a general authority for all drafts and not confined to the particular one.” <em>Held </em>to be correct.</p>

      <em>“ </em>It seems to me the fact of agency or no agency will have to be determined as a question of intention at the time, on the part of the defendants. The fact that they were, one the burgess and the other a councilman of the borough, is an important one in this-connection. There was no one else there to consult, no one but themselves from whom an appointment or authority as agents could be obtained. This fact does not seem to have attracted the attention of the Supreme Court in the review of the case.</p>

Was it necessary to pass and record a resolution, as councilmen, appointing themselves agents of themselves to do this thing ? [It seems to me the only way to solve the problem of agency is to inquire and ascertain from the evidence what was their intention. How did they mean to be understood by others as acting ? Did they intend to have these men credited to the borough of Girard, and that the borough should pay them their price, or did they intend to pay the money themselves, without recourse on any one, and hold them, to be transferred at their pleasure when they could dispose of them to the best advantage? Did they intend to act as individuals or as agents and representatives of the corporation, in hiring these men ? • As was their intention, so was their character and capacity. If they were agents of the borough, acting in good faith for its interests, according to their best judgments, the corporation would be bound by their action, even though it had turned out that the men were not needed.”]</p>
