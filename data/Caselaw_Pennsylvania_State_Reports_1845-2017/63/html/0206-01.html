They also gave in evidence the will of Messer dated August 4th 1843. Messer died in October of the same year. The will was not given in the paper-books, but it appeared to be assumed by all, that by it the lot was devised to the plaintiff. Peter Mayor testified that in 1848 he went on the lot to collect rent as administrator of the widow of Messer; there was then an occupied house on the lot; the occupant said he was not able to pay rent but would pay the taxes; the plaintiff was born June 9th 1842. William Lynch testified that shortly after the tax sale, the guardian of the plaintiff and himself went together to look for the lot, they found a dwelling-house fronting on the street and an unoccupied house on the back of the lot. In 1865 witness called on the defendant who then lived on the lot; there was then a double house on it; the defendant claimed the lot as hers.</p>

      <em>“ </em>There is perhaps no branch of our law more difficult to define with certainty than that relating to tax sales; and as regards the present case, it will be better understood and equally serve the purpose, to give you general instructions, than to answer specially each particular proposition presented by the learned gentlemen on either side. The plaintiff has shown what we call a primfi facie title — that is, a title which will entitle him to your verdict if the defendant has shown nothing to prevent it. Because, if Francis Messer or Mercier, the plaintiff’s ancestor, was in possession, by himself or his tenants, under the sale and other deeds in evidence, he would have a right to recover against a new intruder.” * * *</p>

The plaintiff would be entitled to recover unconditionally, as the effect of such a redemption, if in time and of sufficient amount, would annul the tax sale althogether. * * *</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b209-13" data-blocks='[["BL_209.13",209,[237,2233,1164,217]],["BL_210.1",210,[254,414,1172,2026]],["BL_211.1",211,[212,420,1167,379]]]'>“ But the second question in the case is, whether the lot, at the date of the assessment and tax sale on the assessment book or tax duplicate, is marked vacant. We have not and never had, I believe, any other assessment book or separate lists of seated and unseated lands in this county, than is shown by the duplicates on <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>which the assessments are marked. On the duplicate, this lot was marked vacant and the owner a non-resident. But as regards tax sales there is a wide distinction between the meaning of the words <em>vacant </em>and <em>unseated. </em>They arp by no means convertible terms. A lot may be entirely vacant and not unseated; and in this county and at the date of this sale, there was another and different remedy or mode of procedure provided for the collection of taxes from property which was not unseated, but only vacant. The word unseated is not, in its technical meaning, very easily applicable to city property, and the Supreme Court has nearly excluded its application to such property altogether. A city or town lot such as this can only be regarded as unseated, and subject as such to sale, when the owner has abandoned it without the intention of reclaiming it. It is not a suspension of occupancy or possession, but a total abandonment of the property, that is meant by the term unseated. The term originated in the practice among early settlers of taking up a tract, building a cabin and occupying it a few years till they saw something elsewhere that pleased them better, then getting up and leaving. Lands so abandoned became unseated, and the term still retains its original meaning. * * <em>* </em>Taking the word unseated in this sense, you will perhaps find it difficult to say that this lot was unseated when assessed for the taxes for which it was sold. If Messer’s lot had a shanty on it, and by himself of tenants was occupying it, it was seated when so occupied. Messer left it and. moved to another part of the country. His tenant also left it, and finally the shanty disappeared; the last seen of it was a post standing in 1851, according to the witness Gang. But had Messer abandoned it, intending to relinquish ownership in it, or was it a mere suspension of possession, leaving it unoccupied until it suited his convenience to do otherwise with it, as hundreds of lots are left in large cities, on which the respective owners still set great value ? If this lot was unseated, according to the sense in which I have explained the term, and plaintiff did not redeem, your verdict should be for the defendant. But if it was seated and merely vacant, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff; and this raises the question whether in case you find for the plaintiff, the verdict should be absolute or conditional on payment of defendant’s improvements. [I instruct you, that the value of defendant’s improvements may be assessed and the time specified for their payment.] If any case justifies such finding when seated property has been sold, it is this. The plaintiff, or those under whom he claims, stood by until the property passed out of the hands of the original purchasers, and the vendee had put valuable improvements on it. I incline to think that principles of general equity would compel him to make compensation under the circumstances, even without the aid of the Act of Assembly. [If you find for the plaintiff, therefore, you will value or assess the value of the im<a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>provements made by tbe defendant, and designate tbe time within which plaintiff must pay the amount, in order to entitle him to possession.] In doing this deal as fairly as possible between these parties. A good deal is said about values enhanced by change of times, hut this applies as well to the lot as the improvements, so that the relative value between them may still be observed. In accordance with the foregoing view, the points of law presented by the learned counsel on either side may be regarded as affirmed or denied.”</p>
