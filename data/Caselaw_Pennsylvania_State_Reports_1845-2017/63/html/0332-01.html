On the 24th of August 1866 the testator had been declared a lunatic. His committee, on the 24th of January 1866, leased his land to James Buckley on the shares, for one year, commencing April 1st 1866, part of the house being reserved for the testator. He died on the 31st of March 1866. Buckley went into possession April 1st 1866, and on 4th or 6th April 1867 the defendant took possession of the land under the Landlord and Tenant Acts, Buckley having held it under instructions given by the heirs, including the plaintiff, as long as he could. As owner of the land, the defendant demanded the rent from Buckley; one of the executors received part of the rent; the defendant said it did not make any difference whether he or the executors received the rent. The executors, under advice of counsel, collected the rent. The estate of the testator was unsettled; there was no personal estate of the testator not disposed of, and it would require more than the per<a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>sonal estate to pay the debts. About the 1st of April 1867 the defendant tendered to the plaintiff $700 as the amount of her legacy; she refused to take it. On the trial of the case, January 24th 1868, the defendant paid $700 into court in pursuance of the tender.</p>

The case, therefore, did not fall within the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court under the 59th section of the Act of 24th of February 1884. It is equally clear that, by the acceptance of the devise, Hamilton became personally liable for the legacies, and that their payment could be enforced by an action of assumpsit in the Court of Common Pleas: Lobach’s Case, <a href="/watts/6/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="6 Watts 167" data-case-ids="1846069" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0167-01">6 Watts 167</a>; Montgomery <em>v. </em>McElroy, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20372" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 372">3 W. &amp; S. 372</a>; Hoover <em>v. </em>Hoover, 5 Barr 351; Mohler’s Appeal, 8 Barr 26; Hackadorn’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%2086" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="1 Jones 86">1 Jones 86</a>.</p>

This grows out of the nature of the liability assumed by the acceptance of the devise. From the time of acceptance in such a case as this, where no clog or condition is imposed upon the possession or enjoyment of the land devised, the devisee’s title takes effect. He is entitled to the immediate possession, unless it is held under an outstanding lease, and then he is entitled to the rents and issues of the land, as landlord, by the operation of the will. Such sums charged by a testator on the person of his devisee are not pure legacies as those <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>are which the executor must pay, and, therefore, are not within the general rule that legacies are not payable until the end of the year and do not bear interest until then. There is no estate to be settled by the devisee and no reason for delay. As soon as he accepts the devise he assumes the burthen, and is also entitled to the profits of the estate he accepts, when not encumbered by the testator by other provisions. Hamilton claimed the possession of the land soon after the testator’s death, and claimed the rent of Buckley, the tenant. There was no doubt of his acceptance of the devise immediately after Moore’s death. The fact that the heirs of Moore resisted Hamilton’s right to possession does not alter the case, unless it had been done by the plaintiffs to his detriment. Of this there appears to be no evidence.</p>
