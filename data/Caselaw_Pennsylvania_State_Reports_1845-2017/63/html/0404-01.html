Admitting, then, what the witness testifies to be true,' we think it affords no excuse for the delay, which we also think was unreasonable.

The business of the agent led him through the different places we have stated and detained him necessarily on the road, and he was therefore not obliged, nor could it be expected, while so doing that he would transmit this draft for collection to New York, nor would there be in fact any opportunity to negotiate it until he reached his own home in New Jersey.</p>
