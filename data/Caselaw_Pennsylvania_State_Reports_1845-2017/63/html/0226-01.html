      <em>“ </em>In this case, Elizabeth township offered the bounty on the 18th of February 1865, and the five men in question were not put in until some time afterwards. There was then an offer on one side to pay, and its acceptance on the other, by the putting in of the substitutes; and this I think amounted to a contract to pay, which could be enforced against the township, and if it could, Alexander McClure was right in paying the money upon it.</p>

It is true that it is the word “ volunteers” that is used in the resolution, but it is equally true that it is the word “ volunteers” that is used in the first section of the Act of 25th of August 1864, authorizing the school directors to raise money to pay bounties, and that the very money, which by the first section they are authorized to raise specifically to pay bounties to volunteers, they are authorized by the 3d section to pay for bounties to persons putting in substitutes, or to substitutes themselves, when the principals have not paid them. The word volunteers in the Act of Assembly covers as well those who volunteered to pay money to others to go into the service, as 'those who volunteered to go in themselves, and I cannot see why it <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>should have a narrower signification in the resolution of these school directors. The great object of the school directors and of the people whom they represented,was to get the quota filled so as to escape the draft, and it made little difference to them whether it was filled by persons volunteering to go into the service themselves, or to pay substitutes for going in. The one was as effective for filling the quota and avoiding the draft as the other.” * ■ *</p>

They were volunteers when enlisted and when the bounties were paid. They became substitutes only in the event that members of the association were drafted. The Act of Congress expressly provided that they should be put in before the draft, and the regulations of the provost marshal general, made under the law, provided that they should be credited to the sub-district to ■ which the associations belong; and prescribed the order in which they should become substitutes for the members of the association, if any should be drafted.</p>

They enlisted voluntarily and not in place of any one. The government recognising that fact paid them a bounty as volunteers, permitted them to select their own regiments and mustered them in at once before the draft. The fact that they were procured by the associations to enter the service does not detract from their own character as volunteers; nor is this character changed by the subsequent draft of members of the association, and their then standing as substitutes of the members drawn. This is simply the reward offered by the government to the association for its service in procuring the volunteers. Being in fact volunteers they were credited generally to the sub-district, and would stand as a general <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>credit if none of the members of the association should be drawn. The only operation the Act of Congress had, was, when a member of the association should be drawn, to cause the general credit then to enure to the particular benefit of the association procuring the volunteer, thus screening its drafted member from service, as the reward of the association for its service in procuring the volunteer. These five men being volunteers when the bounty was paid, the time of the passage of the Act of Congress can make no difference. There was no error in allowing the estate of McClure the credit for their payment. This renders the other question as to the amount stated of no importance.</p>
