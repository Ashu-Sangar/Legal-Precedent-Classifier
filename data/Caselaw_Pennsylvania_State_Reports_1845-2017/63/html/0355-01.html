It is true, they charge themselves with the appraised value and excess in the sale of the goods of the decedent, and also with the rights and credits due, described as cash on hand, bonds, notes and other evidences of debt, amounting to $3746.38, and they set forth their disbursements. Items of charge and discharge to the extent stated, had been administered and settled, and the account confirmed. But being a partial account expressly, and so intended by the executors, it did not operate in any way on items of charge or discharge not included in it, and it concluded only those that were. Subsequently, in their final account, the executors claimed credits not claimed in the partial account. These had mostly arisen when the test of collecting the debts, due the estate was applied. In some cases, receipts of the testator were in the hands of debtors, without being endorsed on the evidences of the debts due in the executor’s hands; and in others the debts proved entirely uncollectable. These were items of discharge against the charge of the debts to the executors in the inventory, which were not known, stated or passed upon in the partial account. It was insisted, however, that as the executors had charged themselves with the inventory of the debts due, in their partial account, that precludes any credit in their final account for partial payments of those debts, or of those which have turned out desperate. This is not correct, according to the principle of Rhoads’ Appeal. The charge of the debts due the estate did not preclude* credits. Those claimed now were not passed upon then, and of course, the case cited did not bar them. Had the credits been claimed and <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>allowed, although erroneously, they would have stood, unless relieved by a bill of review.</p>

These disbursements were cash disbursements, not credits for receipts against claims, or for desperate debts, and thus far, therefore, that account is conclusive. The items excepted to and disallowed as credits by the auditor and court, not being in the partial account, were not determined by it, and should not have been excluded, on the principle of the case cited, and Shindel’s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 43, but should have been allowed as credits in the final account, if otherwise entitled on their merits. The items thus referred to are in the sixth exception to the executors’ account.

It is true that the statement of the executors showing the sale of the real estate, and the amount received therefrom, and the balance due, was made on a citation requiring it to be filed in the register’s office at the same time they were cited to file a final account of the personalty. The executors filed their account of the realty there. This was but an irregularity, which ought not to vitiate what was done in regard to it in the Orphans’ Court after it was certified there by the register. This court had undoubted jurisdiction of this account, as appears by the 19th section of the Act of 16th of June 1836, Art. YIII.

This bid was made before, in fact, the land was advertised for sale, and it was neither withdrawn nor renewed afterwards, when the land was by advertisement notoriously for sale; but the auditor finds that the executors always represented that they had a bid of $75 per acre by persons looking at the property with a view to buy ; and that, notwithstanding, they sold it to Margaret Leslie in January 1866, for about $53.38 per acre. The executors insisted that they had sold to her only 195 acres. Had this been so, it would not have equalled the bid made by half the amount of the surcharge. But then the auditor finds that the executors sold to her in fact 224 acres, and properly enough concluded that they are not exonerated from responsibility if they acted so negligently as to sell largely more than they intended. Without discussing this more <em>in extenso, </em>the auditor finds, what must be a finality to this controversy in the absence of anything to show an error in it— viz., that “ the fair market value of the land in 1865, after the death of the widow, when the executors advertised it and offered it for sale, was $75 per acre.

The auditor winds up his report as follows: — “ Viewing this transaction in this light, I am of opinion that it shows such negligence, such default on the part of these executors, acting as they were, in the capacity of trustees, as brings the case within the rule stated by Rogers, J., in Moore’s Appeal, 10 Barr 438, that a trustee may be surcharged beyond the actual profits where there is satisfactory proof of supine negligence or wilful default; and therefore surcharge the executors with the difference between the price they did receive, $12,000, and the price I find from the evidence they might and should have received, $16,861.87J, which difference is $4861.87J.” This is a finding of supine negligence on part of the executors in the sale of the property in question, whereby the <em>cestuy que trustents </em>would be greatly damaged unless <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>they are surcharged. The rule to surcharge in such cases to the extent of the injury is not to be doubted: Moore’s Appeal, <em>supra; </em>Springer’s Estate, 1 P. F. Smith 342.</p>
    <p id="ArDA" data-blocks='[["BL_369.6",369,[217,550,1159,388]]]'>The able argument of the counsel for the appellants might cause a doubt of the accuracy of the auditor’s finding; but he put us in possession of nothing by which it could on the facts be tested, and set aside, if wrong. We are, therefore, constrained to affirm the decree of the court in so far as it relates to the account of the executors in the management and sale of the real estate; but we reverse, as already stated, the decree confirming the executors’ account of the personal estate, with costs to be paid by the appellees. As to the account confirmed, the costs are to be paid by appellants.</p>
    <p id="b369-7" data-blocks='[["BL_369.7",369,[216,939,1159,217]]]'>We think that the court should open the decree thus declined to be affirmed, in order to allow the executors to present any claim they may have for disbursements and expenses incident to the sale of the real estate, and accruing thereon. This would be equitable and just, and is recommended to the court.</p>
    <p id="b369-8" data-blocks='[["BL_369.8",369,[216,1154,1159,381]]]'>It seems there was an issue ordered and tried to inform the conscience of the court as to some of the controverted matters, perhaps before the auditor. It is probable that its result may have confirmed some of the findings of the auditor. This we do not know, however, but that issue is not before us in any shape or form. The decree of the court seems to have been based upon the auditor’s report alone, and so was the argument here. We have nothing to do with the feigned issue, as no part of it is before us.</p>
