The timber in question had belonged to John Shoup and William Wilkinson, who brought it to Pittsburg in the spring of 1865; they put it into the charge of Thomas Stephens and authorized him to sell it.

These points are answered in the affirmative, with this explanation or qualification in regard to the alleged assent or encouragement by Stephens, viz.: If such alleged assent or encouragement is predicated of the evidence to the effect that Hill alleged to Baum and Stephens that <em>he </em>was <em>authorized </em>to sell the lumber, and thereupon, Stephens, on that account, supposing himself to be superseded, declined to take any part in the sale, but informed Baum that Hill was responsible for what he did, and afterwards gave it <em>as his </em>opinion, when interrogated by Baum, that he supposed that Shoup &amp; Wilkinson had not themselves, up to that time, made any sale to Poor &amp; Canfield. This, we instruct you, would not, on Stephens’ part, if he was ignorant of want of authority in Hill, amount to any such assent or encouragement as would divest Shoup &amp; Wilkinson’s title, and transfer it to Baum &amp; Carrier, or constitute a valid sale of property. His assenting to Hill’s acting as agent for Shoup &amp; Wilkinson, upon Hill’s assertion that <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>he had authority so to act, could neither constitute nor ratify a sale by Hill, in which Stephens declined to take part, and his information to Baum, when inquired of afterwards, that, in his opinion, Shoup &amp; Wilkinson had not made any prior sale, when it was true that no prior sale had been made, and his statement that Hill was a responsible party for his acts, could not be construed as such encouragement as would prejudice Shoup &amp; Wilkinson’s title, but was rather calculated to put Baum on his guard as to Hill’s authority to sell.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b83-6" data-blocks='[["BL_83.5",83,[216,814,1160,591]]]'>“ 3d Point. We cannot instruct in accordance with this proposition. Fraud on the part of Hill, in making the sale, might affect the right of Baum &amp; Carrier, if such fraud as is alleged here did exist, and of this we cannot say there is no evidence. The fraud alleged is that Hill pretended, both to Stephens and Baum, that he was authorized to sell the timber, when, in truth and in fact, he had no authority at all so to do. If this is true, Hill’s sale to Carrier &amp; Baum conferred no title to the property, and the timber could be demanded and recovered of them by the rightful owners. Unless Hill had power from the owners, or their agent, to sell, his professed power and sale under it, would be a fraud, and, unless ratified afterwards by Shoup &amp; Wilkinson, or their authorized agent, with full knowledge of the facts, it would confer no title on Baum &amp; Carrier.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b83-7" data-blocks='[["BL_83.6",83,[212,1414,1163,689]]]'>“ 4th Point. This proposition is true, and is affirmed; but I would say this, in regard to it, if Poor was not deceived by Hill’s assertion of authority, or the implied assertion, by reason of same, and made the settlement referred to, with knowledge of Hill’s defective or doubtful power to sell, and of Carrier &amp; Baum’s doubtful, or disputed title, under it — in other words, with a knowledge of all the facts and circumstances in regard to it, and made the adjustment of his and Canfield’s interest therein with such knowledge, the plaintiffs would be estopped, as herein asserted; but if Poor made this settlement and adjustment of his claim, under the impression induced by Hill, or Baum &amp; Carrier, that it was an actual bond, fide sale to Carrier &amp; Baum, or to Hill himself, when, in fact, it was only a pretended or void sale, then the transaction referred to in this point would not have the effect to estop Poor &amp; Canfield from subsequently purchasing of Shoup &amp; Wilkinson, when they discovered they had been deceived.</p>

The title by them subsequently acquired, would not enure to Carrier &amp; Baum’s benefit, if the settlement and adjustment of his claim was predicated of the representation and belief that Carrier &amp; Baum had actually purchased the property from an authorized agent, when, in fact, their alleged purchase was void. On the other hand, if, as aforesaid, he made the settlement and adjusted his interest in the property with a knowledge <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>of the actual facts and circumstances in regard to Baum &amp; Carrier’s alleged purchase, or in regard to their defective title, he would • be held as a trustee for their use, under his subsequent purchase.</p>

Taking possession of the property, without removing it, may or may not be a conversion, under the circumstances. There may be a joint possession, and possession without conversion, and even work done on it, without conversion. The conversion of property is when the party takes exclusive possession, and converts it to his own uses and purposes, or withholds it from the owner; and this is a question of fact, which I refer to you, under the evidence. If such conversion by Baum &amp; Carrier took place before sale to, and possession by Poor, as alleged, about the 4th of October, the plaintiffs here cannot recover.</p>

The evidence is for you, hut our recollection is, that the notes were not merely offered to, hut received and taken away by Jackson and Hill, both the note previously given in settlement of Canfield &amp; Poor’s interest, and the note to Shoup &amp; Wilkinson, or for their interest; and we do not recollect any evidence of Poor’s agency to receive the note for Shoup &amp; Wilkinson, nor that it had been endorsed by them, or if they were not payees, and whether the payee had endorsed, or any evidence of Poor &amp; Canfield’s or Shoup &amp; Wilkinson’s acceptance of this note, of the larger amount, and how, and for what purpose it was left in that place, although seen at their place, and taken away, according to the testimony of McClure, by Jackson and Hill.</p>

If there is no evidence in the case of aggravation, affecting Carrier &amp; Baum, this point is correct; but whether there is such evidence, under all the testimony, we leave to you. The theory of the defence, in regard to it, is, that Carrier &amp; Baum were bonfi fide purchasers, through Hill, without knowledge of his defective authority, and that the other parties defendants are, besides Hill, the mere employees of Carrier &amp; Baum, for rafting and running their timber. If this is the correct theory of the case, in this respect, then the defendants’ proposition is correct, and the damages are to be ascertained and assessed as therein stated, if the verdict is for the plaintiffs. But the plaintiffs’ theory of the case is different, and, according to it, they allege that there is evidence of aggravation, affecting Carrier &amp; Baum, in this, that they were aware, or had reason to be informed, of Hill’s want of power to sell to them; that the question of his power was the subject of discussion between them and Stephens, and that when their employee and agent, Andrew Jackson, was informed by Shoup, in the presence of Hill, that Shoup &amp; Wilkinson had neither made nor authorized any such sale, Hill admitted <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>this, but said he had authority from somebody else, and Jackson, thereupon, declared he would take the timber, whether or no, and the timber was taken accordingly. All this, and other circumstances of evidence in the case, the plaintiffs allege, manifest a common interest in the defendants, or couple Carrier &amp; Baum with the transaction, which was intended to get the property out of the possession of its rightful owners, by pretence of purchase, at the point of time when Carrier &amp; Baum were buying up all the timber in the market, with a view to enhance the market price. This is the theory of the plaintiffs, in regard to this part of the case, and which theory is correct, is entirely a question for you to determine. But if you find, from the evidence in the case, that it (the plaintiffs’) is true, and the plaintiffs, on the other grounds in the case, are entitled to a verdict, they are entitled, if, in your opinion, the justice of the case demands it, to a higher measure of damages than that which is indicated in this point of the defendants.</p>

The objection was that the interrogatory was leading, and that, therefore, the answer ought not to be received. The court overruled the objection, holding that an objection to the character of the interrogatory should have been made by the defendants before the commission issued. This was a good reason for the ruling, especially as the defendants joined in the commission by filing cross-interrogatories. This has been often held; but I need only cite Overton <em>v. </em>Tracey, 14 S. &amp; R. 311, which is at hand, as sufficient authority on the point. The 73d rule of court is not applicable to the point — that refers to objections to depositions taken, and perhaps to the execution of commissions. This error, we think, is not sustained.</p>

      <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>Nor do we think that the second exception below is any better founded. The witness Prescott had spoken of a rise in the price of timber in the autumn of 1865, the same season in which the controversy arose. Having so stated the fact in a general way, the plaintiff’s counsel proposed to ask him, “ what was the extent of the sudden rise in the price of timber of which you speak?” It seems to me this was proper to be asked, if what he had said was testimony, and it was not objected to, in order to give definiteness to what he had already said. Whether it would have any applicability to, or effect in the case, eventually, would depend on subsequent testimony. The court could not reject it at that stage of the case. There was no error, therefore, in receiving it. If the only ground of controversy had been the amount of damages which the plaintiffs were entitled to receive there would have been more plausibility in the objection at that point of the controversy, although not more of soundness ; but the defence was that no damage, was to be recovered at all — that they were not liable to any. Hence it seemed somewhat inconsistent to object that such testimony might subject them to too high a rate of damages, while denying liability to any. At all events, the question was properly allowed, and the answer to be given.</p>
    <p id="b87-6" data-blocks='[["BL_87.5",87,[205,1335,1160,174]]]'>There are twelve other assignments of error, These are upon the answers of the court to the points submitted by the defendants' counsel, and to portions of the general charge. We see nothing in any of them that looks like error, or requires much discussion.</p>
    <p id="b87-7" data-blocks='[["BL_87.6",87,[202,1508,1162,944]],["BL_88.1",88,[276,424,1158,123]]]'>The 3d, 4th and 5th assignments relate to the effect of an alleged assent of Stephens, the agent of Shoup &amp; Wilkinson, to a sale of the timber in controversy, by Hill, one of the defendants, to Carrier &amp; Baum. There was certainly abundance of testimony to go to the jury tending to show that if any assent of Stephens was given to a sale of the timber by Hill it was under the belief that Hill had authority from Shoup &amp; Wilkinson to make the sale, superinduced thereto by the declarations of Hill that he had such authority. It was contended by the plaintiffs below that if any assent were given by Stephens, or acquiescence in the sale by him, it was thus induced. If this were so, such an assent, so induced, would not bind the owners, or anybody. If he was simply the agent in the business of Shoup <em>&amp; </em>Wilkinson, to sell the timber, he could not delegate his power so as to bind them, even if he had attempted it. <em>Delegatus non delegare potest. </em>The answers, and body of instructions on this point of the case, were, proper, and as favorable to the defendants as they had any right to expect. It was referred to the jury to say whether Stephens had assented to the sale by Hill, without being misled by him as to his authority to so sell, with the instruction, if such were the case, the plaintiffs could not recover; but if he was misled, and there was no authority in Hill to make the sale, they might. <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>This is the substance of the instructions, and they certainly were as favorable to the defendants as they could reasonably claim to have them.</p>
    <p id="b88-6" data-blocks='[["BL_88.5",88,[276,553,1160,388]]]'>The sixth assignment also is not sustained. It is to the answer of the court to the third point of the defendants below. It is certainly true, as was in substance said by the learned judge, that if Hill, through fraud, and without authority, made sale of the timber to Carrier &amp; Baum, no title passed, and did not prevent the owners from selling it to other parties. To hold the contrary would be to assent to the doctrine of market overt, although not applicable to our times, and more, for Hill had not even the possession of the property he was selling.</p>
    <p id="b88-7" data-blocks='[["BL_88.6",88,[276,941,1162,726]]]'>The answer to the defendants’ fourth point was also unobjectionable. It was to the effect that if Poor, on behalf of Canfield and himself, was not deceived by Hill’s claim of a right to sell the property, and became a party in selling out their alleged interest in it to Carrier &amp; Baum, they might be estopped from holding for themselves under a purchase from Shoup &amp; Wilkinson. But if he made a settlement of their interest in the belief that Hill had authority, while, in fact, he had none, his contract to secure himself and his partner in the timber or lien' upon it, would, under such circumstances, not estop them in asserting title as against Carrier &amp; Baum, under a bond, fide purchase from the owners. The defendants cannot be allowed to claim an estoppel arising out of the misrepresentations or fraud of their agent or their own. This is a principle too consonant with justice to need a reference to authorities to prove. The instructions, therefore, on this point were altogether right and proper, and the submission of these positions to the jury was right.</p>
    <p id="b88-8" data-blocks='[["BL_88.7",88,[277,1667,1159,173]]]'>These remarks are applicable also to the answer of the court to the defendants’ 5th point, which involves the same principle as that contained in the 4th point, and this disposes of the 8th and 9th assignments of error.</p>
    <p id="b88-9" data-blocks='[["BL_88.8",88,[277,1840,1159,256]]]'>In regard to the answer of the court to the defendants’ 6th point, which is the matter of the 10th assignment of error, we think the assignment is not sustained. At what time, place, and in what circumstances, conversion of the timber took place was a questioq solely for the jury, and this was the direction of the court on the subject, and was right.</p>
    <p id="b88-10" data-blocks='[["BL_88.9",88,[278,2095,1160,215]]]'>The 11th, 12th and 13th errors áre not substantially assigned in accordance with the rules, and we need not discuss them <em>in ex-tenso, </em>but in truth this is of little consequence in the case, for we have examined them and find no error in the answers of the court of which they are predicated.</p>
    <p id="b88-11" data-blocks='[["BL_88.10",88,[282,2311,1159,128]],["BL_89.1",89,[216,401,1161,1033]]]'>The 14th and last assignment of error is to the remark of the learned judge in his general charge, that “ Hill, if not the agent of the owners of the timber in the transaction, must have been <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>the agent of the purchasers from, or through him. A broker is the mutual agent of the seller and buyer, when authorized to sell, and in consequence, Baum &amp; Carrier would be visited with the conse.quences of his acts.” We see not wherein injury could have resulted to the defendants from the remark quoted. The defendants claimed through a sale made by Ilill, not through a sale by Shoup. Nothing like that, we think, appeared in the case, and there was enough in the case to enable a jury to draw the inference, at least there was enough to be submitted to the jury to draw the inference, that Carrier &amp; Baum became the purchasers through the agency of Hill. If so, and he had no authority to sell to them, they would take no title, and they could not escape responsibility for converting the property to their own use to which they had no right. The true import of the remark and its purpose, was to assert that if Hill had no authority in the premises, the defendants’ purchase from him would be no protection to them, and that they would be responsible for the property to the plaintiffs if they were invested with the title. This was right beyond a question. We see no necessity or call for any more elaboration of this case than we have given it, although the assignments of error are numerous and the discussion of the several questions assumed a very wide range. Therefore, seeing no error in the various rulings of the learned judge, we are brought to the conclusion that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>
