Power had been advanced $1000; on the 28th of August 1848, William Power had been advanced $4000, the price of a tract of 100 acres of land that day conveyed to him by his father; on the 30th, John F. Power was advanced to the same amount; and in the same manner Evan W. Power on the 26th of November 1853, was advanced $1500, besides $1834 in various sums at different times. On receiving advancements, these sons acknowledged in writing under seal that the sums received were in full of any share or dividends coming to them respectively out of their father’s real and personal estate; John, William and Evan executed formal releases “ of and from the said share or dividend of the estate aforesaid, and of and from all actions, suits, payments, accounts, reckonings, claims and demands whatever, for or by reason thereof.”</p>

At the time of his death, he was the owner of a tract of land containing 237 acres and 67 perches, which was appraised by the inquest at $225 per acre, but, under an order of court for the sale of it, the highest bid offered for it was $150 per acre. His personal estate amounted to $5695.39.</p>
    <p id="b446-12" data-blocks='[["BL_446.17",446,[278,1458,1156,597]]]'>The father, in his lifetime, had divided a portion of his estate amongst his four sons, James Power, John E. Power, William Power and Evan W. Power, and each contracted to receive their respective portion, in full of his share of the real and personal estate of their father, and released all claim thereto. A sum of $3000 was given to a married daughter, which had been held to be only an advancement, and not a purchase of her right as an heir. If this arrangement is sustained, which it should be, in strict justice, the persons entitled, as heirs, to the real and personal estate of the decedent, are the two unmarried daughters, Harriet Power and Mary Ellen Power, the two married daughters, Margaret Speers and Frances Houseman bringing in their respective advancements, the children of Jane Thomas, deceased, and the children of Hannah Fry, deceased.</p>

An heir, or an expectant devisee or legatee, may, in the lifetime of the intestate or testate, in equity, sell or assign his expectant or contingent interest, whatever it may turn out to be, upon the death of the person from whom it may come, which contract, if made upon a valuable consideration, a court of equity will enforce. If so, there can be no reason why a father <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>should not make such a contract with a son, which should entirely bar all his claim as an heir to any part of his parent’s estate.</p>
