In three of the squares the lots run up to them, and in front of them, giving ten lots on the south and east of the north-east public square; six lots on the north and east of the south-east public square; and five lots on the north and west of the south-west public square; but no lots are placed on the squares. So the lots continue along High street to the centre square, both from Delaware and Schuylkill Front streets, but stop at its boundaries. The second plan agrees with the former; but in addition, the north-east and south-east squares have written on their face ‘eight acres for public uses;’ the north-west,eight acres given for public uses, by Wm. Penn, Esq.;’ the south-west, ‘ eight acres allotted for public uses, &amp;c.’ On the centre square is written, ‘ Centre Square, ten acres.’ This is strong evidence to show that these spaces of ground were laid out as squares for public uses, distinct from the streets and lots, and other property in the city bounds, when the original plan of the city was made by its founder.</p>
