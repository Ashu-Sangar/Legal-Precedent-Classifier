The specifications allege error (1) in discharging the rule, and (2) in not entering judgment, in favor of plaintiff company, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nFor reasons given by the learned president of the court below, in his opinion discharging the rule, we think he was quite right in substantially holding that the averments of fact contained in defendant\u2019s affidavits were sufficient to prevent a summary judgment, and thus carry the case to a jury.\nThe appeal is accordingly dismissed at plaintiff\u2019s costs, but without prejudice to its right to trial by jury, and a second ap- - peal after final judgment.",

    "head_matter": "The Rockwell Manufacturing Company, Appellant, v. The Cambridge Springs Company.\nAffidavit of defense\u2014Contract\u2014Belay.\nIn an action to recover the price of lumber an affidavit of defense is sufficient which avers that the defendant had suffered great loss and inconvenience in its business, by reason of delay in delivering the lumber within the time agreed upon, and that \u201c on account of the lumber so to be delivered and the difficulty of finding such lumber in such large quantities, the defendant could not purchase such lumber and in such quantities from other parties and proceed with the finishing of the building, and was therefore compelled to wait on account of the delay caused by the neglect of the plaintiff to deliver the said lumber according to the contract.\u201d\nAffidavit of defense\u2014Belay-Assessment of damages.\nWhere an affidavit of defense to an action for lumber sold and delivered alleges damages resulting from delay in delivering the same, but inaccurately sets up the measure of damages, the court will apply the legal rule, if sufficient facts be stated to constitute a basis for the assessment of damages.\nAffidavit of defense\u2014Befects in goods sold\u2014Bamages.\nIn an action for the price of flooring, doors, paneling, etc., on agreement that they should be of \u201cfirst quality as to material and workmanship,\u201d an affidavit of defense is sufficient which alleges damages in a specified sum, resulting from \u201c defects in the material employed, in that the same was not properly seasoned, and by virtue thereof the same has shrunk so that the paneling is loose and joints opened, and this is the result as to much of the woodwork.\u201d\nArgued April 25, 1899.\nAppeal, No. 413, Jan. T., 1898, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. Crawford Co., Nov. T., 1897, No. 5, M. L. D., discharging rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\n\u2022 Before Sterrett, C. J., Green, Mc-Collum, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\n\u2022 Scire facias sur mechanic\u2019s lien, for flooring, doors, door frames, bases, window sides, casings, paneling, etc.\nRule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nThe material averments of the affidavit of defense are set forth in the opinion of Thomas, P. J., which was as follows:\nThe mechanic\u2019s lien hi this case is based upon an espistolary contract, a copy of which is filed with the bill of particulars, together with a claim for \u201c extras \u201d amounting to the net sum of $1,521.03. October 11, 1897, a scire facias was issued thereon and an affidavit of defense was filed November 1,1897, and on February 22, 1898, a supplemental affidavit of defense was filed in accordance with the rules of this court.\nThe entire damage resulting to defendant, as set up by the affidavit of defense, was from the fact that the plaintiff company failed to deliver the goods contracted for at the time agreed upon, and that by reason thereof the defendant company had suffered great loss and inconvenience in their business and the profits to be derived therefrom. It is strenuously urged by the plaintiff that these allegations are not sufficient to prevent judgment. It is true that our courts have regularly held that in cases of this nature the defendant cannot, after having accepted the goods contracted for, at a time later than that which the delivery was agreed upon, set up the said delay as a defense to plaintiff\u2019s recovery for the price thereof. The duty of defendant has been indicated to be to go into the market and secure his goods, and refuse to accept the ones formerly contracted for, when they arrive later than the time agreed upon.\nIf nothing more appeared in the affidavit of defense than what is above noted, we should certainly be obliged to hold that that was the duty of defendant in this case, and that in no event could it avail itself of this defense to the action; but by another paragraph of the original affidavit of defense we learn: \u201cThat on account of the lumber so to be delivered and the difficulty of finding such lumber in such large quantities, the defendant could not purchase such lumber and in such quantities from other parties and proceed with the finishing of the building, and was therefore compelled to wait on account of the delays caused by the neglect of the plaintiff to deliver the said lumber according to contract.\u201d\nFrom the case of Blakeslee Manufacturing Co. v. Hilton, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 189, upon which plaintiff in this case greatly relies, we are informed as to the duty of defendant on the failure of purchased goods to arrive on time, and also as to what will relieve him from such action, where the court says: \u201c The duty of the defendants, looking at the circumstances disclosed by the affidavit, was to supply themselves with another pump, from some other source, when the one they ordered from the plaintiff failed to arrive promptly. It was not to be manufactured specially, was not, so far as we can see, of new or peculiar pattern, and the inference to be drawn from the affidavit is that it belonged to a class of goods usually kept in stock. Nowhere is it intimated that one similar could not have been obtained, at once, elsewhere, and loss have been avoided.\u201d\nThis affidavit alleges the impossibility of obtaining at once, or at all, goods sufficient and of the kind and quality to fill the order and thus avoid delay.\nIt is averred that the plaintiff refused and neglected to make the delivery as per contract, although urged and requested so to do.\nTo say that a vendor can never become responsible for damages by reason of his delays would be radical, and if he might ever be so held, we think it is under just such circumstances as are recited in this affidavit.\nConsiderable was said in the argument as to the improbability of the truth of the statements in the affidavit of defense, as to their being unable to secure these goods of other firms or parties. Whatever may be thought of the reasonableness or unreasonableness of such statements, for the purposes of this case they must be taken as true. They are not at all impossible. It is also urged that the contract specifies no time for delivery. The affidavit of defense alleges that all goods were to be delivered in time to complete the hotel building by May, 1897. Take the contract as set forth by plaintiff it would be obliged to deliver the same within a reasonable time, unless prevented by defendant. It can hardly be asserted that a reasonable time would be more than fourteen months.\nPlaintiff alleges that the measure of damages for such delay is inaccurately set up in defendant\u2019s affidavit, and it cannot prevail. This may be true, but it is apparent that it has set up sufficient facts to constitute a basis for the assessment of damages under the legal rule by which they must be measured.\nThe supplemental affidavit of defense alleges a damage of $3,000, resulting from a defect in the material employed, in that the same was not properly seasoned, and by virtue thereof the same has shrunk so that the paneling is loose and joints opened, and that this is the result as to much if not all of the woodwork.\nThe plaintiff would, under any circumstances, be obliged to furnish material suitable for the purpose for which it was to be employed, but in its proposition to furnish this bill it says it is to be \u201c first quality as to material used and workmanship.\u201d\nPlaintiff alleges the injury herein recited is too vague and indefinite, and urges for our consideration the case of Vollmer v. Magowan, 180 Pa. 110, but we do not see that they can be fairly compared. True, a similar allegation was set forth in the affidavit in that ease when it averred that \u201cthe said furniture, consisting of tables, chairs, bedsteads, couches, cabinets, dressing cases, etc., were made of wood not thoroughly seasoned, so that the same have cracked, warped, split, and shrunk,\u201d etc., but this is joined with the recitation of many other defects in similar and dissimilar articles of an entirely different character, descriptions of some of which were certainly quite vague and indefinite. It did not specify the damage resulting from this defect, nor, as a matter of fact, from the combined defects recited in the affidavit. It nowhere attempts to inform plaintiff of the amount of damages claimed either for the combined or for specific defects, excepting where it alleges that certain articles of a valuable character were never delivered by virtue of which the defendant was damaged \u201c to the extent of about at least $1,000.\u201d The undelivered goods are not mentioned, specified, or described.\nThe Supreme Court simply decided that the affidavit was too vague and indefinite, which seems very apparent, but it does not appear to us that it rules this case. The defect alleged here is that the lumber was \u201c green \u201d or not properly seasoned, and that this applied to all or nearly all of the great bill furnished. Affiant goes on to describe the results produced by reason of this defect, and specifies the injury resulting therefrom, and we think it done with as much particularity as would be required in a statement of demand.\nWe consider these items of defense available, and that a further consideration of defenses set up is not necessary.\nError assigned was the order of the court.\nAlfred Gr. Church, for appellant.\nNondelivery of merchandise within a certain time is no defense, if the merchandise is finally accepted: Endlich on Affidavit of Defense, 415; McKay & Co. v. McKenna, 173 Pa. 581; Preston v. Finney, 2 W. & S. 53; Blakeslee Mfg. Co. v. Hilton, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 184; Culin v. Glass Works, 108 Pa. 220; Bunting v. Hopple, 2 W. N. C. 445.\nFrank P. Ray, for appellee, was not heard.\nMay 8, 1899:"
