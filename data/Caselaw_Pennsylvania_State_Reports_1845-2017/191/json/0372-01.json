Chief Justice Stebbett,\nThe sole question in this case is whether the averments of facts contained in the affidavits of defense are sufficient to prevent a summary judgment. In disposing of such questions, the truth of aE facts properly averred in the affidavit of defense must necessarily be conclusively presumed to be true, because the rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit is in the nature of a demurrer thereto. Applying this principle to the case before us, we are aE of opinion that the facts properly averred by the defendant are sufficient to carry the case to a jury; and hence there was error in making the rule for judgment absolute, etc.\nInasmuch as the case goes back for trial, further discussion of the questions involved in the defense that is interposed is neither necessary nor desirable.\nJudgment reversed and record remitted with a procedendo.",

T., 1898, by defendant, from order of C. P. Cumberland Co., May T., 1898, No. 57, making absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nReversed.\nRule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defense. Before Biddle, P. J.\nThe affidavit of defense was as follows:\nThe said Merchants Bank is indebted to the said James W. Eckels for professional services as attorney and for services rendered in the organization and promotion of said Merchants Bank in a sum largely in excess of the amount claimed by the plaintiff namely, $1,200 with interest from May 14, 1897.\nThat the defendant was employed in the preliminary organization and promotion of the Merchants National Bank, plaintiff, and in that employment did prepare all the papers incident to the incorporation of the same and did secure the charter therefor, and did prepare the constitution and by-laws for said bank and also fully complete the permanent organization thereof by securing subscribers to the capital stock, procuring and providing a place of business; preparing leases, purchasing necessary-equipment and furniture; advising and counseling from time to time as to matters of interest to the plaintiff from the time of the organization of said bank to July, 1897, -which said services remain unpaid at the time of the institution of this suit and for which a set-off is asked against the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\nIn a supplementary affidavit of defense the defendant averred that \u201cthe services in the before-mentioned affidavit of defense were rendered by him at the instance and request of all the promoters of the said Merchants Bank, a majority of said promoters thereafter being directors in said bank and said services were rendered with an understanding with all said promoters that said services should be paid for what they were reasonably worth.\u201d\nError assigned was the order of the court making absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nE. E. Belt.zhoover, with him II. S. Stuart, for appellant.\nThe law is settled that where a set-off is sworn to, the items and amount need not be stated provided it is said to exceed the plaintiff\u2019s claim: Runyan v. Crawford, 1 T. & H. Pr. sec. 419; Fletcher v. Bancroft, 1 T. & H. Pr. sec. 419.\nIt is sufficient that the defense be stated with certainty to a common intent: Hugg v. Scott, 6 Wh. 274; Thompson v. Clark, 56 Pa. 33; Selden v. Neemes, 43 Pa. 421; Twitchell v. McMurtrie, 77 Pa. 383; Link v. Wilson, 8 Mont. 142; Church v. Jones, 132 Pa. 462; Knerr v. Bradley, 105 Pa. 190; Bryson v.

C. 503.\nWhen the projectors of a company enter into contracts in behalf of a body not existing at the time, but to be called into existence afterwards, and the body for whom the projectors assumed to act does come into existence, it cannot take the benefit of the contract without performing that part of it which the projectors undertook that it should perform: Bell\u2019s Gap R.

Christy, 79 Pa. 59.\nQonrad Hambleton, for appellee.\nA corporation is not bound to pay for services rendered before its organization was perfected in procuring subscriptions to its capital stock: R., R. I. & St. L. R. R. Co. v. Sage, 65 Ill. 328; N. Y. & N. H. R. R. Co. v. Ketchum, 27 Conn. 170; Franklin Fire Ins. Co. v. Hart, 31 Md. 59; Western Screw and Mfg. Co. v.

Drake, 35 Kan. 564.\nTo be sufficient to prevent summary judgment, an affidavit of defense must contain all the facts necessary to constitute a legal answer to the statement of claim, and the omission thereof cannot be supplied by possible inference from the facts which are stated: Class v. Kingsley, 142 Pa. 636; Slag Works v. Krause & Sons, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 622; McCrackem v. Presbyterian Church, 17 W. N. C. 45; Endlich on Affidavits of Defense, sec. 515, Louchheim v. Becker, 3 W. N.
