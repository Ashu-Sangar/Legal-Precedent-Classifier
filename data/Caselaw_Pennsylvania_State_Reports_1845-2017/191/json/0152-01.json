Roberts, Appellant.\nPromissory notes\u2014Waiver of protest\u2014Indorser.\nIn an action against an indorser o\u00ed a promissory note the case is for the jury on the question of waiver of notice of protest where the plaintiff testifies that shortly before the note became due defendant came to his place of business and stated that he had been unfortunate- in business; that it \u2022would be impossible for him to pay the note, and that it would be useless for plaintiff to put the note in bank to have it protested.\nArgued March 28, 1899.\nAppeal, No. 88, Jan.

J.\nAt the trial it appeared that the note had not been protested, and that no notice of nonpayment had been sent to the defendant. Plaintiff testified that on March 30, 1897, about twelve days before the note became due, the defendant called upon him at his place of business \u201c and told me that he could not pay that note when it became due. He said that he had met with unfortunate business affairs, and it would be absolutely impossible for him to pay the note or raise the money to pay it in any way. He told me that it would be useless for me to put the note in bank, to have- it protested, as it would be absolutely impossible for him to pay it.\u201d\nThe court submitted the case to the jury.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1,096.33. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned among others was refusal of defendant\u2019s point, \u2022 which was as follows: \u201c Under the evidence the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d\nLouis P.
