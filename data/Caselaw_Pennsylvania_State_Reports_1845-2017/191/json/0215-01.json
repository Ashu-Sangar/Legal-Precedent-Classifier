    "head_matter": "John G. Platt v. The Belsena Coal Mining Company, Appellant.\nAppeals\u2014Interlocutory order\u2014Quashing appeal.\nAn order discharging a defendant\u2019s rule to show cause why the service of a bill in equity on a person named as defendant\u2019s agent should not be set aside is an interlocutory order from which no appeal lies.\nArgued April 19, 1899.\nAppeal, No. 402, Jan. T., 1898, by defendant, from order of C. P. Clearfield Co., May T., 1898, No. 3, discharging rule to set aside service of bill in equity.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McColltjm, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nRule to set aside bill in equity.\nGordon, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nThis case was heard on the petition and answer, which shows that John H. Kl.oclc, upon whom the bill was served as agent and superintendent of the Belsena Coal Mining Company, defendant, was, in fact, acting in the capacity indicated. It is true the petition alleges he was not an agent of the company \u201c upon whom service of the bill \u201d could be made, but that assertion is based upon the allegation that the petitioner, having been named as the company\u2019s agent, as required by the act of April 22, 1874, no legal service could be had upon any other agent. The agency of Klock being thus admitted, the service upon him would be good under the act of March 21, 1849: Hagerman v. Empire Slate Co., 97 Pa. 534; Benwood Iron Works v. Hutchinson, 101 Pa. 359;. Fulton v. Accident Association, 172 Pa. 117.\nBut it is claimed by petitioner that regardless of Klock\u2019s position as agent, the Company having designated him\u2014Deady\u2014 as its authorized agent in the state, Klock was not an agent on whom the service could be made; that for service purposes he was not an agent, and the cases of Liblong v. Kansas Fire Insurance Company, 82 Pa. 413, and Hagerman v. Empire Slate Co., 97 Pa. 534, were cited as sustaining that position. The question then arises, did defendant corporation comply with the act of 1874. In my opinion it did not do so. The certificate attached to the petition shows that Frank J. Deady, the petitioner, was named as agent on April 11,1898, while the service upon Klock was had March 31, 1898. But a certificate from the office of the secretary of the commonwealth was offered and admitted in evidence at argument on rule, showing that Hon. D. L. Krebs had been named as the authorized agent of the corporation, but it was admitted that he had no knowledge of having thus been named as agent until Deady was named as his successor on April 11,1898, and that the \u201c certificate of the secretary of the commonwealth \u201d of the filing of the statement was not \u201cpreserved for public inspection\u201d by him as agent, as required by the second section of said act, which evidence and' admission were received with same effect as if set out in an amendment to the petition.\nIt is true that where a remedy is provided by act of assembly it alone must be pursued, but this obligation rests upon all persons affected by it, and it especially rests upon the class of persons for whose benefit the law was enacted or which seeks to take advantage of it to defeat a proceeding which would otherwise be legal, especially as in this case where no injustice would apparently result from the service as made, and to set it aside would but result in additional expense and delay. In the case of Wintermute v. Central R. R. of N. J., 5 Pa. C. C. R. 648, it is held that the failure to preserve for public inspection the certificate required, prevents a foreign corporation from availing itself of the provisions of the act of 1874.\nThe rule is discharged.\nFrror assigned was the order of the court. Appellee moved to quash the appeal.\nRoland ID. Swoope, with him William F. Patton, Patterson $ Gleason and George H. Zeigler, for appellee, on motion to quash.\nThis appeal should be quashed: Lauer v. Lauer Brewing Co., 180 Pa. 596; Kendrick v. Overstreet, 3 S. & R. 357; Brown v. Ridgway, 10 Pa. 42; Holland v. White, 120 Pa. 228; Bennethum v. Bowers, 133 Pa. 332; Lycoming Fire Ins. Co. v. Storrs, 97 Pa. 354; Coleman\u2019s App., 75 Pa. 441; Transit Co. v. Pipe Line Co., 180 Pa. 224; Rand v. King, 134 Pa. 641; Annexation to Borough of Camp Hill, 142 Pa. 511; Darby v. Sharon Hill, 112 Pa. 66; Esling\u2019s App., 89 Pa. 205.\nHenry Q. Terry, with him Qourtland K. Bolles and Krebs \u00bf- Patterson, for appellants, contra.\nApril 24, 1899:"
