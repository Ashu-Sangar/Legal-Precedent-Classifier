That question was fairly submitted to the jury, who found for the plaintiff and assessed his damages at $4,562.50.\nIt is conceded that the judgment entered on the verdict should not be disturbed unless there is error in one or more' of the learned tria] judge\u2019s instructions or rulings. No such error is disclosed by the record; nor is there anything in any of the four specifications that requires discussion. They are all overruled, and the judgment of the court below is affirmed.",
