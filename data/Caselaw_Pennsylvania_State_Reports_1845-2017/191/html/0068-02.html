My executor or trustee of said fund shall annually pay so much of the net interest or <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>incomes of the trust estate to my son David personally as will be required for the support of my son David and family, during David’s life. ... In the event of sickness or other misfortune befalling my son David, so that he would come to want or destitute circumstances, then in that case said trustee shall have the right to use as much of the principal of the trust fund as will be necessary to supply such want, but the trustee shall be the judge of the necessity, and likewise the amount of principal to be used.”</p>
    <p id="b90-4" data-blocks='[["BL_90.5",90,[262,813,1172,353]]]'>The will then provides that if David dies leaving “ a widow and child or children living at his death, the trustees shall pay the interest or income of said trust fund for the support of the widow and child or children annually during the said widow’s widowhood.” “ Should my son at his death leave only a widow living, then said trustee shall pay her maintenance not exceeding two hundred dollars per annum during her widowhood,” etc.</p>
    <p id="b90-5" data-blocks='[["BL_90.6",90,[261,1174,1174,507]]]'>The will further provides: “ that at the marriage or death of my said son’s widow, whichever may first occur, the principal of the said trust fund, whether in money or real estate, shall go and descend to the child or children of my son David, which were living at his death, their heirs and <em>assigns; </em>and should my son not leave a child or children or other descendants living at Ms death, then the whole of said trust fund, remaining in the hands of the trustee, whether in real or personal estate, shall go and descend to my said daughter, Annie Musser, her heirs and assigns.”</p>

As we have seen, the will provides that, in certain contingencies, any child, children or other descendants of appellant who may be living at the time of his decease will be entitled to the corpus of the trust or so much thereof as may remain unexpended under the terms of the trust. Although, as yet, appellant is childless, there still exists the possibility of his having children or other descendants who may be living at the time of his decease.</p>

It provides for future possible contingent interests which are not now represented by any one competent to act, and hence it cannot be set aside by any form of transfer or agreement. One of its provisions is that, from and after the death or marriage of appellant’s widow, whichever may first occur, “the principal of said trust fund, whether in money or real estate, shall go and descend to the child or children of my said son . . . . living at his death,” etc. In order to give effect to the full intention of the testatrix, as to the interests that are to be enjoyed under this and other provisions of the will, the trust must be sustained. The learned auditor and court below were therefore right in upholding the trust and awarding one half of the net fund to the trustee.</p>

It is needless to say that this is a purpose quite foreign to the office of a proviso, as the same is generally understood, but, it is impossible to read and consider the act as a whole without coming to the conclusion that the improper use of the proviso was intended to have the enlarging effect claimed for it by the commonwealth. ,</p>
