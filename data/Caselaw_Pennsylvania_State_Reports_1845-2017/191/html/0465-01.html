Haldeman was decided it was' questionable what was the character of oil and whether it was to be treated as mineral or not. Chief Justice Woodward says: “Throughout this opinion I have treated oil as a mineral. Until our scientific knowledge on the subject is increased, this is the light in which the courts will be likely to regard this valuable production of the earth. But out of this results the difficulty of a strict classification of a right to take it, as an incorporeal hereditament. If a mineral, it is part of the land; and a right to take land or any part of land is not, strictly speaking, an incorporeal hereditament. Nor is the right to fire bote, or plow bote or turves ; and yet, for the want of a better classification, this is treated in law as an incorporeal interest. To the same head is to be referred these oil rights.”</p>

Haldeman was rendered the Supreme Court have decided that natural gas is a mineral. In their opinion they say: “ Gas, it is true, is a mineral; but it is' a mineral with peculiar attributes, which require the application of precedents arising out of ordinary mineral rights, with much more careful consideration of the principles involved than of the mere decisions. Water is also a mineral; but the decisions in ordinary cases of mining rights, etc., have never been held as unqualified precedents in regard to flowing, or even to percolating water. Water and oil, and still more strongly gas, may be classed by themselves, if the analogy be not too fanciful, as mineral ferae naturae. In common with animals, and unlike other minerals, they have the power and the tendency to escape without the volition of the owner. Their “ fugitive and wandering existence within the limits of a particular tract is uncertain,” as said by Chief Justice Agnew in Brown v. Vandergrift, <a href="/citations/?q=80%20Pa.%20147" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="80 Pa. 147">80 Pa. 147</a>. They belong to the owner of the land, and are part of it, so long as they are on or in it, and are subject to his control ; but when they escape and go into other land, or come under another’s control, the title of the former owner is gone. Possession of the land, therefore, is not necessarily possession of the gas. If an adjoining, or even a distant, owner, drills his own land, and taps your gas, so that it comes into his well and <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>under his control, it is no longer yours, but his. ” Westmoreland N.

The evidence shows that in a considerable portion of this territory there is no gas. In the 484 acres conveyed by Dickinson and wife to the plaintiff the testimony of the superintendent of the plaintiff company is that about two thirds of that territory is not gas territory and is worthless. That in the remaining territory the wells are giving out and the pressure upon them is diminishing by reason of the large consumption, and that it will be necessary to drill an additional number of wells in said territory to enable the company to supply their customers, and in the opinion of all the witnesses, and no testimony has been offered on the part of the defendant to contradict it, the land assessed is indispensable and necessary to enable the company to carry out the purposes of its organization and supply their customers with gas.] [5]</p>
