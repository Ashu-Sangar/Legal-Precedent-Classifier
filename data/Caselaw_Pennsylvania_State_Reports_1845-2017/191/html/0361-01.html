The evidence of these two witnesses is the only evidence on this point that there is in the <em>case; </em>and under it I am of the opinion that Stark was what is known in law as an independent contractor; that is, that he had a right to perform the work, to conduct the performance of it in such manner as he chose, independent of the right of the company to interfere with the means which he employed or with his manner of conducting it, the company having no other jurisdiction over it except to approve or disapprove of it when completed under the contract; and that the defendant company was not liable for his negligence. I am, therefore, obliged to say to you, as a question of law, that inasmuch as the defendant had no right to interfere with Stark or his employees in the means which he chose to employ on his part, their negligence could not and should not be imputed to the defendant company so as to hold it liable in damages for the injury that Mrs. Thomas sustained.] [2]</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b384-6" data-blocks='[["BL_384.5",384,[263,579,1183,1078]]]'>The proximate cause of Mrs. Thomas’s injury was the upsetting of a plank upon which she stepped while crossing Allegheny street, in the borough of Hollidaysburg. This and other planks placed by its side formed a temporary crossing over the rails. It was uptilted by a loaded cart striking the end of it. The cart was under the control of the employees of C. N. Stark, who had contracted to construct the defendant’s road in Hollidaysburg. It is not alleged that the crossing itself was not reasonably safe for the purpose for which it was made, or that Mrs. Thomas would not have passed over it in safety if the cart wheel had not struck the plank. There was ample space between the end of the plank crossing and the pavement to allow the passage of the cart. Permitting it to get on the plank was the negligence of the person or persons in charge of it, for which the contractor might be liable. The defendant was not their employer. They were servants of the contractor. The relation of master and servant existed between them, and the contractor would be liable for negligence on their part while in his employ. To him only the rule of respondeat superior applies. There cannot be two superiors severally responsible for the same wrongful act: Wray v. Evans, <a href="/pa/80/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="80 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1042401" data-case-paths="/pa/80/0102-01">80 Pa. 102</a>.</p>

It had no control or supervision of the work, except to see that it was completed according to the specifications. • With the men or means employed by Stark to accomplish it, it had nothing to do, except in the event of Stark’s neglect or refusal to prosecute the work with a force sufficient for its completion within the time specified in the <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>agreement, which contingency did not happen. The agreement provided that the engineer of the defendant company might declare it forfeited (among other causes) “ for noncompliance with his directions in regard to the manner of constructing it.” The agreement was not rescinded, and Stark completed the work. It is earnestly contended that by these stipulations the defendant reserved control of the work, and was, therefore; liable for the negligence of the contractor’s employees during its progress. “ Noncompliance with the directions of the engineer ” must be construed in connection with other parts of the contract. It evidently means noncompliance with his directions in such matters as under the agreement he had the right to direct. It does not, either expressly or by inference, give him the right to interfere with the means Stark chose to use to accomplish the work. Such right is not reserved in the agreement, and it was not within the contemplation of the parties that the engineer could compel a forfeiture of the agreement by assuming at his will to give directions in matters over which the agreement did not give him jurisdiction. The right of the engineer was to fix the grades and alignment of the road, to establish the amount of work done each month, to approve the work when completed and to employ workmen in case Stark failed to provide sufficient force to accomplish the work within the specified time. There is nothing in the agreement which even hints at the light of the engineer to control or in any way interfere with the means which Stark might choose to employ in the work. Stark testified that the work was exclusively in his control and that the engineer did not interfere with the means he chose to accomplish it. Stark had the right to and did use whatever means he chose to make the excavations. The defendant or its engineer had no right to direct that they should be made by picks or dynamite. He also had the right to remove the excavated dirt by such means as he saw fit, whether by wheelbarrows, carts or cars or by any other sort of conveyance he chose. The defendant had no concern in such matters, and did not exercise any control over them. We are clearly of opinion that this case comes within the rule laid down in City of Erie v.

It is necessary to refer to only a few of them. In Reynolds v.

Smith, <a href="/pa/163/0561-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="163 Pa. 561" data-case-ids="859083" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0561-01">163 Pa. 561</a>, the injury complained of was the caving in of a sewer which had been constructed by the defendant under a contract with the city of Easton. It appeared from the evidence and it was found by the jury that thé negligence in constructing the sewer was the fault of the direction of the engineer of the ciiy, who directed the manner of its construction and filling up the excavation. It was held that if the contractors followed the directions of the engineer, but in carrying out his directions they negligently did the work, and the injury complained of resulted from such negligence, the contractors would have been responsible. In his opinion Mr. Justice Dean says: “ The plaintiff alleged it was negligence to leave the sheeting and to puddle the filling of the trench; the defendants replied that this was not negligence, but even if it were the city did it, not we. . . . True, if the puddling was negligently done after the engineer directed the contractors to follow that method, and such negligence occasioned the injury, the contractor could not have escaped liability because the city had changed the method.” That case emphasizes the rule that “ when a person contracts with another to do a work for him according to the contractor’s own methods, and not subject to his control or orders, except as to the results to be obtained, the former is not liable for the wrongful acts of such contractor or his servants.” In the case of Homan v. Stanley, <a href="/pa/66/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="66 Pa. 464" data-case-ids="432411" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0464-01">66 Pa. 464</a>, an owner contracted with one person to dig the cellar; with another to do masonry, and the third to put up the structure.

In his opinion denying the motion for a new trial the salient facts of the case, together with the principles involved, etc., are so fully set forth that little, if anything, can be profitably added in vindication of his rulings.</p>

Stark was an independent contractor and, as such, had a right to do the work and direct its performance in such manner as he chose, independently of any right of the defendant railway company. The latter had no other control over the work than to approve or disapprove of it when completed by Stark; and, inasmuch as the defendant company had no right to interfere with him or his employees, the negligence of the latter could not be imputed to it. It therefore follows <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>that there was no error in the instructions recited in the second specification.</p>
