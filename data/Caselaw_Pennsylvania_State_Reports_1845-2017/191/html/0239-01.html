    <p id="b267-5" data-blocks='[["BL_267.8",267,[145,1195,1178,820]]]'>The auditor found that the term of the partnership under its articles had not expired, there had been no formal dissolution or settlement of accounts, there were still some undistributed assets, and one unpaid debt, a mortgage on real estate belonging to the partnership, though held in the name of an individual partner, yet, notwithstanding these circumstances, he found as a fact that the firm had sold its entire plant, equipment and good-will, and by common consent ended its business. This finding was confirmed by the court, and we see no reason to question its soundness. The auditor’s conclusion that the case is “ analogous to that of a partnership which has dissolved by mutual consent, settled its accounts, paid its debts, and has a surplus in land,” is the logical deduction from the facts. Dissolution, as between the partners, is a matter of intention, and it may be shown by the sale of the whole property and business, as well as in other ways: 17 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 1100.</p>

In dealing with questions of this kind it is important to keep constantly in mind what equitable conversion really is, a fiction by which for certain specific purposes, and to the limited extent required for such purposes, realty may be treated as personalty or personalty as realty. As said in Wentz’s Appeal, <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a><a href="/pa/126/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="126 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="968875" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0541-01">126 Pa. 541</a>, “ the money never is • real estate, in law any more than in fact, but for certain purposes, and within certain limits it is treated as if it was real estate. . . . The whole doctrine is the creation of equity for a specific purpose, and when that purpose is accomplished, the rule ceases to operate. So far therefore from the money actually becoming real estate, and requiring a positive act of reconversion to restore it to its natural character of money, it never is real estate, and is only treated as such within a limit,” and quoting Sharswood, J., in Foster’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=74%20Pa.%20397" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="74 Pa. 397">74 Pa. 397</a>, “when the purpose of conversion is attained conversion ends.”</p>
    <p id="b268-4" data-blocks='[["BL_268.4",268,[287,939,1175,915]]]'>Land held by partners as partnership assets is to be treated as if it were personalty to the extent demanded bjr the purpose with which it is put into the common stock, but no further. How far that shall go is largely a matter of intention, but the presumption is that it shall extend to all the regular and legitimate uses of the business, and it may be that as to creditors this presumption must be held conclusive. It is frequently said that during the partnership it is “ an out and out conversion,” but the phrase is unfortunate, and apt to mislead. Even in a leading case in which it is used, the limited sense in which it is to be taken is shown elsewhere in the opinion, “ where land is a part of partnership stock, it at no time—not even during the continuance of the partnership—becomes personalty in such an unqualified sense as to give one partner an implied power to dispose of the whole partnership interest in it. As regards the power of disposition, land held as partnership stock is not subject to the rule which makes each partner the agent of the firm: ” Foster’s Appeal, 74 Pa. 39T.</p>

But its status as personalty even during the continuance of the business was temporary and restricted, and the moment the necessity for so treating it ceased, its quasi character ceased and it resumed its normal position as land'.
