That Peter Meyers was killed on the afternoon of July 31,1898, in this county, is beyond question; that fact is not in dispute; that he was slain by the defendant is also admitted. The defendant’s revolver is here, the weapon with <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>which the killing was done; it is identified not only by witnesses for the commonwealth, but by the defendant himself, and the leaden messengers of death that caused the death of Peter Meyers are also produced here in evidence. The cause of death is not disputed, cannot be, very well, under the evidence. The coroner mentioned at least two of these wounds that were necessarily fatal. Those are undisputed facts in the case, and the question is what conclusion will the jury come to as to this homicide. Was the defendant justified that day in killing Peter Meyers? If he was, then he is not guilty of any crime. Was the deed committed in the heat of blood and passion and under great provocation? If it was then he-would be guilty of manslaughter. Or will you come to the conclusion that he is guilty of murder of the second degree, or will you say by your verdict that he is guilty of murder of the first degree? In considering the evidence you will naturally begin with the evidence which throws a light on the previous relations of these two men, Joseph Keller and Peter Meyers. There is evidence on both sides as to threats made by the defendant against Peter Meyers and threats made by Peter Meyers against the defendant. It is for you to decide whether the evidence is true on these points. You have heard the testimony of the witnesses. But, in considering the evidence, as I have said, you will begin with the evidence that throws a light upon the relation of the two men, one to the other; and these threats on one side and on the other, if you believe that they were made, will show you the condition of mind of these two men when they came near or when they approached each other, at least it will have a tendency to do that.</p>

There was a dispute about the shooting of pigeons; the two men met in regard to that question; they met I think at Keller’s house, and you heard the testimony of Miss Bender on that question when she said that during the quarrel or discussion, whatever you might call it, the defendant pointed a rifle through the window from upstairs, and told them to go away or else he would drop both of them. Then you have some declarations which were testified to by some of the witnesses as occurring after the homicide. I call your attention to these because they ought to be taken in connection with any <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>previous threats. You remember the testimony of Miss Bender. She says that when coming from the railroad or coming up the railroad the defendant told her that Meyers, using a profane term which I will not repeat to you now, but referring to Meyers, ought to have dropped long ago. And I think it is Mr. Schuller also that testifies to a remark made by this defendant after the shooting when he told him “Don’t touch that corpse or you will get the same dose as he got.” Now there may be some other testimony to this effect. There you have the testimony of the commonwealth as to the threats made by the defendant against Meyers previous to the shooting, and you have the testimony that I have already referred to as to the declarations of the defendant after the shooting. They belong to the same class of evidence, because they tend to show the condition of the defendant’s mind so far as it relates to the homicide. It may throw some light upon his intention, and it may raise his defense in question in the minds of the jury. But there are other threats in the case. There is considerable testimony here that Meyers made many threats against the defendant. You have the testimony of Byron Davis, his father-in-law, stating that he would kill Keller, using a vile term, and that he would “do him.” And also the evidence of Mrs. Bird at the time that he showed the iron or steel knuckles, saying that he had something to fix somebody, and' that he would be able to kill a man by hitting him in the right place. And further, when he went down the alley, after the discussion about the pigeons was over, she told him he better not go, and then he said, “ I will head off Keller,” but did not call him by that name, used a vile term, “and if he touches me I will kill him or he will kill me.” Then you have the testimony of the officer, Charles Lown, who said he heard Meyers make the threat he •ould get even with him before night. Then the testimony of Lizzie Slack and Minnie Keiser. Lizzie Slack testifies in substance the same as Mrs. Bird. Mrs. Keiser says Meyers made declarations that he would kill Keller or Keller would kill him before the sun set. There may be testimony of other witnesses of this nature.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b146-5" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[239,2252,1171,147]],["BL_147.1",147,[192,350,1173,1132]]]'>Now the purpose of the evidence as to threats on the one side and the other is twofold. [The threats made by Keller against Meyers are depended upon by the commonwealth for the pur<a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>pose of showing Keller’s attitude towards Meyers; that he had malice in his heart; that he had anger in his mind towards him; that he made these threats, and that what happened afterwards upon the railroad was in pursuance of these threats and in consummation of an intention on his part to kill Meyers. On the other hand, the threats made by Meyers against Keller are relied upon by the defense to show the condition of Keller’s mind when he met Meyers upon the railroad, and to show what he had reason to expect from Meyers on account of Meyers’s attitude towards him on account of his threats to do him violence, and to injure him during the day. Of course, you must understand that a threat made by one man against another, unless it is communicated to him, cannot have any effect upon the mind of the man that is threatened. There is a threat or two here, the threat testified to by Mrs. Bird and by Lizzie Slack and by Mrs. Keiser, those threats, there is no evidence that I can find in the case where they were communicated to the defendant, Keller, and it is only such threats that he knows of that can possibly have any influence or any effect upon his mind, because if a man does not know of a threat of course it has no influence upon him; but the other threats which he heard himself are to be considered by the jury in connection with his defense.] [2, 3]</p>

You have heard the testimony that Keller, with this belt and revolver, went down the railroad, and according to his own testimony was going to his father’s house, and that Meyers went down the alley, and that finally they met within sight of each other. The witnesses on this point are numerous. It is not necessary that I should go over the testimony of each witness as to what transpired from the time the two men were in sight of each other on the railroad track. We first find the defendant, Keller, talking to a man by the name of Frank Skinner, and according to all the testimony in the case we find Peter Meyers standing a certain distance off upon the railroad track. Many of the witnesses tell the story somewhat alike, they do not differ very materially, but there is some difference in the testimony of some of the witnesses for the commonwealth with the other witnesses for the commonwealth, and also in the testimony of the witnesses for the defense. These witnesses evidently were looking at the same fact, the same <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>events, from different standpoints, from different places; they did not all see alike.; they did not all of them see all that happened ; some saw one part, some saw another part, but I think the testimony is fresh enough in your minds and in your recollections to spare me the trouble of going over the testimony of each witness. A number of witnesses testify that there was no violence apparent to their view between these two men. According to the testimony of some of the witnesses Keller walked to where Peter Meyers stood, and then they walked together, one a little in the lead of the other. Keller pushed Meyers off; you saw the motions of the witnesses when they testified to that fact. Then they still walked together or separated somewhat apart up the track or along the track, and then they both stopped. Now what happened after they stopped on the switch and before the shooting ? There is no evidence of a blow on either side, that is that Meyers struck Keller or that Keller struck Meyers. But there is evidence that Meyers pushed Keller and struck at him, made an attempt to strike him. You have some of the witnesses testifying that immediately before the first shot was fired that Meyers had his hand up and was coming towards Keller, and that Keller shot there and then. Some of the witnesses testify that Meyers immediately after the first shot staggered backwards and then came forward again, and then the three shots were fired in rapid succession, and according to some of the witnesses he retreated backwards until he fell over the embankment. Other witnesses say that he' continued to come forward all the time to the same side of the embankment that Keller was on, and that he finally fell sideways and rolled down to where the corpse was found. So you see the witnesses use different expressions. They say that Meyers “ struck at Keller; ” that Meyers “pushed Keller;” that Keller “motioned and pushed Meyers away from him; ” that Meyers was trying to “ get at Keller.” Those are the expressions, the words that are used by the witnesses; they are words of common idioms, of common character, colloquial in their nature, and are to be taken by the jury according to their common meaning, according to their common acceptation by the people. It is important that you should come to the conclusion, as far as possible, as to the exact facts on this part of the case—what happened there ? In considering the evidence of these several witnesses as to what <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>transpired either before or after the shooting, or immediately before the shooting and at the time of the shooting, you will find, as I have said, some contradictions along the line of the testimony. The testimony of one witness is denied by another, and you have the same witnesses telling the story in a different way. Some of the contradictions are minor: that is, they are not important ; others again are important, and refer to material facts. Now it is the duty of a jury always, when there are contradictions in the testimony of a number of witnesses who testify to the same facts, to harmonize the contradictions as far as possible, to consider that all witnesses do not see the same thing in the same light nor from the same point, and to try and arrive at a consecutive story made up by the jury from the testimony of all the witnesses so far as they have been able to harmonize it. That a jury can often do. Of course, when they come to a point where they cannot harmonize the testimony, where the contradiction is too flat, too apparent, then they must believe either one or the other.</p>

    <p id="b152-6" data-blocks='[["BL_152.8",152,[278,612,1177,1688]]]'>The defendant, in support of the allegation that he had acted in self-defense, was allowed at the trial without objection .to offer proof of threats made by the deceased. Some of these threats had been made in the presence of the defendant, and heard by him; others had been made in his absence and had not been communicated to him. In three of the assignments it is alleged as error that the court failed to call the attention of the jury to the effect that should be given to uncommunicated threats, and that in this respect the charge was inadequate and misleading. In connection with these assignments only that part of the charge is given which refers to the effect on the defendant’s mind of threats made by the deceased. Earlier in the charge the attention of the jury had been called to the threats which the deceased and the accused had made against each other, and it was then clearly stated that the purpose of this testimony was to throw light on the relation in which they stood to each other and the condition of their minds when they met. It was said: “ But in considering the evidence, you will begin with that which throws light upon the relation of the two men one to the other; and these threats on one side or the other, if you believe they were made, will show you the condition of mind of these two men when they came near or when they approached each other—at least it will have a tendency to do that.” It was for the purpose thus stated that the testimony as to threats made by either was admissible. Proof of uncommunicated threats made by the deceased was received as tending to show his motive and intention, and thus giving rise to an inference that in the' fatal encounter he was the aggressor. The effect to be given to such testimony might have been more fully explained, but what was said in the charge in relation to it was not misleading, and in the absence of a request for more specific instructions on the subject it cannot be said that the charge was inadequate.</p>
    <p id="b152-7" data-blocks='[["BL_152.9",152,[280,2307,1168,94]],["BL_153.1",153,[183,364,1167,1025]]]'>The photograph of .the deceased-was offered by the commonwealth to rebut testimony that the defendant was a smaller man <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>than the deceased. This is a kind of testimony which should be received with caution. Tn a recent case, Beardslee v. Columbia Township, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20Pa.%20502" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="188 Pa. 502">188 Pa. 502</a>, it was said by our Brother Mitchell: “Photographs are competent evidence, and when properly taken are judicially recognized as of a high order of accuracy. See Udderzook v. Com., <a href="/pa/76/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="76 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="1038920" data-case-paths="/pa/76/0340-01">76 Pa. 340</a>. But in careless, or inexpert, or interested hands they are capable of very serious misrepresentations of the original. Before they are permitted to be used in the trial, therefore, there should always be preliminary proof of care and accuracy in the taking of them, and of their relevancy to the issue before the jury.” On a question of size a photograph would probably be less reliable than on one of identity. But where other objects, whose size is known, are shown in the picture, and appear therein to have been at the same distance from the camera as the object whose size is sought to be established, a reasonably safe means of comparison is furnished. This was a full length photograph, and the witness who identified it and testified to its accuracy was represented in it, standing by the side of the deceased. This gave the jury a sufficiently safe guide.</p>
    <p id="b153-5" data-blocks='[["BL_153.4",153,[179,1398,1170,866]]]'>The only remaining assignment which need be noticed relates to the refusal of the court to direct the district attorney to call a witness, Charles Lown, whose name was on the bill of indictment. To the request of the defendant’s counsel, the district attorney replied that he had called all the eye-witnesses to the occurrence, and the court sustained this refusal to call the witness, on the ground that his testimony would be cumulative merely. It appears that this witness saw the shooting, and that the fact that he was present had been disclosed by witnesses before examined. The offer should however be judged in the light in which it was presented to the court at the time. The statement of the district attorney that he had called all the eye-witnesses was not controverted, and the fact that other witnesses had testified to the presence of this one was not called to the attention of the court. It then appeared to the court that the witness could have testified only to the threats which had been made some hours before the encounter, as to which there was no dispute.</p>

Sixteen eye<a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>witnesses had already been examined. While it is the duty of the district attorney in such a case as this to present all the testimony' on the material facts, whether adverse to the defendant or favorable to him, the court in its discretion may limit the number of witnesses to be called. There was not a withholding of testimony favorable to the defendant or a failure on the part of the district attorney to present to the jury all the material facts. It was the right of the defendant to have all of the facts connected with the shooting fully and fairly disclosed by the prosecution, but it was not his right to have them repeated over and over indefinitely by all the persons who saw the occurrence.</p>
    <p id="b154-5" data-blocks='[["BL_154.4",154,[299,997,1170,139]]]'>The case seems to have been tried with great care and ability by the learned judge, and the record discloses no error calling for a reversal.</p>
    <p id="b154-6" data-blocks='[["BL_154.5",154,[342,1153,480,44]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
