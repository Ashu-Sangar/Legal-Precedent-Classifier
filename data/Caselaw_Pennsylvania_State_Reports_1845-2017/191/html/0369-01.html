The court is respectfully requested to withdraw all the testimony tending to show that gasoline was kept on the premises insured, because the minutes of May 11, 1897, of the defendant company and affidavit of defense shows that the refusal to pay the loss was put solely upon the ground of a change of occupation, in that a store was opened and kept in the destroyed building, after knowledge that gasoline was kept there. After such waiver and the plaintiff having been put to the expense of suit, etc., it is too late to raise such reason on the trial. <em>Answer: </em>We do not think that the evidence in this case establishes a waiver by defendant of its right to set up in defense to the claim in suit that gasoline was kept upon the insured premises at and immediately prior to the time of their destruction by fire. The request is therefore refused. [1]</p>
