In that ease the chief justice said: “ The first question is, whether the lights of the legatees were so far vested that the act of 1848 could not touch them.” “ The rights of the parties, however, were fixed at the death, and the legislature could not unfix them. It is said they were not vested because the widow had not made her choice, but they certainly would be impaired by swaying her choice by means of a premium for throwing the burden of her provision on the legatees, and a law to give her such a premium would be unconstitutional.”</p>

This would include both real and personal estate, for both are subject to the collateral tax. But the 1st section of the act expressly limits the tax to personal property, and thus the first and last sections are squarely in conflict; one declaring that personal property alone is liable to the tax, and the other that “ all estates or parts of estates not subject ” to the collateral tax shall be liable to the tax.</p>

And even where vested rights are the subject of the retrospective law, if it affects remedies only and not the right itself, it is not forbidden, even though it may be tyrannical and contrary to the spirit of free government, which requires laws'to be “prescribed” and not “like the laws of Caligula, written in small characters and hung on high pillars.” The distinction is thus stated by Chancellor Kent : “ A retrospective statute, affecting and changing vested rights, is very generally considered in this country as founded on unconstitutional principles, and consequently inoperative and void. But this doctrine is not understood to apply to remedial statutes, which may be of a retrospective nature, provided they do not impair <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>contracts, or disturb absolute vested rights, and only go to confirm rights already existing, and in furtherance of the remedy by curing defects and adding to the means of enforcing existing obligations.

The legal rights affected in those cases by the statutes were deemed to have vested subject to the equity existing against them, and which the statutes recognized and enforced.

The theory of succession tax legislation is that “ the right to take by will or from intestates is, after all, but a mere privilege of the municipal law, to be changed, modified, or repealed in the discretion of the state, and not a natural right; and it is only just and proper, in consideration of this privilege, that property passing by will .... or 'through the intestate laws .... should pay to the state conferring this valuable privilege a fair and reasonable bonus <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>or percentage upon the value of the property thus transmitted and received:” Dos Passos on Inheritance Tax Law, sec. 2. The tax, therefore, is not upon the property passing, but upon the right to receive it (Orcutt’s Appeal, 1 Outerb. 179) ; and where before the right has vested it is declared that it shall be paid for, there can be no objection to the law so declaring. But in Pennsylvania the right, so far as concerns the estates of persons dying before the passage of the act of May 12,1897, was governed by the then existing laws; and though the property acquired under it may not have been actually received, the right, itself, was absolutely vested and complete. The right was not dependent upon the fact of distribution, and ownership by persons who became lineally entitled, either under wills or the intestate laws, passed in case of their deaths as part of their estates, both for administration and distribution.</p>

The property, as distinguished from the right to succeed to it, may be the subject of taxation in common with similar property owned by other citizens and bearing the same burden, in return for the protection which all alike receive from the government; but when the right vested under existing laws is taxed by a subsequent law, for general purposes of government and not for any purpose specially benefiting the owner of such right, it is not only taking the property of such owner without compensation, for public use, but it is violating the other constitutional provision that all taxes shall be equal.

This is one of the attributes of sovereignty. The commonwealth must have revenue for its support, and the people must furnish that revenue, and taxation is the only method by which this can be done. Nor can it be doubted that the commonwealth has the right to tax that which is not property in actual possession, but in expectancy, by devolution upon the death of one person to others.

It is not a tax upon the property itself, but on the right of succession thereto. In other words, it is a succession and not a property tax. This was no doubt the intention of the legislature, as developed by the words of the enacting clause; but this proviso attempts to impose a tax upon .property by enacting that so much of the estates of persons heretofore deceased as has not been actually distributed shall be taxable. At the very moment of a person’s death, his estate vests somewhere, either under his will or under the intestate laws, subject, of course, to the rights of creditors and the payment to the commonwealth of any taxes due under existing laws, but it vests eo instante at death. It is then property vested in those entitled thereto. It is not the right to a thing, but it is <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>the thing itself.

The court clearly defined the difference between the right of succession to property and the property itself. Judge Butler said: “ As the right to take by succession and testament is derived from the state, it must necessarily be enjoyed, subject to such conditions as the state may impose; and if a condition be that the kindred or legatee shall pay a bonus, this is not a tax or burden imposed on their property or on the property of anybody else. It is simply the price of the privilege which the state has conferred upon them.” See also Orcutt’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/97/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="97 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="444784" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0179-01">97 Pa. 179</a>.

Article 9, section 1 of the constitution of Pennsylvania, provides that “ All taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority of levying the tax.” This tax is not uniform, but is unequal in many particulars. For instance: by the said second proviso to the enacting clause, if the views already expressed are correct, it is attempted to impose a tax upon property and not upon the right of succession thereto.

Those who were settled with before May 12, 1897, escape taxation, and those who are not settled with until afterwards are taxed; thus the tax is not a uniform one on the same class of subjects. Again, there are many estates that are <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>settled and distributed within a year after the death of the decedent, and there were many such in the year immediately, preceding the passage of this act. They are not taxable; but in the numerous estates, in which, from a variety of causes, .settlement and distribution has been postponed, although the decedent may have been dead for many years prior to those above referred to, the tax is to be imposed. Thus the subjects of taxation are determined by accident and not by any fixed principle. If the retroactive feature of the proviso to the first section is good in law, then, under the second section of the act, all estates of persons heretofore deceased which have not been distributed are subject to penalties. “ If the said tax is not paid at the end of one year from the death of the decedent, interest at the rate of 6 per centum shall be charged for such year, and after the expiration of one year from the death of the decedent, interest shall then be charged at the rate of 12 per centum; ” so that, in an estate in which the decedent has been dead for a number of years, the imposition of this so-called interest would almost amount to confiscation. By this clause we have a penalty imposed for not complying with a law which had no existence. It is no answer to this to say that it was not intended to impose penalties upon the estates of those who predeceased the. passage of the act. Who is to determine this question ?

The constitution expressly provides that the only property which can be exempted from taxation is “ public property used for public purposes, actual places of religious worship, places of burial not used or held for private or corporate profit, and institutions of purely public charity.” This act purposes taxing all personal estate passing by will or the intestate laws, valued at over $5,000,.thus exempting this sum from taxation, while the constitution provides that only those subjects of taxation above enumerated shall be exempt. Again, taxes are to be uniform on the same “ class of subjects.” The class of subjects contemplated by this act is personal property <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>passing by will or under the intestate laws. Now, if the amount of the estate so passing is less than $5,000, it escapes taxation, and if over $5,000, it is taxable.

This diffculty cannot be disposed of by saying that it is absurd, and that the act will be so construed as to avoid it. Where ble words are express and their meaning cannot be changed without disregarding them altogether, there is no room for interpretation, and the legislature, not the court, is responsible for the consequences: Dwarris on Statutes, 204-205; Sutherland on Stat, 315; Black on Interpretation of Laws, 35, 36; Maxwell on Stat. 5-7; Endlich on Stat. 6, 7; Bradbury v.

As was said by Lord Denman, in Green v. Wood, 7 Q. B. 178: “It is extremely probable that the alteration suggested would express <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>what the legislature meant; but we, looking at tho words as judges, are no more justified to introduce words, than we should be if we added any other meaning.

The tax professes to be two per cent on all legacies, but the effect of the exemption of $5,000 (and this irrespective of the question how far the exemption in itself is forbidden as being “ other than the property ” permitted to be exempted by section 1, article 9 of the constitution) is to make the rate upon legacies of the same amount vary with every variation in the size of the entire estate. Thus: Legacies of $2,500 to each of two children, the estate amounting in all to $5,000, are not taxed at all; legacies of $2,500 to each of three children, the entire estate being $7,500, are taxed at the rate of two thirds of one per cent ($50.00 in all); legacies of $2,500 to each of four children, the entire estate being $10,000, are taxed one per cent ($100 in all); legacies of $2,500 to each of six children, the entire estate being $15,000, are taxed one and one third per cent ($200 in all) ; and so on in ever increasing ratio. And yet, as the title informs us, the tax is imposed, not on the estate, qua estate, but on legacies as a classand executors are required to deduct from every legacy “ two dollars in every hundred upon the whole legacy paid ... for the use of the commonwealth.”</p>

      <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>The case is to be decided under the constitution and laws of Pennsylvania. “A constitution,” as was said by Chief Justice Gibson, in Navigation Co. v. Coons, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 101" data-case-ids="480106" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0101-01">6 W. &amp; S. 101</a>, 114, “is made not particularly for the inspection of lawyers, but for the inspection of the million, that they may discover their rights and duties; and it is consequently expressed in terms that are most familiar to them. Words, therefore, which do not of themselves denote that they are used in a technical sense, are to have their plain, popular, obvious and natural meaning.” Taxes on collateral successions had been known for more than fifty years when the constitution of 1874 was adopted. They are spoken of as taxes in innumerable acts of assembly and decisions of the courts, and by the people of the state, who, during all this time, had been accustomed to paying them; and the very act now under consideration, not only in its title (which would otherwise be defective), but in every section, speaks of the “ tax ” which it seeks to impose. And yet we are solemnly asked to say that this is not a tax, but an excise or duty. What is an excise or duty but one species of tax ? The constitution is explicit : “ All taxes shall be uniform,” etc. See Com. v. Randall, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.N.C.%20210" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="2 W.N.C. 210">2 W. N. C. 210</a>. If the people of Pennsylvania who thus expressed themselves are to be told that “ all ” does not mean all; ■ that a tax is not a tax unless imposed periodically; and that “ uniform ” does not mean uniform, but is dependent on the terms and method by which the legislature may express itself, the announcement should be made by that tribunal whose decrees are final, and to whose decisions all must bow in silent submission.</p>

With profound respect for the opinion of the majority of the court which has found this iñdietment to be true, I am yet unable to see in what respect the act offends the organic law of the state. It may be faulty in construction, by introducing a new class of subjects through the gate of a proviso, or, by describing as direct inheritors, artificial bodies which do not take by inheritance, but if its purpose is legitimate, it will stand in spite of these defects. No case has yet decided that a slip in grammar, or a blunder in method, or even an omission of words where they are supplied by the context, will vitiate a statute. It is perhaps well that the courts have been lenient, because acts drawn by accomplished lawyers, which have established rules of property and personal rights, have nevertheless been wanting in scientific arrangement and even in accurate expression.</p>

Hence the uniformity which is prescribed is not absolute and universal, but class uniformity. If it were otherwise, the legislature, when it would raise a revenue, must tax everything, except the properties specifically named in the act which can be the subject of ownership, or else it must forego any taxation at all. It may not place a levy upon mortgages, or carriages, or steamships, and stop there; if absolute uniformity is the mandate of the constitution, it must tax also the tools of the mechanic, the library of the professional man, the rags of the beggar. As to the make-up of these classes, whether they shall be composed of persons or property; as to their limits, whether they shall embrace objects few or many; and as to the rate of taxation, whether it shall be high or low, or whether it shall differ as between the classes, the constitution says nothing; its single injunction is that within each class the imposition shall be uniform. What may be styled the ethics of taxation is left to be dealt with by the legislature. The charge that the act of May, 1897, is aimed at the rich, and throws upon that class the whole of a burden which should be shared by the poor, may be adapted to. the hustings, but should have no place in a legal <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>argument which, is addressed to the constitutionality of the statute. Some matters may be safely left to the natural sense of the individuals who compose the lawmaking body; if they are not above, they at least are not below the moral plane oí the community from which they have been chosen; and the instinct of self-preservation, if a higher incentive shall be wanting, will save them from adopting any measure, the monstrous injustice of which may work their political destruction.</p>

These belong to one division only; they are all tangible and material objects. But incorporeal property exists which is the subject of ownership and may be therefore the subject of taxation; and the "standard for its assessment may be wholly unlike the standard which governs in the former class. So there are rights, the creatures of statute, which are not technically property, but which nevertheless have value, and for that reason are available for state revenue. The right to cany on a particular business or trade, and the right to inherit the estate of a decedent are of this character. The impost laid upon these rights has always been distinguished by the courts from taxation, and has been styled a license. Far from being a verbal refinement, the distinction between the two terms is radical; a tax is the debt which the citizen owes to the state; a license is the title by which he claims and exercises his right. When, therefore, the organic law of the commonwealth, in placing a curb upon the body, which, outside of the limits imposed by the constitution, is omnipotent, by declaring that the taxes imposed by that body shall be uniform, but is silent as to the licenses which are equally subject to its will, the question may be asked with the utmost seriousness, whether licenses were intended to be uniform. The courts have the power, and it is one to be exercised only with infinite caution, to undo the work of the legislature by declaring an act unconstitutional; but they cannot do this by reading into the constitution words which the framers of that instrument saw fit to leave out. To declare a statute unconstitutional upon the strength of a word which <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>nowhere appears in the constitution, would be a more flagrant violation of that instrument by the courts than a faulty title to the act or the introduction of an enacting clause under the form of a proviso would be by the legislature.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b73-4" data-blocks='[["BL_73.5",73,[194,557,1174,1851]],["BL_74.1",74,[281,368,1180,1438]]]'>But this point may be abandoned, and it may be conceded that the legislature obliterated, if such a thing was possible, the distinction between taxes and licenses, by giving to this act the title of a tax law. In that case the charge of two per cent on inheritances was a tax, and, like all other taxes, required to be uniform within the class on whose constituents it was laid. Just here the main assault upon the statute is attempted. It is said that a tax law which singles out for its purpose from among the inheritors of the estates of decedents dying before its passage only those who had not yet received their portions, while it leaves untouched those who had been paid, is not uniform in its working. The fallacy of this objection lies in its assumption that the legislature was in some way restricted in its formation of classes of taxable subjects; that it could not, for instance, arrange in one class lineal descendants and in another collateral kindred; and that it could not impose upon the first class a higher or a lower burden than that which it placed on the second. It would waste time, however, to cite a tithe of the cases and of the acts which have never been questioned, by which this power of the legislature is assured. A few of the authorities were referred to in the adjudication in Lacey’s Estate, and they show that these classes may again be subdivided, without thereby creating an illegal exemption or impairing the uniformity required by the constitution. What, then, is the class of taxable persons which has been created by the act of 1897 ? The answer is: All persons (not taxed as collaterals) who, after the date of its passage, shall be paid or entitled to be paid their shares of the estates of decedents. The act taxes their right of inheritance, not their property; and it measures the value of the right in the individual instance by the value of the individual share. It does not tax the heritable right of those who, before its date, had been paid their shares, not because it lacks the power to tax, but because in their case the right had been exhausted by the payment, and was therefore valueless. The inheritor from a decedent holds his right of inheritance as he holds his property, subject to the taxing power of the state. <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>The circumstance that when the right arose it was not covered by a tax. law, gave him no such vested right as would save it from future taxation. Even on the strict equities of the case, two men stand on the same grade and may be enrolled in the same class, who receive their respective shares on the same day, although the right of inheritance accrued to one of them fifty years ago, and the right of the other only yesterday. Not to labor the point unduly, the inheritor whose right was acquired before the act, but whose share was still undistributed at the date of the act, stands, by comparison with his codistributee who was paid his interest, in the same position as the buyer of a commodity to be delivered in the future, which at the time of purchase was taxed, but upon which, before the delivery, a tax has been laid. He is subjected to an after-imposed burden from which the seller is exempt; but can it be said that the taxing power has interfered with his vested rights ? To review in a sentence what has been said, and to discard the distinction between a tax on a right and a tax on property, which would seem to be the scientific point from which to argue, the power of the legislature to form taxable groups of persons or things is untouched by the constitution, and is practically limitless; in the exercise of this power the legislature may class together all direct inheritors, who, after a given date, shall be paid their shares of decedents’ estates, whether the right to inherit accrued before or after that date; that the power is restricted only to the extent that the tax shall be uniform within each class; and, finally, that a tax of two per cent on all estates embraced in this class is a uniform tax within the meaning,of the constitution.</p>
