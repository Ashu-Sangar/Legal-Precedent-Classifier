They were married February 5,1898, at Limestone, N. Y., and have both resided in Bradford city ever since. The libellant charges that the respondent has offered such indignities to the person of the libellant as to render her condition intolerable and life burdensome, and thereby forced her to withdraw from his house and family on August 27, 1898.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b494-17" data-blocks='[["BL_494.19",494,[242,2097,1180,298]],["BL_495.1",495,[200,332,1173,1131]]]'>The subpoena was awarded and made returnable to December term, 1898, was personally served on the respondent, who employed counsel and caused an appearance to be entered for bim, but did not file any answer. He appeared with his counsel before the examiner who took the testimony, cross-examined the witnesses who testified on behalf of the libellant, and was <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>called and testified in his own behalf. The testimony establishes the marriage, and that the parties cohabited together as man and wife until August, 1898, when she abandoned her husband and home, taking their only child with her, and has since resided with her parents in Bradford city. The testimony shows, from 1894 down to the spring of 1898, an almost continuous course of ill treatment of the wife by the husband; many manifestations of ill temper, profane and vulgar language, calling his wife a liar and a fool in the presence of their friends, charging her with unchastity in the presence of friends and acquaintances, accusing her in the presence of her mother and others, of having communicated venereal disease to him, frequent threats to kill her and threats to shoot her, some of these threats made when he had a revolver in his hand or about his person, and on one occasion knocking her down in their home on Park street. Her evidence, which is to some extent corroborated, charges him with forcing her against her will to have sexual intercourse with him when she was ill and confined to her bed. He was also in the habit of becoming intoxicated, remaining out late at night, drinking intoxicating liquors at their home in company with associates that he brought there. And, in one instance, gambling in their house on Sunday against her protests.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b495-5" data-blocks='[["BL_495.4",495,[203,1470,1172,964]]]'>When the husband charged his wife with having given him a venereal disease, she, under the advice of her mother, submitted to an examination by Dr. Nichols, and he testified positively that she had no venereal disease. The evidence also shows that the husband consulted Dr. Nichols, at about the same time, and was examined by the doctor, and it is a significant fact that when Dr. Nichols was on the stand the respondent’s able counsel did not ask him whether at the time of the examination the husband was suffering from a venereal disease. From the evidence, the inference is strong that the husband had a venereal disease contracted from some person other than his wife. And he testified that he did not believe his wife ever had a venereal disease, and that he did not doubt her chastity. Yet he had charged her in the presence of their friends with having slept with Dr. Gamble during the summer of 1897, at Conneaut. This charge she indignantly denies, but as to the making of the charge by the husband she is corroborated by a witness. In fact, as to most of the important charges against him, she is corroborated.</p>
