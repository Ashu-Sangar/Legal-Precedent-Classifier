It is true the petition alleges he was not an agent of the company “ upon whom service of the bill ” could be made, but that assertion is based upon the allegation that the petitioner, having been named as the company’s agent, as required by the act of April 22, 1874, no legal service could be had upon any other agent. The agency of Klock being thus admitted, the service upon him would be good under the act of March 21, 1849: Hagerman v.

Kansas Fire Insurance Company, <a href="/pa/82/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="82 Pa. 413" data-case-ids="1047940" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0413-01">82 Pa. 413</a>, and Hagerman v.

The question then arises, did defendant corporation comply with the act of 1874. In my opinion it did not do so. The certificate attached to the petition shows that Frank J. Deady, the petitioner, was named as agent on April 11,1898, while the service upon Klock was had March 31, 1898. But a certificate from the office of the secretary of the commonwealth was offered and admitted in evidence at argument on rule, showing that Hon. D. L. Krebs had been named as the authorized agent of the corporation, but it was admitted that he had no knowledge of having thus been named as agent until Deady was named as his successor on April 11,1898, and that the “ certificate of the secretary of the commonwealth ” of the filing of the statement was not “preserved for public inspection” by him as agent, as required by the second section of said act, which evidence and' admission were received with same effect as if set out in an amendment to the petition.</p>

In the case of Wintermute v. Central R. R. of N. J., 5 Pa. C. C. R. 648, it is held that the failure to preserve for public inspection the certificate required, prevents a foreign corporation from availing itself of the provisions of the act of 1874.</p>
