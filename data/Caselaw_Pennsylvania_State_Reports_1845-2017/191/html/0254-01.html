Card was <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>riding in the conveyance of Mr. Asa Slingeiiand down Bailey hill, a public road in Columbia township in this county; the vehicle went over the side of the bank, throwing the occupants out, and Mrs. Card was killed. The plaintiff, her husband, claiming that this was due to the negligence of the township authorities, brings this action to recover damages for the death of his wife. The defendant denies that there was any negligence on its part, and it also contends that the accident was the result of that over which it had no control, and for which it was in no wise responsible.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b275-5" data-blocks='[["BL_275.5",275,[232,862,1174,499]]]'>The first question that presents itself, naturally, is whether the township authorities were negligent. Negligence may be defined to be the want of that care which in any given case the circumstances require. It is the omission or failure to meet or perform some duty. That leads us then to the thought what duty was there in this particular instance which it could be claimed was omitted? This accident happened while the party was riding upon the public highway, by reason, as it is claimed, of defects in the road which rendered it unsafe and dangerous. . . .</p>

There has been a great deal of evidence bearing upon the question of the condition of the road at that time. You, yourselves, by the view which we all took, have seen how it now is. There have been changes made since the accident, but the evidence explains them, and the testimony, by comparison, carries us back to what it was at the time of the accident. A reasonably safe road should be of proper width, it should be free from dangerous obstructions upon its surface, proper regard should be had to make it not too steep, and it should be sufficiently guarded along the edge of places where there is danger that vehicles might get over the side of the road and result in injuries to the occupants unless there was some guard. Did the road at that point meet these requirements ? Was it sufficiently wide there <em>? ... .</em>

But, aside from all these matters, the main contention on the part of the plaintiff is that the road was not sufficiently guarded at the point of the accident. This seems to be the most important circumstance as to the con<a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>dition of the road, although the others may have their bearing. At this point, as you yourselves probably noticed, the road veered or bent a little to the left as you came down the hill. According to the testimony, and as we can readily see, before this ditch was dug out from the north side, it must have bent somewhat more, and the angle must have been still more abrupt. On the southerly side, where the -wagon went off, there is quite a fall. Some of the witnesses have said that it was not more than two and a half or three feet, and Mr. Webb, the surveyor, said that he measured it, and that it was seven feet off. The road was evidently built on a sidehill, and I believe that is the way it is described, and it is said that this abrupt bank was formed by the dirt being thrown out and the road made out over the side of the hill.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b276-5" data-blocks='[["BL_276.5",276,[257,1073,1184,871]]]'>, Below that there is a sharp declivity running down to the foot of the sidehill down into Mr. Ezra Dann’s field. The only thing that there was at this point at the time of the accident was a wire fence strung upon posts, these posts being set down at the foot of the first fall off from the side of the road, and beyond -that nothing except a comb or ridge of dirt on the side of the road. This has disappeared now by the road being filled up even with where it was. . . . Now, having regard to the construction of the road at that place, its width, the character of the surface and all about it, was this a point of danger that required a guard to protect people from getting over there, and if it did require a guard of some kind, was it sufficiently guarded by the comb of earth and the wire fence which were there ? These are questions which you must discuss and determine from all the evidence in the case, whether it was a point of danger, what protection it required and whether that protection was there ?</p>

It is shown that there have been other accidents at that place. Mr. Beardslee went over there a few weeks after the Card accident, and Mr. Jason Murray also went over in the winter of 1892 or the spring of 1898, and Mr. Frank Palmer went over with a load of hay. Those occurrences are to be taken into consideration, because if an accident happens at such a place as that it is some suggestion that it may happen again, and it calls the attention <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>of the township authorities to that possibility and suggests the need of providing against it. That is the reason that evidence was received here. As we understand it, in each of these cases it is suggested that if there had been a guard there the wagons would not have gone off, although perhaps this is a subject of controversy on the part of the defendant.</p>

We desire to caution you, however, about carrying this too far. We often have our eyes opened by experience to that we have not seen before, and it would be too bad if a man could not take advantage of that which was brought home to him in such a forcible way as this accident would bring it. And further, persons may be extra cautious. They may carry their precautions beyond that which would be absolutely necessary, and possibly that is the case here. Still, with these cautions, in considering this evidence, I have deemed it proper to have it laid before you, and you will take it for what you consider it to be worth.</p>

There can be no doubt that the road commissioners knew of its condition.

If it was a place of danger should there have been a guard there different from what there was <em>? ... . </em>You must be convinced, in the first place, that the township authorities were negligent and failed to provide that which the law required them to provide, for the reasonable safety of the traveling public, or there can be no recovery.

I shall not attempt to get into the evidence, but shall simply present to you the contentions on either side. On the part of the defendant it is claimed, and they have produced evidence to sustain their contention, that the colts driven by Mr. Slingerland were vicious and unbroken, that one of them had only within a short time come out of pasture, that he had manifested vicious habits, and that the tugs or traces were in an unfit and unroadworthy condition, not being properly fastened, and that they frequently came unfastened on that day. They also claim that the harness was otherwise defective, and that the near line on the near horse was tied with strings, which became caught in the hame ring. The defendants allege that three of the tugs came unfastened on that occasion, and in consequence of this the tongue dropped down, that the colts became frightened and kicked and became unmanageable and ran away, starting some distance above the hickory tree, as I understand it, and that the <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>wagon, after veering from one side of the road to the other, plunged over the roadside. [On the part of the plaintiff it is denied that these animals were vicious; and it is asserted that on the contrary they were well broken and gentle, and it is denied that more than one tug unfastened. It is also contended that the colts did not run until after they had pulled the lines through the hands of Mr. Slingerland, and that just at that point (the point of the accident having been reached at that time), for want of a proper guard there, the wagon plunged over the bank.] [2] ....</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b279-5" data-blocks='[["BL_279.5",279,[211,881,1170,509]]]'>It is claimed by the defendants that the parties who were present at the accident, immediately afterwards gave a description of it such as the defendants now set up, saying that the tugs came unfastened, that the tongue dropped down, and that the colts kicked and became frightened and ran away. There is also some evidence of parties who were below there, in the field or near the barn of Mr. Bradford, whose attention was attracted to the accident by the noise, and who claim that the character of the noise would correspond with the conditions and affairs claimed by the defendants. . . .</p>

The only positive evidence in regard to that would seem to be the other way. While the evidence is that Mrs. Card was quite a horsewoman and knew about handling horses very well, yet the testimony of Mr. Slingerland and his daughter is to the effect that upon that occasion, when they were driving up to the berry patch, she spoke of this bay colt that is particularly claimed to have been vicious, and remarked upon his being gentle and pulling well. And except for the circumstance that the tugs unfastened on the way home, once, or perhaps twice, as you view the evidence, there is no evidence that the unroadworthiness of the harness, if it was unroadworthy, was suggested to her. [She would not, therefore, be convicted of what we know as contributory negligence because of the use of this conveyance or harness or of these colts, even if they were what the defendant contends, and even though Mr. Slingerland knew it According to the evidence she was riding with Mr. Slingerland <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>by invitation, and without any knowledge, and unless there was something more apparent than has been shown here, she would not be called upon to say “this is something that I will not trust myself to,” so as to be convicted of contributory negligence if she did not speak out in that way. Of course I do not mean to suggest that this was the character of the horses, harness or wagon.] [3] There is evidence that it was not, as well as that it was. You are to determine from the evidence what the real facts were as to this matter. If you find that the contention of the defendant on these points is not sustained, but that these horses were sufficiently well trained and roadworthy; that this harness such as is ordinarily used and in ordinary condition, and the conveyance the same, then the conclusions which the defendant seeks to draw from their unroadworthiness fail, because if the facts are not established, no conclusions can be drawn from them. But if you find that the horses were vicious and the conveyance was unroadworthy, then, while Mrs. Card might not be affected with contributory negligence, she would be affected by that circumstance to this extent: If that was the condition of things, we should then have an extraordinary risk. It would not be the ordinary risk of travel. It would be something that the township would not be called upon to anticipate or provide against; and even though Mrs. Card was traveling with another person who was really responsible for the condition of things, while she would not stand exactly as Mr. Slingerland would if he were prosecuting a suit, yet the risk would be something out of the ordinary, and something which the township was not called upon to anticipate and provide against. The law would not cast upon it the duty of anticipating and providing against vicious and untrained horses and unroadworthy harnesses and wagons. If that was the condition of the. horses, wagon or harness, and that condition of things caused the accident, then the negligence of the township, if any, in not guarding the road at that point would not be the proximate cause. The accident would originate in something that it would not be called upon to provide against, it only being required to anticipate that which would arise from ordinary horses in ordinary condition, and from ordinary harnesses and conveyances.</p>

Later on he will specify the circumstances and consider their relation to the occurrence.</p>

In addition to the evidence descriptive of the grade, width and condition of the road in the vicinity of the occurrence, he in<a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>troduced evidence showing that other persons had met with similar occurrences at or near to the place of the occurrence in question. The plaintiff also introduced evidence showing that soon after the occurrence under consideration the township widened the road at or near the point where the wagon left it, and erected a fence or guard rail there with the view of reducing the risks attending travel at that point. With this brief summary of the principal evidence submitted by the plaintiff in support of his contention, we proceed to note the circumstances which constitute the principal reliance of the township for exemption from liability for the consequences of the occurrence which is the subject of this suit.</p>
    <p id="b287-5" data-blocks='[["BL_287.5",287,[172,972,1160,709]]]'>The circumstances which, according to the contention of the township, constitute the efficient and controlling cause of the occurrence were developed while Slingerland, a voluntary carrier of the persons riding with him, was driving down the Bailey road some distance above the point where the wagon left it, and they may be summarized and specified as follows, to wit: three of the four tugs attached to the whiffletrees suddenly became detached from them, the wagon pole dropped to the ground, the horses became frightened, the driver was unable to control them, and they ran down the road until they were stopped some distance below the place where they broke away from the wagon. The circumstances were so closely connected that they may seem to constitute a single circumstance. Be this as it may we have specified them in their order.</p>
    <p id="b287-6" data-blocks='[["BL_287.6",287,[171,1688,1163,711]],["BL_288.1",288,[304,359,1168,146]]]'>There is some conflict in the evidence respecting the circumstances and the cause of them. As illustrating the conflict we refer to the evidence showing that it was not unusual for the tugs to become detached from the whiffletrees, and to the evidence tending to belittle and discredit it; to the evidence showing that the horses were vicious and skittish, and to the evidence showing that they were well broken and docile; to the evidence showing that the appliances by which the tugs were attached to the whiffletrees were faulty in construction or unreliable by reason of long continued use, or want of proper repair, and to the evidence showing they were in good condition and comparatively safe. There is one item of evidence, however, which is undisputed. It is the admission that, on the day and about a mile from the place of the occurrence to which this litigation <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>relates, one of the tugs, at least, became detached from the whiffletree while Slingerland was driving down Gafford hill. This hill was on, or a part of, the Bailey road.</p>

The rejected offers related to the construction of the appliances connecting the tugs with the whiffletrees; they were to show by the opinions of witnesses that no prudent or reasonably careful driver would use them and that to use them in driving down a hill would be an act of negligence. We are not willing to say that there was error in the rejection of such offers. The ruling complained of in the twenty-third specification is not 'objectionable. The course of the wagon, after three of the tugs were detached from the whiffletrees, and the pole dropped to the ground, was plainly marked by the pole, and opinions respecting its course under such circumstances were not only inadmissible but of no account. There is nothing in the twenty-second or twenty-first specification which requires discussion. The alleged statement of Beardslee that “ some one had tried to break his colt and had made a bad' job of it ” was unimportant, and the explanation by the plaintiff that his statements based on what he heard immediately after the death of his wife proved, upon investigation to be incorrect was clearly admissible. It was for the jury to determine what effect should be given to the explanation. There is nothing in the eighteenth, twentieth, nineteenth, seventeenth, sixteenth, fifteenth or fourteenth specification which requires special notice. It is admitted by the defendant that evidence of other and similar accidents in the vicinity of the occurrence in question is admissible, and we discover no reasonable cause to complain that evidence descriptive of the condition of the Bailey <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>road and the nature and extent of Slingerland’s injuries was received.</p>

As is too often the case, the appellant selected a single sentence from that portion of the charge relating to the erection of a guard rail after the accident, and neglected to mention what was said in connection therewith. This method of specifying alleged error is unfair to the trial court and condemned by the appellate court. It does not appear that the evidence to which the excerpt relates was objected or excepted to, or that a motion was made to strike it out. It has been decided by this Court that the learned judge of the trial court cannot be convicted of error for commenting upon irrelevant or incompetent evidence so received. While this is a sufficient answer to the first specification, we may add that the defendant has not cited any decision of this Court which overrules its decisions in the numerous cases in which it has been determined that such evidence as the excerpt relates to is admissible.</p>

The part refused stated the circumstances we have already specified herein and which, the defendant contends, constitute the efficient and controlling cause of the occurrence under consideration. The court said there were circumstances and considerations not included in the- point, but did not state what they were. The other points were not divided, but were refused in toto and without explanation or statement of the grounds of the refusal. The circumstances specified in the points were not the result of a defect in the road. The tugs became detached from the whiffletrees and this was the primary cause of the casualty complained of. As a consequence of it the wagon pole dropped to the ground, the horses were frightened and ran away, and the driver was unable to guide or control them. None of these circumstances is chargeable to the negligence of the township. Its negligence lies in its failure to erect a barrier at the place where the wagon went down the slope. There is some evidence tending to show that the appliances connecting the tugs with the whiffletrees were defective, and if so they may properly be considered as the cause of the tugs becoming detached as above stated.</p>

Armstrong County, <a href="/pa/183/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="183 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="896119" data-case-paths="/pa/183/0184-01">183 Pa. 184</a>, is quite like the case at bar. In that case, “ after the wagon in which the plaintiff and several others were riding had safely passed over the bridge and proceeded up the hill <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>fifty or sixty feet, the eyes in two traces gave way and this resulted in freeing the horses from the wagon and from the control of the driver. Being thus situated the wagon ran back down the grade, and missing the bridge went over the embankment into the stream below.” It was held that the absence of guard rails was merely the remote cause of the injury the plaintiff received, and that “ the sole efficient and proximate cause was the breaking of the harness, in consequence of which the control of the wagon was lost.” The only distinction between that case and this is that in that the traces gave way while driving up a hill and in this the tugs became detached while driving down a hill. In Habecker v. Lancaster Township, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Pa.%20Super.%20558" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="9 Pa. Super. 558">9 Pa. Superior Ct. 558</a>, it was conceded that the township was negligent in not erecting a barrier at the quarry hole, and held that the sole cause of the accident was the breaking of the holdback straps and that the township was not liable. In that case, as in ours, the accident occurred while driving down a hill. Judge Rice, speaking for the court, said: “ The township officers were under no more obligation to foresee the breaking of a holdback strap going down hill than the breaking of a trace going up hill, and were under no plainer obligation to provide against the consequences in one case than the other.” If, in the case at bar, the jury find the facts as claimed by the defendant it cannot possibly be distinguished from the cases last cited.</p>
