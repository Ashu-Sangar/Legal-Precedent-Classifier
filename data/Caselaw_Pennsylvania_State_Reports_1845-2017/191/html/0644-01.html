On same day fi. fas. were issued on said judgments, but the fi. fa. on the Curtis, Jones &amp; Co. judgment was first placed in the hands of the sheriff, thus giving it priority over the Candee &amp; Co. judgment, so far as concerned personal property.

Curtis and Jones; their business was wholesale boots and shoes, in Reading, Pa. The firm of Fox &amp; Curtis consisted of George Fox and J. A. Curtis; their business was likewise wholesale boots and shoes, in Altoona. Fred W. Curtis and J. A. Curtis were brothers. From 1886, on down to the time of entry of said judgments, said two firms carried on the practice of exchanging notes to the extent of #4,500; that is to say, Fox &amp; Curtis gave their notes for #4,500 to Curtis, Jones &amp; Co., who had same discounted by Reading banks; in exchange therefor, Curtis, Jones &amp; Co. gave their notes for #4,500 to Fox &amp; Curtis, who had same discounted by Altoona banks. It is needless to determine the relative legal rights of these respective parties on the respective notes, so long as the seemingly endless chain of mutual accommodation paper was kept running. What we have to deal with is their legal rights and liabilities when events occurred which stopped movement of the chain. Nor is it very material at whose instance the chain was first put in motion. The auditor finds that it was at the request of Curtis, Jones &amp; Co., but he also finds that it was for the benefit of Fox &amp; Curtis; “ by the desire of Fred W. Curtis ” “ to furnish ” “ more capital ” for “ Fox &amp; Curtis.” As has been said, the respective legal liabilities of these respective mutual accommodation indorsers are immaterial so long as the chain would continue to run ; so long as each firm was solvent and able to take care of and renew its notes there could be no controversy. But suppose one firm should become embarrassed, in failing circumstances, while the other firm was solvent and prosperous; would not, under such a state of circumstances, the solvent and prosperous firm, unless it looked after its own interests promptly, stand a very probable chance of not only <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>having to lift its own notes, but likewise having to pay the notes of the other firm on which it was indorser? In other words, under such a state of circumstances, would not a very probable contingent loss of $4,500 stare the solvent firm in the face ? And this was the state of the present case in July, 1895. Curtis, Jones &amp; Co. were worth at that time at least $175,000. The auditor fails to find specifically whether Fox &amp; Curtis, at that time, were solvent or insolvent. I found as a fact, in the opening paragraph of my opinion in Fox &amp; Curtis’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20Pa.%2058" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="176 Pa. 58">176 Pa. 58</a>, that “on July 12, 1895, Fox &amp; Curtis, wholesale shoe dealers of Altoona, were insolvent.” A reading of the testimony taken before the auditor confirms said finding. Regard being had to the fact that they had compromised with their creditors in 1893; that their total sales only amounted to $3,000 per month; that the partners had overdrawn their accounts; that they were always in need of money, as testified to by Mr. Fiske; that part of their assets consisted of old uncollected accounts, as testified to by receiver Hughes, and the fact that this controversy is now before the courts—because if solvent there would have been sufficient assets to pay all their creditors—and there can be little doubt that the firm of Fox &amp; Curtis were insolvent on July 12,1895. They were financially embarrassed. All that was required was for some creditor to move on them legally, and they would topple over. There were not sufficient assets to satisfy all the creditors; if legal measures were resorted to, some one was bound to be left. On July 12, 1895, then, Curtis, Jones &amp; Co. were facing a probable loss of $4,500, incurred or likely to be incurred by reason of their being parties with Fox &amp; Curtis, in mutually and interchangeably negotiating accommodation paper, and subsequent events have shown that the loss was not only a probable one; in other words, they have been compelled to pay, not only their own notes to the order of Fox &amp; Curtis, but also the Fox &amp; Curtis notes to the order of Curtis, Jones &amp; Co. Such contingent liability was a good and valid consideration for the judgment note, taken by S. M. Meredith, attorney for Curtis, Jones &amp; Co., from J. A. Curtis for Fox and Curtis, for $4,500, on J uly 12, 1895, and entered to No. 393, June term, 1895. The fact that the liability was only contingent would not impair its validity as a consideration: Braden v O’Niel, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20Pa.%20467" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="188 Pa. 467">188 Pa. 467</a>. It is there said by Mr. Justice <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>Williams : “ Tlie question conies down to this: Can a debtor secure his friend against a contingent liability?

Curtis shows that the foundation was, viz: that the judgment so confessed was founded upon the liability of Fox &amp; Curtis <em>as makers of the four notes held by Curtis, Jones </em>¿• <em>Co. </em>Having fixed such liability as the foundation of such judgment, they cannot now shift their position and claim that the judgment is founded on anything else than the original consideration, viz : The liability of Fox &amp; Curtis as makers of these accommodation notes.”</p>

Evidently he intends to call attention to and lay stress upon the testimony of Fred W. Curtis, taken December 28, 1895, which is as follows : “ Q. (by Mr. Leisenring, as if on cross-examination). Then the foundation of the judgment which was confessed by Fox &amp; Curtis to Curtis, Jones &amp; Co. was their liability as makers of these notes of which you speak ? A. I desire to explain this matter.” The witness then goes on at length to explain about his own trip to Altoona, and how he came to send Attorney S. M. Meredith. “ Q. This answer is not an answer to the question which I asked you. I now ask you again whether the foundation of the judgment which was confessed by Fox &amp; Curtis to the firm of Curtis, Jones &amp; Co. on July 11, 1895, was based upon those notes of which you have spoken heretofore given <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>you by Fox &amp; Curtis? A. The foundation was <em>that we expected to lose </em>on the notes that we held against Fox &amp; Curtis. Q. Were Fox &amp; Curtis indebted to the firm of Curtis, Jones &amp; Co. for anything else than their notes which you held? A. No, sir. Q. Then the foundation of the judgment confessed on July 11 were these notes? A. Yes, sir; I suppose that is right.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b668-5" data-blocks='[["BL_668.5",668,[265,704,1178,1588]]]'>The italics —■“ that we expected to lose ”—are mine, and show I think, that the witness meant to say that the foundation of the judgment was not any particular notes, but an expected loss. It is evident that, although Fred W. Curtis may not have been sufficiently versed in legal lore to explain just how Fox &amp; Curtis were legally liable, he had sufficient business shrewdness to know that there was a probable loss impending, and the judgment was taken to indemnify against such loss. But, assume that, on December 28, 1895, he was made, by the questions of astute counsel, to base his claim on an insecure legal foundation, if his claim was a just one why should he not be permitted thereafter to “ shift ” his “ position ” and state the true legal foundation? And on July 14, 1897, the same witness, Mr. Fred W. Curtis, did again go on the witness stand and relate how his firm, Curtis, Jones &amp; Co., had to pay not only their own notes, but also the Fox &amp; Curtis notes, and, in effect, state that the attendant loss from paying both sets of notes was the foundation for the judgment. I conclude, then, that the said judgment, No. 398, June term, 1898, Curtis, Jones &amp; Co. v. Fox &amp; Curtis, $4,500, was founded on a valid consideration, and that the auditor in his conclusion founded on deductions from facts, that said judgment was invalid because not supported by or given for a valid consideration is in error. But the auditor likewise found that there was actual fraud, independent of mere want of consideration, or, assuming that there was a valid consideration, which would vitiate or invalidate said judgment, and postpone the execution issued thereon so as to let in on the fund arising from the sale of personal property the junior execution of Candee &amp; Co. This finding, as to actual fraud, is likewise founded mainly on inferences from facts, and to my mind is erroneous and unwarranted.</p>

Weigley, ‘to repel it by clear evidence or else stand convicted.’ To the auditor it seems that very early in the case the burden of clearing their skirts was placed upon Curtis, Jones &amp; Co.” Following up this line of thought, the auditor, seemingly, “ convicts Curtis, Jones <em>&amp; Co. </em>upon suspicion alone.” True, the auditor quotes and professes to be guided by the following language of Mr. Justice Mitchell in Werner v. Zierfuss, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20Pa.%20366" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="162 Pa. 366">162 Pa. 366</a>: “ It may be considered as an established result of our eases that if a creditor takes a judgment, or conveyance, or payment in any form, to secure an actual debt, the transaction will be valid against other creditors, although he knew (1) that the effect would be to postpone the others; (2) that the debtor intended it to have that effect; and (3) although he took it to aid that intent as well as to protect himself. The criterion is not the effect, but the fraudulent intent. Without that the transaction cannot be impeached.” But the auditor seemingly failed to give any heed to the next sentence in said opinion in Werner v. Zierfuss, which is as follows: “A corollary of the foregoing rule is that where there is an actual debt, the jury cannot be permitted to infer a fraudulent intent from the mere fact of payment, or preference given to it.” The auditor likewise failed, seemingly, to be guided by the legal doctrine laid down in the preceding paragraph of said opinion: “ The rule is different when property is taken for a debt. One creditor of a failing debtor is not bound to take care of another. It cannot be said that one is defrauded by the payment of another. In such case, if the assets are not large enough to pay all, somebody must suffer. It is ‘ a race in which it is impossible for every one to be foremost.’ He who has the advantage, whether he gets it by preference of the debtor, or by his own superior vigilance, is entitled to what he wins, provided he takes no more than his honest due.”</p>

Where there is contradictory evidence as to material facts, the opinion of an auditor as to which witness is telling the truth is entitled to great weight, but, where the alleged contradictions are as to immaterial matters, the matter becomes comparatively unimportant. The alleged contradictions, alluded to by the auditor, are as to immaterial matters. Take the matter of the date of the notes. The auditor says as to this: “ Whatever may have been the purpose or object of misdating the note the auditor is unable to say, but that there was a sinister purpose in it he is not prepared to deny.” But why impute a sinister purpose when explanations consistent with a proper motive are at hand, such as an honest mistake as to the correct day of the month, etc. So, too, as to the other contradictions referred to by the auditor, as to Mr. Fred W. Curtis’s statement at one time that the note was not prepared in Altoona, afterwards that he thinks he saw something like it at Reading, before Mr. Meredith came to Altoona; the further circumstances, on which the auditor lays much stress, that Mr. Meredith was contradicted as to the day of the month on which he came to Altoona, as to his interview with Mr. Fox, and' whether it was the fault of Meredith or of Fox that no subsequent meeting between them was held.</p>

Fred W. Curtis, of Curtis, Jones &amp; Co., had been in Altoona in June, and had offered to take the assets of Fox &amp; Curtis and pay said firm’s debts, dividing any surplus between the partnors. It was only after what seemed to Fred W. Curtis an unusual and uncalled for delay in answering said proposition that the attorney of Curtis, Jones &amp; Co. was sent to Altoona to protect the interests of that firm. This circumstance, namely, the offer to take assets and pay debts, it seems to me, shows that Curtis, Jones &amp; Co. were not fraudulently unmindful of the rights of others, and only had recourse to extreme measures as a last resort.</p>

Possibly, the error on the part of the auditor arose from his seeming prejudice against the claim of Curtis, Jones &amp; Co., as inequitable, as tending to give Fox <em>&amp; </em>Curtis a false credit. But such is almost always the inevitable result of borrowing money from confidential friends; creditors have no legal right to complain so long as no actual misrepresentations are made. Wholesale houses have a method of guarding against such secret claims, if they see fit to adopt it, by taking statements from their debtors before they sell them goods.</p>
