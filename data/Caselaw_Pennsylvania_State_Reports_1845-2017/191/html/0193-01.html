The sum receipted for did pay for all coal mined before January 1, 1889, but as above stated tbe excess was not always paid to the end of each quarter when it was demandable. Facts bearing upon said main statement are these: Rev. Mr. Waller was exceptionally intelligent and capable and attentive regarding business matters; be occasionally called at tbe company’s office and inquired about tbe state of bis account and statements showing its condition taken from tbe books were given to him; such inquiries related to excess, because each quarter be received by mail a statement of coal and cash charged' to him and a check for what was owing on tbe $2,250 rent; be bad access to the books and looked at them sometimes; it is not proved that any false statement was rendered to him or that he ever asked for a statement and was denied.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b218-5" data-blocks='[["BL_218.5",218,[269,1121,1174,1069]]]'>9. The allegations in tbe bill that tbe quarterly statements rendered were false and misleading; that by reason of tbe omission therefrom of excess of coal mined tbe lessor was kept in ignoranpe of such excess, and that tbe conduct of tbe lessees was in fraud of tbe lessor’s rights is not established by evidence ; none of said averments is proved by tbe books, statements or correspondence between tbe parties; no witness has testified to anything material in this reference, except results and inferences from defendant’s books; the assertion that tbe lessees led Rev. D., J. Waller to infer that no excess was mined is rebutted by what is stated in tbe last finding and by tbe fact that on several occasions before February, 1889, be received large sums, not appearing on tbe quarterly statements, and which be knew were paid on excess ($8,000 was thus paid in tbe third quarter of 1883 by tbe coal company, limited, and by defendant, $2,000 in second quarter of 1884 and $6,518.85 in fourth quarter of 1888, tbe advances for which notes of lessor were given, that is $5,000 on December 6, 1884, and $2,000 on May 15, 1885, are also borne in mind. As to said allegations of bad faith tbe answer is responsive to tbe bill and denies said allegations. That denial is not overcome by adequate evidence.</p>

Waller knew that payment for the excess was demandable at tbe quarter day next after it was taken out. A contrary view would have to rest on tbe idea that he was ignorant of an important covenant in his indenture, or that be <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>thought that the excess was payable at the pleasure of the lessees or not until the estate granted had expired by the exhaustion of the coal, none of these would be reasonable surmises even.</p>

A stated account properly exists only where accounts have been examined and the balance admitted as the true balance between the parties without having been paid. When such balance admitted is paid the account is deemed a settled account: Br. Eq. Juris. § 658. Pleas are abolished by the equity rules of 1894; all defenses shall be by answer or demurrer. In substance the answer sets up that an account has been settled. The receipt in full of February 9,1889, supports that defense. Conceding that the receipt is not to be regarded as a solemn written contract between parties executed and delivered, but the acknowledgment of a party only (Batdorf v. Albert, <a href="/pa/59/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="59 Pa. 59" data-case-ids="426991" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0059-01">59 Pa. 59</a>); it must be held that the receipt has not been overcome by <em>evidence; </em>the prima facie proof established by it has not been contradicted. The only error concerning the receipt urged by plaintiffs’ counsel is the matter of interest on the excess. The court has found that the lessor did not intend to exact interest. He accepted the principal tendered to him by the check for $6,078.20 in full discharge of the debt. He could waive the claim for interest. As to claims prior to January 1, 1889, the rights of the plaintiffs are the same as the lessor would possess if he were still living and were suing. If the lessor were seeking to recover interest prior to January 1,1889, his position would be that of one who accepted payment of an overdue debt, where no interest was contracted for, and who several years afterwards sued to recover interest. Interest is a legal and uniform rate of damages allowed in the absence of any express contract when payment is withheld after it has become the duty of the debtor to discharge his debt: Kesey v. Murphy, <a href="/pa/30/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="30 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="415551" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0340-01">30 Pa. 340</a>; Minard v.

Where a <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>balance of an account was paid without any charge for interest the court refused to open the account to support a claim for interest: Consequa v. Fanning', 3 Johns. Chan. 587. The defendant subscribed to the capital stock of a railroad company the amount of subscription to be paid “ in such instalments and at such times as the board of directors might lawfully direct.” Several calls were made by the directors amounting in the aggregate to the precise sum subscribed, which were all paid by the defendant but not at the time designated in the calls, and receipts given. Nothing was said about interest and no claim made for it until after the whole principal had been paid. Held, that an action would not lie to recover interest on the several amounts specified on the calls for the time they remained unpaid after the day designated for payment by the call: Central E. E. Co. v. Moravia, <a href="/barb/61/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="61 Barb. 180" data-case-ids="2261636" data-case-paths="/barb/61/0180-01">61 Barb. 180</a>. Where parties themselves settle their accounts (at regular intervals) without charging each other with interest it is not in accordance with law or equity to go behind such settlements for the purpose of allowing interest in favor of one party against the other, such settlements are considered conclusive unless impeached for fraud or mistake: Chandler v. Bank, <a href="/cal/61/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="61 Cal. 401" data-case-ids="2268170" data-case-paths="/cal/61/0401-01">61 Cal. 401</a>. Where there is a stipulation for interest it may be recovered even ^fter the principal debt has been paid; but it is otherwise where the interest is recoverable merely as damages or as incident to the debt: Chitty on Contracts, p. 959, note <em>7c; </em>11 Am. &amp; Eng.

However, I rest the decision of this point on the fact that lessor did not intend to claim interest for arrearages before 1889; that his receipt is evidence of that fact; his previous dealing corroborates that view.</p>

That and every other averment alleging bad faith, and that the lessor was kept in ignorance of the quantity mined, are denied in the answer.

Upon this view of the case also it must be held that the receipt of February 9, 1889, remains unimpeached and uncontradicted.
