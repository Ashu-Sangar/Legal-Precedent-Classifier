It is to be remembered that the question now under consideration is whether classification based simply upon the value of the property is such reasonable classification as will support a tax law which seems to be in conflict with the constitutional requirement of uniformity. We assert that such classification is not only without reason, but that the reason assigned is subversive of the fundamental principles of American equality before the law. It divides the community into two classes, with the figure $5,000 as the line of demarkation. To the one class it proclaims that they are too poor to be called upon to contribute their pro rata for the support of the <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>state; to the other it announces that they have more than enough, and it is proposed that they alone shall bear the burden.</p>

If taxation of inheritances on this basis of classification is lawful, all taxation may be imposed upon the same basis. The legislature may prescribe that only the excess over $5,000 upon the assessed valuation of the land of each individual landowner shall bear the burden of the land tax. Such a statute would exempt from taxation the larger proportion of the dwelling houses in this city, and relieve the burden now carried by the small farmers of the state. Such legislation may be commended upon economic grounds by academic theorists who have imbibed the teachings of foreign schools and know little of the principles of American liberty and American democracy.</p>

It cannot be that in the first quarter of only the second century of our existence as a nation of freemen equal before" the law, we are to have a statutory declaration enforced by judicial sanction that there is a class of the poor and a class of the rich with the sum of $5,000 the dividing line.</p>

In his Treatise on Taxation (2d ed.), pp. 2,3, the same learned author says: “ In an exercise of the power to tax, the purpose always is that a common burden shall be sustained by common contributions, regulated by some fixed general rule and apportioned by the law according to some uniform ratio of equality. The power is not, therefore, arbitrary, but rests on fixed principles of justice which have for their object the protection of the taxpayer against exceptional and invidious exactions, and is to have effect through established rules operating impartially.”</p>

By necessary implication, the first clause of that section recognizes the authority of the <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>legislature to justly and fairly, but never arbitrarily, classify those subjects of taxation with the view of effecting relative equality of burdens. A pretended classification that is based solely on a difference in quantity of precisely the same kind of property is necessarily rinjust, arbitrary and illegal. For example, a division of personal property into three classes with the view of imposing a different tax rate on each,—class 1, consisting of personal property exceeding in value the sum of one hundred thousand dollars (§100,000), class 2, consisting of personal property exceeding in value twenty thousand dollars (§20,000) and not exceeding one hundred thousand dollars (§100,000), and class 8, consisting of personal property not exceeding in value twenty thousand dollars (§20,000)—would be so manifestly arbitrary and illegal that no one would attempt to justify it.</p>

In any view that can reasonably be taken of these limitations, it must'be manifest to any reflecting mind that the act in question offends against them by undertaking to wholly exempt from taxation the personal property of a very large percentage of decedents’ estates, and impose increased and unequal burdens on the residue of the same class of property.</p>

As we have seen, the act does not profess to be a supplement to or an amendment of our laws relating to the estates of testates or intestates, but quite the reverse. There is nothing in its title or its text to indicate anything else than that it was intended to be a tax law imposing a tax of two per centum on the personal property of decedents therein specified within the scope of article 9 of the constitution; but assuming, for argument’s sake only, that it is otherwise,—that it was in fact intended to be an act supplementary or amendatory of existing laws regulating the succession to estates of decedents, we think it clearly offends against that clause of article 3, section 7 of the constitution, which declares : “ The General Assembly shall not pass any local or special law .... changing the law of descent or succession.”</p>

The pre-existing law of succession is changed by that act, in that it imposes a burden ou so much of said property as is in excess of $5,000, and leaves it unchanged as to the residue. It is therefore a special and not a general act, because it does thus impose a burden on a part of said property, and declares that, in all estates, personal property, not exceeding $5,000 in value, shall be exempt from said burden. It thus changes the law of succession as to part of the property specified therein, and attaches a condition to the right of succession which is neither general nor uniform, in that the burden is not imposed upon all distributees or all estates of decedents, but only upon a portion of them arbitrarily selected, while others in precisely the same class are exempted therefrom. As to classification, it is very clear that $5,000 in value of the personal property specified in the act is precisely the same in kind as $50,000 (or any other sum) in value of said property. The money value of any given kind of property, such as that specified in the act can never be made a legal basis of subdivi<a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>sion or classification for the purpose of imposing unequal burdens on either of such classes, or wholly exempting either of them from any burden.

Whatever the percentage of such estates maybe, —whether more or less than five to ten per centum,—it conclusively shows the special character of the act in question. It also illustrates the injustice and inequality that must result from such special legislation. If the exempted personal property were subjected to the same tax rate that is required to be paid on personal property in excess of $5,000, it would yield to the commonwealth an average of about $50.00 on each decedent’s estate,—a sum that is by no means insignificant when the aggregate number of such estates is taken into consideration.</p>
