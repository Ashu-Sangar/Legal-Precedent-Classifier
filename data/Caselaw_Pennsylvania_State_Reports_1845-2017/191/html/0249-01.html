They operate upon the surface of streets and carry passengers short distances for low fares. Here their likeness ceases. The electric motor has brought upon the crowded city streets as well as upon many of the country highways, cars and trains with a speed and size approaching those of the steam road; subject in their passage to grade crossings of other cars at well nigh every street corner, and of vehicles and foot passengers at every foot of their course and on every hand; running at short intervals of time and space making collision peculiarly likely; subject to frequent and abrupt starting, stopping and turning and to many switches with possibility of derailment. All of these things make transportation upon the electric car quite as perilous as upon steam roads and leave no room for comparison with the slow, deliberate and easily controlled transportation by horses. Under these circumstances, is the passenger who rides upon the platform of the trolley to be held to the rule applicable to steam roads or to the horse car?</p>

When the plaintiff boarded the car he was accompanied by a friend who took a seat within the car and was uninjured by the collision. Again, the plaintiff’s evidence is that the passengers inside the car were “shook up and scared, and some hurt,” but McAvoy, the plaintiff’s friend, who was in the car and had the better opportunity of knowing what befell the other passengers, says : “ The people that was inside, when they seen them coming, they jumped up and run to the back of the car, it shook them up pretty well in there, some of them was thrown down I think, 1 can’t say for sure.” On all the testimony it seems plain that the peculiar injury complained of by the plaintiff was contributed to, if not wholly caused by, his presence on the platform, and thus convicts him of such contributory negligence as is a bar to recovery.</p>

Unless he shows some valid reason’ to excuse him, a passenger is bound to put himself in the appointed place, and if he does not, he takes the risk of luis location • elsewhere. This L the settled rule of all our cases. In Germantown Pass. Ry. Co. v. Walling, <a href="/pa/97/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="97 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="444802" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0055-01">97 Pa. 55</a>, it was said by the trial judge and affirmed by this Court, that “ it is the duty of the passenger to go into the proper, usual and safe place, if it is possible to do so.” And in Mann v. Phila. Traction Co., <a href="/pa/175/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="175 Pa. 122" data-case-ids="880567" data-case-paths="/pa/175/0122-01">175 Pa. 122</a>, it was said “the car was empty and it was the clear duty of the passenger to take his seat on the inside.”</p>
    <p id="b272-6" data-blocks='[["BL_272.8",272,[304,1465,1187,510]]]'>In the present case it is undisputed that there were vacant seats in the car, one of which the plaintiff could and should have taken. He chose instead to stay on the platform. In so doing he took all the risks incident to that position. The injury he received by being thrown against the dasher was the direct consequence of his position, and would not have been received had he been inside. Whether he would have received some other injury, equal or greater, is conjectural and irrelevant. If he is to recover at all it must be for injuries received, not for what he might have received under different circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b272-7" data-blocks='[["BL_272.9",272,[305,1981,1187,356]]]'>The distinction sought to be made between injury from ordinary risks of the road and from a collision, the result of negligence of the carrier, is not sound. What the passenger took upon himself was the risk of his position from any cause.

In respect to this subject, the electric trolley car occupies a position between these two. As said by our Brother Fell, in Reber v. Pittsburg, etc., Traction Co., <a href="/pa/179/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="179 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="887017" data-case-paths="/pa/179/0339-01">179 Pa. 339</a>, “the use of electricity as a motive power by passenger railway companies has created new conditions from which new duties arise. The greater speed at which cars are ipoved increases the dangers to passengers and to persons on the streets, and of these dangers all persons must take notice.” The principle at the foundation of the rule is and always has been the same, but in the development of methods of travel, the circumstances and conditions have changed. Bapidity of transit is no longer a mere convenience to the traveler, it has become a matter of vital interest to the general business of the community. The increased speed upon passenger railway lines, with its resultant danger, now approximates to that of steam railroads and, indeed in many cases, exceeds the speed of the fastest trains at a time not too remote to be within the memory of every judge on this bench, a time at which the rule as to steam cars was first established. The reasons which were potent in the establishment of that rule then are equally potent in its application now. We hold therefore that where there is room to be seated inside in the passengers’ proper place, and no special and sufficient reason is shown why he should not avail himself of it, it is negligence per se to remain on the platform of a moving trolley car.</p>
