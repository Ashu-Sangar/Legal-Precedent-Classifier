Case was to contribute $1,000 as his share of the capital stock of Ed. M. Hart &amp; Co. To do this, he borrowed $500 from his father-in-law, the plaintiff, on May 5,1897, and paid the balance June 22, by a negotiable note drawn by Mr. Page to Case’s order, payable four months after date at the West Branch National Bank. This note was indorsed by Case and Ed. M. Hart &amp; Co., discounted by the bank, and the proceeds went to the credit of the partnership. Case was credited with the cash and proceeds of the note as capital and charged with the discount. The note was renewed, October 22, 1897, with like paper signed by Page to Case’s order, indorsed by him and the suspender company, Ed. M. Hart having retired in the mean time, and the partnership name changed to Williamsport Suspender Company.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b533-5" data-blocks='[["BL_533.5",533,[191,1064,1171,404]]]'>It is unquestionable that the money and credit loaned by Page were obtained by Case for the purpose of meeting his obligation to his copartners, and it is just as clearly proved that he not only failed to disclose this fact to Page, but represented to him that he was borrowing the money for the firm and they would protect him. No security was given Page until the confession of this judgment by Case for the defendant company, which was done without the knowledge of his partner, Keightley.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b533-6" data-blocks='[["BL_533.6",533,[187,1478,1175,713]]]'>Between the partners the money loaned by Page was Case’s debt, but Page is on a different footing. Each partner is the general agent of the firm and has the power to bind his co-partners by acts done within the scope of the business. He may borrow money for the partnership and give notes therefor in the name of the firm. “ If the lender is informed or has notice that the money is borrowed for the individual use of the partner borrowing, and not for the firm, the partnership is .not liable for any security that may be given therefor in the name of the firm. But if the lender has no knowledge or notiee, at the time of making the loan, the firm will be liable therefor, although the money may have been borrowed for the separate use of one of the partners: ” Mr. Justice Williams in Potter v. Price, 8 Pitts. 136.</p>

It follows that the $500 loaned by <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>Page was a debt of the partnership, and a judgment confessed for that amount would withstand the attack of its creditors.</p>

It was no more than a declaration that as between the members of the firm themselves they would consider it a debt of the partnership. To make it a claim which could be enforced by Page they would have to ratify the transaction or assume the debt by positive agreement with him: North Pa. Coal Co.’s App., <a href="/pa/45/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="45 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="9502594" data-case-paths="/pa/45/0181-01">45 Pa. 181</a>. Page’s indorsement is another matter. His loan of money was a valid debt of the firm, only because there was no notice to him of the purpose for which the money was obtained and the consequent lack of authority in Case to bind the partnership, nor any circumstance that would have put a reasonably prudent man on inquiry. But when his son-in-law asked him to back the firm in securing a discount in bank he presented a paper on which the name of the partnership nowhere appeared. Instead, it was a note payable to his own order, and Page signed it, thus becoming the accommodation maker, not for the partnership but for Case. If, as we believe, Case said he wanted the money for the firm, this note bore on its face evidence that his statement, if not false, was at least not the whole truth. It was apparent, from the form of the instrument, that it was for some individual transaction of Case’s. When presented to Page the partnership stamp was not on the note in any form. Notice of any fact that ought to put a man on inquiry is sufficient to protect a firm from the acts of a partner within the scope of the business: Potter v. Price, 3 Pitts. 136. Surely here was enough to lead any reasonably prudent man to inquire, why, if I am loaning my credit to the partnership, am I asked to sign a note payable to one of the partners ? And inquiry would have developed that the money to be raised on the paper was to meet Case’s obligations to his copartners, and for that he had no power to bind them. Mr. Page thought he was the indorser for the suspender company, but that cannot effect the law of the case. A man cannot be heard to say he did not know that which by due care he should have known. This loan of credit is not a partnership debt, and the confession of judgment by one partner, without the consent of the other is a fraud <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>on him and the firm creditors: McNaughton’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/101/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="101 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="500888" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0550-01">101 Pa. 550</a>. And this fraud it would seem taints the whole judgment, for a judgment fraudulent in part is void in the whole as against other creditors: Gates v.

The only exception to this rule and recognition of partly good and partly bad judgments is, as Judge Arnold points out in Moore v. Dunn &amp; Fell, <a href="/pa/147/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="147 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="829843" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0359-01">147 Pa. 359</a>: “ In cases of judgments held by married women against their husbands in which the excessive part will not be attributed to bad faith, but will be presumed to be a mistake, or included in good faith.” <em>We </em>would be inclined to add this case to the exception rather than hold it within the rule, but our judgment of what the law is must control our personal views of what it should be.</p>

    <p id="b537-9" data-blocks='[["BL_537.11",537,[198,1626,1164,301]]]'>The first question raised by the assignments of error is the constitutionality of the Act of July 9, 1897, P. L. 237. The act is entitled a supplement to the act of March 17, 1869, relative to fraudulent debtors, “ authorizing the courts to inquire into the validity of judgments confessed and alleged to be fraudulent, and providing the practice therefor.”</p>
    <p id="b537-10" data-blocks='[["BL_537.12",537,[195,1935,1165,402]]]'>It is objected that this act is void, first, because the title is not sufficiently explicit and the subject is not germane to that of the act to which this assumes to be a supplement, and secondly, because section 2, which provides that no witness shall be excused from answering as to any matter relating to the inquiry, is in violation of the fifth amendment of the constitution of the United States, and also of section 9 of the bill of rights of the constitution of Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b537-11" data-blocks='[["BL_537.13",537,[195,2346,1163,94]],["BL_538.1",538,[294,406,1174,817]]]'>Neither of the objections is tenable. The subject of the act is entirely germane to the act of 1869. The title of the latter <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>refers to fraudulent debtors and that of the former to fraudulent judgments given by debtors. The subject of both acts is fraud by debtors against their creditors, and the object of both is to enable the creditors to investigate and defeat fraud if it be discovered. The methods and remedies are different but the object is the same. The title to the act of 1897 would have been good if it had ended with calling it a supplement to the act of 1869. But it did not stop at that. On the contrary, it went on and set forth the subject of the act itself with sufficient clearness to meet all requirements, even if it had not been called a supplement at all. The act of 1869 is not referred to or mentioned in any way in the body of the act, and omitting all the words referring to the act of 1869 the title would read “ an act authorizing the courts to inquire into the validity of judgments confessed and alleged to be fraudulent, and providing the practice therefor.” Such a title indicates the subject with entire clearness.</p>
    <p id="b538-4" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[291,1232,1178,714]]]'>The second objection is equally untenable. The fifth amendment of the constitution of the United States has no applicar bility at all to the matter. As to the constitution of Pennsylvania, if any part of the act transgresses, which has not been shown, it is section <em>2, </em>which is so distinct and separate that it might be cut off without in any way affecting the body of the act or its object. The act is constitutional and its purpose plain. Previously no creditor could interfere with another creditor’s execution unless he had a lien himself by levy or otherwise. This act was intended to give a general creditor a standing such as he would have had if he had had a lien, and to facilitate his inquiry into the alleged fraud. It is for his benefit, and does not change the settled rule that a judgment, fraudulent as to creditors, is nevertheless good between the parties.</p>

The act is mandatory that the bond shall be filed before the rule is granted, and the proceedings, therefore, were irregular and should have been quashed, if the objection had been made in time. The first petitioner, however, by leave of the court, filed a bond nunc pro tunc, and as the objection was not made until the record was in this Court, it may fairly be considered as waived by the respondent in the rule, now appellant, for whose benefit the bond was required <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>The other petitioning creditor who was permitted to intervene has never filed any bond, and the rule as to him was without jurisdiction in the court. He therefore has no standing in the case.</p>

The court therefore found that a judgment for $500 would have been good against creditors, but in regard to the note he held that, as it was in the name of one partner only, Page was put upon notice and chargeable with knowledge that as between the partners, the money raised by the discount of the note was money due to the firm by Case as part of his contribution to the firm capital. As to this sum therefore the court held that it was not a debt of the firm, and being included in the judgment made it wholly void. These deductions however are not sustained by the facts. The representation by Case to Page was that the money was to be raised for the use of the firm by the discount of the note. There was nothing extraordinary in that. One partner may borrow in his own name for the use of his firm, and if he borrows by having his note discounted it is no different. The only effect of the form of the loan is to put on the lender the burden of proof that ho believed the money was for the firm, and that it actually reached it. Both these elements were established in this case. Page thought he was lending to the firm, and the money in fact went to and was used by it. It is true that as between the partners, the money was due by Case as contribution to capital, but it is not at all clear that the form of the note on which it was borrowed was sufficient notice to put Page on inquiry into that fact, in the face of Case’s assertion that it was money borrowed for the firm, and still less that it would support any inference of fraud in including this sum in the judgment. There must be fraud, and the creditor must be party to it, to avoid the judgment at the suit of other creditors. In Meckley’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/102/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="102 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="502707" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0536-01">102 Pa. 536</a>, 543, it was said by our late Brother Clark: “It is doubtless true, as said by Mr. Justice Sharswood in Clark v. Douglass, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Pa.%20415" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="62 Pa. 415">62 Pa. 415</a>, that ‘a judgment confessed voluntarily by an insolvent or indebted man for more than is due is prima facie fraudulent within the statute of 13 Eliz. c. 5 ’ but then it is only prima facie fraudulent, and <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>as the auditor has specifically and expressly found from the evi deuce that, in fact there was no dishonest or fraudulent purpose to cheat or defraud, delay or hinder the creditors, that prima facie presumption is by the auditor’s finding fully rebutted.” So here, we do not think the rules of law are to be so applied as to compel us to hold that to be a fraud which the court has on the evidence found to have been done honestly and in good faith. The court below applied the legal presumption too rigidly in view of the actual facts.</p>
