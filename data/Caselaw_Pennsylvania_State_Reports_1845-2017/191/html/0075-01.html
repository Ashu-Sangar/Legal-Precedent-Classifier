The auditor has carefully considered the able argument of the counsel for the trustee in support of- his contention that the intent of the testator was to keep the original estate intact, and that to diminish the original principal by the amount of the legacy and distribute all the accumulations as illegal would not only defeat his intention, but also run counter to the policy of the law, but cannot see his way clear to adopt this view of the case. In his opinion, the accumulations directed by the will were good only during the minority, and then under the provisions of the acts of assembly and the decisions of the courts, belong absolutely to the minor, no accumulations being authorized by law for any other person, and that therefore the $20,000 legacy must necessarily come out of the corpus of the estate. The language of the will and codicil would seem, in your auditor’s opinion, to indicate that this was also the intention of the testator, for it will be noticed that in his will the testator has used the words “ share and shares ” invariably until he comes to dispose of the surplus income, which he directs the trustee to accumulate into capital, and from and after that time to pay all income accruing on such capital to his children; and by his codicil he modifies the provisions of the will respecting the shares of his daughters, and directs that the trustee of their shares shall, upon the arrival of each of his daughters at the age of twenty-one years, pay over to such daughter out of her share the sum of $20,000 <em>absolutely; </em>or, if any daughter shall have arrived at the age before the payment to the trustee aforesaid of her share of his estate, he directs that his executrix shall make such payment and transfer <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>of said sum of $20,000 to her directly. If this last event had happened in the case of this daughter, to wit: if she had become of age before the executrix had paid over to the trustee this daughter’s share of the decedent’s estate, it would have been the duty of the executrix to have paid to the daughter the said sum of $20,000, and as there would in all probability have been very little, if any, accumulated fund out of which to have paid the same in the hands of the executrix, it must necessarily have been paid out of the principal share of the said daughter’s part of the decedent’s estate in order to carry out the intent of the testator.</p>

By the terms of the codicil the provisions of the will were expressly modified and changed, so that out of the shares of the daughters as fixed by the will there should be paid to the daughters respectively on their arrival at the age of twenty-one years, the sum of $20,000 absolutely. The title of the daughters to these sums of $20,000 each, is derived directly from the codicil, and the source from which these sums are to be taken is the principal of the estate. The testator directs his executrix to divide all <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>the residue of his estate into as many parts or shares as there may be children, or issue of a deceased child or children, living at the time of his death, and the share or shares respectively of any child or children so living at the time of his death he directs his executrix to grant, assign and pay over to the trustee, to invest the same and hold such share or shares in trust for such child or children severally and respectively. The words “ share ” and “ shares ” as thus used in the will must clearly import share or shares in the residue of the estate, and when the testator in the codicil uses the same words to indicate the source from which the §20,000 must be taken, it necessarily follows that it is out of the residue of the estate, which is the.principal in the hands of the trustee that these legacies must be paid. That being so, the remaining considerations are very simple. It is conceded that the provision for accumulations is void, and it is only necessary to refer to the statute to learn what becomes of them. The words of the act (April 18,1853) are, “ And the rents, issues, interests and profits so directed to be accumulated contrary to the provisions of this act shall go to and be received by such person or persons as would have been entitled thereto if such accumulation had not been directed.” Under our decisions in Washington’s Estate, <a href="/pa/75/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="75 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1036620" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0102-01">75 Pa. 102</a>, McKee’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/96/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="96 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="494646" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0277-01">96 Pa. 277</a>, Grimm’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/109/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="109 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="542287" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0391-01">109 Pa. 391</a>, Rhode’s Est., <a href="/pa/147/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="147 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="829834" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0227-01">147 Pa. 227</a>, and other kindred cases, the unlawful accumulations go to the minor absolutely upon attaining majority. The title to them is derived from the statute and.is therefore not vfithin the control of the testator. In this view of the subject it is clear that the whole amount of the unlawful accumulations belongs to the appellee, and must therefore be paid to her absolutely, and the §20,000 legacy, to her by force of the codicil, and that also must be paid to her directly. We think the question is quite free of difficulty, and that it needs no further discussion. . .</p>
