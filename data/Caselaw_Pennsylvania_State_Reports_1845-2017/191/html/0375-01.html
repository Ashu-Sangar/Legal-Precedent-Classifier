For if a man have sufficient mind to distinguish between right and wrong and also sufficient will power to control his acts, so as to give him freedom of choice, [that is, so that he might have done different from what he did, then he is responsible before the law and should be punished for his criminal acts, even though he may not have had at the time an entirely sound mind. And while a slight departure from a well-balanced mind may be pronounced insanity in medical science, yet such a rule cannot be recognized in the administration of the law, when a person is on trial for the commission of a high crime. The just and necessary protection of society requires the recognition of a rule which demands a greater degree of insanity, to exempt from punishment.] [19]</p>

And supposing the defendant was at the time able to distinguish between right and wrong, and yet was laboring under partial insanity, hallucination or delusion which drove him to the commission of the act as a duty of overwhelming necessity, is he in such case responsible for his act ? If the delusion were of such a character as to induce the defendant to believe in the real existence of facts which were entirely imaginary, but which, if true, would have been a good defense, he would not be responsible; but if the defendant, although he labors under partial insanity, hallucination or delusion, did understand the nature and character of his acts, had a knowledge that it was wrong and criminal, and mental power sufficient to apply that knowledge to his own case, and <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>knew if he did the act he would do wrong, and would receive punishment; and, if, further, he had sufficient power of memory to recollect the relation in which he stood to others, and others stood to him ; that the act in question was contrary to the plain dictates of justice and right, injurious to others, and a violation of the dictates of duty, he would be responsible.</p>

The object of these rules and the reasons upon which they are founded have been fully stated in Battles v. Sliney, <a href="/pa/126/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="126 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="968916" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0460-01">126 Pa. 460</a>, and in Com. v.

In the latter case it was said by our Brother Mitchell: “The assignments are the pleadings of this court, and the only part of the case that remains of record after the remittitur to the court below. They should therefore be self-explanatory and self-sustaining, giving in each assignment separately the offer, with so much of the proceeding or accompanying evidence as is necessary to the proper understanding of the offer, the ruling of the court upon it, and if testimony objected to be admitted, so much of it as may suffice to show why it was injurious to the party objecting.”</p>

We find quoted, in connection with the printed argument of counsel, a part of the testimony on which the rulings of the court as to the competency of jurors were based, but that part only which is favorable to the appellant’s contention.

If the accused alleges insanity he must establish it by fairly preponderating evidence or the presumption of sanity which the law raises stands unshaken. . . . There is no middle ground which the law recognizes; nor does a doubt of sanity reduce the grade of the crime to murder of the second degree. . . . Either the offense of defendant is wholly excused because the jury is satisfied by the preponderance of evidence of his irresponsibility, or he is guilty because the evidence fails to so satisfy them.” We have quoted from the opinion at length because it clearly expresses the principles of our decisions on the subject under consideration.</p>

Nothing short of a very clear abuse of discretion would induce us to interfere with the judgment on this ground.
