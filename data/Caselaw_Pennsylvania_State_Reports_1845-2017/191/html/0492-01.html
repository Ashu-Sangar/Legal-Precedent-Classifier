Avenue Passenger Railroad Company; that can only be called in question by another proceeding. The South Side Passenger Railroad Company stood by from 1888 to 1897, without ever raising a question or controverting the right of the Second Avenue Passenger Railroad Company and the Second Avenue Traction Company to run their cars on the tracks in dispute. Of course, it knew and must have known that the cars of the Second Avenue Passenger Railway Company were running on these tracks from 1888, and that the Second Avenue Traction Company was running its cars from 1894, after it had obtained, by assignment, all the rights of the Second Avenue Passenger Railway Company. All the stock of that company, except five shares which are not represented, was transferred to the Pitts-burg &amp; Birmingham Traction Company, and that company also has a lease for 999 years of the entire property of the South Side Passenger Railway Company. That company has, therefore, no substantial or tangible interest in the tracks in dispute which requires a court of equity to interfere between the Pitts-burg &amp; Birmingham Traction Company and the Second Avenue Traction Company. From the long lapse of time and the other circumstances connected with this case, the South Side Passenger Railroad Company is estopped from denying the validity of the agreement of November 9, 1891, or the rights of the Second Avenue Traction Company to run on these tracks. That bill is, therefore, dismissed.</p>

The more important controversy in this case is raised by the cross-bill of the Pittsburg &amp; Birmingham Traction Company. The contention of that company is that the contract of November 9, 1891, was not authorized by the directors of that company or reported to and approved by a meeting of the stockholders. But the evidence shows that the officers of the Pitts-burg &amp; Birmingham Traction Company were the movers for that agreement. It was sanctioned by the attorneys of that road; it was approved before it was made, by all or nearly all of the stockholders of that company, at least by a very great majority of them, and was reported by the president to the annual stockholders’ meeting in 1892, when no objection whatever was made to <em>it; </em>and it has been carried into effect fully and completely. The tracks were repaired and put in condition as provided in that contract, the payments were made in pur<a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>suance of it, and monthly reports have been made in pursuance of that agreement ever since. The road has been in operation under that agreement, without any objection by the Pittsburg <em>&amp; </em>Birmingham Traction Company as to its validity, until this cross-bill was filed, six years after the contract was entered into. Under these facts the Pittsburg &amp; Birmingham Traction Company is estopped from denying the validity of that contract.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b521-3" data-blocks='[["BL_521.4",521,[177,780,1169,917]]]'>It raises the question, also, whether the Second Avenue Traction Company has any rights; denying that it is an assign, properly speaking, of the Second Avenue Passenger Railway Company. It appears from the evidence that the Second Avenue Traction Company owns all the stock of the Second Avenue Passenger Railway Company. It also has a lease from that company for 999 years of all its franchises, property and rights of every kind whatsoever, and an assignment from that company also of that lease. This leaves the Second Avenue Passenger Railway Company without any property or rights whatsoever for 999 years. It is virtually out of existence, except in name, for that period of time, and all its franchises, rights and property of every kind, possessed and exercised by the Second Avenue Traction Company, by virtue of the leases and assignments just mentioned. Therefore, the Second Avenue Traction Company, if not technically, is, at least, actually, and to all intents and purposes, the assign of the Second Avenue Passenger Railway Company.</p>

Another question then arises as to the proper construction of that agreement of November 9, 1891. The contract was made in view of the certain natural increase of business in 999 years between Glenwood and Grant and Market streets in Pittsburg. There is nothing specified in it or limited as to the extent of the user or the number of cars that may be used on those tracks. If the Second Avenue Passenger Railway Company connected with , other railroads at Glenwood it might, doubtless, have hauled their passengers from Glenwood to Grant street and Market street, but, of course, in that event, there would have been a change of passengers and a change of ears at Glenwood; but, by virtue of the leases that were obtained of these other railroads beyond Glenwood, the Second Avenue Traetion Company is now running its cars continuously <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>from Market street to the termini of those various roads, and the question raised by the Pittsburg &amp; Birmingham Traction Company as to the construction of the agreement is, that that is outside the terms of the agreement. The agreement was simply to run the cars from Grlenwood in to Pittsburg. Now, the Second Avenue Traction Company is running its cars continuously from Market street in Pittsburg to those various termini. Let us look at the precise terms of this contract of November 9, 1891. It was evidently based on the idea that the two companies had an equal interest, and would run about the same number of cars, or make about the same number of trips of cars on the tracks in dispute. They were each to pay one half the expenses of reconstructing the railroad; one half the expense of equipping and maintaining the road in good condition ; one half the cost of the poles, trolley wires and overhead equipment then erected; one half the expense thereafter of maintaining them and keeping them in good order; the Second Avenue Passenger Railway Company was not to extend its lines or make any contracts to run its cars across the river to any points reached by the lines of the Pittsburg &amp; Birmingham Traction Company, nor make any agreement with any other company so that its cars could run from such competing points; and the Pittsburg &amp; Birmingham Traction Company agreed that if it should allow any other company, not its successor or assign, to use these tracks, a proportional credit should be allowed the Second Avenue Passenger Railway Company on its half of the expense. These provisions clearly indicate that the parties were dealing on the basis of equal interest. No provision is made for either party extending its lines. That does not seem to have been contemplated. The provision that, if the Pittsburg &amp; Birmingham Traction Company should allow any other company to use the tracks, there should be a proportional deduction from what the Second Avenue Passenger Railway Company should pay, most strongly confirms this view. Considering the terms of the agreement of November 9, 1891, and the circumstances under which it was made, to allow the Second Avenue Traction Company, by virtue of its numerous leases of other roads, to run more cars than the number of cars run by the Pittsburg &amp; Birmingham Traction Company over these same tracks, without paying an increased proportion <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>of the expenses, would be manifestly unfair and inequitable. A just and equitable arrangement would be for the companies to pay the expenses provided for in the agreement in proportion to the number of cars; that is, the number of car trips made by each company over these tracks.</p>

The contract of November 9,1891, was made on the implied understanding that the two contracting parties would have about an equal use of the tracks between the Tenth street bridge and Grant and Market streets, and each party pay one half the expenses. Since the Second Avenue Traction Company has got control of the roads beyond Glenwood, its use of said tracks is greater than that of the Pittsburg &amp; Birmingham Traction Company, and it should pay a greater proportion of the expenses. And it is now ordered and decreed that the expenses provided for in the contract of November 9,1891, be apportioned and paid by the two companies in proportion to their use of said tracks; that is, in proportion to the number of car trips made by each company over said tracks; which shall include the ears owned or controlled by each company passing over said tracks; and it is further ordered and decreed that the Second Avenue Traction Company settle with the Pittsburg &amp; Birmingham Traction Company on this basis, for the term from January 1, 1896, to January 1,1898, and thereafter every month, or at such other times as they may agree upon. If the parties cannot agree upon the amount due January 1,1898, or upon any period hereafter, or upon any other question arising under this decree, either party may apply to this court for such further order or proceedings as may be necessary.

The appellants, complainants in the bill and cross-bill respectively, though upon opposite sides of the record in both cases, have the same interest, and are seeking the same relief, and the substantial defendant is the Second Avenue Traction Company. The subject of controversy is the right of the Second Avenue Traction Company to use the tracks of the South Side <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>Passenger Railway on certain streets in the city of Pittsburg, under an agreement made in 1891 between the Pittsburg and Birmingham Traction Company and .the Second Avenue Passenger Railway Company. The court below heard the bill and cross-bill together and delivered one opinion covering both. For convenience we follow the same course.</p>
    <p id="b529-4" data-blocks='[["BL_529.5",529,[209,661,1168,446]]]'>The court below held, first, that the South Side Passenger Railway Company had no substantial interest in the subject which would justify a court of equity, in view of the delay and other circumstances, in interposing; secondly, that the Pitts-burg and Birmingham Traction Company was estopped from contesting the validity of the contract of 1891; thirdly, that the Second Avenue Traction Company was an “ assign ” of the Second Avenue Passenger Railway Company, within the terms of the contract of 1891.</p>
    <p id="b529-5" data-blocks='[["BL_529.6",529,[209,1125,1165,136]]]'>In these three findings on the facts and the law we concur, and as to them the decree will be affirmed on the opinion of the court below.</p>
    <p id="b529-6" data-blocks='[["BL_529.7",529,[206,1280,1170,453]]]'>The court further found that the agreement of 1891 was “ evidently based on the idea that the two companies had an equal interest, and would run about the same number of cars or make about the same number of trips on the tracks in dispute,” but as the Second Avenue Company, by reason of its numerous leases of other roads, was now running more cars than the Pitts-burg and Birmingham Company, he decreed a “ just and equitable arrangement” by which the expenses, should be paid by each in proportion to the number of its cars.</p>
    <p id="b529-7" data-blocks='[["BL_529.8",529,[198,1742,1173,662]],["BL_530.1",530,[264,364,1174,705]]]'>In this, however, the court fell into the serious error of making an arrangement which, however just or equitable as matters would now stand if they were starting de novo, was not at all what was called for by the contract as actually made by the parties. The interest of the parties was not equal, nor was the contract based on any such idea. On the contrary the Pitts-burg and Birmingham Company was the owner of the tracks (de facto at least for the term of years) and the Second Avemte Passenger Railway Company was a licensee, or at most a sub-lessee. The latter had no rights but those the agreement gave it, the former had all the rights of ownership that the agreement did not part with. This is explicitly recognized in the provision that if it should allow any other company as licensee to use <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>its tracks a proportionate credit should be allowed the Second Avenue Company. The allowance of another company to come in as a licensee was by virtue of the lights of ownership. The latter company had no such rights, and could not divide or share or part with its privileges, except to an assign within the terms of the agreement. No doubt the idea of an equal amount of use was the basis of the proportions of the expense of maintenance the two parties were to bear, but their interests in the corpus of the thing were entirely different. Had the business of the Second Avenue Railway Company, by natural growth, led to more than equal use of the tracks, there could have been no ground of complaint, for however much the idea of equality of use may have influenced the rent to be paid, the license to use was unrestricted as to amount.</p>
    <p id="b530-4" data-blocks='[["BL_530.5",530,[262,1086,1178,1020]]]'>This brings us to the really vital question in the case. The use by the Second Avenue'Railway Company was without limit as to amount, but it was a use for itself and its own cars. It had a power of growth, but it had no general power of expansion into other fields, or of increase by the absorption of other roads. When it was itself absorbed by the Second Avenue Traction Company, the latter became, as already held, a practical “ assign,” and as such entitled to the continuance of all the rights and privileges given to its assignor by the agreement of 1891, but to nothing more. It did not thereby step into the agreement as an independent party in its own right, with all its own corporate privileges. As to all those it was still a stranger, and its only place in the agreement was as the locum tenens of its assignor, with only the latter’s contract rights. The use of the tracks therefore by the Second Avenue Traction Company for cars which it hauls in the operation of its leased or consolidated lines, other than the Second Avenue Passenger Railway Company, is not merely an increased, use of the latter’s privilege, but a distinct and independent use outside of the agreement of 1891, and without legal right.</p>

But we are saved any difficulty on that point by <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>the offer of the Pittsburg and Birmingham Company in its cross-bill to accept “ any reasonable arrangement,” and the disclaimer by counsel at the argument of any relief sought, beyond a recognition of its rights and adequate compensation for the use of its property. What the measure of that shall be we have no facts before us to indicate, and all we decide now is that the measure of compensation fixed by the court below was not based on the proper recognition of the rights of the complainant.</p>
    <p id="b531-4" data-blocks='[["BL_531.5",531,[194,761,1168,609]]]'>So much of the decree as dismisses the bill of the South Side Passenger Railway Company, holds the Pittsburg and Birmingham Traction Company estopped from contesting the validity of the agreement of 1891, and adjudges the Second Avenue Traction Company an assign of the Second Avenue Passenger Railway Company, is affirmed on the opinion of the court below ; but the rest of the decree is reversed and a decree directed to be entered in favor of the Pittsburg and Birmingham Traction Company upon its cross-bill against the Second Avenue Traction Company upon the principles indicated in this opinion ; costs up to this point to be paid by the Second Avenue Traction Company.</p>
