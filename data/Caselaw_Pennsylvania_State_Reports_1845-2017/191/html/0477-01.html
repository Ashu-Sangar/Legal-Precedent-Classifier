It is not enough to say, you ought to be satisfied. He has the <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>right to say he is not satisfied, and that is binding, unless it is a frivolous or capricious objection, in order to avoid taking the machinery which is offered to him. Now, in this case I do not think it is contended on either side that the defendant did not properly express his dissatisfaction as to the condition in which the elevator was. The point in this case is, and it is contended by the plaintiffs in this case, that be was entitled to a reasonable time in order to correct the defects in the machine before it was offered to this party as a complete machine. And he contends it was never offered to this party as a complete machine because he was prevented by the aetion of the defendant from making it complete. The second point is that, even admitting that the defendant was right in saying that it was not substantially complete, and that it had a right to say so, yet, still, after that a second contingency arose. “ The whole work and material to be of the best, and should there be any difficulty as to the work giving satisfaction, then you are either to make it entirely satisfactory or to take it away and replace it with one that will be so.” So that the contention of the plaintiffs is on these two points; that they were not offered a fair opportunity to present it in its completeness, that they were not allowed sufficient time to make it satisfactory. That, it seems to me, is the whole question in this case. Of course, there should be a reasonable time allowed for both of these things. It would be idle and absurd to say a man could go on forever tinkering at a machine of this kind, but he ought to have what, in a business point of view, would be a reasonable and fair opportunity, to put his machine to the best advantage, and if, after a reasonable and fair opportunity, he did not present it in such a condition as his contract called for, he cannot recover.</p>

The plaintiffs’ explanation of that is that originally he was to complete the whole machine, along with what is called the cage, and that subsequently the part in relation to the cage was taken from him, and he made an allowance in consequence of the fact he was not obliged to furnish it, and he attributes his delay in completing it at the proper time mainly to the fact that the person who was to fur<a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>nish this cage did not furnish it when they were ready for it, and, of course, until it was furnished the machine could not be completed, and by reason of that and other causes he was really excused from completing it at the time he was required by the contract.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b500-4" data-blocks='[["BL_500.4",500,[287,636,1182,810]]]'>On the other hand, it is contended by the defendant, even if plaintiffs were entitled to a moderate delay, they were not entitled to the delay they claim, and that throughout this whole work the defendant company gave every opportunity that it thought reasonable to have all the faults corrected, and when it was applied to, asking other opportunity to do so, it did not hesitate to grant the request. [So that the main question for you to decide in this ease is that. Do you believe that they had a fair and reasonable opportunity to finish this machine and tender it to the defendant, or do you believe they had a reasonable opportunity if it was unsatisfactory to make it satisfactory? If they had not, your verdict should be for the plaintiffs.] [7] If, however, you think the defendant fairly did all he agreed to do and gave every opportunity a reasonable man had a right to ask to have this thing perfected, then your verdict should be for the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b500-5" data-blocks='[["BL_500.5",500,[285,1462,1180,405]]]'>[When I use the word, “ finished,” as to the machine, I mean substantially finished. If there was some trifling matter, which would enable a person to say, “ I have not entirely finished it; I haven’t put in a tack or nail, or something ”—I don’t mean that. I mean in such condition as would justify the statement that it was substantially finished—then the defendant had a right to exercise his option about it.] [8] The defendant’s points are declined except as answered in the charge.</p>

Under the terms of the contract, the money for the elevator was to be paid for the entire work only when completed and working to the entire satisfaction of the defendant company. That being so, the question of the running and working of the elevator was left to the judgment of the said defendant company, and unless there was caprice in the exercise of its judgment, the plaintiffs were bound by it, and in that event your verdict must be for the defendant.

That being so, as a matter of law, the judgment of the defendant corporation was exercised fairly and not capriciously; therefore your verdict must be in its favor. [2]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b501-5" data-blocks='[["BL_501.4",501,[185,595,1167,407]]]'>8. It having appeared from the evidence in this case that the elevator was completed sufficiently to enable the defendant, by riding passengers in it and otherwise, to determine whether it was or would be satisfactory, therefore the rejection of the elevator by the defendant company was not premature, and under the terms of the contract, not being satisfied with it, the company had a right to reject it; therefore your verdict must be for the defendant.
