This claim comes squarely in conflict with the interpretation of section 8, article 9 of the constitution, as announced in Pepper v. City of Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/181/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="181 Pa. 566" data-case-ids="891393" data-case-paths="/pa/181/0566-01">181 Pa. 566</a>. The question involved there was precisely the same as here, and the present chief justice speaks as follows:</p>
    <p id="b165-12" data-blocks='[["BL_165.11",165,[181,1403,1177,756]]]'>“ It is clear, therefore, that in all cases cited we have adhered to the proposition that the increase of two per cent authorized to be made by the second clause of the eighth section may not be transcended except by a popular vote, and this, whether the increase has been made by successive additions, each less than two per cent, or at one time and by one municipal act alone. We have not allowed this percentage of increase to be exceeded in any instance by mere municipal action. It follows, therefore, that, as the two per cent limit in the present case has been more than reached by previous additions, though by subsequent reductions the aggregate of the additions is now slightly below the two per cent limit, the ordinances authorizing the two loans of $8,000,000 and $3,000,000 respectively, are both invalid, and the plaintiff's bill must be sustained and the injunction prayed for awarded.”</p>

Those cases hold that the sinking fund must be deducted from the amount borrowed, in determining whether the seven per cent limit has been <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>reached; here the question is, whether the two per cent limit of increase can be exceeded without a popular vote ? <em>We </em>hold that it'cannot. The city already has borrowed, since the adoption of the constitution, more than two per cent, and more than that percentage of that additional indebtedness is now outstanding and unredeemed. Although the proposed new debt would not exceed the seven per cent limit, nor exceed two per cent of the assessed valuation, nevertheless, it makes more than two per cent of new debt, since the constitution went into effect; therefore, notwithstanding the reductions, the municipal authorities must have recourse to the people for authority to increase the debt.</p>
