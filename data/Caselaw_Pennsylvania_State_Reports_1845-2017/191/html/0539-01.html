Heasley, living in Emlenton, Venango county, Pennsylvania, was a member of the Northwestern Masonic Aid Association of Chicago, Illinois, and had a certificate for the payment by the association of $5,000 at Ms death. The original certificate was issued March 10, 1879, numbered 8288, payable at his death to his son,- Pitt O. Heasley, if then living, and if not, then to his own legal representatives. On Ms own application and at his request, on surrendering that certificate, the association, on December 20,1879, issued another, in place of the first certificate, retaimng the same number, payable at his death to Ms son, Pitt O. Heasley, if living, and if not, then to the devisees or legal heirs of his said son. On March 13,1890, the said Jeremiah H. Heasley applied to the association for a new certificate, in place of the'second one above mentioned, alleging it was lost or destroyed; thereupon the association issued a third certificate, dated December 20,1890, payable at his death to his son, Jeremiah H. Heasley, Jr., or to the heirs of Jeremiah H. Heasley. The father died in 1896, his son, Jeremiah H. Heasley, Jr., surviving. Pitt O. Heasley died in 1889, devising all his estate to his widow, the plaintiff. She and the son Jeremiah each claimed the fund. The association paid the money into court, filmg a bill for the parties to interplead, and this issue was formed.</p>

The <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>articles of association on which it was incorporated, state, “ The particular business and object for which said association is formed is to secure pecuniary aid to the widows, orphans, heirs and devisees of deceased members of said association.” But the bylaw of the association adopted in 1874, and continued the same until 1889, was not so restricted as to the beneficiary. Article 4, in relation to “ membership,” section 4, was in these words : “ In all applications for membership the applicant shall designate to whom he desires benefits paid, and his certificate of membership shall be made in conformity therewith.” It then provided that upon surrender of the old certificate he might change the beneficiary, numbered the same as the old. Section 3 provided that the “ certificate shall contain the terms of the agreement or contract between the association and the member to whom it is issued.”</p>

The by-laws provided for the classification of members into divisions and classes, according to age, and the amount of assessment to be paid on the death of a member of that division and class. Jeremiah H. Heasley belonged to division B and class 4. He was to pay on the death of a member of his division, according to article 5 of the by-laws, an assessment of $1.40 on notice from the board of trustees. There were no sick benefits or funeral expenses. By article 6 of the by-laws, on the death of a member, the board of trustees shall pay “ to such person or persons as shall appear legally entitled to receive the same as follows, viz: for each member of the same division with the deceased, for class 4, $1.20, provided that the aggregate sum so paid shall in no case exceed .... in division B $5,000.”</p>

In the annual report of the board of trustees to the association, at Chicago, January 9,1889, referring to the great amount of business of the previous year, and the wonderful prosperity of the association, the report says: “We are, if possible, more and more convinced of the wisdom of our plan, the permanency of our system, and the continued success of the Northwestern Masonic Aid Association, so long as there shall be a demand among healthy men for life insurance at cost.” Again in the report of January 8, 1890, for the year 1889, the board of trustees speak in glowing terms of their business and prosperity, and say, “ the Northwestern Masonic Aid Association has never consolidated with or reinsured any other company.” But applicants have come voluntarily, “ convinced of the desirability of our plan of insurance.” These reports do not refer to any change in their plan, from the beginning, but refer to the character of their business all along. Neither was there any material change in the bylaws, although the association may have had enlarged powers under later legislation. This character of the business of the association from its start, in 1874, is confirmed by the testimony of James A. Stoddard, who was the secretary of the association from 1874 to 1898. He says in his deposition, the association “ issued policies upon the life of any one, either a Mason or recommended by a Mason.” At the time the certificate of December 20, 1879 (the second), was issued, it was customary for the association to issue certificates “ payable similarly to the manner in which this is payable; ” the company did not pay any sick benefits, its business was confined “ strictly to life insurance,' payable upon death to the policy holder; ” the divisions, A, B, etc., were made to designate at that time the amount of insurance which each man carried. “ Commissions were paid agents for obtaining new members or new insurance.” Upon the death of a member assessments were made “ to pay the amount of his insurance; ” the association had “ no philan<a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>thropic or benevolent purpose other than to collect and pay to the beneficiaries of a member, upon his death, the amount of insurance which he had obtained;” “a good many payments were made out of the accumulated surplus or assets of the association.” “ The sole and only object or purpose of the association was to offer indemnity or security for loss of life of the members insured.” “ This company has paid over such losses amounting to a million and a quarter of dollars, out of moneys saved out of the expense element of the assessments.” These extracts from the testimony of Mr. Stoddard are conclusive of the real character of the association, from its inception, and long before it openly became an insurance company. The annual reports of the board of trustees as to the financial affairs of the association, its annual receipts, expenses, payments, commissions, etc., are consistent only with an insurance business. In 1896 the name was changed to the “Northwestern Life Assurance Company.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b563-5" data-blocks='[["BL_563.5",563,[194,1209,1172,918]]]'>6. The assessments were generally paid bimonthly. From the date of the first certificate, March 10, 1879, to his death in 1889, Pitt O. Heasley paid all the assessments, and both certificates, that of March 10, 1879, and December 20, 1879, were in his possession; he surrendered the first when the second was issued. It was in his possession at the time of his death, and has remained in the possession of his widow and devisee ever since. She paid the assessments for one year after his death, until February, 1890, when the father got the third certificate. She and her husband paid the assessments for eleven years. After the father took out the third certificate, making his son, Jeremiah, Jr., the beneficiary, she offered to pay to the association the assessments as they were made, and continue to pay the same, but the association refused to receive the money from her. Jeremiah, Jr., paid the assessments after that until his father’s death, six years. The exact amount paid by each party was not in evidence, but the evidence indicates, and the fact is so found, that the assessments for each year were $100.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b563-6" data-blocks='[["BL_563.6",563,[193,2134,1169,240]]]'>7. Just before the third certificate was taken out, Jeremiah, Jr., at the request of his father, applied to the widow to give up the certificate she held (the second), but she refused to surrender it, claiming an interest in it by virtue of the will of her husband.</p>

The application of the father to the association for the third certificate, March 22,1890, and to change the beneficiary, was on the ground that that certificate was “ lost or destroyed.” Yet in that application he says, that after the death of Pitt O. Heasley that certificate came into the possession of his widow, and whether it was destroyed or not, he cannot state, but he is “ unable to obtain the certificate at present to forward for cancelation,” as the by-laWs required. That was express notice to the association that that certificate was not lost, but in possession of the widow, who refused to surrender it and might claim an interest in it.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b564-6" data-blocks='[["BL_564.6",564,[280,1020,1181,973]]]'>It is contended on part of defendant that the member of a benevolent association can change the beneficiary at will, and the beneficiary takes no interest that requires consent or notice before the change. That principle is not denied, but it does not apply to this case, because, while the association was a benevolent association in name, it was virtually doing an insurance business, and this was a contract of insurance. Even if that is true, it is further contended that under the statutes of Illinois the association had no right to engage in the insurance business, and it would be ultra vires. I doubt whether the association could raise that question after receiving the assessments for so many years. It does not raise the question, but has paid the money into court, and asked for an issue to determine which of these parties is entitled to the money. If the association could not raise that question, how can either of these parties raise it ? The question before us, and the only question, is this: under these certificates, these contracts, and the facts of the case, which of these parties is entitled to the money, or how shall it be distributed ?</p>

This is virtually a contract of insurance. The father paid none of the assessments (with the exceptions perhaps of one or two assessments after the death of his son Pitt, but these were refunded to him by the widow). His son Pitt and the widow paid them for eleven years, thus keeping the policy alive. Jeremiah, Jr., paid them for six years, keeping it alive until the father’s death. Each receives a benefit from what the other <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>did. They both contributed to secure the fund now in court, and for distribution; it is a fund raised by the payment of assessments for seventeen years; the plaintiff and her husband paid for eleven years, eleven seventeenths of the whole, and the defendant for six years, six seventeenths of the whole. It would be manifestly unjust to give the entire fund to one, to the exclusion of the other.</p>

The contention there was whether the widow or executrix took the fund, or whether it went to the “ heirs ” under the intestate law. The contract was regarded rather as an insurance, and the question was whether the widow, who had a power of appointment under the will, could claim the money, or whether it should go in accordance with the express words of the policy, “to the heirs at law of William D. Jones.” The facts of that case were wholly different from the facts in this case.</p>

    <p id="b567-7" data-blocks='[["BL_567.8",567,[198,940,1172,1066]]]'>The association is an Illinois corporation, chartered as a beneficial association, and it issued its certificate of membership in that capacity. By the law of Illinois such associations are not insurance companies. Prima facie this association therefore was a beneficial association, and it was so held in Northwestern Masonic Aid Association v. Jones, <a href="/pa/154/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="154 Pa. 99" data-case-ids="842411" data-case-paths="/pa/154/0099-01">154 Pa. 99</a>, where it was said by Thompson, J., in delivering the opinion of the Court, “ The purpose of the association was to secure pecuniary aid to the widow, orphans, heirs and devisees of deceased members. .... It is not an insurance company, nor are these certificates, issued by it in the state of Illinois, contracts of insurance.” The undertaking of insurance companies and of beneficial associations being alike to pay money after death, their business inevitably runs upon closely allied lines, but the distinctive marks are pointed out with great clearness by our late Brother Clark, in Com. v. Association, <a href="/pa/137/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="137 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="821444" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0412-01">137 Pa. 412</a>. We have examined the evidence in the present case and are of opinion that it was not sufficient to overcome the presumptions from the charter of the association and the law of Illinois, nor to justify a disregard of the prior decision of this Court on the status of this association.</p>

These latter provisions were clearly for the protection of the association itself, and did not create any right in the beneficiary or any other person by the mere possession of the certificate. In 1890, after the death of his son Pitt, the first beneficiary, Heasley, Sr., procured a <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>new certificate, naming his son J. H. Heasley, Jr., as beneficiary, upon an affidavit that the first certificate was lost or destroyed and that he was unable to obtain it. It appears that in fact it was at that time in possession of the plaintiff, the widow of the first beneficiary, Pitt, but she had refused to give it up,- and it was therefore true that Heasley, Sr., was unable to obtain it for purpose of surrender. The plaintiff’s husband, being a mere voluntary beneficiary, had no vested right in the certificate or the money to become due upon it which he could transmit to her by will or by possession of the instrument. When Heasley, Sr., exercised his privilege as a member to change the beneficiary, and the association accepted his affidavit as a compliance with its by-law and issued the new certificate payable to J. H. Heasley, Jr., the latter’s right attached, and the widow of the former beneficiary had no standing to question it.</p>

But there was no basis for such division. So far as appears, all the payments, during the life of Heasley, Sr., were voluntary, and could not interfere with his rights as a member. Had they been made under a contract with him, the case might have been different, and an equity made out, but such contract is neither averred nor proved.</p>
