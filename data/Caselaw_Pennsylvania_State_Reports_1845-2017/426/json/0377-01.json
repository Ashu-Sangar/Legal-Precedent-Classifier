        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nThese appeals involve two separate actions concerning the same matters. The first (appeals numbers 188 and 194) presents a petition seeking a declaratory judgment, which action was brought June 18, 1965 by Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) and the City of Philadelphia against Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC) and its subsidiaries. Plaintiffs\u2019 petition requested the court to determine (1) the right of SEPTA as the city\u2019s assignee to purchase the assets of PTC pursuant to an option to purchase contained in paragraph Eleventh of an agreement dated July 1, 1907, as amended; (2) the meaning of the purchase price formula set forth in the agreement; and (3) such other matters necessary to effect the transfer of PTC\u2019s property. Thereafter, certain minority shareholders of PTC petitioned to intervene as defendants, and their petition was granted by this Court on May 13, 1966. After hearing extensive testimony, the trial court held on July 14, 1966 (approved by the court en banc on September 16, 1966) that (1) the city\u2019s reserved right of purchase under the agreement of 1907, as amended, was valid; (2) the city\u2019s assignment of that right to SEPTA was valid; (3) SEPTA, as the city\u2019s assignee, must pay to PTC a sum composed of the following amounts reflected by PTC\u2019s balance sheet as of the date of payment: (a) an amount equal to PTC\u2019s then outstanding bond, mortgage and ground rent indebtedness; (b) an amount equal to ten dollars per share for all then outstanding common stock of PTC; and (c) the amount of the then \u201cRetained Earnings\u201d of PTC.\nThe second action (appeals numbers 189 and 192) involves a complaint in equity filed July 8, 1966 by Edmond G. Thomas (a taxpayer) and PTC against the City, the Mayor, and the Commissioner of Public Property of Philadelphia, and against SEPTA. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint prayed, inter alia, for an injunction restraining defendants from carrying out the agreement of June 8, 1965, whereby the city assigned to SEPTA its right to purchase PTC. The city and SEPTA filed preliminary objections, and on September 16, 1966 the complaint was dismissed for the reasons stated in the opinion of the court en banc filed that day in the declaratory judgment proceeding.\nThe lower court\u2019s opinion, we believe, sets forth a comprehensive well-reasoned analysis of the problems involved and proposes, in every instance, a solution which this Court deems fair and proper. Accordingly, we recommend to the interested reader that he closely study that opinion, for we intend here only to highlight the matters of importance.\nIn 1902, the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company (PRT) was formed as a consolidation of the various transit systems previously existing in Philadelphia. On its own or through subsidiaries, PRT leased, owned and operated high speed lines, and bus and taxi facilities throughout the city. On July 1, 1907, the city and PRT entered into a written agreement which provided in Section Eleventh: \u201cThe City reserves the right to purchase all the property, leaseholds and franchises of the Company, subject to all indebtedness . . . upon July 1st, 1957, or upon the first day of any July thereafter by serving six months\u2019 notice . . . [for] an amount equal to par for its capital stock then outstanding, to wit: the thirty million (30,000,000) dollars of capital stock now authorized plus any additional capital stock issued with the consent of the City hereunder. . . .\u201d\nIn the decades that followed, PRT suffered financial misfortune. Finally, in 1938 the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a reorganization plan filed by PRT. On May 20, 1939, City Council consented to the reorganization and enacted an ordinance authorizing the execution of an amendment to the 1907 agreement. On June 12, 1939, the amendment was executed. It made five major changes in Section Eleventh:\n1. The 1939 agreement enabled the city to purchase the entire transportation system (since PTC, unlike PRT, owned the leaseholds and franchises of the underlies and traction companies), not just PRT\u2019s leaseholds and franchises, as provided in the 1907 agreement.\n2. It allowed the city to purchase PTC\u2019s assets free and clear and not subject to PTC\u2019s indebtedness.\n3. It permitted the city to exercise its reserved right of purchase on any July 1, with 6 months\u2019 notice to PTC.\n4. The formula for determining the purchase price was changed to the following: a. The amount of PTC\u2019s outstanding bonds, mortgage and ground rents; b. The par value of PTC\u2019s outstanding preferred stock; c. $10 per share of PTC\u2019s outstanding common stock; d. The amount of PTC\u2019s then undistributed corporate surplus.\n5. The city reserved the right of condemnation.\nThe 1907 agreement was further amended on October 26, 1950, July 1, 1957, July 5, 1962 and February 25, 1965.\nPTC argues that the purchase option was void under the rule against perpetuities. As the lower court said: \u201cThe best way to state PTC\u2019s argument is to state its best case.\n\u201cIn Barton v. Thaw, 246 Pa. 848 (1914), plaintiffs were children of Joseph Barton, who had conveyed coal under certain land to Thaw\u2019s predecessors in title, by a deed that provided that \u2018And in case, the said parties of the second part, their heirs or assigns, should at any future time whatsoever desire to purchase any of said land in fee simple, then the said parties of the first part, for themselves, their heirs or assigns, hereby covenant and agree to sell and convey the same to the said parties of the second part, their heirs or assigns, at a price not exceeding one hundred dollars per acre.\u2019 (246 Pa. at 350).\n\u201cThe sale of the coal was admittedly good, but plaintiffs claim, by a bill to remove a cloud upon title, that the option to purchase the surface of the land was void because in violation of the rule against perpetuities. \u2018It [was] conceded by counsel that the case presents for the first time to the courts of Pennsylvania the question whether an option or right to purchase land, unlimited in point of time, violates the rule against perpetuities, and therefore is void. . . .\u2019 (246 Pa. 350-351). The lower court in a careful opinion held that the option did violate the rule, and the Supreme Court affirmed.\n\u201cPTC\u2019s argument is that the Oily\u2019s reserved right of purchase is also an option \u2018unlimited in point of time,\u2019 'and therefore it is also void. It has been seen, above, that indeed the City\u2019s right of purchase is thus unlimited. Is it, however, therefore void?\u201d\nThe historical purpose of the rule against perpetuities was to destroy serious hindrances to the beneficial and prosperous use of property. PTC claims that under Barton v. Thaw, supra, Pennsylvania law recognizes a blanket condemnation of all remote options. That is not so, for Barton stated at 246 Pa. 364 that its result is dependent on the interests of the community at large. In this case, the danger of fettering the free use of property is outweighed by considerations of public concern and welfare.\nFurthermore, the purchase option is not an impress on land but is solely a contract right not within the rule against perpetuities. In Philadelphia v. Philadelphia Transportation Co., 386 Pa. 231, 126 A. 2d 132 (1956), this Court stated that until exercised the option gave the city no right in PTC\u2019s property as such, but merely a contractual right. With regard to exclusively contractual rights, the Eestatement of Property, \u00a7401 provides, \u201cA transaction which is exclusively contractual is not subject to the rule against perpetuities.\u201d This Court took the same view in Caplan v. Pittsburgh, 375 Pa. 268, 100 A. 2d 380 (1953).\nMoreover, even assuming that the purchase option fell within and did violate the common law rule against perpetuities the Estates Act of 1947, Act of April 24, 1947, P.L. 100, 20 P.S. \u00a7301.4 makes that rule inapplicable. Sub-sections 4(a) and (b) provide, \u201cNo interest shall be void as a perpetuity except . . . [u]pon the expiration of the period allowed by the common law rule against perpetuities as measured by actual rather than possible events. . . .\u201d\nWith regard to this matter, the lower court stated: \u201cThus, if an option void at common law actually vests within 21 years, it is valid even though it might not have vested that soon. Or, as Bregy puts the point, at page 5307 of his treatise on the Estates Act: \u2018. . . such agreements will no longer be void from the beginning as in Barton v. Thaw. Under the statute an unlimited option should be allowed to run until the expiration of the permissible period, and stricken down only if it remains unexercised at that time.\u2019 (Footnotes omitted.)\n\u201cIf the City and PTC had made no further agreements after the Agreement of 1939, the Estates Act of 1947 would not be pertinent. However, as was seen in discussing the duration of the City\u2019s reserved right of purchase, the City and PTC made the Agreements of 1957, 1962, and 1965. The importance of this fact appears when one considers Section 21 of the Estates Act, 20 P.S. \u00a7301.21. This provides that the Estates Act . . shall take effect on the first day of January, one thousand nine hundred forty-eight, and [except in respects not here material] shall apply only to conveyances effective on or after that day. As to conveyances effective before that day, the existing laws shall remain in full force and effect.\u2019 \u201d\nSection 1 of the Estates Act defines a conveyance as \u201c. . . an act by which it is intended to create an interest in real or personal property whether the act is intend-i ed to have inter vivos or testamentary operation.\u201d If the 1957 agreement is a conveyance under that definition, the Estates Act of 1947 applies, and the \u201cwait and see\u201d rule was complied with, for the option was in fact exercised within the time limitation of the rule against perpetuities dating from July 1, 1957.\nBased on the premise that the city\u2019s reserved right of purchase expired July 1, 1957, and was extended by agreement to December 31, 1964, PTC further argues that SEPTA\u2019s attempt to exercise the purchase option was ineffective becaus\u00e9 it was not timely and that the option period was not further extended by the 1965 agreement because the latter agreement was never approved by PTC\u2019s shareholders. We agree with the lower court\u2019s conclusion that the premise of those arguments is unsound because under the 1939 agreement the reserved right of purchase remained effective until exercised.\nThe intervening minority shareholders argue that the agreement of 1985 was not intended to extend the reserved right of purchase, but by \u201cfraud, accident or mistake\u201d the 1985 agreement failed to express this limitation. Again, we agree with the court\u2019s evaluation of intervenors\u2019 evidence in this respect to the effect that they were unsuccessful in proving fraud, accident or mistake. Bather, the testimony of their witnesses tended to prove that the city intended to preserve the option to purchase PTC, and not to allow it to expire so that there was no mutual mistake; nor were the representatives of PTC misled by the city invalid because it was made without public auction, during negotiations of the 1965 agreement.\nPTC asserts that the assignment to SEPTA was The lower court carefully analyzed this question in the following manner.\nSection Eleventh of the 1907 agreement, which was carried over into the 1939 agreement, provides that the city may assign its reserved right of purchase and that the company may become a bidder for that right. On June 8, 1965, the city made the assignment to SEPTA, which exercised the right on the same day. No notice of the assignment was given to PTC, nor was a public auction or competitive bidding permitted.\nPTC does not argue that the agreement of 1907 requires public auction because it says \u201cmay be put up at public auction.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Instead, PTC argues that the Home Buie Charter of 1951 requires a public auction. The Home Buie Charter is, however, irrelevant.\nSection 11 of the First Class City Home Buie Act, Act of April 21, 1949, P.L. 665, 53 P.S. \u00a713111 provides that no contract existing at the time of adoption of any home rule charter shall be affected thereby. Since the agreement of 1939 does not require public auction, the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter cannot affect that agreement no matter what its says about public auctions.\nMoreover, public policy does not require assignment by public auction. The reason for requiring competitive bidding is to prevent private business from gaining favors of government or from corrupting government. Here, the assignee is another government agency and the reasons in favor of bidding competitively are absent.\nThe most perplexing problem concerns interpretation of the purchase price formula. Four factors are involved:\n\u201c1) an amount equal to the sum of the face amount, or call price if any, and accrued interest of all then outstanding bonds of, and all then outstanding prior lien bonds, mortgages and ground rents on the property of, Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries....;\n\u201c2) plus the par value of all then outstanding preferred stock of Company. . . .;\n\u201c3) and an amount equal to ten (10) dollars per share for all then outstanding common stock of Company. . . .;\n\u201c4) and the amount of the then undistributed corporate surplus, if any, of Company.\u201d\nThe word \u201cthen\u201d refers with respect to each factor to the particular July 1st named in the notice of intent to exercise the option. SEPTA named July 1, 1966 as the settlement date, and the parties extended this date to January 1, 1967.\nThe first three factors present no problem of interpretation or computation. The amount of the outstanding bonds, mortgages and ground rents can readily be ascertained; there is no outstanding preferred stock because PTC converted its preferred stock to common stock in 1955; and the amount of outstanding common stock can be determined without difficulty. Only the meaning of \u201cundistributed corporate surplus\u201d is at issue.\nPTC and the minority shareholders propose that \u201cundistributed corporate surplus\u201d is the excess of the appraised value of PTC\u2019s assets over the value of its liabilities and capital as of the settlement date. The trial court rejected this argument and held that the fourth factor of the formula was reflected on PTC\u2019s balance sheet figure as \u201cRetained Earnings.\u201d As the court observed: \u201cOne of the great attractions of a purchase price formula is that the buyer can figure out what the price will be before he exercises his option and commits himself to purchase. A valuation proceeding after the option is exercised defeats this purpose.\n\u201cThis is so on general principles. Thus the Supreme Court, in Philadelphia v. Phila. T. Co., 386 Pa. 231, 239 (1956), said of the purchase price formula: 1 . . the price to be paid for the property according to the option is determinable by a fixed formula whereas a condemnation proceeding must depend upon the uncertain decision of a fact-finding tribunal as to the value of the property then being acquired.\u2019 (Footnote omitted.)\n\u201cIn addition, the history of the underliers and PRT, the other provisions of the agreement, and the legislative history of the formula itself, all demonstrate that \u2018undistributed corporate surplus\u2019 is not a valuation but a balance sheet figure.\n\u201cMoreover, the other provisions of the Agreement of 1939 gave the City control over the other factors of the formula. Section First of the Agreement of 1907, which was not amended but continued in effect by the Agreement of 1939, provided that \u2018No further increase of capital stock or funded indebtedness . . . shall be made by the Company . . . without the consent of the City. . . .\u2019 Also, if more bonds were issued by the Company, there would be a corresponding increase of assets, which the City would acquire if it exercised its right to purchase. Still further, the City was entitled to representation on the board of directors (Section Fourth of the Agreement of 1907 and Section 1(a) of the Agreement of 1939), and the City Controller was empowered to examine the Company\u2019s books (Section Fifth of the Agreement of 1907, continued in effect by the Agreement of 1939).\n\u201cThus PTC\u2019s argument comes down to an assertion that of the four factors of the formula, all could be controlled by the City, and could be determined by an examination of the balance sheet, before the City decided whether to exercise its right of purchase, except for one factor \u2014 \u2018undistributed corporate surplus.\u2019 This assertion is almost self-defeating. In any case, the hearings before the Transportation and Public Utilities Committee of City Council in April and May of 1939 demonstrate that both PET (seeking the City\u2019s consent to be reorganized as PTC) and the City understood the formula to be a simple mathematical calculation based on book figures.\n\u201cIn essence, what the hearings demonstrate is that PTC\u2019s present argument as to the meaning of \u2018undistributed surplus\u2019 is based upon a practice precisely contrary to the purpose of the Agreement of 1939. In PTC\u2019s present view the 1939 amendment called for PTC to reap the benefits of any increase in the unrealized value of its assets in the event of a sale to the City under the City\u2019s option. The hearings make it clear that the formula was to do just the opposite: the City was to reap any increase in the unrealized value of PTC\u2019s assets, if, but only if, the City exercised its option and thereby purchased the PTC system as a whole.\u201d\nBy providing for a purchase price formula and by electing to exercise the option to purchase, rather than to proceed by condemnation, SEPTA was assured of being able to determine for itself the price to be paid by an examination of PTC\u2019s balance sheet figures, rather than by a lengthy valuation process which would leave the purchase price determination to a fact-finding body. Clearly, \u201cundistributed corporate surplus\u201d is not a valuation, but a balance sheet figure, as are the other three factors.\n\u201cUndistributed corporate surplus\u201d is a factor which represents earnings accumulated by PTC rather than earnings paid out as dividends. That language assured the shareholders that when the option was exercised, they would receive so much of the accumulated earnings as were not paid to them as dividends. Had the only class of shareholders of PTC in 1939 been common shareholders, the phrase \u201cretained earnings\u201d or \u201cearned surplus\u201d would have accomplished that purpose. However, PTC had preferred shareholders whose dividend rights upon liquidation were, pursuant to the articles of incorporation, cumulative if, in fact, dividends were earned. Thus, it was possible for PTC to have at the end of a given year earned, accumulated, but unpaid dividends on preferred shares of stock in an amount that would exceed the amount of \u201cearned surplus\u201d (or \u201cretained earnings\u201d). On account of this situation, the draftsmen of the 1939 agreement did not use as a price factor a sum equal to PTC\u2019s \u201cthen retained earnings,\u201d because in such a situation had the option been exercised the common shareholders would have received less than ten dollars per share. The draftsmen clearly desired to insure that the common stockholders received ten dollars a share if the city exercised its option and not a lesser sum because of an obligation by PTC in liquidating to pay preferred shareholders earned, accumulated, but unpaid dividends. Accordingly, so long as there were preferred stockholders \u201cundistributed corporate surplus\u201d meant the greater of PTC\u2019s retained earnings or its earned, accumulated, but unpaid dividends as of the settlement date. Since 1955, when PTC converted its preferred stock to common stock, there have been no earned, accumulated, but unpaid dividends. Accordingly, by paying an amount equal to PTC\u2019s retained earnings, the city will achieve the purpose of the formula \u2014 that the common shareholders get back what they risked: so much of the accumulated earnings as were not paid to them in dividends. And this is what \u201cundistributed corporate surplus\u201d means.\nThis means PTC\u2019s retained earnings, because, in the language of the court below: \u201cPTC\u2019s present balance sheet carries two accounts: \u2018Capital Surplus\u2019 and \u2018Retained Earnings.\u2019 As has just been seen, \u2018undistributed corporate surplus\u2019 means a fund available for the payment of. cash dividends. Therefore, it includes only PTC\u2019s \u2018Retained Earnings\u2019 account. It does not include the \u2018Capital Surplus\u2019 account because under Pennsylvania law cash dividends cannot be paid from capital surplus. Branch v. Kaiser, 291 Pa. 543 (1928); Berks Broadcasting Co. v. Craumer, 356 Pa. 620 (1947).\u201d (Footnote omitted.)\nPTC\u2019s retired employees receive pension benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis. PTC has no funded pension plan; pension benefits are paid out of the fare box from current revenues. Actuarial studies reveal that the amounts required to fund past service costs would be approximately $11,939,392 for nonsupervisory retirees and $4,973,304 for supervisory and executive retirees. The parties have stipulated that this $17,000,-000 obligation is a present vested liability. The question presented is whether PTC\u2019s \u201cundistributed corporate surplus\u201d is extinguished by its obligation to its retired employees. SEPTA\u2019s accounting expert testified that minimum standards of accounting principles require that a vested pension liability be carried on the liability side of the balance sheet. PTC did not, in fact, do so because the pension obligation was never funded. Bather, the actuarily determined amount of the obligation was revealed in a footnote to their annual financial reports. SEPTA argues that if this liability were placed on the books, it would eliminate all surplus, because there is no offsetting asset on the books. Consequently, there would be no retained earnings or \u201cundistributed corporate surplus.\u201d Accordingly, contends SEPTA, the purchase price need not include any amount representing PTC\u2019s \u201cundistributed corporate surplus.\u201d\nPTC, on the other hand, presented expert testimony justifying its accounting techniques with respect to its pension liability because as a public utility its rates were fixed by taking into account pay-as-you-go pension payments in the rates for the year of payment. Thus, argues PTC, it does not have a fund available for cash dividends (retained earnings), which is part of the purchase price formula.\nAs the lower court indicated, the accounting testimony is neither necessary nor appropriate to a resolution of this issue. Bather an examination of the agreements is sufficient to dispose of the matter. As the trial court stated: \u201cSection Eleventh of the Agreement of 1907 provided that for a price equal to the par value of PBT\u2019s stock the City or its assignee could acquire \u2018all the property, leaseholds and franchises of the Company, subject to all indebtedness now existing or hereafter lawfully created hereunder upon July 1st, 1957. . . .\u2019 This was changed by the Agreement of 1939, so that the City or its assignee, upon payment of the formula price provided in that Agreement, would acquire \u2018all the property, leaseholds, and franchises of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries upon any first day of July thereafter. . . .\u2019 The clause \u2018subject to all indebtedness . . . [etc.]\u2019 was eliminated. It follows, therefore, that if SEPTA pays the formula price, it acquires PTC\u2019s assets not subject to PTC\u2019s obligations, i.e., that SEPTA after the acquisition will not be subject to PTC\u2019s pension obligation, which is only another way of saying that SEPTA may not refuse to pay the full formula price by charging against it PTC\u2019s pension obligation as though SEPTA would be subject to it.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)\nOn this point, PTC carries the argument further and contends that SEPTA must not only pay for PTC\u2019s retained earnings but also must assume PTC\u2019s pension obligation. We have already decided that SEPTA must, under the formula, pay for PTC\u2019s retained earnings. It is, however, not required under the agreement of 1939 to assume PTC\u2019s pension obligations.\nThe lower court further concluded that SEPTA may not reduce the purchase price by PTC\u2019s cost of financing and organization expenses because the 1939 agreement intended the option price to be a single price for all of PTC\u2019s leases, franchises and assets, and SEPTA must pay the full purchase price. We agree.\nIn addition, the trial court decided that in making payment for \u201caccrued interest of . . . then outstanding . . . mortgages,\u201d SEPTA must pay PTC a sufficient amount to compensate PTC for any prepayment penalties PTC is called upon to pay if PTC retires its mortgage debt before the maturity date. Again, we agree.\nFinally, the court below held that the date when SEPTA must make payment to PTC be extended for a period of not less than six months after final disposition of this case. This is certainly a reasonable extension in view of the fact that SEPTA will not know with certainty the amount it must pay until this case is finally concluded. It must then be allowed sufficient time to raise the money necessary to effect the purchase.\nIn appeals number 188 and 194, the judgment is affirmed. In appeals number 189 and 192, the decree is affirmed.",

        "text": "Concubbing Opinion by\nMb. Justice Musmanno:\nNo commercial enterprise can achieve success without manpower. The financial resources of the Philadelphia Transportation Company could never have been amassed without the work of its maintenance and transportation employees. Now that PTC is to be sold, the pension rights of the men who manned the tramway cars and buses, and kept them in running condition, must not be lost or mislaid in a labyrinth of complicated fiscal proceedings.\nThe lower court properly declared that: \u201cPTC is required to provide for the payment of retired employees\u2019 pensions before it may distribute the money that will be received from SEPTA when SEPTA purchases PTC\u2019s assets.\u201d\nThe Transport Workers Union of America and Transport Workers Union of Philadelphia, Local No. 234 (known as TWU) correctly point out in their brief that their primary concern is that, out of the purchase price paid by SEPTA to PTC, PTC is required to hold back, and not distribute to the PTC shareholders, a sum equal to the liability due and owing the retired employees. This proposition is eminently just and legally unassailable. What the TWU employees have put into their daily toil is as much a part of the PTC assets as bricks are an integral part of the building of which it consists. Every street car and bus is held together by the perspiration of those who toiled to maintain and operate it.\nThus, the moneys due the retired pensioner is a vested liability which PTC may not shed or cast off. This liability cannot be shifted to another track or derailed and certainly not abandoned. I repeat the lower court\u2019s finding, namely, \u201cPTC is required to provide for the payment of retired employees\u2019 pensions before it may distribute the money that will be received from SEPTA when SEPTA purchases PTC\u2019s assets.\u201d\nUnder this language, which is as plain and clear as a street car passing over a trestle bridge, the money due the retired employees must be deducted from the purchase price and held for the employees\u2019 pension fund. Any action which would distribute that fund to anyone other than the PTC pensioners, to whom it belongs, would constitute a contempt of the wording and spirit of decision of the court below. This pension money is in effect a trust fund for the protection of the pensioners and must be respected as such. The pension fund is a bread box for the retired employees. It must be kept safe and secure so that the bread it contains will continue to be fresh and life-sustaining.\nIn addition, it is clear from the record below that, to the extent that that such fund, deducted from the purchase price, should be insufficient to carry out the pension obligation, SEPTA has a liability in the future to pay that pension obligation, if, for any reason whatsoever, PTC might deplete the amount of the purchase price without fully providing for the pension liability to retired employees.\nThere is a reservoir of moneys in the amounts payable to PTC under the SEPTA purchase. The pensions must be drawn from that reservoir. The time to end the long-drawn out litigation in this case is now. The employees should not be required to seek with a broken tin cup for water in the desert of any further legal controversy.\nI affirm, with the majority of the Court, the order of the court below.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMe. Chief Justice Bell :\nI dissent for each of the following reasons:\nThe Option Is Illegal and Void\n1. SEPTA\u2019s claim is based upon the Option which was contained in the 1907 contract between the City of Philadelphia and Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company (now Philadelphia Transportation Company) and which was assigned by the City to SEPTA for no consideration. This Option violates the Rule against Perpetuities and is void!\nIn 1901, the City of Philadelphia entered into an Agreement with the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company. Paragraph Eleventh of this Agreement provided: \u201cThe City reserve [s] the right to purchase all the property, leaseholds and franchises of the Company, subject to all indebtedness . . . upon July 1st, 1951, or upon the first day of any July thereafter by serving six months\u2019 notice . . . [for] an amount equal to par for its capital stock then outstanding, to wit: the thirty million ($30,000,000) dollars of capital stock now authorized plus any additional capital stock issued with the consent of the City hereunder. . . .\u201d\nComplementing this right to purchase, Paragraph First of the Agreement included the provision \u201cnor shall the Company, during said term, part with any of its stocks, leaseholds or franchises without like [City\u2019s] consent.\u201d\nIn 1939, the 1907 Agreement was replaced by a new-Agreement between the City and the Philadelphia Transportation Company. Paragraph Eleventh of the 1907 Agreement was amended. Although many changes were made by the parties, the most pertinent changes were as follows: The City was given the right to purchase the entire transportation system; it changed the time when the City could exercise its right of purchase from \u201cJuly 1st, 1957, or upon the first day of any July thereafter\u201d to \"any first day of July hereafter.\u201d Also, the price that the City was to pay by exercising the right to purchase was changed to a price made up of four factors: (1) the amount of PTC\u2019s outstanding bonds, mortgages and ground rents; (2) the par value of PTC\u2019s outstanding preferred stock (of which presently there is none); (3) $10 for each share of PTC\u2019s outstanding common stock; and (4) \"the amount of .. . [PTC\u2019s] then undistributed corporate surplus, if any.\u201d Furthermore, the City reserved \u201cwhatever right to condemn it now has or shall hereafter have,\u201d a reservation which was not in the Agreement of 1907.\nThis 1907 Agreement, as amended by the 1939 Agreement, was amended or extended by Agreements entered into between the City and the PTC in 1950, 1957, 1962 and 1965, the latter two Agreements specifically stating that the extensions were without prejudice to the claim of the PTC that the 1907 Agreement terminated either on December 31, 1964 or on June 30, 1965. The City was thus given the right or option to purchase all of the properties of the PTC without any time limit specifically imposed on this right, and until such purchase option was exercised, the PTC could not sell or alienate any of its property, stocks, leaseholds or franchises without the City\u2019s consent. Since the City\u2019s interest in the PTC properties would not vest until it exercised its purchase option, which clearly and undoubtedly could be exercised later than the period of 21 years allowed by the Rule against Perpetuities, the Option violates the Rule.\nIn upholding the City\u2019s right to purchase under the Rule against Perpetuities, the majority relies on three grounds. First, the right to purchase is a contractual right to which the Rule does not apply. Second, if the Rule does apply, the extension Agreement of 1957 acted as a \u201cconveyance\u201d to bring it within the Estates Act of 1947 and the so-called \u201cwait and see\u201d rule incorporated therein. Third, the Rule should not operate on the City\u2019s right to purchase for reasons of public policy. I find no merit in any of these contentions.\nAn option is an offer to sell to the optionee or, conversely, a right given to the optionee to buy certain property at or within a stated period of time and for a specified price, and when supported by consideration is a contract. However, the fact that an option gives what amounts in this case to a contractual right does not insulate it from the Rule against Perpetuities.\nThe leading case on this point is Barton v. Thaw, 246 Pa. 348, 92 Atl. 312 (1914). It involved an option and is squarely in point and controlling. That case arose sur a bill in equity to remove a cloud upon title. In 1881, the owners of land conveyed the coal and other minerals underlying the land to grantees. This conveyance contained an option to the grantees, their heirs or assigns \u201cat any future time whatsoever ... to purchase any of said land in fee simple ... at a price not exceeding $100 per acre.\u201d Obviously, there was no time limit within which the option had to be exercised.\nThis Court adopted the lower Court\u2019s learned Opinion in which it traced and reviewed the Rule against Perpetuities from its ancient beginnings and held that it was taken from the common law of England and was part of and imbedded in the common law of our Commonwealth.\nThe Court accurately stated that the Rule against Perpetuities is a restriction against fettering the alienation of property, that under the Rule vesting must take effect within lives in being and 21 years thereafter (including the period of gestation), that the Rule operates as a nullification and destruction of the intention of the parties, and is a peremptory command of law based upon public policy, and that because of the public policy favoring alienability, the Rule must be remorselessly applied. The Court further said (pages 855, 358, 363-4, 365) : \u201c \u2018When lives cannot be taken as a measure, the perpetuity period is twenty-one years/ Goodwin on Real Property, 280. \u2018The period of twenty-one years may be taken in gross, that is, limited simply as a space of time, without reference to any minority, and without being preceded by a life or lives in being.\u2019 Poulke on Rule against Perpetuities, sec. 340. \u2018If an absolute term is taken, and no anterior term for a life in being is referred to, such absolute term cannot be longer than twenty-one years/ Perry on Trusts, 349. \u2018As to the time within which an executory estate or interest must arise, it is evident that some time limit must be fixed, for if an unlimited time were allowed for the creation of these future and indestructible estates the alienation of lands might be henceforward forever prevented by the innumerable future estates which the caprice or vanity of some owners would prompt them to create. A limit has, therefore, been fixed on for the creation of executory interests, and every executory interest which might, under any circumstances, transgress this limit is void altogether. If no lives are fixed on then the term of twenty-one years only is allowed/ Williams on Real Property (6th Am. Ed.), 317. \u2018The rule is that where the testator fails to avail himself of lives in being, and adopts a term of years, without reference to any life in being, the term cannot extend beyond twenty-one years from his death.\u2019 Johnston\u2019s Est., 185 Pa. 179.\n\u201cA privilege to acquire such right [under the option] was given by the Barton deed, but no such right was conveyed thereby. The event upon which the estate is to arise, to wit, the acceptance of the option to purchase, is uncertain, being unconfined as to limit of time. The interest created by this option, therefore, is not vested, but contingent, and is within the rule against perpetuities. In that respect this case differs from one where the owner of land conveys the coal thereunder, with general mining rights and the right to use surface for mining purposes, as in Dewey v. Great Lakes Coal Company, 236 Pa. 498, cited by counsel for the defendants. In a case like that the rights are conveyed by the deed and vest immediately. There a present fixed right of future enjoyment is conveyed, although the right of enjoyment may not be exercised immediately.\n\u201c. . . By its terms the option ... is limited only by the confines of eternity. We cannot conceive of a more violent breach of the rule against perpetuities. . . . And the rule must be rigidly enforced. In Coggins\u2019 App., 124 Pa. 10, Mr. Chief Justice Paxson designates the rule against perpetuities as \u2018a rule of property founded upon the highest considerations of public policy, and too firmly imbedded in our system of jurisprudence to be disturbed save by an act of assembly\n\u201c3. The option or right to purchase in this case constitutes a cloud upon the title of the plaintiffs which they are entitled in equity to have removed by cancellation.\u201d\nThis Court, in its Opinion in Barton v. Thaw, said (page 366) : \u201cThe covenant in question was declared to be void because in violation of the rule against perpetuities. We quite agree with the learned court below that it would be difficult to conceive any case which could be deemed more violative of the rule and a greater hindrance to alienation than the one at bar. The case turns very largely upon the character of the interest in the surface which the optionees took under the covenant. If it was a present, fixed and vested interest in the land the rule against perpetuities would have no application. But is a mere option to purchase land, unlimited as to time and indefinite in duration, which may he exercised in ten years, or in a hundred years, or in a thousand years, or which may never he exercised at all, depending upon the ivish or pleasure of the optionee, a present vested interest? To ash this question would seem to answer it. In no proper legal sense can a mere privilege of exercising a future right to purchase he deemed a present vested interest in land. The optionees may never exercise their option, and failing to do so, they would never acquire a vested interest in the land.\u201d\nBarton v. Thaw has been cited with approval in Mather Estate, 410 Pa. 361, 189 A. 2d 586 (1963); Newlin Estate, 367 Pa. 527, 80 A. 2d 819 (1951); Lockhart\u2019s Estate, 306 Pa. 394, 159 Atl. 874 (1932); Lilley\u2019s Estate, 272 Pa. 143, 116 Atl. 392 (1922); Vilsack v.

Hurst, 284 Pa. 94, 130 Atl. 315 (1925).\nThe Majority has ignored this clear and well settled law of Pennsylvania and relies instead on \u00a7401 of the Restatement of the Law of Property, which states that \u201cA transaction which is exclusively contractual is not subject to the rule against perpetuities.\u201d Of course, this is not controlling but even if it were, an examination of the illustrations and comment under \u00a7401 clearly and without the slightest doubt demonstrates that the section does not apply to the type of contractual right asserted here by SEPTA. The rationale of \u00a7401 is set forth in the comment to that section: \u201ca. Rationale. The rule against perpetuities has as its sole objective the prevention of \u2018inconvenient fetterings of property\u2019 (defined in \u00a7370, comment c). When a transaction is \u2018exclusively contractual\u2019 (defined comment b) it involves no fettering of any property and hence there is no occasion for applying the rule against perpetuities thereto.\u201d\nBut an option does involve the fettering of property and certainly the 1907 Option provision did! As Cor-bin points out in his Treatise on Contracts (Yol. 1A, page 481) : \u201cWhen an owner, by an Option Contract, gives to a promisee an Option to Purchase for a stated period, he has restrained alienation for that period, . . .\u201d That is precisely why this Court held in Barton v. Thaw, 246 Pa., supra, that the Rule against Perpetuities applies to option contracts. The 1907 City-PTC Agreement not only gives the City a right, during an unlimited future, to purchase the franchises and other properties of the PTC, but further prohibits the PTC from \u201cparting with any of its stocks, leaseholds or franchises without [the City\u2019s] consent.\u201d It is difficult to imagine a greater fettering of alienation of property.\nThe restrictive effect of the option in this case is further emphasized by the fact that, as the City and SEPTA claim, the City\u2019s right to purchase could be exercised at any time in the future without limit. Could any statement or contention more clearly demonstrate that this Option unquestionably violates the Rule? Poetically expressed, the Option may be exercised at any time before the stars are old and the sun grows cold and the leaves of the judgment book unfold.\nThe majority Opinion next states that \u201cIf the 1957 agreement is a conveyance under that definition, the Estates Act of 1947 applies, ... for the option was in fact exercised within the time limitation of the rule against perpetuities dating from July 1, 1957.\u201d The Estates Act of 1947 took effect January 1, 191\u00a18 and applies \u201conly to conveyances effective on or after that day. As to conveyances effective before that day, the existing laws shall remain in full force and effect.\u201d\nThe 1957 Agreement does not give the City a new option or right to purchase, nor does it expressly modify the original Option given in 1907. Furthermore, (1) an option has never heretofore been \u201ca conveyance,\u201d and (2) an option does not create a legal or equitable title in property: Synes Appeal, 401 Pa. 387, 394, 164 A. 2d 221 (1960); and (3) an option is not \u201ca conveyance\u201d as defined in the Estates Act of 1947. It is clear that prior to any exercise of the Option by the City under Paragraph Eleventh of the 1907 Agreement, the optionee had no interest, legal or equitable, in or to the property subject to the Option, and a right which is void ab initio cannot be revived by one or even by both of the parties.\nFinally, the Majority states that the Option should be upheld on the grounds of public policy. It disposes of the Rule against Perpetuities in two sentences: \u201c. . . Barton stated at 246 Pa. 364 that its result is dependent on the interests of the community at large. In this case, the danger of fettering the free use of property is out-weighed by considerations of public concern and welfare.\u201d The Majority has mistaken the principle of public policy and has blindly put the shoe on the wrong foot. SEPTA, if ably managed (which, because of its multifarious functions and the varied and complicated problems which are certain to arise, is doubtful of accomplishment) is a desirable objective and a worthwhile public policy, but that does not and cannot legalize the violation of any law or the destruction or abolition of the public policy of the Commonwealth, or the evasion of the many controlling decisions of this Court to the contrary. The Majority cites no authority to support it and obviously proceeds on the recently adopted theory that a worthy objective validates and Constitutionalizes anything and everything, and every case is to be decided on a personal ad hoc basis. This substitutes uncertainty and confusion for certainty, clarity and stability, as well as for long-established and well-settled law, and borders on the ridiculous. I believe, although no one can be sure from the majority Opinion, that the practical result of that Opinion on this point is to judicially exterminate the Rule against Perpetuities, which it now writes off as \u201cgone with the wind.\u201d\nBarton v. Thaw, 246 Pa., supra, makes it crystal clear that there are compelling public policy reasons for not permitting unlimited restraints on alienation of property. Furthermore, the public interest of the City and also of SEPTA is adequately and completely protected by the fact that the City and SEPTA may condemn the entire transportation system if, in the public interest, either so desires.\nIn addition, the Majority conveniently overlooked the fact and the law that neither a Municipality nor an Authority is a Sovereign, and what might apply to a Sovereign does not apply to a Municipality or an Authority. A Municipality, not only in its private or proprietary but even in its governmental capacity, has no vested rights in its functions or powers and is Constitutionally subject to change, repeal or total abolition at the will of the Legislature. In Lighton v. Abington Twp., 336 Pa. 345, 9 A. 2d 609, the Court, in an Opinion by Justice Linn, said (pp. 352, 353) : \u201cIn Commonwealth v. Moir, 199 Pa. 534, at p. 541, 49 A. 351, Mitchell, J., said: \u2018Municipal corporations are agents of the state, invested with certain subordinate governmental functions for reasons of convenience and public policy. They are created, governed, and the extent of their powers determined by the legislature, and subject to change, repeal, or total abolition at its will. They have no vested rights in their offices, their charters, their corporate powers, or even their corporate existence. This is the universal rule of constitutional law, and in no state has it been more clearly expressed and more uniformly applied than in Pennsylvania.\u2019 See also Shirk v. Lancaster, 313 Pa. 158, 162, 169 A. 557.\u201d Accord: Cleaver v. Board of Adjustment, 414 Pa. 367, 200 A. 2d 408; Schultz v.

Fox, 64 Pa. 169, 180-181.\nIt is equally true that in its private or proprietary capacity a municipality is subject to the same duties and obligations as is a private corporation. Said the Court in Commonwealth v. PRT, 287 Pa. 70, 134 Atl. 452, at page 76: \u201cOur cases are numerous in which it has been held that, where the municipality is not engaged in public business, it acts as do others likewise engaged, and is subject to the same duties and obligations as to its contracts and the responsibility for the acts of those employed by it: [citing cases].\u201d In that particular case, the Court held that the City was engaged in its private or proprietary capacity, and not in its public or governmental capacity, in the operation of transit facilities leased to PET.\nDeclaratory Judgment Proceedings\n2. A declaratory judgment proceeding is not a proper remedy and cannot be granted in this case because both the majority of this Court and the Court below reform the Option and grant SEPTA, contrary to the clear and express terms of the Option, the right to make payment and settlement within a period of not less than six months after the final disposition of this case, in lieu of the time period expressly and specifically required by the Option: Baskind v. National Surety Corp., 376 Pa. 13, 16, 101 A. 2d 645. Cf. also McWilliams v. McCabe, 406 Pa. 644, 657-8, 179 A. 2d 222.\nThe proper remedy in this case, assuming that the City and SEPTA wish to exercise whatever rights either possesses, would be (a) a bill in equity for specific performance, which could include an extension of the time for settlement, or (b) condemnation by eminent domain.\nFor the aforesaid reasons, I would reverse the judgment and the Order of the lower Court and dismiss the petition for a declaratory judgment.\nAssuming arguendo that SEPTA has the legal right to exercise the City\u2019s aforesaid options, and that a Declaratory Judgment proceeding will lie, I would construe the City\u2019s Option formula as follows:\nFirst: SEPTA must assume the unfunded pension obligations of PTC. This subject was not covered in the Option or in any other part of the Agreements and was never within the contemplation of the parties. Section 24 of the Act of August 14, 1963, P. L. 984, as amended,. 66 P.S. \u00a72024, requires that SEPTA \u201cshall recognize and be bound by existing labor union agreements where they exist between labor unions and transportation companies that are acquired, purchased, condemned or leased by the board.\u201d Moreover, these unfunded pension obligations have always been treated by PTC with the approval of the City and of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission as a current operating expense when actually paid. It is therefore fair, equitable and just that PTC\u2019s pension obligations be assumed by SEPTA. Cf. Pittsburgh v. Pa. P.U.C., 370 Pa. 305, 88 A. 2d 59; Re Uniform System of Accounts for Electric Corporations, 82 P.U.R. (NS) 161.\nFurthermore, there is a stronger and even more compelling reason why SEPTA must assume the pension obligations. The City\u2019s Option provides in the clearest language that the City must pay the PUT stockholders (for all the Company\u2019s property, lock, stock and barrel) \u201can amount equal to ten (10) dollars per share for all then outstanding common stock of Company, and the amount of the then undistributed corporate surplus, if any, of Company.\u201d The Option makes it mandatory to pay the stockholders (an amount equal to) $10 a share \u2014 not $10 conditionally or subject to any deductions whatsoever \u2014 and in addition thereto the amount of said surplus, if any. If no undistributed corporate surplus exists or if the liabilities exceed the assets, the City under said Option must pay $10 per share, which, in no event, can be reduced by pensions or by any other liabilities real or assumed, vested or contingent. The Majority\u2019s interpretation, which would greatly reduce or completely eliminate said $10 per share, completely ignores and violates this clear provision of the Option and radically alters the terms of the City\u2019s Option.\nFor these reasons, as well as for the reasons so ably set forth in Justice Roberts\u2019 Opinion, I specifically dissent to this part of the majority Opinion.\nSecond: Item(4) (d) of the purchase price formula (as used in this Option), namely, \u201cand the amount of the then undistributed corporate surplus, if any, of Company [PTC]\u201d is difficult to interpret. There is no designation of surplus on the books of PTC under the heading \u201cundistributed corporate surplus\u201d or \u201ccorporate surplus,\u201d or merely \u201csurplus.\u201d The headings nearest thereto are carried on its books as \u201ccapital surplus\u201d and \u201cretained earnings.\u201d The meaning of \u201ccorporate surplus\u201d is at times indefinite and uncertain and is dependent on the particular agreement or particular Act (as the case may be). However, I agree with the Opinion of the Majority to the extent that the prima facie intent and the general rule means \u201cthe corporate surplus shown on the balance sheet of the Company.\u201d\nIn Branch v. Kaiser, 291 Pa. 543, 549, 140 Atl. 498, 500 (1928), this Court followed and adopted the following general rule which was thus stated in Edwards v. Douglas, 269 U. S. 204, 214: \u201c. . . The word \u2018surplus\u2019 is a term commonly employed in corporate finance and accounting to designate an account on corporate books. . . . The surplus account represents the net assets of a corporation in excess of all liabilities including its capital stock. This surplus may be \u2018paid-in surplus,\u2019 as where the stock is issued at a price above par. It may be \u2018earned surplus\u2019, as where it was derived wholly from undistributed profits. Or it may, among other things, represent the increase in valuation of land or other assets made upon a revaluation of the company\u2019s fixed property. . . .\u201d\nMoreover, it is a matter of common knowledge that a corporation changes from time to time the carried or book value of its corporate or capital surplus, and the methods or factors for determining the same, and further that the Federal Government or the State Government has at times employed a different formula for the ascertainment thereof. Consequently, I believe that \u201cundistributed corporate surplus\u201d means prima facie \u201cbook value,\u201d but that the various assets of the Company may be revalued and their actual value established by relevant and convincing evidence.\nI believe and would hold that the \u201cundistributed corporate surplus\u201d means (a) PTC\u2019s retained earnings, and (b) its capital surplus as shown on the books of the Company at the date of settlement, or its actual capital surplus on that date as proved by a revaluation thereof.\nItalics throughout, ours.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts:\nThe majority opinion, as it frankly states, is merely a highlighting of the opinion of the court below; indeed the majority seems to adopt that opinion in toto. Of necessity, therefore, my disagreement must be with the source of this Court\u2019s opinion.\n1. Perhaps the most inequitable aspect of the Court\u2019s disposition is its saddling PTC with the obligation of paying future pension rights due its retired employees, thereby depriving PTC\u2019s stockholders of approximately $17,000,000. As a result the amount they will actually receive for their stock will be considerably less than the $10 per share envisioned by the 1939 formula. Indeed the amount required to meet the pension fund obligation is practically equal to the amount received in exchange for PTC\u2019s stock. Thus the effect of the disposition on this aspect is to wipe out entirely Item 3 of the option formula.\nYet in choosing to exercise its option, SEPTA is obligated to take over PTC as an operating transportation system in its entirety. Logically this ought to include PTG\u2019s pension obligation. \u201cPensions are wages and constitute a present benefit, and therefore upon the establishment of a pension plan, whether based on past or future services, or both, the entire charge becomes an operating expense not an income deduction or a charge to surplus.\u201d Re Uniform System of Accounts for Electric Corporations, 82 P.U.R. (NS) 161 (N.Y. 1950). In Pittsburgh v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Comm\u2019n, 370 Pa. 305, 88 A. 2d 59 (1952), this Court held that the burden of pension payments, including those attributable to past services, should be assumed by present and future ratepayers, rather than the stockholders. The following paragraphs from the Court\u2019s opinion seem to me to be equally applicable to the present case: \u201cThe Superior Court and the City of Pittsburgh rely upon the argument that a decision allowing the \u2018freezing payment\u2019 places a burden on present and future ratepayers which should have been borne by those in the past. It is obvious, as the City argues and the Superior Court stated, that as a result of the Commission\u2019s decision present and future ratepayers must pay that portion of the cost of pensions which is more properly attributable to past services. But the criterion for determining whether present and future ratepayers or the investors in Bell should bear this portion of the cost is not ivhether past ratepayers should have paid it. If it were, it was illogical for the Superior Court to permit the Company to allow that portion of the pension costs attributable to services rendered between 1933 and 1927 since such costs should have been placed upon ratepayers between those years. Furthermore, even the ratepayers in 1913, by that test, should not have borne the amount which was paid out in pensions on a pay-as-you-go basis and which was attributable to services rendered before 1913.\n\u201cReduced to its simplest terms, the situation is this. Pensions are noio recognised as a proper operating expense. It is fundamental that in order to afford an adequate retirement program any pension plan must take into consideration past services of employes: Osborne et al. v. United Gas Improvement Co. et al., 354 Pa. 57, 63, 64, 46 A. 2d 208. Someone must pay for the pension costs properly attirbutable to past services. At the present time such costs can be placed upon present and future ratepayers or the investors in the Company. In the present situation the test for determining where the burden should be placed as between these two classes of individuals is whether management abused its discretion in 1927 by not placing the full cost on the ratepayers from that time on. If they did, the investors for whom they acted should bear the cost. If they did not, there is no valid legal objection to placing the burden on present and future ratepayers. Since we have already demonstrated it cannot properly be held that management abused its discretion in 1927, the costs of pensions including the freezing payment were correctly included by the Commission as an operating expense.\n\u201cThe view which we take of this phase of the case is supported by ample authority. On the other hand, the contention of the City of Pittsburgh that these pension costs should be borne by the Bell stockholders is not supported by a decision of any court of last resort. . . .\u201d 370 Pa. at 320-21, 88 A. 2d at 66-67. (Emphasis supplied and footnote omitted.)\nPTC has always followed the normal procedure of treating its pension obligations as part of its current operating expense. Accordingly these obligations have been reflected in its current rate structure. For over twenty-five years this has been done with express knowledge and approval of the City of Philadelphia, SEPTA\u2019s assignor, who during this entire period was represented on PTC\u2019s Board of Management. Moreover, PTC\u2019s handling of its pension obligation had the approval of the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission. It seems to me, therefore, to be totally irrelevant to the issue before us for SEPTA to suggest that if it had been in control of PTC\u2019s management, it would have made different arrangements in order to meet its pension obligation. Had SEPTA chosen to acquire PTC by means of condemnation, the price SEPTA would have paid would have included the value of PTC\u2019s past pension obligations. Metropolitan Transportation Authorities Act of 1963, P. L. 984, \u00a78, 66 P.S. \u00a72008(f) (24) (1) (iii). In exercising the option SEPTA is purchasing PTC \u201clock, stock, and barrel,\u201d and is obligated to purchase it as it is \u2014 -not as it might have been.\nIn addition, SEPTA\u2019s failure to assume PTC\u2019s pension obligation is in conflict with the legislative intention set forth in the statute creating SEPTA, Metropolitan Transportation Authorities Act of 1963, P. L. 984, 66 P.S. \u00a72001 et seq. Section 24, 66 P.S. \u00a72024 provides that SEPTA \u201cshall recognize and be bound by existing labor union agreements where they exist between labor unions and transportation companies that are acquired, purchased, condemned or leased.\u201d It is evident that the legislature was thus concerned with the welfare of the transportation companies\u2019 employees. The existing union agreement specifically provides that retired employees shall \u201ccontinue to receive benefits in accordance with the provisions of the contracts which were in effect at the times of their respective retirements on pension.\u201d Yet, as the amicus brief points out, SEPTA can hardly be bound by this provision of the union contract, which it assumes on the settlement date, and at the same time insist that retired employees look not to it, bnt to PTC, for their benefits.\nThus I believe the Court\u2019s treatment of the $17,-000,000 pension obligation is doubly burdensome. First, it retroactively compels PTC to utilize past earnings in order to pay for future obligations. This is not only contrary to the manner which PTC, with the express approval of the City and the P.U.C., has in the past treated said obligations, but also contrary to the intent of the 1939 agreement itself. Secondly, since these pension obligations have always been met on a pay-as-you-go basis, it contravenes the legislative intention by unnecessarily depriving retired employees of the security of the fare-box.\n2. Under the 1939 agreement, the purchase price of PTC\u2019s entire operations is to be determined in accordance with a four factor formula contained therein. The only dispute concerning this formula is the meaning of the term \u201cundistributed corporate surplus.\u201d I am unable to agree with either SEPTA\u2019S definition, adopted by the Court, that undistributed corporate surplus means only the balance sheet figure described as retained earnings, or PTC\u2019s definition that the term means the excess of the fair valuation of all the assets over the liabilities plus capital stock, thus requiring all the assets to be valued prior to their inclusion in the formula.\nPTC derives its position from the classic definition of corporate surplus in Edwards v. Douglas, 269 U.S. 204, 46 S. Ct. 85 (1925), and approved by this Court in Branch v. Kaiser, 291 Pa. 543, 549, 140 Atl. 498, 500 (1928) : \u201cThe word \u2018surplus\u2019 is a term commonly employed in corporate finance and accounting to designate an account on corporate books. But this is not true of the words \u2018undivided profits.\u2019 The surplus account represents the net assets of a corporation in excess o'f all liabilities including its capital stock. This surplus may be \u2018paid-in surplus,\u2019 as where the stock is issued at a price above par. It may be \u2018earned surplus\u2019, as where it urns derived wholly from undistributed profits. Or it may, among other things, represent the increase in valuation of land or other assets made upon a revaluation of the company\u2019s fixed property.\u201d 269 U.S. at 214, 46 S. Ct. at 88.\nWhile I have no quarrel with this definition, I believe that it is inapplicable in the present case because the entire purpose of the 1939 agreement was to establish a fixed formula which would permit the buyer to know the price he would have to pay at the time he exercised his option. Philadelphia v. Philadelphia Transp. Co., 386 Pa. 231, 239, 126 A. 2d 132, 135-36 (1956). A valuation proceeding after the option is exercised, as PTC urges, would defeat this purpose; lienee I agree with the court below that \u201cundistributed corporate surplus\u201d is not a valuation but a balance sheet figure.\nOn the other hand, the conclusion that undistributed corporate surplus is limited to the retained earnings of PTC is a non sequitur. In my view, which incidentally is supported by the opinion of the court below, the purpose of the formula price was not only to permit the optionee to purchase the company at a known price but also to insure PTC\u2019s stockholders that in the event the option was exercised their equity in the corporation as the same appeared on the company\u2019s books would at least be returned to them. On its books, PTC has divided its stockholders\u2019 equity into three categories: (1) capital stock, for which the formula compensates the stockholders by requiring the purchaser to pay $10 per share for each outstanding share of stock; (2) retained earnings, for which, under the opinion of the court below, the stockholders are compensated for by its inclusion in the term \u201cundistributed corporate surplus\u201d; (3) capital surplus, for which under the Court\u2019s determination the stockholders receive no compensation.\nI can see no justification for giving SEPTA the capital surplus as a windfall. This account is not a recently created entry but has had the unchallenged acceptance and approval of both the City and the P. U. C. for more than a quarter of a century. Every advantage of a known certainty which is true about the retained earnings balance sheet figure is equally true about the capital surplus account. As the court below observed: \u201cThere was no fraud or deceit \u2014 either alleged or proved \u2014 in the way PTC kept its books. The essence of the formula price, as had been seen, is that it is a book price. SEPTA is therefore bound to accept PTC\u2019s books in computing the formula price.\u201d\nAccordingly, I would hold that the term \u201cundistributed corporate surplus\u201d as used in the 1939 formula means PTC\u2019s retained earnings and capital surplus as reflected on its balance sheet at date of settlement.\n3. Additionally, I am disturbed by the uncertainty generated by the Court\u2019s treatment of PTC\u2019s current cash and liabilities. All agree that under the agreement SEPTA will purchase PTC\u2019s cash as well as its other assets, and that PTC is liable for the excess of its current liabilities over and above its current cash. However, there is considerable uncertainty as to what the Court\u2019s disposition is with regard to PTC\u2019s current cash and liabilities. As I read the opinion of the court below, on the one hand, it permits PTC to pay its current liabilities before settlement date, thereby reducing the amount of cash transferable to SEPTA. Presumably, PTC could liquidate all its cash by satisfying as much of its current liabilities as the cash would cover. It is also possible for SEPTA and PTC to make an arrangement so that SEPTA will assume the current liabilities to the extent of PTO\u2019s current cash account thus not necessitating PTC to dispose of its cash in a desperate effort to meet a settlement deadline. On the other hand, the court states that if for any reason no such agreement is made PTC remains responsible for any liabilities existing on settlement date even though in its cash account there is an amount which could theoretically be utilized to reduce current liabilities.\nIn my view this confusion, which is not necessary and could produce a most inequitable result, should, especially in view of the intensity of this litigation, be clarified. Under the Court\u2019s decree SEPTA has six months in which to raise the money to purchase PTC. Under these circumstances PTC might not know until settlement date whether or not SEPTA will actually secure the necessary funds to assume control of its operations, and it may be impossible for PTC to settle its current liabilities on such short notice. On the other hand, if SEPTA fails to purchase the company, PTC may find itself with an inadequate cash position with which to properly operate the transportation system. I see no problem in making it crystal clear that the current cash is to be applied to the payment of current liabilities. On the settlement date SEPTA should only receive that portion of current cash which is in excess of PTO\u2019s current liabilities, unless there is an agreement that SEPTA will assume an amount of current liabilities equal to the amount of current cash it obtains.\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien joins in this dissenting opinion.",
