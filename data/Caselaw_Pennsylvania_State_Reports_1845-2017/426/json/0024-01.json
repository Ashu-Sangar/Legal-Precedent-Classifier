        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Musmanno,\nAfter pleading not guilty to a charge of murder, Henry Corbin was tried by a jury which, on February 1, 1966, found him guilty of murder in the second degree. Corbin\u2019s defense was that he had shot James Crockett in self-defense when Crockett entered his apartment. Following the jury\u2019s verdict, Corbin moved for a new trial. The motion was denied and the defendant appealed.\nCorbin has charged various trial errors, none of which, after study, we find to bear merit.\nCorbin claims the court was in error in refusing to allow his counsel to ask prospective jurors the question, \u201cHave you ever served on a murder jury before?\u201d. The mere fact that a juror has served on a previous murder jury does not in and of itself present a cause for which the juror may be disqualified. As has often been stated, the purpose of a voir dire examination is to effectuate the selection of a competent, fair, impartial and unprejudiced jury. (Commonwealth v. McGrew, 375 Pa. 518.) Thus, the questioning is to be confined to disclosing qualifications or lack of qualifications of a juror and, particularly, whether a juror has formed a fixed opinion or may be otherwise subject to disqualification for cause. The inquiry as to previous jury service in a murder case would not, per se, reveal competence or lack of it in the juror. If the defense feared that a particular juror entertained a fixed opinion in murder cases, such bias could be ascertained through other relevant questioning. It is also to be noted that, as pointed out in the McGrew case, supra, the questioning in the voir dire examination remains within the scope of the trial judge\u2019s discretion. We do not find any abuse of discretion for the reason here discussed.\nCorbin also charges that the court erred, because, in its charge, the court said: \u201cThe consequences are not yours, but follow the crime and not the findings.\u201d The defendant has here taken one sentence out of context. The court\u2019s full statement on this phase of instruction reads: \"... You have sworn to make a true deliverance between the Commonwealth and the Defendant, and to render a verdict in accordance with the evidence. You must not swerve from the duty because of the consequences of your findings. The consequences are not yours, but follow the crime and not the findings. You should then dismiss from your mind the fear of the consequences of your findings, except so far as their import should make you cautious, deliberate and just in considering the evidence, and clear and satisfied in the judgment you form upon it. If, through fear, pity, indignation or passion you suffer your mind to be drawn from a true and just verdict, you commit error.\u201d This statement is in accordance with established law and procedure.\nThen the defendant maintains that the court committed prejudicial error, because in its charge, it referred to the victim of the homicide, James Crockett, on at least 15 occasions as either \u201cJames Corbet\u201d or as \u201cCorbet\u201d, and on at least two occasions it called the defendant, Henry Thomas Corbin, \u201cJames Corbin\u201d. Defendant fears that this misnaming (if such it can be termed) confused the jury. There is not the slightest indication that the jury was remotely confused as to the identity of the parties.\nFinally, the defendant contends the verdict of guilty was contrary to the weight of the evidence and the law. It was the defendant\u2019s position that he shot the victim, James Crockett, when the latter forced himself into his apartment, because he, Corbin, feared for his life. As this court stated in Commonwealth v. Wilkes, 414 Pa. 246, self-defense is an affirmative defense, and the person who asserts such a defense must prove it by a preponderance of the evidence. When such evidence is presented, it is still for the jury to determine if it is to be accepted, even though, it might be uncontradicted. Thus, whether or not, under all of the testimony, Corbin was justified in taking Crockett\u2019s life was strictly a jury question. Reviewing the record we find no reason for reversing the jury\u2019s verdict or the action of the court below in refusing a new trial.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Roberts concurs in the result.\nMr. Justice Jones and Mr. Justice Cohen took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.",
