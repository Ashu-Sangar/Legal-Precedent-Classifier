        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nOn this appeal, American Cyanamid Company, [Cyanamid], challenges the validity of an order of the Court of Common Pleas No. 4 of Philadelphia County which upheld the propriety of an assessment of taxes by the School District of Philadelphia, [School District]. These taxes were assessed and levied under the so-called \u201cGeneral Business Tax\u201d statute for the \u2022benefit of the School District for the years 1960 to 1963 inclusive.\nCyanamid, a Maine corporation, engaged in the manufacture and marketing of chemicals, pharmaceutical and related products, maintains its principal office in Wayne, New Jersey. Prior to July 28, 1958, Cyanamid did maintain a branch office and. warehouse in Philadelphia but since that date it has had no office,. warehouse or other facility in Philadelphia. During the tax years in question, Cyanamid had no manufacturing plant in Philadelphia; of its 53 manufacturing plants in the United States, Cyanamid, originally, had three, and, later, two \u2014 in Latrobe and New Castle \u2014 manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania.\nIn July, 1958, Cyanamid opened a branch office in Fort Washington, Montgomery County. The major function of the Fort Washington office is the processing of orders received from customers, either by mail or telephone. If a customer orders a product which is warehoused at Fort Washington, the product is shipped to the customer by mail or common carrier and payment therefor is made by the customer either to Fort Washington or to Wayne, New Jersey. If the product ordered is not warehoused in Fort Washington, the Fort Washington office requests the location where the product is warehoused to make the shipment and to bill the customer and no payment therefor is received at Fort Washington.\nInsofar as presently pertinent, Cyanamid maintains two bank accounts at Girard Trust Company in Fort Washington and has no account or accounts in any bank in Philadelphia. Adjustments of customers\u2019 complaints, collections of delinquent accounts and the selection of common carriers are all handled by Cyanamid\u2019s facilities and personnel located outside Philadelphia. The Fort Washington office has a Philadelphia telephone number and is listed in the Philadelphia telephone directory for the purpose of rendering available emergency services to hospitals, etc. in connection with its pharmaceutical products. Prices for products, terms of sales, freight allowances, etc. are arranged only at the home offices of Cyanamid\u2019s nine operating divisions none of which offices are located in Philadelphia. Customers\u2019 orders are accepted or rejected only at such home offices.\nA review of the record indicates the following contacts between Cyanamid and Philadelphia: (1) twelve of Cyanamid\u2019s forty-one medical representatives\u2014 whose function is to encourage and promote the use of pharmaceuticals manufactured by Cyanamid \u2014 have assignments which include geographical areas within Philadelphia and these twelve medical representatives spend approximately 5% of their time calling at hospitals and talking to medical staff members and the balance of their time is spent calling upon pharmacists; while such representatives do receive complaints and inquiries, since pharmaceuticals are available to consumers only upon doctors\u2019 prescriptions, such representatives cannot and do not \u201csolicit orders\u201d; (2) four men attached to Cyanamid\u2019s \u201cPlastics and Resins\u201d division, who are located at the Fort Washington office, spend some time in Philadelphia; it is the function of these technically trained men to promote Cyanamid\u2019s plastics and resins among the customers of Cyanamid\u2019s customers but such men are without authority to take or accept orders for such products; (3) one man attached to the Fort Washington office, who works in the \u201cDyes Department of Organic Chemicals\u201d division, visits paper mills only to dispense technical information but does no work in Philadelphia; (4) two men from the Fort Washington office and attached to Cyanamid\u2019s \u201cPigments\u201d division spend approximately 20% of their time in Philadelphia visiting manufacturers to demonstrate the quality and acceptability of Cyanamid\u2019s chemical pigments; (5) two men from the Fort Washington office, attached to the \u201cChemicals\u201d division, call on various plants to promote the chemical products; one of such men spends about 2% of his time and the other less than 1/10 of 1% of his time in Philadelphia; (6) two men from the Fort Washington office and attached to the \u201cAgricultural\u201d division,\u2014 which manufactures and markets animal health products \u2014 , visits distributors to check upon the sale of products by such distributors to customers and they spend less than 1% of their time in Philadelphia; (7) of Cyanamid\u2019s other five operating divisions none have any personnel stationed in Pennsylvania, although some of the products of such five divisions are ordered by Philadelphia customers and the orders are filled from warehouses located in Pennsylvania but outside Philadelphia; (8) Cyanamid has customers in Philadelphia who order and receive shipment of its products by mail or common carrier, Cyanamid paying the freight and the postage; (9) Cyanamid lists its Fort Washington telephone number in the Philadelphia telephone directory; (10) trade journals, which include advertisements of Cyanamid\u2019s products, circulate in Philadelphia.\nThe School District contends that the regularity and continuity of sales by Cyanamid of its various products to customers located in Philadelphia constitutes \u201cbusiness\u201d and \u201ccommercial activity\u201d within the school district\u2019s territorial limits and that the receipts from such sales are subject to the general business fax. With this contention we do not agree. The tax theory of the School District is well expressed by Cyanamid\u2019s counsel: \u201c[The School District] place the emphasis on who is in the school district, rather than what has gone on within the school district.\u201d\nThe statute which levies the general business tax must be strictly construed; if there exists any reasonable doubt as to its application and construction, such doubt must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer and against the taxing unit. See: Commonwealth v. Rieck Investment Corporation, 419 Pa. 52, 59, 213 A. 2d 277 (1965); Commonwealth v. Willson Products, Inc., 412 Pa. 78, 83, 84, 194 A. 2d 162 (1963).\nIn Alan Wood, Steel Company v. Phila. School District, 425 Pa. 455, 229 A. 2d 881 (1967), we recently construed the \u201cGeneral Business Tax\u201d statute: \u201cThe general business tax ... is imposed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the School District of Philadelphia. This tax is levied upon \u2018carrying on . . . within a school district. . . any trade [or] business . . . or making sales to persons within such school district\u2019 and is measured by receipts \u2018received in or allocable to a school district ... by reason of any sale made\u2019 in the school district. \u2018Business\u2019 is defined as: \u2018Carrying on or exercising for gain or profit within a school district of the first class, any trade, business, including financial business as hereinafter defined, profession, vocation, or commercial activity, or making sales to persons within such school district\u2019. (Section 1, 24 P.S. \u00a7584.1). \u2018Receipts\u2019 are defined as: \u2018Cash, credits, property of any kind or nature, received in or allocable to a school district of the first class from any business or by reason of any sale made ... or services rendered or commercial or business transaction had within a school district of the first class\u2019. (Section 1, 24 P.S. \u00a7584.1). ... The Act of 1949, supra, authorizes a school district of the first class to levy and collect an annual tax, in addition to any other school tax, for general public school purposes. Such annual tax is authorized to be levied on every \u2018person [including a corporation] engaging in any business in any school district of the first class\u2019 and the tax is measured by the annual receipts realized from the business. Section 1 clearly defines what the legislature meant both by \u2018business\u2019 and \u2018receipts\u2019 from business. To come within the legislative language the activity considered to be \u2018business\u2019 must (a) be carried on or exercised within the school district\u2019s territorial limits and (b) include any trade, business, profession, vocation or commercial activity or making sales to persons within the district. The legislature has defined \u2018business\u2019 in broad and comprehensive language. \u2018Receipts\u2019 includes \u2018cash, credits, property of any kind or nature\u2019 if received in or allocable to the school district: the source of such receipts may be any business, sales made, services rendered or commercial business transactions if the situs of such activity was within the school district.\u201d (pp. 459-80, 462-63) In Alan Wood, we further said (pp. 464-66) : \u201cAn analysis of the statute indicates that liability for the general business tax attaches only if the taxpayer is carrying on or engaging in business or a commercial activity within the school district. First, what constitutes carrying on or engaging in business or a commercial activity? The landmark decision in this area of law is Shambe v. Delaware & Hudson R.R. Co., 288 Pa. 240, 135 A. 755 (1927) which enunciated the so-called \u2018solicitation plus\u2019 doctrine and held that the presence of an office in Philadelphia plus the solicitation of freight business by employees working out of such office did not constitute \u2018doing business\u2019 in Philadelphia. In Lutz v. Foster & Kester Co., Inc., 367 Pa. 125, 129-130, 79 A. 2d 222 (1951), we reaffirmed the Shambe doctrine and stated: \u2018There must be \u201cother activities\u201d in addition to the solicitation of business to make a foreign corporation\u2019s conduct the doing of business. . . . Such \u201cother activities\u201d do not consist of acts of courtesy performed by business solicitors, without complusion, in order to satisfy or accommodate customers. Nor do they reside in the number of solicitors employed or the character and extent of the facilities provided them for carrying on their solicitations such as office space and office equipment of desks, typewriters, filing equipment and telephones, or in the identification of the company or its representatives emblazoned on the office door or printed in the telephone directory. The criterion is, rather, whether the local solicitors have authority to bind the foreign corporation by which they are employed. . . . The orders obtained by the defendant\u2019s solicitors were not binding on the company until they were received and accepted by it at its home office in Bridgeport, Connecticut.\u2019\n\u201c. . . A review of the applicable case law would indicate that the \u2018carrying on or engaging in business\u2019 set forth in the statutory law contemplates activities which involve more than a mere presence of an office and a solicitation therefrom of business or courtesy calls on customers. \u2018Doing business\u2019 requires proof that the taxpayer was actually effecting sales of its products and performing acts regularly and continuously which, in a direct as opposed to an incidental manner, effects the taxpayer\u2019s corporate objects (Shambe, supra, p. 247).\u201d\nIn view of the factual situation presented upon this record, considered in the light of the statutory provisions, we conclude that Cyanamid\u2019s activities within the taxing district did not rise in the taxable years to the statutory level requisite for the imposition of this general business tax. The School District maintains that Cyanamid is taxable because it \u201chas its registered address in Philadelphia, has some of its sales representatives living in Philadelphia, has a Philadelphia telephone number listed in the Philadelphia telephone directories and has many sales representatives carrying on vigorous sales campaigns among physicians, hospitals, and merchants in Philadelphia on a regular, continuous and systematic basis, and in fact sells substantial quantities of its merchandise to its customers in Philadelphia.\u201d Onr examination of the present record indicates that many of the so-called \u201cfacts\u201d upon which the School District relies are either nonexistent of record or highly exaggerated.\nEven if we were to assume that the factual matrix upon which the School District relies finds support in this record, the School District still has failed to establish the liability for the general business tax of Cyanamid under both the statutory provisions and our case law. It requires no citation of authority to refute the School District\u2019s argument that simply because some of Cyanamid\u2019s personnel maintained their individual residences in Philadelphia that such fact would render Cyanamid liable for this tax. Nor is the fact that Cyanamid\u2019s Fort Washington office is listed in the Philadelphia telephone directory significant. See: Lutz v. Foster & Kester Co., Inc., 367 Pa. 125, 129, 79 A. 2d 222 (1951). That Cyanamid has personnel who promote, even on a \u201cregular, continuous and systematic basis\u201d, its products in Philadelphia simply amounts to \u201csolicitation\u201d which is not sufficient to equate engagement in business or commercial activity requisite under the statute for the imposition of the tax. See: Shambe, supra, p. 244; New v. Robinson-Houchin Optical Company, 357 Pa. 47, 49, 53 A. 2d 79 (1947); Lutz, supra, p. 129; Motch & Merryweather Machinery Co. v. Pittsburgh School District, 381 Pa. 619, 116 A. 2d 733 (1955). Moreover, the fact that Philadelphia customers order and purchase Cyanamid\u2019s products in substantial quantities does not in itself satisfy the statutory requirement. The School District\u2019s so-called \u201cfacts\u201d, standing alone or viewed in their entirety, do not render Cyanamid liable for this tax.\nThe instant situation is not unlike that presented in Alan Wood, supra. Cyanamid maintains no facility or office of any kind in the School District area. Its personnel calling upon Philadelphia customers, actual or potential, lack any authority whatsoever to effect sales. There is no proof of record that any sales of Cyanamid\u2019s products are made in Philadelphia and, on the con-, trary, the record indicates that all sales are effected outside Philadelphia. All that this record portrays is that Philadelphia customers order and use Cyanamid\u2019s products and that some of Cyanamid\u2019s personnel promote the sales of Cyanamid\u2019s products within the School District area. In such a factual situation, the School District has failed to prove such engagement in business or commercial activity within the statutory language as to make receipts from sales to Philadelphia customers subject to the general business tax.\nOrder reversed.\nMr. Justice Cohen took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nAet of Hay 23, 1949, P. L. 1669, as amended, 24 P.S. \u00a7584.1 et seq.\nThe City of Philadelphia, which- assessed and levied mercantile license taxes against Cyanamid for the same years, intervened, as amicus curiae, in the court below.\nCyanamid\u2019s home office, until May, 1962, had been in New York City. Its shareholders\u2019 meetings are held in Portland, Maine, and its directors\u2019 meetings are held either in New York City or Wayne, New Jersey.\nThis Fort Washington facility is one of fifteen branch offices with \u201con premises\u201d warehousing in the United States and it is the sole branch office in Pennsylvania. As part of the \u201cTransportation and Distribution\u201d division \u2014 one of nine service divisions which provide services for Oyanamid\u2019s eleven operating divisions\u2014 the Fort Washington office is supervised by a branch manager under whom are 61 office and shipping room personnel. This office services a territory which embraces four States, including Pennsylvania, parts of two other States and Washington, D. C.\nOf these four men, one spends 15%, two spend 10% and o.ne spends no time in Philadelphia.\nFrom an examination of the School District\u2019s argument, one gains the impression that the proximity of the Fort Washington office to the territory of the School District vitally affects the taxing authority\u2019s thinking. Unfortunately for the taxing authority, the taxing statute requires activity in, not close to, the territory of the taxing authority.\nApparently, the School District makes reference to the designation by Cyanamid, at the time it registered to do business as a foreign corporation in Pennsylvania, of the office of C. T. Corporation as the address at which process might be served upon Cyanamid. Such is not a fact of record. Even if it were of record, such designation is not the equivalent of being engaged in business or commercial activity in the taxing district within the statutory concept.\nAppellee\u2019s brief, pp. 7, 8.",

Philadelphia School District, 425 Pa. 455, 229 A. 2d 881 (1967), decided only a few weeks earlier. I dissented in Alan Wood and believe that American Cyanamid is also engaged in \u201ccommercial activity, or making sales to persons within such school district of the first class.\u201d General Business Tax Act of May 23, 1949, P. L. 1669, as amended, 24 P.S. \u00a7584.1. As the majority point out each case must be decided on its own facts. Thus, as in Alan Wood, I am content to rely upon an excerpt from the opinion of the court below which, in my view, amply demonstrates that appellant\u2019s commercial contacts with the City were not insubstantial: \u201cAmerican Cyanamid is a Maine corporation duly qualified to do business in Pennsylvania and having registered office at 123 South Broad Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Eighty to ninety percent of the products delivered to customers of American Cyanamid in Philadelphia are shipped from the warehouse in Fort Washington, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The branch office and warehouse there has a Philadelphia telephone number and is listed in the Philadelphia directories; it has some 19 sales representatives, 3 of whom reside in Philadelphia; they regularly call upon various businesses, professional men, druggists and others to promote the sale of the products of American Cyanamid. The prices for the products, terms of sale, allowance and ultimate acceptance or rejection of the orders is determined by the Fort Washington office. The representatives who call on the various businesses, hospitals, physicians, institutions and druggists, solicit and sometimes write orders, record complaints, answer inquiries and leave literature.
