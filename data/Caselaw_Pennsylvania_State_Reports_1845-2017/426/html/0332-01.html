Wissahiekon Mutual entered into a defense on behalf of Miss Taylor, and represented her up to and during a compulsory arbitration hearing, held on February 21, 1966, in the County Court of Philadelphia County. That arbitration hearing resulted in a finding for appellant in the amount of $719. On March 18, 1966, Wissahiekon Mutual, being insolvent, went into receivership. Thereupon, appellant made a demand upon appellee that the matter be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of his uninsured motorist coverage contained in his policy written by appellee.

We agree with the statement of the dissenting opinion in the Superior Court that: “When an insurer fails to defend a claim, or to satisfy a judgment against its insured, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, it 'denies coverage’ to him in the only meaningful sense of that term.”</p>

This case, while novel in the appellate courts of Pennsylvania, has been considered and decided in other jurisdictions. The Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, interpreting a statute of that State in <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Brower, </em><a href="/va/204/0887-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="204 Va. 887" data-case-ids="2044788" data-case-paths="/va/204/0887-01">204 Va. 887</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=134%20S.E.2d%20277" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="134 S.E.2d 277">134 S.E. 2d 277</a> (1964), reached a conclusion opposite to that reached <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>by the Superior Court. The Virginia statute in question required uninsured motorist coverage in all automobile liability policies issued in the State of Virginia, and further contained a provision defining uninsured vehicles. That definition included as uninsured vehicles those where there was insurance but the insurance company writing it denied coverage thereunder. The court held that the refusal of the insurance carrier, which had become insolvent subsequent to the accident, to pay the judgment which its insured had become obligated to pay, constituted a denial of coverage, thereby invoking the uninsured motorist coverage of the other driver’s insurance policy. The Court said: “State Farm argues that neither National nor any of its receivers ‘have made an express denial of coverage’ to Mazza and hence that Mazza’s automobile was not au uninsured vehicle. But [the Virginia statute] does not say that the denial must be express. It says only that the automobile is an uninsured vehicle if the insurance company ‘denies coverage’. There is nothing in the letter of the statute nor, as we believe, in the spirit and purpose of the statute, that requires the denial to be expressed. Denial of coverage clearly may be as effectively made by the conduct of the insurer as by its spoken or written word.”</p>
    <p id="b380-4" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[197,1743,1160,653]],["BL_381.1",381,[155,361,1151,209]]]'>The Supreme Court of South Carolina followed <em>Brower </em>when faced with a similar situation in <em>North River Ins. Co. v. Gibson, </em><a href="/sc/244/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="244 S.C. 393" data-case-ids="2111778" data-case-paths="/sc/244/0393-01">244 S.C. 393</a>, <a href="/sc/244/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="244 S.C. 393" data-case-ids="2111778" data-case-paths="/sc/244/0393-01">137 S.E. 2d 264</a> (1964). In that case, again, an insurance carrier became insolvent subsequent to the accident which precipitated the litigation. Under the South Carolina statute, requiring uninsured motorist coverage, an uninsured vehicle was defined as one, inter alia, on which liability insurance was carried but as to which the insurer denies coverage. The court held that the right of the insured to recover on his uninsured motorist coverage is not necessarily determinable as of the date <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>of the collision. The South Carolina Supreme Court adopted the language of <em>Brower </em>that: “An insurer denies coverage to its insured when it fails or refuses to accord him the protection it contracted to give.”</p>
    <p id="b381-3" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[150,582,1156,1094]]]'>Appellee, in the instant case, contends that the South Carolina decision in <em>Gibson </em>is dependent upon a 1963 amendment to the South Carolina statute, which amendment specifically defined an uninsured vehicle as one on which there was insurance but the insurance carrier who wrote it was subsequently declared insolvent. Such, however, is not the rationale of the South Carolina decision. It held specifically that the purpose and effect of the amendment was to clarify, rather than to broaden, the coverage afforded by the statute as it existed prior to the amendment and at the time of the accident which gave rise to the case. In that connection, it should be added that the decision in <em>Federal Ins. Co. v. Speight, </em><a href="/f-supp/220/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="220 F. Supp. 90" data-case-ids="68327" data-case-paths="/f-supp/220/0090-01">220 F. Supp. 90</a>, E.D. S.C. (1963), wherein the Federal District Court construed the South Carolina statute in the same manner as the Superior Court construed the policy at bar, is of no authoritative value, inasmuch as that decision preceded <em>Gibson </em>by 11 months, and the Supreme Court of South Carolina, in <em>Gibson, </em>decided to the contrary.</p>

Co., </em>53 Cal. Reporter 669 (1966). In that case, the California Court of Appeals was faced with a situation similar to those faced by the appellate courts of Virginia and South Carolina. There, too, the statute requiring uninsured motorist coverage defined an uninsured motor vehicle as one, inter alia, covered by insurance but the company writing it denies coverage thereunder. Once again, the tortfeasor’s carrier became insolvent subsequent to the accident, and the Court of Appeals of California adopted the reasoning of Virginia and South Carolina. The Court pertinently stated: “The reasoning of the Vir<a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>ginia court in the Brower case is sound, and is consistent with the letter and the spirit of the California statute. [The California statute] is a part of a pattern of statutes which are ‘designed to give monetary-protection to that ever changing and tragically large group of persons who while lawfully using the highways themselves suffer grave injury through the negligent use of those highways by others.’ [citing cases] Such statutes must be liberally construed to carry out this objective of providing compensation for those injured through no fault of their own.

We agree with their conclusion, and with the conclusion of the dissenting opinion of the Superior Court that insolvency of the tortfeasor’s carrier occurring subsequent to the accident, and the consequent refusal or inability of that carrier to defend or pay judgments to which its insured has become liable, constitutes a denial of coverage within the uninsured motorist provision of the insured’s pol<a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>icy and entitles the other insured to proceed in accordance with his own insurance policy.</p>

Clearly the Legislature did not intend to restrict the benefits of the Uninsured Motor Vehicle Act to those eases where the tortfeasor lacks insurance at the moment of injury or where his insurance carrier denies recovery, since realistically, one injured by a tortfeasor whose carrier is or has become insolvent prior to the satisfaction of his claim is just as unprotected as is the person injured by a tortfeasor who has no insurance at all.</p>
