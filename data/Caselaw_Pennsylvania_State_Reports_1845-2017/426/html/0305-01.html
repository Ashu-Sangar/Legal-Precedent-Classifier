After a hearing, wherein extensive testimony was taken and documentary evidence was reviewed, the court en banc fixed the degree of guilt as murder in the first degree and imposed the death penalty. The appellant filed a motion in arrest of judgment and, after submission of briefs and oral argument, the court, on October 25, 1966, by its opinion and order, denied the motion. On November 2, 1966, the death sentence was formally announced in open court, where appellant, with counsel, was present. This appeal followed.</p>

Weyandt, a lieutenant of the guards, was standing in the yard of the Western State Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh conversing with another guard, John Fred Walz. Suddenly and without warning, someone came up behind Weyandt, and he received what he described as “a hard blow in the back”. He wheeled around and confronted Stanley Howard, the appellant, who was then an inmate at that institution. Howard was facing him with a knife in his right hand. Howard advanced toward Weyandt, and Weyandt began backing away. Howard then swung the knife and, with a sweeping motion, struck the officer in the chest. Walz ran over to assist Weyandt and the appellant, Howard, turned upon him, cursing, and shouted “Do you want it too?”. Walz ran to obtain assistance. Weyandt continued backing away, holding his hands in front of him. At this point, tradesmen instructor <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>Clifford Grogan came on the scene and approached Howard from behind. Just before Grogan was able to seize the appellant, Howard spun sideways and struck at Grogan with the knife. Grogan jumped backward, attempting to avoid the thrust, and in doing so, fell to the ground. He kicked out at the appellant and in the same motion rolled over onto his right side. Appellant, Howard, thereupon stabbed Grogan in the left side. Howard then stepped over his victim in a straddling position and, while Grogan was on his hands and knees and Howard was straddling him across the hips, Howard proceeded to stab Grogan twice in the right side.</p>

It was at this point that Weyandt discovered that the blow which he had felt in his back had been a stab wound inflicted by the appellant. Weyandt recovered from this stab wound, but Grogan died shortly thereafter from the stab wounds which he had received.</p>

Officer Weyandt further indicated at the trial that from the time he felt the pain in his back until he saw Grogan attempting to restrain Howard was only a matter of seconds. Weyandt further indicated at the preliminary hearing that the demeanor of the appellant was that of someone who was mad or angry. There is no evidence to indicate that Grogan was ever known by Howard.</p>

In January, 1944, Mrs. Halsey reported that he was ‘misbehaving’ and that she could not handle him, and he was therefore placed with a Mrs. Gilbert. In October, 1947, it is reported that Howard was stealing from Mrs. Gilbert’s grandson. In December, 1948, Howard was reported annoying an elderly man on the way to school. In February, 1949, he is reported to have been a school problem, and in July, 1949, he climbed out of a school bus and ran away. In August, 1949, he was reported to have been dumping garbage cans into the hallways of apartment buildings adjacent to his own. By the end of 1949, Mrs. Gilbert reported that he was constantly staying out late and running around and that she was unable to handle him. In January, 1950, he was placed in the home of a Mrs. Ford. She reported that he lied to her as to his activities, stayed out late, and was a disciplinary problem.</p>

Finally, in October, 1951, Mrs. Dumas reported that Howard had run away for a week-end, had committed thefts from her, and that she was unable to control him. On November 1, 1951, a Juvenile Court hearing was held, involving the thefts from Mrs. Dumas. Howard was placed on one year’s probation and placed in an institutional home.

Heller, a psychiatrist. Dr. Heller classified appellant’s problem as “a long-standing character disorder of the dissocial type, manifested by a long history of anti-social behavior, inability to profit from experience, and a lack of capacity to form meaningful emotional relationships.” In spite of appellant’s record of suicidal attempts at Graterford, Dr. Heller was of the opinion that appellant did not present a significant suicide risk and recommended that he be placed in the prison population. Dr. Heller’s second report on October 1? 1964, followed an apparent suicide attempt. At that time, he stated: “It would appear that this suicidal attempt was a superficial one, as was the original one he made <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>at Graterford . . At this time, Dr. Heller reiterated his previous evaluation of Howard and found him unable to respond to disciplinary relationship except for the briefest periods of time. On October 20, 1964, appellant was examined by Dr. 0. Fred Hering, a psychiatrist, following an episode of bizarre behavior and a suicidal attempt on October 2, 1964, supposedly a severe reaction to the long sentence which had been ' imposed. Dr. Hering stated: “This man was admitted to 3 Block . . . following an episode of bizzarre [sic] behavior on 15 Block, where he had been sent following a suicidal attempt. . . . This seemed to be a very severe reaction to the fact that he had a 30 to 60 year sentence and feels he has nothing to lose. However, it was pointed out to him that he has a lot to gain with behavior which would be more productive and constructive for him; that there is an opportunity for him to learn many things, both about himself as well as vocationally and educationally, here in the institution. He seems somewhat impressed by this.”</p>
    <p id="b356-4" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[194,1450,1150,913]],["BL_357.1",357,[188,371,1151,371]]]'>The instant killing occurred on November 12, 1965. However, appellant was not indicted until December of 1965, and early in January of 1966, he was brought to court for the appointment of public counsel or the opportunity to obtain private counsel. On January 17, 1966, he corresponded with the newly-created office of the Public Defender, requesting counsel, and counsel was formally appointed on February 1, 1966. On February 21, 1966,. upon the application of the office of the public defender, Dr. Emil Trellis, a psychiatrist, and Dr. Leon I. Ford, a clinical psychologist, were appointed to examine appellant. On March 5, 1966, Dr. Ford examined the appellant for approximately 4 hours. This examination included testing and an interview with appellant at great length. Dr. Ford observed: “. . . He seems equally inclined to take direct action, often in an impulsive manner, to avoid or to <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>obtain release from tension. Most of the time he reacts on a reality basis, bnt he has the potential for sudden emotional eruptions on the basis of inner promptings with little regard for external reality. . . . When his defenses are lowered under great stress he can be overwhelmed by intense mixed moody and angry feelings and destructive impulses. . . .</p>
    <p id="b357-4" data-blocks='[["BL_357.5",357,[186,754,1151,642]]]'>“Psychological tests reveal Mr. Howard to be extremely immature and self-centered person who views the world as extremely hostile and unpleasant. He has many deep-seated fears and conflicts and an extremely low tolerance for frustration and anxiety. Passivity, fantasy, projection and counter-phobic defenses are insufficient to contain his anxiety, and he avoids and relieves tension by direct and often impulsive action. Assultive [sic] tendencies are easily elicited especially when he feels threatened. Generally, he is quite reality oriented, but he has occasional lapses when his thinking is illogical and disordered.”</p>
    <p id="b357-5" data-blocks='[["BL_357.6",357,[182,1408,1152,422]]]'>He concluded as follows: “The eneuresis (bed-wetting), anti-social behavior, impulsive assaultiveness towards self and others, and the psychological test results indicating emotional conflicts, illogical thinking and the potential for impulsive behavior with little regard for reality all suggest a borderline psychosis or transient psychotic episodes in an impulsive character disordered personality.”</p>

He indicated that Howard had inadequate counter-phobic defenses, indicating that appellant tended to become more aggressive to counteract his fears. The suggestion of transient psychotic episodes was supported by the effects upon appellant of his being isolated and the occasional lapses which occurred in the <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>process of psychological testing. Dr. Ford’s testimony also revealed, in his opinion, it would have been better had appellant been tested soon after the crime, depending upon his condition, and that it would have been worth the attempt to try to determine appellant’s state of mind at the time the offense was committed.</p>
    <p id="b358-4" data-blocks='[["BL_358.5",358,[214,701,1156,373]]]'>In direct examination, Dr. Ford defined “psychosis” as follows: “Psychosis, generally speaking, is a condition in which the person is emotionally disturbed. In other words, they don’t react to things as other people do. They might see a situation differently than other people see a situation. . . . They might react in such a way that it is entirely unrealistic, . . .”</p>
    <p id="b358-5" data-blocks='[["BL_358.6",358,[210,1085,1158,371]]]'>As to “transient psychotic episodes”, Dr. Ford explained : “By this I mean that under great stress a person can go into one of these psychotic episodes. It doesn’t mean that they are like this all the time. It would happen when they are under particular kinds of stress. ... It can be inner stress. It could be external, it could be inner, it could be both.”</p>
    <p id="b358-6" data-blocks='[["BL_358.7",358,[203,1466,1161,917]]]'>Dr. Ford classified appellant as a sociopathic personality, defined as follows: “The sociopathic personality essentially is someone who from very early in life has had very few, if any, close personal relationships with people of longlasting nature, and as a result they tend to be very shallow, very superficial in the way they form friendships. They are really too immature socially and emotionally to really form friendships, real friendships, as most people do. They, of course, seem to be self-centered and primarily concerned with self-preservation and frequently may get into all sorts of difficulties with the law and with people in managing to survive as the only way they know how. They haven’t been disciplined enough as children and really never developed a strong conscience, as the average person does who has more stable family relationships. Essentially, that’s about it . . .”</p>

      <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>Dr. Ford went on to state that sociopaths do not normally adjust well to long periods of confinement, and that possibly long periods of confinement could lead to further anti-social acts. He stated that sociopathic personalities are mentally ill, and that in his opinion, Stanley Howard was mentally ill. When questioned as to his being treated for his illness, he replied: “That’s a difficult question. People have been trying to treat sociopaths and people who are mentally ill like Stanley for many years, with some success and with some failures. I would say more failures than successes.”</p>
    <p id="b359-3" data-blocks='[["BL_359.4",359,[178,1021,1154,805]]]'>Dr. Emil Trellis first examined Stanley Howard on March 3, 1966, and again on April 1, 1966. IDs testimony revealed that he had studied the tests given to Howard by Dr. Ford, and after examining Howard’s tests, diagnosed him as “emotionally unstable personality with schizoid features. . . ”. He quoted the definition of Emotionally Unstable Personality from the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of the American Psychiatric Association as follows: “In such cases the individual reacts with excitability and ineffectiveness when confronted by minor stress. His judgment may be undependable under stress, and his relationship to other people is continuously fraught with fluctuating emotional attitudes, because of strong and poorly controlled hostility, guilt, and anxiety.</p>

He testified that the sociopatliie person “tends to be impulsive; hence not to be able to have the judgment or control of impulses to delay immediate action with the idea that they have to have consequences for their behavior. The sociopath does not readily learn from experience. The sociopath in general isn’t able <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>to have the controls to develop a sustained kind of occupational skill in many cases.” Dr. Trellis also stated that, in his opinion, Howard was not legally insane.</p>

The action of appellant supplies specific intent, willfulness, deliberation and premeditation essential for a determination of murder in the first degree. For example, in <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant further contends that this failure to give him a prompt medical examination was a denial of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel, and prevented an effective inquiry into the defense of insanity. We find these contentions also to be without merit. We are aware that the psychiatrist and psychologist who testified on behalf of appellant both indicated it would have been desirable had appellant received an earlier mental examination; that is, shortly after the time the crime was committed. We are of the opinion that this would have been a desirable thing, and perhaps had the prison authorities had it to do over again, would have had such a mental examination conducted.

We find this contention to be without merit. As we said in <em>Commonwealth v.

Smith, </em><a href="/pa/405/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="405 Pa. 456" data-case-ids="1303572" data-case-paths="/pa/405/0456-01">405 Pa. 456</a>, 459, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.2d%20619" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="176 A.2d 619">176 A. 2d 619</a>, 620 (1962), to wit: “This Court has sustained a verdict of first degree murder with penalty of death where defendant allegedly had an irresistible impulse, was a moron or a mental defective or a sexual pervert or a psychopathic personality, or had been previously confined in the hospital for the criminal insane for 14 years, or was a schizophrenic psychopath or was an unstable, mentally defective moron, or was feeble-minded. [Citations omitted'].” Eaeh case must be decided on its own facts and the mere existence of psychiatric evidence tending to show the existence of a mental disease or defect is not sufficient to preclude the imposition of the death penalty. Most, if not all, <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>of the cases cited in the <em>Smith </em>opinion are distinguishable either because of the quantum of psychiatric testimony and/or because, as in <em>Smith, </em>a jury rather than a judge had determined the penalty. In the latter circumstances, this Court may not reverse the sentence for an abuse of discretion. See <em>Commonwealth v. Taranow, </em><a href="/pa/359/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="359 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="473128" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0342-01">359 Pa. 342</a>, 344-45, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20A.2d%2053" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="59 A.2d 53">59 A. 2d 53</a>, 54 (1948). Nevertheless, in light of current medical knowledge, I cannot subscribe to the broad implications drawn by the court below from <em>Smith’s </em>sweeping statement.</p>
