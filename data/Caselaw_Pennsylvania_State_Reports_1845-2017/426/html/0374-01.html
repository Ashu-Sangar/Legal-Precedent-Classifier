      <em> </em>In June of <em>1965, </em>almost 10 years after her mother’s death, appellant filed this petition for citation directed to the remaining executor of her mother’s will to show cause why he should not file an account of his administration of her mother’s estate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">**</a> An answer was filed by the executor and a master was appointed to hear testimony in order to determine if an account should be filed. On February 24, 1966, the master filed his report recommending that the Orphans’ Court dismiss the petition for an accounting. The lower Court adopted the master’s findings of fact and conclusions of law and dismissed appellant’s petition.</p>
