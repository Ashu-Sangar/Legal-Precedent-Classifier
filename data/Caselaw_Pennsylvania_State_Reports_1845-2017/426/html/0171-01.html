The marriage between the testator and the appellee was the second for both, and the appellant, decedent’s son, was born of his previous marriage. The parties were married on October 12,1956. On October 5, 1956, they executed an antenuptial agreement, under which the testator agreed to devise the premises at 6474 Anderson Street, Philadelphia, to appellee, in considera<a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>tion for which the appellee agreed to release the rest of his estate from her claims as the surviving spouse. The agreement further provided that if the real estate at 6474 Anderson Street were sold in his lifetime, he would provide then, under such circumstances, in his will, a bequest of $10,000 to his widow in lieu of the real estate.</p>

If I should sell the said premises 6474 Anderson Street before my decease, then in lieu thereof, I give, devise and bequeath to my beloved friend, Sophie Gross, the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars in cash as well as the contents of any other apartment or house which we may occupy as our home at the time of my death.”</p>

Previously, on or about December 24, 1963, appellee had filed notice of a claim in the amount of $10,000 as a lien against the property at 623 S.

Sixth Street, Philadelphia, was beyond appellee’s reach. On January 15, 1965, Judge Saylor filed his adjudication, awarding $10,000 to appellee as a creditor. He observed at that time that if the widow were to be paid her $10,000, it would be necessary to liquidate the parcel of real estate at 623 S. Sixth Street. He further ruled that Paragraph 6 of the antenuptial agreement did not place the property beyond the reach of appellee. Exceptions were filed and, in an opinion dated May 26, 1965, the matter was referred back to the auditing Judge, for disposition of other questions not resolved at audit.</p>

On March 25, 1966, an amended supplemental adjudication was filed by the auditing Judge, which reduced the amount of the surcharge; however, in all other respects, the adjudications of January 15, 1965, and November 16, 1965, were confirmed. The court again ordered the appellant to sell the real estate and appellant again filed exceptions. On April 18, 1966, before the court en banc, the appellant’s counsel stated : “I have an application to make, your Honor. It is, not my intention to argue the exceptions filed on behalf of the estate. I have no qualms with Judge Saylor's recent adjudication.

Sixth Street from appellee’s claim is effectively answered in the opinion of Judge Saylor of November 10, 1964. In that opinion, Judge Saylor said: “It is next contended that even though Sophie has the right as a creditor to proceed to collect the $10,000, she cannot do so with respect to 623 South Sixth Street, because of the waiver clause in the sixth item. There is no question as to the ability of the parties to insulate or release a given item of property from Sophie’s claim. Even a judgment creditor having a lien on several parcels of real estate can agree to release a particular tract from the lien of his judgment. The only question is whether by the language used in the antenuptial agreement she has done so.</p>

Looking at the com<a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>píete provision, the instrument reads: ‘. . . she will take no steps to contest the . . .

    <p id="b221-5" data-blocks='[["BL_221.5",221,[148,631,1154,588]]]'>“Whether Sophie was married to the decedent or not would not have any effect upon her ability to contest his will, assuming that she had an interest in the estate. It is, therefore, clear that the ‘to the same extent’ provision can apply only to modify ‘prevent the bequest’. But the only way in which a wife can prevent a bequest from taking effect, which is not available to a non-wife, is by an election to take against the will. The ‘prevent the bequest’ provision must therefore be read as referring to preventing the bequest from effect by taking against the decedent’s will.</p>

Whether she was married or single would have no effect on her standing as a creditor, and therefore the provision under consideration does not bar her from asserting her rights as a creditor. In any event, the rights of the widow should not be taken away from her by vague language which would not convey to a reasonable person that when she signed the agreement she was agreeing that she would not be paid the $10,000 unless, in addition to premises 623 South Sixth Street, there was sufficient other property to pay her claim.”</p>
