This warehouse was used for “dead storage”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> of equipment used in Lardas’ painting-contracting business. Underwriters Insurance Company, Home Insurance Company, National Union Fire Insurance Company and Fidelity-Phenix Fire Insurance Company (Insurance Companies) insured the warehouse from loss by fire, the total coverage of all policies totalling |10,500.</p>
    <p id="b93-4" data-blocks='[["BL_93.5",93,[150,787,1152,524]]]'>On March 4, 1962, a fire of undetermined origin occurred which resulted in a total loss of the warehouse and caused damage in excess of the $10,500 policies’ limits. Lardas first learned of the fire on or about July 15, 1962, when a letter was received from the Allegheny County Fire Marshal advising them the warehouse had been “gutted” by fire. Lardas immediately notified the Insurance Companies of the Fire Marshal’s letter and their own lack of knowledge of the exact date of the fire.</p>
    <p id="b93-5" data-blocks='[["BL_93.6",93,[147,1332,1153,747]]]'>The Insurance Companies sent an adjuster to investigate the fire and to initiate negotiations with Lardas and their counsel on the question of and the possible amount of liability. Prior to any active negotiations, however, the adjuster insisted upon Lardas executing nonwaiver agreements concerning any possible violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance contracts. On the advice of their counsel, Lardas executed such agreements. Active negotiations toward a possible settlement of the claim continued for a few months. Insurance Companies submitted their maximum offer of settlement in October 1962 which Lardas rejected in November 1962; this was the last offer by either party for settlement of the claims.</p>

This action, instituted in the County Court of Allegheny County, was transferred to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. The action was tried before a court without a jury and, after a trial, the court ordered the entry of a judgment in favor of the Insurance Companies. Upon affirmance of this order by the court en banc, judgment was entered. From the entry of that judgment Lardas has appealed.</p>

The court below entered judgment on two grounds: (1) no proof of loss had been submitted within 60 days from the date of the fire; (2) no lawsuit was filed within one year from the date of the fire.</p>

This is not a statute of limitation imposed by law; it is a contractual undertaking between the parties and the limitation on the time for bringing suit is imposed by the parties to the contract.

First, that Lardas’ failure to commence suit within twelve months from date of the loss was not a breach of the insurance policy because the one year period began to run <em>when the insured had knowledge of the loss. </em>The fire occurred March 4, 1962. Lardas had knowledge of the fire on July 15, 1962, and commenced his suit on the insurance policies on March 28, 1963, or more than one year after the occurrence of the loss and eight months after knowledge of said loss. Certainly, Lardas had adequate opportunity and time to commence a lawsuit after he gained knowledge of the loss and prior to the policy limitation of “twelve months next after inception of the loss”. Such language as to the time limitation is too plain and unequivocal to be subject to any ambiguity or misunderstanding. The period of twelve months, in fact the period of eight months, was not an unreasonable length of time in which to require the commencement of an action and “. . . it is lawful for the parties so to contract, and such a provision is binding on them [citing authorities].”: <em>Abolin v.

The record unequivocally reveals that, prior to <em>any </em>negotiations between the insurers and the insured, non-waiver agreements were executed by Lardas and such agreements preserved for the companies their rights to defend on the basis of any policy provisions. Furthermore, review of this record indicates that (a) the Insurance Companies did not in any manner mislead Lardas about the possibility of settlement — in fact in November, 1962, the parties broke off all settlement negotiations and (b) the Insurance Companies did not in any manner induce or persuade Lardas to refrain from commencing suit.
