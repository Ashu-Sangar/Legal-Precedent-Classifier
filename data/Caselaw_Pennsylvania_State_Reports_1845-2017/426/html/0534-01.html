Detweiler and Vivian, his wife (Detweilers), operated a retail beer distributorship on King Street in Pottstown Borough, Montgomery County, prior to May 1965. Because of inadequate facilities, they sought a new location for the business and engaged Joseph Bishop, a real estate broker, to assist in locating a suitable site. He produced the property involved here, located at 757 Beech Street, Pottstown, which is situated in an R-3 Residential District Classification under the Pottstown Zoning Ordinance enacted in 1963. A retail distributorship is not a permissible use of property in such a district.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> However, for many years prior to the enactment of the <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>controlling, ordinance, the building on the property-had been used in substantial .part for the operation of a retail family grocery store, another nonpermitted use, which, therefore, enjoyed the status of a lawful nonconforming use..</p>
    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.5",580,[188,650,1159,858]]]'>Acting on behalf of the Detweilers, Bishop filed an application with the borough officials for permission to" operate a retail beer distributorship business on the property. As a result he received a letter from the Pottstown Borough Manager assuring him that, under the pertinent ’provisions of the zoning code,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the nonconforming grocery use could be validly changed to the nonconforming distributorship use, provided there were no structural alterations to the building involved. The Delweilers then purchased the property and subsequently secured a building permit to construct a walk-in refrigerator and a drive-in area for customers. Later a group of nine neighborhood property owners filed a timely appeal from the issuance of the building permit (their first knowledge of any of these proceedings was the initiation of construction).</p>
    <p id="b580-5" data-blocks='[["BL_580.6",580,[187,1521,1157,260]]]'>This appeal was sustained since the zoning code, here in question, allows structural alterations of nonconforming uses' only upon the grant of a special exception, which had not been sought or allowed. (See n.-3,'supra.)</p>

A public hearing was scheduled and it was stipulated that the zoning board, along with determining the special exception question, would also resolve the threshold issue of whether the beer distributorship was a use of the same or more restricted classification as that of a grocery use, according to the commercial hierarchy established by Art. VII, §701 of the zoning ordinance. (See n. 3, supra.)</p>

One’s own personal opinion might well be that there is a distinct difference between a neighborhood grocery store and a beer distributorship, i.e., between food, an essential commodity, and beer, certainly a nonessential one. This personal response, whether it be intestinal or otherwise, is surely valid. However, the criterion in this zoning case is the Potts-town ordinance and its clear language delineates the permissible boundaries of our exploration. Under Art. XII, §1200(3.) of that law, provision is made for the change from one nonconforming use to another. The possibility of a case such as we have before us was obviously considered by the borough legislators. Change was explicitly permitted with the proviso that the change be to ■ a use within the same or “higher” commercial classification.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

There are nine such .classifications. Classification Three includes, “Store or shop for any retail business.” The subsequent classifications name specific retail businesses, which are, apparently, excluded from the broad scope of number three. It is our feeling that if the borough fathers wished to exclude a beer distributorship or similar business from inclusion in Classification Three, they would have done so, as they specifically did with other businesses. However, they did not. Perhaps this omission was a (now) lamentable oversight; perhaps <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>not. In any event, we must deal with the ordinance as it now stands; and, as it stands, there is no commercial distinction made between a grocery store and a beer distributorship. Thus, we are unable to say that the zoning board of adjustment of the Borough of Pottstown abused its discretion or committed an error of law, when it held that the change in nonconforming uses in this case was valid under the ordinance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Indeed, the board seems to have interpreted the ordinance in logical fashion.</p>

This Court has held, however, that the right to a nonconforming use runs with the land, not the ownership thereof: <em>Eitnier v. Kreitz Corp., </em><a href="/pa/404/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="404 Pa. 406" data-case-ids="1301529" data-case-paths="/pa/404/0406-01">404 Pa. 406</a>, 412, <a href="/citations/?q=172%20A.2d%20320" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="172 A.2d 320">172 A. 2d 320</a>, 323 (1961); see also, 8A McQuillin, Municipal Corporations §25.191 (3d ed. Rev. Vol. 1965). Hence, the fact that in the instant case we have a change in an existing nonconforming use coupled with a change of ownership is of no moment under present Pennsylvania law. It is now this writer’s own personal view, however, that such situations pose a threat to effective zoning without the mitigating factor of protection of property rights being present. Thus, it may well be that the <em>Eitnier </em>view, supra, could bear re-examination in light of the “rationale” stated above, as well as for the very pragmatic reason of preventing trafficking in nonconforming uses (and thus thwarting the vitality of Pennsylvania zoning). Since the issue has been neither briefed nor argued in the instant case, we will not pursue it here.</p>
