The years 1961 and 1962 fell between the triennial years 1960 and 1963, and one of the issues involved here is whether or not the property owners had any right between triennial years to contest the assessment which had been placed upon their property for the triennium beginning in 1960.</p>

The Board refused to accept the appeals, stating that the appeal period had expired. The owners then filed a complaint in mandamus with the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County requesting an order directing the Board to hear the appeals. The Board filed preliminary objections which were dismissed; upon failure of the Board to file an answer, the Court on April 12, 1961, ordered issuance of a writ of mandamus directing the Board to hear the owners’ appeals.</p>

      <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>Both the Board and the owners then appealed to this Court. Following remands to the lower court upon petition of the Board, that court reaffirmed its earlier orders on August 16, 1966. The present appeals were then filed by both parties.</p>
    <p id="b637-4" data-blocks='[["BL_637.5",637,[130,648,1154,1123]]]'>First, the Board has appealed from the order of the lower court directing it to hear these appeals for years between triennial years. The Act of June 21, 1939, P. L. 626, as amended, 72 P.S. §§5452.1 to 5452.20, governs assessments in counties of the second class. Section 13 of that act states that assessors shall revise assessments and valuations between triennial assessments for a variety of reasons covering virtually any situation where the value of the property has changed. This section concludes by stating: “All assessments required to be made by the proper assessors in the year between the triennial assessment shall be returned to the board not later than the first Monday of September of the year preceding the one for which it is made.” Section 14 of the act follows immediately: “At any time before such date, any taxable person may apply to the board for the reassessment of any subject of taxation which he considers incorrectly assessed or as to which he considers himself entitled to a change in valuation or to have mechanical or transcribing errors corrected.”</p>
    <p id="b637-5" data-blocks='[["BL_637.6",637,[131,1793,1151,582]],["BL_638.1",638,[200,360,1154,101]]]'>Prior to an amendment of September 16, 1961, P. L. 1353, to §13, the act contained no specific provision permitting an appeal by an owner from an intertriennial reassessment. However, as we read these sections, it seems clear to us that (1) the assessor is required to reassess between triennial years where the value of the property has been changed and (2) a property owner may request a reassessment any time before the first Monday of September of an intertriennial year. Therefore, in this case the owners should have made such a request prior to September 5, 1960. They did not. In<a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>stead, they filed an appeal with the Board on November 15, 1960, seeking a revision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b638-4" data-blocks='[["BL_638.5",638,[200,468,1158,590]]]'>In truth, neither party did what was required. The assessor did not reassess. The owners did not request a reassessment (and, clearly, had they done so, a refusal by the assessor to take any action would have been subject to a mandamus order). Therefore, the subsequent complaint in mandamus against the Board was based upon a view of the Board’s duties which was in error. Yet the Board’s preliminary objections failed to,point this out; the Board filed no answer; the lower court issued an order without considering the above procedures; and the Board filed no appeal.</p>
    <p id="b638-5" data-blocks='[["BL_638.6",638,[202,1069,1162,316]]]'>We believe the last point is conclusive. Since no, appeal was filed by the Board within the statutory time limits, it may not now question the lower court’s erroneous order.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Therefore, we must quash the Board’s appeal on this point of our own motion. See <em>Dipple v.
