The first (appeals numbers 188 and 194) presents a petition seeking a declaratory judgment, which action was brought June 18, 1965 by Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) and the City of Philadelphia against Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC) and its subsidiaries. Plaintiffs’ petition requested the court to determine (1) the right of SEPTA as the city’s assignee to purchase the assets of PTC pursuant to an option to purchase contained in paragraph Eleventh of an agreement dated July 1, 1907, as amended; (2) the meaning of the purchase price formula set forth in the agreement; and (3) such other matters necessary to effect the transfer of PTC’s property. Thereafter, certain minority shareholders of PTC petitioned to intervene as defendants, and their petition was granted by this Court on May 13, 1966. After hearing extensive testimony, the trial court held on July 14, 1966 (approved by the court en banc on September 16, 1966) that (1) the city’s reserved right of purchase under the <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>agreement of 1907, as amended, was valid; (2) the city’s assignment of that right to SEPTA was valid; (3) SEPTA, as the city’s assignee, must pay to PTC a sum composed of the following amounts reflected by PTC’s balance sheet as of the date of payment: (a) an amount equal to PTC’s then outstanding bond, mortgage and ground rent indebtedness; (b) an amount equal to ten dollars per share for all then outstanding common stock of PTC; and (c) the amount of the then “Retained Earnings” of PTC.</p>

Plaintiffs’ complaint prayed, inter alia, for an injunction restraining defendants from carrying out the agreement of June 8, 1965, whereby the city assigned to SEPTA its right to purchase PTC. The city and SEPTA filed preliminary objections, and on September 16, 1966 the complaint was dismissed for the reasons stated in the opinion of the court en banc filed that day in the declaratory judgment proceeding.</p>

That language assured the shareholders that when the option was exercised, they would receive so much of the accumulated earnings as were not paid to them as dividends. Had the only class of shareholders of PTC in 1939 been common shareholders, the phrase “retained earnings” or “earned surplus” would have accomplished that purpose. However, PTC had preferred shareholders whose dividend rights upon liquidation were, pursuant to the articles of incorporation, cumulative if, in fact, dividends were earned. Thus, it was possible for PTC to have at the end of a given year earned, accumulated, but <em>unpaid </em>dividends on preferred shares of stock in an amount that would exceed the amount of “earned surplus” (or “retained earnings”). On account of this situation, the draftsmen of the 1939 agreement did not use as a price factor a sum equal to PTC’s “then retained earnings,” because in such a situation had the option been exercised the common shareholders would have received less than ten dollars per share. The draftsmen clearly desired to insure that the common stockholders received ten dollars a share if the city exercised its option and not a lesser sum because of an obligation by PTC in liquidating to pay preferred <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>shareholders earned, accumulated, but unpaid dividends. Accordingly, so long as there were preferred stockholders “undistributed corporate surplus” meant the greater of PTC’s retained earnings or its earned, accumulated, but unpaid dividends as of the settlement date. Since 1955, when PTC converted its preferred stock to common stock, there have been no earned, accumulated, but unpaid dividends. Accordingly, by paying an amount equal to PTC’s retained earnings, the city will achieve the purpose of the formula — that the common shareholders get back what they risked: so much of the accumulated earnings as were not paid to them in dividends. And this is what “undistributed corporate surplus” means.</p>

PTC has no funded pension plan; pension benefits are paid out of the fare box from current revenues. Actuarial studies reveal that the amounts required to fund past service costs would be approximately $11,939,392 for nonsupervisory retirees and $4,973,304 for supervisory and executive retirees. The parties have stipulated that this $17,000,-000 obligation is a present vested liability. The question presented is whether PTC’s “undistributed cor<a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>porate surplus” is extinguished by its obligation to its retired employees. SEPTA’s accounting expert testified that minimum standards of accounting principles require that a vested pension liability be carried on the liability side of the balance sheet. PTC did not, in fact, do so because the pension obligation was never funded. Bather, the actuarily determined amount of the obligation was revealed in a footnote to their annual financial reports. SEPTA argues that if this liability were placed on the books, it would eliminate all surplus, because there is no offsetting asset on the books. Consequently, there would be no retained earnings or “undistributed corporate surplus.” Accordingly, contends SEPTA, the purchase price need not include any amount representing PTC’s “undistributed corporate surplus.”</p>

Bather an examination of the agreements is sufficient to dispose of the matter.

[etc.]’ was eliminated. It follows, therefore, that if SEPTA pays the formula price, it acquires PTC’s assets not subject to PTC’s obligations, i.e., that SEPTA after the acquisition will not be subject to PTC’s pension obligation, which is only another way of saying that SEPTA may not refuse to pay the full formula price by charging against it PTC’s pension obligation as though SEPTA would be subject to it.” (Footnotes omitted.)</p>

The rationale of §401 is set forth in the comment to that section: “a. Rationale. The rule against perpetuities has as its sole objective the prevention of ‘inconvenient fetterings of property’ (defined in §370, comment c).

The 1907 City-PTC Agreement not only gives the City a right, during an unlimited future, to purchase the franchises and other properties of the PTC, but further prohibits the PTC from “parting with any of its stocks, leaseholds or franchises without [the City’s] consent.” It is difficult to imagine a greater fettering of alienation of property.</p>

SEPTA, <em>if </em>ably managed (which, because of its multifarious functions and the varied and complicated problems which are certain to arise, is doubtful of accomplishment) is a desirable objective and a worthwhile public policy, but <em>that does not and cannot legalize the violation of any law or the destruction or abolition of the public policy of the Commonwealth, or the evasion of the many controlling decisions of this Court to the contrary. </em>The Majority cites no authority to support it and obviously proceeds on the recently adopted theory that a worthy objective validates and Constitutionalizes anything and everything, and every case is to be decided on a personal ad hoc basis. This substitutes uncertainty and confusion for certainty, clarity and stability, as well as for long-established and well-settled law, and borders on the ridiculous.

If no undistributed corporate surplus exists or if the liabilities exceed the assets, the City under said Option must pay $10 per share, which, in no event, can be reduced by pensions or by any other liabilities real or assumed, vested or contingent.

The following paragraphs from the Court’s opinion seem to me to be equally applicable to the present case: “The Superior Court and the City of Pittsburgh rely upon the argument that a decision allowing the ‘freezing payment’ places a burden on present and future ratepayers which should have been borne by those in the past. It is obvious, as the City argues and the Superior Court stated, that as a result of the Commission’s decision present and future ratepayers must pay that portion of the cost of pensions which is more properly attributable to past services. <em>But the criterion for determining whether present and future ratepayers or the investors in Bell should bear this portion of the cost is not ivhether past ratepayers should have paid it. </em>If it were, it was illogical for the Superior Court to permit the Company to allow that portion of the pension costs attributable to services rendered between 1933 and 1927 since such costs should have been placed upon ratepayers between those years. Furthermore, even the ratepayers in 1913, by that test, should not have borne the amount which was paid out in pensions on a pay-as-you-go basis and which was attributable to services rendered before 1913.</p>

In the present situation the test for determining where the burden should be placed as between these two classes of individuals is whether management abused its discretion in 1927 by not placing the full cost on the ratepayers from that time on. If they did, the investors for whom they acted should bear the cost. If they did not, there is no valid legal objection to placing the burden on present and future ratepayers.

Section 24, 66 P.S. §2024 provides that SEPTA “shall recognize and be bound by existing labor union agreements where they exist between labor unions and transportation companies that are acquired, purchased, condemned or leased.” It is evident that the legislature was thus concerned with the welfare of the transportation companies’ employees. The existing union agreement specifically provides that retired employees shall “continue to receive benefits in accordance with the provisions of the contracts which were in effect at the times of their respective retirements on pension.” Yet, as the amicus brief points out, SEPTA can hardly be bound by this provision of the union contract, which it assumes on the settlement date, and at the same time insist that <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>retired employees look not to it, bnt to PTC, for their benefits.</p>

On its books, PTC has divided its stockholders’ equity into three categories: (1) capital stock, for which the formula compensates the stockholders by requiring the purchaser to pay $10 per share for each outstanding share of stock; (2) retained earnings, for which, under the opinion of the court below, the stockholders are <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>compensated for by its inclusion in the term “undistributed corporate surplus”; (3) capital surplus, for which under the Court’s determination the stockholders receive no compensation.</p>

Additionally, I am disturbed by the uncertainty generated by the Court’s treatment of PTC’s current cash and liabilities. All agree that under the agreement SEPTA will purchase PTC’s cash as well as its other assets, and that PTC is liable for the excess of its current liabilities over and above its current cash. However, there is considerable uncertainty as to what the Court’s disposition is with regard to PTC’s current cash and liabilities. As I read the opinion of the court below, on the one hand, it permits PTC to pay its current liabilities before settlement date, thereby reducing the amount of cash transferable to SEPTA. Presumably, PTC could liquidate all its cash by satisfying as much of its current liabilities as the cash would cover. It is also possible for SEPTA <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>and PTC to make an arrangement so that SEPTA will assume the current liabilities to the extent of PTO’s current cash account thus not necessitating PTC to dispose of its cash in a desperate effort to meet a settlement deadline.

    <p id="b461-4" data-blocks='[["BL_461.5",461,[126,916,1161,1126]]]'>In my view this confusion, which is not necessary and could produce a most inequitable result, should, especially in view of the intensity of this litigation, be clarified. Under the Court’s decree SEPTA has six months in which to raise the money to purchase PTC. Under these circumstances PTC might not know until settlement date whether or not SEPTA will actually secure the necessary funds to assume control of its operations, and it may be impossible for PTC to settle its current liabilities on such short notice. On the other hand, if SEPTA fails to purchase the company, PTC may find itself with an inadequate cash position with which to properly operate the transportation system. I see no problem in making it crystal clear that the current cash is to be applied to the payment of current liabilities. On the settlement date SEPTA should only receive that portion of current cash which is in excess of PTO’s current liabilities, unless there is an agreement that SEPTA will assume an amount of current liabilities equal to the amount of current cash it obtains.</p>
