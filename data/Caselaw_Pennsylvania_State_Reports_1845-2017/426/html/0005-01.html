In <em>Cady, </em>plaintiffs had given the defendant a general release for all claims arising out of an automobile accident, including “all unknown, unforeseen, unanticipated, and unsuspected injuries.” The release was signed nine days after the accident; the consideration for it being the lowest estimate received by the plaintiffs for the repair of their automobile. At the time the release was executed neither party suspected that Mrs. Cady had suffered any bodily injury; indeed defendant’s insurance adjuster testified that he had <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>included Mrs. Cady in the release only as an extra precaution. Subsequently, Mrs. Cady developed symptoms which indicated that she had sustained bodily injuries in the accident. Although viewing the release as prima facie evidence of payment and settlement, nevertheless, the Superior Court, speaking through Judge Montgomery, sustained, without dissent, the jury’s action in voiding the release. The court held, in accord with the rule in a majority of sister jurisdictions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> that since neither party contemplated personal injuries on the part of Mrs. Cady, the release could not be construed to cover them: “The circumstances, including the details as to when, where and how the releases were secured, and the inadequacy of the consideration, [Avere] all matters reflecting on the meeting of the minds of the parties and collectively support the jury’s action.” <em><a href="/pa-super/208/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="208 Pa.

In the same automobile accident D-l’s car is slightly damaged.

This has been recognized for centuries by English-speaking peoples. Lord Coke, Chief Justice of England, thus wisely expressed (circa 1600) these truths: “The knowne certaintie of the law is the safetie of all.” This has been a beacon light for Anglo-American Courts, for text authorities, and for law-abiding Americans ever since the foundation of our Country.

Change of circumstances or modern circumstances does not mean, nor has it ever heretofore been considered as the equivalent of “change of personnel in the Court,” or the substitution of the social or political or economic philosophy of a Judge for the language of the Constitution or of a written instrument, or for well settled principles of law.</p>
