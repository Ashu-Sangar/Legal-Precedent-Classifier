(2) The <em>McHugh </em>case, supra, held the exclusion applied in the case of materials purchased for the construction of new facilities for the Philadelphia Water Department.

Presumably, “public utility” would also be needed to direct anyone reading the statute to the Public Utility Code definition of “services”. Since Lafferty performs services which can be equated with <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>those of a genuine public utility, i.e., a common carrier, it asserts that it is encompassed within the ambit of the exclusionary clause.</p>

In fact, we made no such assumption. The only issue raised before us in that case was whether the tax exclusion applied to the construction of new facilities, as well as to the improvement of existing facilities. It was assumed, or tacitly conceded, in every one of the six briefs<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> filed by the various parties and amici curiae in that case, as well as by this Court speaking through the present writer, that the Philadelphia Water Department was a bona fide public utility.

The sole ■ question was whether or not certain tangible property (meters) was used by the admitted public utilities in rendering a “service.” The whole em: phasis of our opinion in <em>Equitable Gas Company </em>was <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>devoted to the question of whether or not the use of meters by a public utility constituted the rendering of a “service” by that public utility.</p>

In applying the “public utility service” exclusion,, the “public utility” question should be decided before reaching the “service” question. An entity must be a “public utility” under the Public Utility Code to qualify for the sales and use tax public utility service exclusion.

      <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>Lafferty next argues that the purpose of the exclusion is to prevent “tax pyramiding,” i.e., to insure that the sales and use tax is paid only once in the sequence from creation of the commodity or service to the consumer, to prevent a tax on a tax situation. Thus, Lafferty says that contract carriers are as much within the scope of such a purpose as common carriers. While we tend to agree with Lafferty that obviation of “tax pyramiding” is indeed the purpose of the instant exclusion, we cannot agree that contract carriers therefore qualify thereunder. Our prior determination interpreting the exclusion in question as being unavailable to entities not qualifying as “public utilities” under the Public Utility Code disposes of this argument. The Legislature may well have intended to block “tax; pyramiding”, but it likewise intended to bar contract carriers from the instant exclusion. Apparently, the Legislature felt that the effects of such “pyramiding” insofar as contract carriers are involved were not of such gravity to warrant the exclusion, perhaps since the scope of contract carrier service, by definition, is limited. The “purpose” argument was made to bolster the syllogistic argument and when the latter fell, the former becomes, in effect, moot.</p>

Lafferty contends that there is no difference or, at least, not enough difference between the two types of carriers to constitutionally sustain differing tax treatment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

If that is proper, then the exclusion of Class D com<a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>mon carriers is necessarily valid, such exclusion then being incidental to the larger distinction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> The distinctions between a public utility and a business entity which is not a public utility are well known.

Jur. Public Utilities and Services, §2 (1942) ; 73 C.J.S. Public Utilities §1 (1951). If the purpose of the exclusion indeed is to prohibit tax pyramiding, it is reasonable for the Legislature, steering a course between the need for revenue and consideration for the consumer, to deem public utility customers the most appropriate beneficiaries of the exclusionary safeguard.</p>

That is to say, if a potential taxpayer is involved in purchases or uses which are for the direct benefit of a <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>public utility, to be used by that public utility in an excluded service, then the potential taxpayer might be likewise excluded from the sales and use tax. It should be evident that the rationale of <em>McHugh </em>is in no way limited to the strict facts of that case, i.e., to construction contractors <em>only. </em>Furthermore, the exclusion might also be available in the case of an entity long considered <em>by the courts </em>to be a public utility rendering what have been judicially declared to be public utility services though such entity does not come within the Public Utility Code.
