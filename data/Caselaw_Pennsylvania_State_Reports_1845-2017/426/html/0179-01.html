P. 2179(a) (3)), a personal action against a corporation may be brought in the county where the cause of action arose. See <em>Monaco v. Montgomery Cab Co., </em><a href="/pa/417/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="417 Pa. 135" data-case-ids="1894028" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0135-01">417 Pa. 135</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20252" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="208 A.2d 252">208 A. 2d 252</a> (1965). Corporation contends that the cause of action, or the act allegedly violative of plaintiffs’ rights, occurred where the news<a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>paper was printed and “primarily circulated”, i.e., Mercer County; hence, venue lies only in that county. While there is authority in some jurisdictions to support this position,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> we do not subscribe thereto. In our view, it is premised on a confused understanding of the word “publication” as it applies to defamation and is in conflict with the fundamental principles of an action in libel.</p>
    <p id="b226-4" data-blocks='[["BL_226.5",226,[210,810,1160,1345]]]'>When one speaks of the “publication” of a newspaper, we think of the actual plant where it is physically printed and “published.” But this in itself has nothing to do with the “publication” of a defamatory statement contained in the newspaper. The word “publication” in this sense has a different connotation. Several examples could be cited to demonstrate this point. For instance, assume that all of the copies of the newspaper involved had been picked up at the newspaper plant in Mercer County and taken to and distributed in Allegheny County. There would have been no “publication” of the defamatory article in Mercer County. The only publication would have taken place in Allegheny County. And, regardless of where the defamatory statement is written or printed, no cause of action for libel arises until there is a publication of the defamatory matter, which is “its communication intentionally or by a negligent act to one other than the person defamed”: Restatement, Torts §577 (1938). Likewise, if one writes or prints a defamatory letter in Mercer County and mails it to an addressee in Allegheny County, there obviously is no publication of the libel until the letter is read in Allegheny County and (which is most important) understood as being defamatory of the plaintiff.</p>

      <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>Moreover, in determining where a cause of action for libel arises, we must keep certain fundamental points in mind. The most important function of an action for defamation is to give the innocent and injured plaintiff a public vindication of his good name. Its primary purpose is to restore his unjustly tarnished reputation, and “reputation is the estimation in which one’s character is held by his neighbors or associates.” Restatement, Torts §577, comment b (1938).</p>
    <p id="b227-4" data-blocks='[["BL_227.5",227,[165,856,1154,913]]]'>If a newspaper is published and circulated in New York City which includes a defamatory statement of a person in Scranton, Pennsylvania, but no one in New York City recognizes the article as applying to the individual defamed, or if there is such recognition of identity but no realization that the article is defamatory of the person in Scranton, then there is no publication in New York City. See Restatement, Torts §577, comment c (1938). However, if a few copies of this newspaper published in New York City are sent to Scranton and there read by the Scrantonian’s neighbors or associates who recognize the reference to him and reasonably believe that it is defamatory, then the newspaper has libeled him in Scranton, and not in New York City, the place where the newspaper is printed and “primarily circulated.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Compare <em>Peck v. Tribune Company, </em><a href="/us/214/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="214 U.S. 185" data-case-ids="3650372" data-case-paths="/us/214/0185-01">214 U.S. 185</a> (1909).</p>

For instance, where a magazine is printed and sent out from Chicago and is sold from stores in Philadelphia and contains an exposé type of article which defames a Philadelphia resident: Must he go to Chicago to obtain redress? The problem becomes more acute with a radio or television program which defames a person residing in a place far removed from the area wherein the program originates.</p>

    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.6",228,[188,1065,1161,1133]]]'>Under the English and American common law rule, every sale of a single copy of a newspaper was a distinct publication, giving rise to a separate cause of action. See Gatley, Libel and Slander (5th ed. 1960) at 424; Prosser, Torts §94 (2d ed. 1955) at 599; and Restatement, Torts §578, comment b (1938). As a result, in times past a large number of separate lawsuits were instituted against a newspaper based upon the one defamatory story. The Act of 1953, supra, which limits individuals so defamed to one cause of action for the entire publication, regardless of the number of individual copies of the newspaper published, was enacted to eliminate such successive oppressive harassment and not to fix the site of the cause of action. On the other hand, Pa. R. C. P. 2179, supra, was designed to give a plaintiff, who has a tort committed upon him by a corporation in his own bailiwick, a convenient forum in which to obtain redress without the undue expense, inconvenience and delay of resorting to a forum in a distant metropolitan area. See <em>County Construction Co. v. Livengood Construction Co., </em>supra.</p>

P. 2179, supra, permits venue in a libel action against a corporation in the county where the cause of action arose, there is no such rule or statute authorizing this in the situation where the libel action is against an individual. In fact under Pa. R. C. P. 1006(a) and 1042, venue in such instances is limited to the county wherein the individual defendant can be served. Pa. R. C. P. 1043<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> relied upon by the plaintiffs to establish venue of the action in Allegheny County against the individual defendant, Woge, has no such effect. This rule, dealing with deputized service, applies only where a rule or statute prescribes that the action may be brought in the county where the cause of action arose. See Pa. R. C. P. 1042; 2A Anderson, Pa. Civil Practice §1043.2 at n. 30, §1042.1 at 632-634 (1960).
