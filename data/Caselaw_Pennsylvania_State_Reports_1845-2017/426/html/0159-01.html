Fiumara, </em><a href="/f-supp/232/0757-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="232 F. Supp. 757" data-case-ids="1485796" data-case-paths="/f-supp/232/0757-01">232 F. Supp. 757</a>, E.D. Pa.

    <p id="b207-3" data-blocks='[["BL_207.5",207,[160,545,1155,543]]]'>After Judge Van Dusen’s decision remanding the action to the Court of Common Pleas No. 5, Fiumara, on October 20, 1965, obtained a rule upon the Oil Companies to show cause why he should not be reimbursed for all the costs, disbursements and attorney fees, amounting to §13,212, incurred by him in connection with the litigation involving the Oil Companies’ attempt to remove the action to the Federal Court. The court below discharged this rule <em>without prejudice. </em>The present appeal is from that order.</p>
    <p id="b207-4" data-blocks='[["BL_207.6",207,[156,1100,1155,532]]]'>The issue presented by this appeal is whether Fiumara is entitled to the payment by the Oil Companies of all costs, disbursements and attorney fees incurred by him by reason of the attempted removal proceedings. The gravamen of his contention is that the Oil Companies, in seeking to remove the conspiracy action from the Court of Common Pleas No. 5 to the Federal Court, acted in bad faith and as part of a plan of harassment by the Oil Companies of Fiumara.</p>
    <p id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.7",207,[153,1655,1153,540]],["BL_208.1",208,[223,384,1160,814]]]'>Fiumara takes the position that, when the Oil Companies filed the §250 bond with their petition of removal to the Federal Court, this constituted evidence that the Oil Companies <em>agreed “. </em>. . [to] pay all costs and disbursements incurred by reason of the removal proceedings [if] ... it be determined that the case was not removable or was improperly removed. . . .”, and, since the Federal Court had decided that the removal of the action was improper and had remanded the action to the State Court, Fiumara <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>argues that he has the right to collect on this <em>agreement </em>to pay all costs and disbursements, the latter including reasonable attorney’s fees. Fiumara contends that the Oil Companies breached the agreement contained in the removal bond and he seeks to liquidate the amount of costs and disbursements and to reduce such amount to a judgment so that he can then proceed against the Oil Companies’ surety for that amount. In a nutshell, Fiumara contends that, because <a href="/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A71446" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="28 U.S.C. §1446">28 USC §1446</a> (d) mandates in removal proceedings the posting of a bond conditioned on the payment of costs and disbursements if the action was not removable or improperly removed, he is entitled to recover $13,212 because the Federal Court remanded the action to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.</p>
    <p id="b208-4" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[212,1212,1167,1203]]]'>Before proceeding to any consideration of the issue raised on this appeal, we must determine whether the order of the court below constitutes an <em>appealable </em>order. The thrust of Fiumara’s action in the court below is that the Oil Companies had entered into an illegal conspiracy in restraint of trade; even though a copy of a complaint <em>proposed to be filed </em>was attached to the original pleading in this action — which was a petition for a rule to show cause why the Court of Common Pleas did not have exclusive jurisdiction of the action — , up until the time of filing the instant appeal no complaint had ever been filed; after the various efforts of the Oil Companies to remove the action to the Federal Court had been thwarted, then Fiumara presented to the Common Pleas Court his petition for a rule for the award of the costs and disbursements which, allegedly, had been incurred by him in his successful challenge to the Oil Companies’ attempt to remove the action to the Federal Court; at the time of the presentation of such petition, the action in the court below had not even reached the pleading stage.</p>
