Obviously, no individual has a special, as distinguished from the public, interest in this controversy.

Under such unusual and extraordinary circumstances, quo warranto could not be resorted to in order to determine this matter. Moreover, in <em>Mayer v. Hemphill, </em>supra, the majority of this Court refused to pass upon the propriety of an action in equity to determine the existence of a violation of Article X, §10-107(5) of the charter although, because of what it termed “extraordinary circumstances”, it did determine the merits of the litigation.</p>

However, by reason of a later provision contained in §8(1), the <em>“activities </em>or <em>functions </em>[of the county officers were] not changed; they will operate just the same as before and continue to perform their present duties until the next stage of the project is entered upon, which is to accomplish what may be termed the <em>intra </em>city consolidation, that is, the reorganization or ‘streamlining’ of the municipal governmental structure, now enlarged by the acquisition of the former county offices. Since clause (7) of the City-County Consolidation Amendment provides that the county officers are to continue, now as city officers, to perform their duties ‘until the General Assembly shall otherwise provide’, it would seem that any proposed reorganizations, regroupings, abolitions or mergers, of the former county offices, designed the more advantageously to incorporate their functions into the existing municipal structure, must wait upon action by the General Assembly”: <em>Lennox, </em>supra, p. 370.

The mere fact of constitutional classification of district attorney as a “county officer” <em>per se </em>should not be controlling any more than it was in <em>Lennox. </em>It is clear that when the framers of Article XIV, §1 referred to district attorneys as “county officers” they did so in description of the geographical area in which they wrere to perform their functions as opposed to those officers whose functions are performed on a statewide basis.

While this conclusion was based on a reason somewhat distinguishable from the instant case, Lennox does indicate that this Court has on a previous occasion eschewed a literal and insensitive interpretation of the designation ‘county officer’ in Article XIV of the Con<a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>stitution. Moreover, the decision in Lennox is particularly pertinent since we there held that what at first seemed to be the alteration in the character of the offices of prothonotary and register of wills by constitutional language adopted in 1951 had not in fact occurred in light of a careful consideration of the language of Article V, adopted in 1871”.

All officers are either appointed or elected, and the second sentence of the section provides that those appointed, other than judges of the courts of record and the superintendent of public instruction, may be removed at the pleasure of the appointing power. This sentence is not involved in the determination of the question before us, but the last is, for it declares that all officers elected by the people, not within the exceptions, ‘shall be removed by the Governor for reasonable cause, after due notice and full hearing, on the address of two-thirds of the Senate.’ Here is a distinct constitutional expression, and there can be no debate as to the validity of any legislation repugnant to it: Commonwealth v.

Whether the words, ‘all officers elected by the people,’ include officers elected to fill purely statutory offices created by the legislature and by it to be abolished at will is not a question now calling for a decision from us.

Clearly there is but <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>one answer to this. A constitutional direction as to how a thing is to be done is exclusive and prohibitory of any other mode which the legislature may deem better or more convenient.

Of course, it is the de jure holder of that office who is entitled to the emoluments thereof, and whether or not Specter was such had to be resolved as a threshold question. Admittedly, on November 2, 1965, he was elected to the office for a term of four years and continues to hold the office under that mandate. Assuming arguendo, that he is subject to the provisions of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter and has violated §10-107(5) thereof, 1 still cannot see how the finance director of the city has the power or authority to declare Specter has forfeited title to the office and is not still the de jure holder thereof.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Absent such au<a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>thority, any attempt to so declare would have no legal effect.

Mr. Specter filed a complaint in mandamus in the court of common pleas to compel the Finance Director to pay him his salary. The court of common pleas decreed that Specter was entitled to his salary on the basis that he was a State officer and, therefore, not bound by the city charter. The City of Philadelphia appealed.</p>

The reason is that a government official should not use the power and equipment of his present office to harass and badger Ms political opponent through the instrumentality of his present office.

It was obvious that one who would be at the very center of the establishment maintaining law and order had to be an integral part of the city government which was now to have autonomy. Thus, in the constitutional amendment leading to the charter itself, all county officers (and the district attorney’s office was specifically listed as a county officer) were to become city officers. The pioneers and proponents of Home Rule, as men of intelligence and foresight, realized that the district attorney, by the very nature of his office, exercises tremendous influence on public opinion. This influence results particularly from the fact that the district attorney as the overseeing general in the never-ceasing battle against crime and disorder, creates considerable legitimate news and is therefore a focal point of intense public interest. The momentum of his actions is such that even statements made by him on subjects having nothing to do with law enforcement in Philadelphia are accepted and published. A high public duty, therefore, rests on the district attorney to speak facts as they are and not to embellish them with imaginative forays.</p>

It would appear that the district attorney, in presenting his case for either side of the coin, does not restrict himself to the law but advances reasons which should be addressed to a legislative committee contemplating changes in the law, rather than to a Court which is only interpreting what is already written into the law. For instance, Mr. Specter asks rhetorically: “Is it reasonable that the Mayor should be able to use the power of his office to seek reelection, but on the other hand, a holder of another office, no matter how high or low, should not be able to continue in his position while a candidate for Mayor?”</p>

Chief Justice Steen said in the clearest language possible: “Apart from precedents either pro or con, it would be wholly incredible to suppose that the only accomplishment intended by the City-County Consolidation Amendment was the merely puerile one of a change of titles, and that for such a superficial purpose alone two successive legislatures voted upon the amendment and the citizens of the Commonwealth adopted it at a state-wide election! Certainly something more substantial was intended to be wrought by its enactment. Its real and designed result was that, when the <em>former county officers became city officers and the former county employes city employes, they automatically </em>became subject thereby to the laws then in effect governing and regulating <em>city </em>officers and employes, and also, of course, to any such laws as might thereafter become effective.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

By this illustration, he argues that if the prothonotary and the register of wills could be excluded from the City Charter, so can the district attorney. But in his very discussion of this point, Justice Jones destroys the comparison because he points out, and properly so, that the prothonotary and the register of wills receive special mention in the Pennsylvania Constitution apart from the enumeration in <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>Article IV, §1. Justice Jones specifies: “Article V, §7 of the Constitution specifically provided for the office of prothonotary in Philadelphia, his manner of appointment and his authority to appoint assistants, such constitutional status led our Court to conclude that the prothonotary, even though constitutionally designated as a ‘county officer/ did not fall within the City-County Consolidation Amendment and was not converted thereby into a ‘city officer.’ As to the register of wills, also the subject of a special provision in Article Y, §22 of the Constitution, the Court concluded that the register of wills was not, by the amendment, converted into a ‘city officer’ and did not become subject to the charter.”</p>
    <p id="b192-4" data-blocks='[["BL_192.5",192,[211,1125,1159,362]]]'>But there is no provision in the Constitution which specifically refers to the district attorney as the above designated ones apply to the prothonotary and the register of wills.

The sheriff represents the sovereign power of the Commonwealth perhaps even more than the district attorney because he executes the laws of the Commonwealth, whereas the district attorney only prosecutes those who violate the laws.

Thus the plaintiff raises an artificial issue when he says that the City’s answer, if accepted, amounts to removing him from office. I regret to say that my friend Justice Jones, in his opinion, falls into a similar non sequitur. If this Court would decide that Mr. Specter cannot simultaneously be a district attorney and mayoral candidate, he would still, as I have stated, not be removed from office.

In view of what I have stated in this Opinion, I further hold that it is legally immoral for a government official, armed with the unlimited prosecuting powers lodged in the office of District Attorney, to carry on an election campaign against those who are opposed to him politically.</p>
