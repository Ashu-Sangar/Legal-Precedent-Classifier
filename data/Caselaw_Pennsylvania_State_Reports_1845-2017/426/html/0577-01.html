The assessment was $2,566,700; the expert witness for the taxpayers testified to a fair market value of $2,400,000; the Board’s witness testified to an “actual market value” of $4,000,000; and the court below found tile fair market value to be $3,000,000. ' It then reduced this figure to an assessment of $1,320,000 by application of the common level ratio of assessed value to market value for the triennium 1963, 1964 and 1965 of 44%.</p>
