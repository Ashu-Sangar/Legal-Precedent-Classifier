    <p id="b618-8" data-blocks='[["BL_618.12",618,[221,1292,1158,749]]]'>• In this appeal by the Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review of Allegheny County (Board) issues are raised similar to those raised in the appeal of the Board in the case of property owned by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company decided this day. In addition, the Board raises questions concerning additional ratio testimony presented on behalf of the taxpayer. This testimony was based upon appraisals of 320 properties made by the witness, and the ratio arrived at by him tended to confirm the ratio reached by Dr. Raymond Richman and referred to in the <em>Massachusetts Mutual </em>opinion. In any event the court below did not appear to attach particular significance to this separate study.</p>
