    <p id="b405-6" data-blocks='[["BL_405.9",405,[158,873,1151,530]]]'>Alexander was tried for murder and related charges on June 28, 1954.

That petition was dismissed and Alexander then filed this petition for relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act.

He further contends that his convictions should be invalidated because the Judge and the prosecuting attorney took an oath of office.</p>

If his theory of the law and his interpretation of the Federal, and the State Constitution were accepted and his conviction invalidated, it would (as he admits) nullify every criminal conviction ever obtained in the Com<a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>monwealth of Pennsylvania, and would make a mockery of every oath taken by every Judge and every public official from tbe President of the United States to a magistrate.</p>

In that case, the Court said (pp. 506-7, 508) : “Brown contends that his conviction and sentence for second degree murder is void because he was ‘. <em>. . </em>proceeded against, prosecuted and sentenced by a religious establishment. . . .’ He apparently argues that his conviction violates the Federal Constitution [and also the Constitution of Pennsylvania] because the Pennsylvania Constitution [Article VII, §1] permits [or requires] a Judge to take an oath.</p>

In Zorach v. Clauson, <a href="/us/343/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="343 U.S. 306" data-case-ids="11339107" data-case-paths="/us/343/0306-01">343 U.S. 306</a>, 313 (1952), we gave specific recognition to the proposition that '[w]e are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.’ The fact that the Founding Fathers believed devotedly that there was a God and that the unalienable rights of man were rooted in Him is clearly evidenced in their writings, from the Mayflower Compact to the Constitution itself. This background is evidenced today in our public life through the continuance in our oaths of office from the Presidency to the Alderman of the final supplication, 'So help me God.’ Likewise each House of the Congress provides through its Chaplain an opening prayer, and the sessions of this Court are declared open by the crier in a short ceremony, the final phrase of which invokes the grace of God. Again, there are such manifestations in our military forces, where those of our citizens who are under the restrictions of military service wish to engage in voluntary worship. Indeed, only last year an official survey of the country indicated that 64% of our people have church membership, Bureau of the Census, U. S. Department of Commerce, Statistical Abstract of the United States (83d ed. 1962), 48, while less than 3% profess no religion whatever. Id., at p. 46. It can be truly said, therefore, that today, as in the beginning, our national life reflects a religious people who, in the words of Madison, are 'earnestly praying, as ... in duty bound, that the Supreme Lawgiver of the Universe . . . guide them into every measure which may be worthy of his blessing. . . .’”</p>
