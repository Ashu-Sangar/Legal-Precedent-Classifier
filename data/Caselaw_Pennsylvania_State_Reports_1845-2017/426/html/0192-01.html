The quesJ tioning of the witnesses, who testified as to Vivian’s statements, was sufficient to indicate, that evidentiary use of the testimony was being challenged on constitutional grounds, and to place this issue before the court.

It appears that on the fourth day of trial, while Vivian was under examination as a witness, the noonday recess interfered. The trial judge remanded him to the custody of an officer for the recess period, and instructed his counsel that he would not be permitted to see Vivian or discuss the case with him during this time. This ivas error. As pointed out in <em>United States v.

An extensive discussion ensued. The record discloses the court was seriously troubled as to what disposition should follow. Vivian had been furloughed from a mental institution as an out-going patient only a short time before the crimes involved were committed. There was also a detainer on file from another county. A report of a neuro-psychiatric examination of Vivian given to the court was not <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>clear. Another immediate psychiatric examination was. directed, and the court then stated he would release Vivian for two weeks, at the end of which time he wanted, inter alia, a report from the psychiatrist, and a specific recommendation as to whether or not probation should continue. He then placed Vivian on probation for a period of five years in the case arising out of indictment No. 667, and on one year’s probation in each case arising out of indictments Nos. 712, 751, 752 and 754.

In the interim the trial judge had received reports from a psychiatrist and from the Director of the Forensic Psychiatric Clinic at Temple University, each of whom had examined Vivian after February 14th. Therein it was stated that an effective period of vocational training was needed if rehabilitation were to be accomplished, and probation was strongly opposed. After a consideration of these findings, the court then sentenced Vivian to imprisonment for a term of one to four years on indictment No. 667, and six months to one and one-half years on indictments Nos. 712, 751, 752 and 754, the sentences to run consecutively.</p>

United, States, </em><a href="/us/168/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="168 U.S. 532" data-case-ids="6141481" data-case-paths="/us/168/0532-01">168 U.S. 532</a>, at 541 (1897). For an informative, compact treatment of the historical development and apparent underpinnings of the rule, see Recent Developments, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%20563" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="65 Mich. L. Rev. 563">65 Mich. L. Rev. 563</a> (1967). The above article states that any of three separate rationales may constitute the logical basis for the rule. Thus, the use of an inadmissible confession requires automatic reversal regardless of the existence of ample admissible evidence because: (1) It is impossible to accurately measure what impact the confession had on the jury. <em>Payne v. Arkansas, </em><a href="/us/356/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="356 U.S. 560" data-case-ids="6164736" data-case-paths="/us/356/0560-01">356 U.S. 560</a>, 567-568 (1958); or, (2) The defendant has been deprived of a constitutional right. <em>Miranda v.
