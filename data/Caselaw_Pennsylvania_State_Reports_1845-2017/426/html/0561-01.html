Dixon as office manager .of Lawrence Copper &amp; Bronze Co., a Pennsylvania corporation. Some time daring October, 1958 Dixon sold this concern, although Mrs. Hoover. continued to be employed in a similar capacity by the successor company. Dixon died on September 10, 1963; his will was admitted to probate on September 18, 1963, and letters testamentary were advertised for the first time on September 19, 1963. The first and final account of the executors of Dixon’s estate was filed on December 14, 1964. Appellant then filed exceptions to this accounting on the ground that the- account failed to include $25,000 owed to her under an oral contract with Dixon. This sum was allegedly due for services rendered in connection with the sale of Lawrence Copper — according to appellant, Dixon promised to pay her a commission of 10 per cent of the purchase price if she was able to obtain a purchaser for the business.</p>

      <em>Miller </em>did not involve an allegation that the six-year statute of limitations for contract claims had run. Instead, the case was concerned with the Act of August 17, 1951, P. L. 1258, §3, as amended, 20 P.S. §320.732 (Supp. 1966) which provides that an executor who distributes assets more than one year after the letters of administration have been advertised is not personally liable to a creditor of the estate who did not give notice of his claim during that year. Neither the statute involved in <em>Miller, </em>nor the cases holding that under certain peculiar circumstances an executor having personal knowledge of a claim cannot avoid paying it by invoking this statute, has any relevance to the present situation where no distribution of assets has yet been made and the claim itself is barred because it was not brought within the period fixed by the six-year statute. We have frequently said, and reiterated in <em>Miller, </em>that: “ 'Knowledge by a fiduciary of the existence of a contingent claim does not relieve the presumptive creditor of the duty to give notice thereof under the Fiduciaries Act of 1917.’ ” <em>Miller v.

This conclusion is reinforced by the' rule that, absent a contrary intention expressed by the parties, a real estate broker becomes entitled to his commission when he obtains a purchaser who is ready, willing 'and able to contract.
