This tax is levied upon ‘carrying on . . . within a school district. . . any trade [or] business . . . or making sales to persons within such school district’ and is measured by receipts ‘received in or allocable to a school district ... by reason of any sale made’ in the school district. ‘Business’ is defined as: ‘Carrying on or exercising for gain or profit within a school district of the first class, any trade, business, including financial business as hereinafter defined, profession, vocation, or commercial activity, or making sales to persons within such school district’. (Section 1, 24 P.S. §584.1). ‘Receipts’ are defined as: ‘Cash, credits, property of any kind or nature, received in or allocable to a school district of the first class from any business or by reason of any sale made ... or services rendered or commercial or business transaction had within a school district of the first class’. (Section 1, 24 P.S. §584.1). ... The Act of 1949, supra, authorizes a school district of the first class to levy and collect an annual tax, in addition to any other school tax, for general public school purposes. Such annual tax is authorized to be levied on every ‘person [including a corporation] engaging in any business in any school district of the first class’ and the tax is measured by the annual receipts realized from the business. Section 1 clearly defines what the legislature meant both by ‘business’ and ‘receipts’ from business. To come within the legislative language the activity considered to be ‘business’ must (a) be carried on or exercised within the school district’s territorial limits and (b) include any trade, business, profession, vocation or commercial activity or making sales to persons within the district. The legislature has defined ‘business’ in broad and comprehensive language. ‘Receipts’ includes ‘cash, credits, property of any kind or nature’ if received in or allocable to the school dis<a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>trict: the source of such receipts may be any business, sales made, services rendered or commercial business transactions if the situs of such activity was within the school district.” (pp. 459-80, 462-63) In <em>Alan Wood, </em>we further said (pp. 464-66) : “An analysis of the statute indicates that liability for the general business tax attaches only if the taxpayer is carrying on or engaging in business or a commercial activity within the school district. First, what constitutes carrying on or engaging in business or a commercial activity? The landmark decision in this area of law is Shambe v. Delaware &amp; Hudson R.R. Co., <a href="/pa/288/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="288 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="1100767" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0240-01">288 Pa. 240</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=135%20A.%20755" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="135 A. 755">135 A. 755</a> (1927) which enunciated the so-called ‘solicitation plus’ doctrine and held that the presence of an office in Philadelphia plus the solicitation of freight business by employees working out of such office did not constitute ‘doing business’ in Philadelphia. In Lutz v. Foster &amp; Kester Co., Inc., <a href="/pa/367/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="367 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1228382" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0125-01">367 Pa. 125</a>, 129-130, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20A.2d%20222" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="79 A.2d 222">79 A. 2d 222</a> (1951), we reaffirmed the Shambe doctrine and stated: ‘There must be “other activities” in addition to the solicitation of business to make a foreign corporation’s conduct the doing of business. . . . Such “other activities” do not consist of acts of courtesy performed by business solicitors, without complusion, in order to satisfy or accommodate customers. Nor do they reside in the number of solicitors employed or the character and extent of the facilities provided them for carrying on their solicitations such as office space and office equipment of desks, typewriters, filing equipment and telephones, or in the identification of the company or its representatives emblazoned on the office door or printed in the telephone directory. The criterion is, rather, whether the local solicitors have authority to bind the foreign corporation by which they are employed. . . . The orders obtained by the defendant’s solicitors were not binding on the company until they <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>were received and accepted by it at its home office in Bridgeport, Connecticut.’</p>
    <p id="b122-4" data-blocks='[["BL_122.5",122,[239,484,1161,599]]]'>“. . . A review of the applicable case law would indicate that the ‘carrying on or engaging in business’ set forth in the statutory law contemplates activities which involve more than a mere presence of an office and a solicitation therefrom of business or courtesy calls on customers. ‘Doing business’ requires proof that the taxpayer was actually effecting sales of its products and performing acts regularly and continuously which, in a direct as opposed to an incidental manner, effects the taxpayer’s corporate objects (Shambe, supra, p. 247).”</p>

The School District maintains that Cyanamid is taxable because it “has its registered address in Philadelphia,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> has some of its sales representatives living in Philadelphia, has a Philadelphia telephone number listed in the Philadelphia telephone directories and has many sales representatives carrying on vigorous sales campaigns among physicians, hospitals, and merchants in Philadelphia on a regular, continuous and systematic basis, and in fact sells substantial quantities of its merchandise to its customers <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>in Philadelphia.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Onr examination of the present record indicates that many of the so-called “facts” upon which the School District relies are either nonexistent of record or highly exaggerated.</p>

It requires no citation of authority to refute the School District’s argument that simply because some of Cyanamid’s personnel maintained their individual residences in Philadelphia that such fact would render Cyanamid liable for this tax. Nor is the fact that Cyanamid’s Fort Washington office is listed in the Philadelphia telephone directory significant. See: <em>Lutz v. Foster &amp; Kester Co., Inc., </em><a href="/pa/367/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="367 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1228382" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0125-01">367 Pa. 125</a>, 129, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20A.2d%20222" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="79 A.2d 222">79 A. 2d 222</a> (1951). That Cyanamid has personnel who promote, even on a “regular, continuous and systematic basis”, its products in Philadelphia simply amounts to “solicitation” which is not sufficient to equate engagement in business or commercial activity requisite under the statute for the imposition of the tax. See: <em>Shambe, </em>supra, p. <em>244; New v.

Moreover, the fact that Philadelphia customers order and purchase Cyanamid’s products in substantial quantities does not in itself satisfy the statutory requirement. The School District’s so-called “facts”, standing alone or viewed in their entirety, do not render Cyanamid liable for this tax.</p>

Cyanamid maintains no facility or office of any kind in the School District area. Its personnel calling upon Philadelphia customers, actual or potential, lack any authority whatsoever to effect sales. There is no proof of record that any sales of Cyanamid’s products are made in Philadelphia and, on the con-, trary, the record indicates that all sales are effected outside Philadelphia. All that this record portrays is that Philadelphia customers order and use Cyanamid’s products and that some of Cyanamid’s personnel promote the sales of Cyanamid’s products within the School District area. In such a factual situation, the School District has failed to prove such engagement in business or commercial activity within the statutory language as to make receipts from sales to Philadelphia customers subject to the general business tax.</p>

Philadelphia School District, </em><a href="/pa/425/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="425 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1906713" data-case-paths="/pa/425/0455-01">425 Pa. 455</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=229%20A.2d%20881" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="229 A.2d 881">229 A. 2d 881</a> (1967), decided only a few weeks earlier. I dissented in <em>Alan Wood </em>and believe that American Cyanamid is also engaged in “commercial activity, or making sales to persons within such school district of the first class.” General Business Tax Act of May 23, 1949, P. L. 1669, as amended, 24 P.S. §584.1. As the majority point out each case must be decided on its own facts. Thus, as in <em>Alan Wood, </em>I am content to rely upon an excerpt from the opinion of the court below which, in my view, amply demonstrates that appellant’s commercial contacts with the City were not insubstantial: “American Cyanamid is a Maine <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>corporation duly qualified to do business in Pennsylvania and having registered office at 123 South Broad Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Eighty to ninety percent of the products delivered to customers of American Cyanamid in Philadelphia are shipped from the warehouse in Fort Washington, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The branch office and warehouse there has a Philadelphia telephone number and is listed in the Philadelphia directories; it has some 19 sales representatives, 3 of whom reside in Philadelphia; they regularly call upon various businesses, professional men, druggists and others to promote the sale of the products of American Cyanamid. The prices for the products, terms of sale, allowance and ultimate acceptance or rejection of the orders is determined by the Fort Washington office. The representatives who call on the various businesses, hospitals, physicians, institutions and druggists, solicit and sometimes write orders, record complaints, answer inquiries and leave literature. For the years in question the receipts derived from customers located in Philadelphia range between approximately $1,400,000 to $2,000,000 per year.”</p>
