    <p id="b138-9" data-blocks='[["BL_138.15",138,[216,1384,1160,212]]]'>The question involved in this appeal is whether Lucille Schede Brooks validly and effectively exercised the <em>special </em>power of appointment given her by Albert W. Schede, her first husband.</p>
    <p id="b138-10" data-blocks='[["BL_138.16",138,[214,1602,1159,536]]]'>Schede died June 1, 1957 leaving a last Will dated April 11, 1953. In his Will he created two trusts which were primarily for the benefit of his wife Lucille, — one a so-called marital deduction trust and the other a residuary trust. This appeal involves only “the marital deduction trust.” In this trust, testator gave Lucille all of the net income for her life and the right and power to withdraw principal not exceeding $5,000 annually.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> He then pertinently provided in Paragraph Fourth (d) :</p>

      <em> </em>and upon her failure so to do, the trust shall continue and shall be divided into two separate trusts hereinafter referred to as Trust A and Trust B.”</p>
    <p id="b139-5" data-blocks='[["BL_139.5",139,[147,741,1152,478]]]'>After Schede’s death, Lucille married Bernard F. Brooks, the present appellant. Lucille died May 4, 1965 leaving a substantial estate of her own. In her Will she pertinently provided: “Fourth: I give, devise and bequeath all of the rest, residue and remainder of my property, both real and personal of every kind and nature <em>and of which I may have a power of appointment </em>to my husband, Bernard F. Brooks absolutely and forever.</p>
    <p id="b139-6" data-blocks='[["BL_139.6",139,[148,1232,1151,372]]]'>“Fifth : In the event that my husband, Bernard F.

    <p id="b139-7" data-blocks='[["BL_139.7",139,[149,1615,1149,142]]]'>It will, of course, be instantly noted that in her appointment she did not specifically refer to Schede’s will.</p>

Judge Saylor, the auditing Judge, filed an able adjudication in which he rejected Brooks’ claim, and exceptions to that adjudication were dismissed by the Court en banc in a unanimous and able Opinion written by President Judge Klein. From the final Decree of the Orphans’ Court, Brooks took this appeal.</p>

      <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>Appellant contends (1) that Lucille exercised the special power which Schede gave her by the <em>broad </em>language of her above-quoted residuary gift, in which she gave to her husband, Brooks, “all of the rest, residue and remainder of my property ... of every kind and nature and of which I may have a power of appointment.” Appellant further contends (2) that her intention to exercise the special power of appointment which Schede gave her was further evidenced by the stipulation of the parties that (a) when Lucille executed her Will, she knew she had a power of appointment under Schede’s will and no other power of appointment, and (b) that her gift of property of every kind of which she may have a power of appointment would have no operative effect except as an execution of the power which Schede gave her.</p>
    <p id="b140-5" data-blocks='[["BL_140.5",140,[215,1230,1158,426]]]'>Appellant concedes, and correctly so, (1) that the power given Lucille was a special and not a general power of appointment, and (2) that §14(14) of the Wills Act of April 24, 1947, P.

That means that the appointing instrument must specifically refer in the instant case to the power which was granted by Schede’s will and which Lucille seeks to exercise and execute. A general residuary clause, even if and when it included the words, “I hereby exercise every power of appointment which I possess,” would not and does not comply with and fulfill the donor’s condition and is not a valid exercise of the special power of appointment granted to Lucille. <em>Windolph </em>
