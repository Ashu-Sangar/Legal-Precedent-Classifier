After a trial, the jury rendered a verdict against the insurance carrier. A motion for a new trial having been refused, judgment was entered on the verdict and from that judgment the instant appeal was taken.</p>

    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.5",552,[212,1021,1160,1185]]]'>Many years ago, Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Gibson in <em>Wolf v. Carothers, 3 </em>S. &amp; R. 240, 242 (1817), said: <em>“To exclude </em>a witness, it is necessary that he should have a vested interest, not in the question, but in the event of the suit. It must be an interest, that the judgment in the cause would operate upon; for if by the event, he would neither acquire or lose a right, nor incur a responsibility, which the law recognizes, he is competent. Every other kind of interest goes to credibility.” Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Stern somewhat narrowed the definition of “adverse interest” in <em>Billow v. Billow, </em><a href="/pa/360/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="360 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="475044" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0343-01">360 Pa. 343</a>, 347, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.2d%20817" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="61 A.2d 817">61 A. 2d 817</a> (1948), when he stated: “Moreover, the adverse interest upon which disqualification depends must be <em>in the immediate result of the particular suit and not in its effect on other possible actions or circumstances; </em>remote considerations, such as a possible right of indemnity or contribution under which a witness might have an adverse interest, are not to be considered if his interest is not adverse so far as the suit is concerned in which his testimony is given: [citing authorities].” (Emphasis added).</p>

Regardless of his present condition of insolvency, we must face the fact that the unpaid judgment will be an obstacle in his path toward any possible future solvency and will affect him in various, ways, perhaps precluding his securing a license to operate a motor vehicle and deterring him from securing a remunerative livelihood. It appears to us clear, that, if this judgment were to be paid by the insurance carrier, Collins would have a vital interest in that result and to that extent certainly his interest would be “adverse” to that of the insurance carrier. As we read our case law we cannot find such “adverse interest” to be remote or contingent; common sense teaches us that Collins would be greatly interested in unloading the burden of this judgment from himself and placing it on the insurance carrier. In our view, Collins’ interest was “adverse” to the insurance carrier and the latter should have been permitted to call him as on cross-examination; in not permitting the insurance carrier to do so, the court below erred.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The insurance carrier contends that, because Collins was not called as on cross-examination, it was prejudiced because (a) it could not “lead” the witness in its examination (See: <em>Rogan Estate, </em>supra, pp. 214, 215) and (b) it was deprived of the tactical advantage of “pointing out to the jury that, the witness had an adverse interest”. Such contentions lack substantial merit. Collins did have an “adverse interest” and the trial court did err in refusing the insurance carrier the opportunity to call him as on cross-examination; however, the instant record does not demonstrate any such prejudice arising from this error as justifies the grant of a new trial.</p>

Not only can I find <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>no case law whatsoever to indicate that a separate, specific finding of prejudice need be shown to grant a new trial in a case such as this (nor are any cases so holding cited by the majority or by the appellee in its brief), but furthermore, even assuming arguendo that specific prejudice need be shown, I fail to see how the facts of this case do not <em>amply </em>demonstrate its presence.</p>

The jury was asked to decide whether Collins operated Mrs. McKirdy’s car with her permission at the time of the accident. Since a finding of permission effectively absolves Collins of liability for the accident, quite naturally Collins was only too pleased to testify that he drove the car with Mrs. McKirdy’s blessings. This fact, when coupled with the trial judge’s refusal to allow the insurance company to call Collins as on cross, resulted in a trial record which all but mocks the adversary system.</p>
