Chalfiu, a candidate for Controller on the Democratic ticket and a taxpayer, against (1) Arlen Specter, the present District Attorney of Philadelphia and the candidate for Mayor on the Republican ticket, and (2) the City Commissioners and other City officers. The Complaint prayed for an injunction (1) enjoining the City Commissioners from placing the name of Specter on the ballot as a candidate for Mayor in the Philadelphia municipal election on November 7, 1967, and (2) to restrain defendants from making any payments pertaining in any way to the candidacy of Specter for the office of Mayor, and (3) enjoining Specter from remaining as a candidate for Mayor unless he forthwith resigns the office of District Attorney, and (4) such further general relief as may be just and proper under the circumstances. This - suit was not brought before July 28, 1967 as in fairness it should have been. The Court below, on August 31, 1967, sustained defendant Arlen Specter’s preliminary objection to the Complaint in Equity and dismissed plaintiff’s complaint. This was a final and therefore an appealable Order.</p>

So considered, and most important, he stated that under the clear and mandatory language of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, <em>Specter was a City officer </em>and not a State officer, and- was subject to the provisions of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter. Justice Musmanno agreed on this point with the Chief Justice. Justice Cohen was absent, because of illness. This meant that a majority of the Judges (three Judges of this Court and the Court below) believed and held that Specter was a State officer and could be a candidate for Mayor without resigning as District Attorney, while three Judges of this Court believed that Specter was a City officer and was subject to the City Charter.</p>

Kelly, Jr.’s name must remain on the ballot as a candidate for Councilman at large in the November 1967 municipal election — was doubt,- uncertainty and bewildering confusion.

Moreover, it is important to further note that while his term of office and his salary are fixed by the Legislature (1) the District Attorney of Philadelphia (a) is elected, and (b) is paid — not by the Commonwealth but — by the people of Philadelphia, and (2) the District Attorney of Philadelphia is <em>elected in municipal </em>instead of in State-wide elections, and (3) the essential and principal and most important powers, functions, duties, limitations and boundaries of the District Attorney of Philadelphia involve only crimes committed — not throughout the Commonwealth but — only in the City of Philadelphia.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">*</a>

One of the important questions, nevertheless, is — since Specter is a City officer, can these penalties be waived? Moreover, there is the additional very important fact that, according to the uncontradicted averments of the City Commissioners, the printing of ballots and the setting up of ballot machinery -must commence on September 26, 1967.

Section 977 of the 1937 Pennsylvania Election Code, 25 P.S. §2937, provides that all nomination petitions and papers shall be deemed valid unless objected to within seven days after the last day for filing. Arlen Specter filed his petition on March 7, 1967. As of March 14, 1967, nary an objection had been heard. Now, more than six months later, appellant stands be-, fore this Court, in equity, and seeks to enjoin Arlen Specter from running for mayor of Philadelphia unless he first resigns his office of district attorney. Thus, the issue is. framed: is §977 of the Pennsylvania <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>Election Code the <em>sole </em>and <em>exclusive </em>remedy for challenging a person’s right to run for political office in Pennsylvania?

The office of district attorney is a <em>state </em>office; Arlen Specter is a <em>state </em>officer. In <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Specter v.

Finally, as late as July 3, 1967, in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Specter v. Martin, </em><a href="/pa/426/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="426 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1908548" data-case-paths="/pa/426/0102-01">426 Pa. 102</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=232%20A.2d%20729" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="232 A.2d 729">232 A. 2d 729</a> (1967), the district attorney was successful in a mandamus action to compel payment of his salary, <em>again, </em>because he was not a city officer and was not governed by the Philadelphia Home Eule Charter. Attempts have been made to undercut the holding in <em>Martin </em>by noting that only three Justices on the six member Court actually held Specter to be a state officer, a fourth concurring on the theory that Specter was entitled to be paid because he was at least a <em>de facto </em>district attorney. Two Justices dissented. To say that the mathematics of <em>Martin </em>prove that this Court did not really hold Spec<a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>ter to be a state officer is merely self deluding.

        <em> </em>Much has been made of the fact that §976 of the Pennsylvania Election Code, 25 P.S. §2936, speaks only of technical defects in nomination papers and petitions which are patent on their face.

Not only does <em>J aspan </em>itself prove that such is not the ease (Kelly’s alleged defect was his residence; it was certainly not patent), but the language of 977 shows, without doubt, that it was not intended to cover only the defects enumerated in §976. Section 977 recites that “if the court shall find that said nomination petition or paper is defective under the provisions of section 976 .. . <em>or was not filed by persons entitled to file the same, </em>it shall be set aside.” (Emphasis supplied.) The last phrase is a clear legislative “catch-all” designed precisely for attacks such as could have been made in <em>Jaspan </em>and should be <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>made here.

Who can doubt that his staff is working in some form or another to advance that candidacy? Who can doubt that he has merged his official functions and duties as district attorney with that of his status as a candidate for mayor? Who can doubt that he intimidates his political foes with implied threats of harassing investigations, possible arrests and resulting freedom of movement? All, of course, in direct violation of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, the law as heretofore laid down by this Court, the law as declared, even in this decision of today, by a majority of the Court, and, above all, in ignominious desecration of the highest principle of American conduct, fair play.</p>

The founders of the City Charter cannot help but be considerably distressed to see their Magna Charta of Philadelphia’s liberties being used as an engine of political intimidation. Daily the district attorney appears on the political warpath, daily he fulminates against his. political opponents, daily he uses the tremendous powers of his investigating forces to frighten those who might support his political adversary.</p>

The framers of the Philadelphia Charter fore<a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>saw all this and declared in language that four members of this Court recognize, namely, that a district attorney may not merge an active campaign for an office other than that of district attorney and still remain as district attorney. Richardson Dilworth recognized this principle when he was a district attorney and became a candidate for office. He recognized this principle when as mayor he decided to become a candidate for governor; Arlen Specter recognized this principle in November, 1966, when he proclaimed to the world that he was- a city officer under the City Charter, but he denounced this honorable principle when his ambitions took him into a candidacy for mayor, and his mendacious trip to Montreal. He is entitled, of course, to further his ambitions and it would not disturb me to see a person in any position other than district attorney campaigning for office, but the district attorney’s office is distinctly one of prosecution and, when prosecution, or threat of prosecution, is linked with an attack on the district attorney’s political foes, the prosecution becomes persecution, which has no place on the sunlit field of fair and honorable political conflict.</p>

Then four members of a 7-Judge Court solemnly declare that the Charter must <em>not </em>be obeyed.

There can be no denial that a judge sometimes, because of opinions he has written or-because of his life’s philosophy which is well-known, evinces a certain predilection on which lawyers calculate. For instance, analysts are constantly endeavoring to predict decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States on the basis of what its judges have previously said. But in this case, the predilections, philosophy and attitude on the law by the Chief Justice have been expressed in two opinions, not of year's ago but practically of yesterday. Indeed, even today the Chief Justice affirms that interpretation of the law. The Chief Justice, in effect, laid down the law of the case in this litigation. And yet, in spite, of these solemn confirmations, the Chief Justice orders that his own proclaimed law must not be obeyed!" This character of arbitrary ordering can only lead to disorganization, dismay and eventual disappearance of respect for law, and when that happens, the' downfall of our democratic institutions is threatened. • :</p>
