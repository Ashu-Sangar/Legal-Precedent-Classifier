In deciding that the <em>Radio &amp; Television </em>dispute was not shown by the employer to be “one of those which the Board will decline to hear”, the Court used, as its measuring rod, the <em>previously </em>announced figure of $100,000 in gross receipts given by the N.L.R.B. as the required jurisdictional amount in cases involving radio1 stations.

First, it is contended that the Stryjewskis employ only their son and that the National Labor Relations Act itself declares that one is not an employee if <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>be works for his parents.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> Thus it follows that since the Stryjewskis have no employees, the federal statute does not even apply to them and of course the federal agency will not take jurisdiction. In a footnote tins trial court opinion states however, that the Stryjewskis do in fact have other employees. This is simply not substantiated by the record. Nowhere in the 200 pages of testimony is there the slightest scintilla of evidence that anyone works for the Stryjewskis other than their son. That another son and a brother-in-law have occasionally helped out on weekends for a few hours and for no pay certainly cannot support a finding that the Stryjewskis had employees within the meaning of the act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_6" id="ref_footnote_3_6">6</a>

This addition process is indeed consistent with board policy, but only when a <em>secondary </em>boycott is involved. See <em>Hattiesburg Building and Trades Council v. Broome, </em><a href="/us/377/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="377 U.S. 126" data-case-ids="6165644" data-case-paths="/us/377/0258-01">377 U.S. 126</a>, <a href="/us/377/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="377 U.S. 126" data-case-ids="6165644" data-case-paths="/us/377/0258-01">84 S. Ct. 1156</a> (1964) and cases cited therein. Appellee’s contention notwithstanding, there simply is no secondary boycott present here. Admittedly, on May 15, 1967 a federal-preliminary injunction was issued restraining the union from forcing the importing distributors to cease doing business with several domestic distributors, one of whom was the present appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_7" id="ref_footnote_3_7">7</a> However, not only was this injunction dissolved pursuant to the N.L.R.B.’s letter of May 23, 1967 in which the board declared that none of the picketing was unlawful as secondary, but also the trial record below is devoid of any evidence that there was picketing at the importer’s place of business in the present dispute. It is the nature of a secondary boycott that pressure is put upon one employer to cease trading with another employer with whom the union has its primary dispute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_8" id="ref_footnote_3_8">8</a> Clearly under these circumstances it is quite reasonable for the N.L.R.B. to look to both employers’ gross receipts for jurisdictional purposes. However, the only picketing complained of by the Stryjewskis occurred at <em>their </em>place <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>of business. If the result of the picketing was a refusal by the importer’s drivers to cross the picket line, thus preventing the Stryjewskis from transacting business with the importing distributors, this alone cannot support the conclusion that a secondary boycott was involved. Since, absent the presence of a secondary boycott, the trial court’s determination of gross receipts was clear error, it should not have declined jurisdiction on that ground.</p>

Of course I agree with the majority that even under their reading of section 14(c) the case can now be heard below since the N.L.R.B. in fact declined jurisdiction on the day of oral argument before this Court.

The language of 14(e) creates a procedure whereby the board may decline to hear cases over which it <em>could </em>take jurisdiction. However, the letter from the board to the Stryjewskis states that “Tacony is not an employer within the meaning of the Act,” and that “[tjherefore, any picketing directed at Tacony by the Respondent, Local 830, or any other labor organization would not be encompassed by Section 8(b)(7)(C) of the Act.” Such language can certainly be read to mean more than a mere refusal to hear a case pursuant to 14(c). It might very well mean that the board <em>could not </em>hear this case even if it wanted to. In such a situation, assuming that a state court can read the definition section of the Act as easily as the board can, there would certainly be no need to wait for the board to say “no” before we can say “yes.”</p>
