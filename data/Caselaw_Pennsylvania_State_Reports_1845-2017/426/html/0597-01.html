Rule 1035(b) governing summary judgments, effective May 9, 1966 and applicable to actions pending at that time, adopts verbatim the following sentence from Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: “The judgment sought shall be rendered ... if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>judgment as a matter of law.” The appellee moved for summary judgment under Rule 1035 and was successful in the court below, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. I believe that summary judgment should not have been granted.</p>
    <p id="b642-5" data-blocks='[["BL_642.5",642,[217,659,1158,690]]]'>Appellant’s complaint alleged that on September 8, 1962, at approximately 11:50 p.m., appellee Robert Witlin parked a 1961 Chevrolet on 21st Street between St. James Street and Locust Street. The automobile, which Witlin had leased from appellee Modern Auto Leasing Corp., was allegedly driven by one Carr in a negligent manner striking appellant’s decedent. Appellees Witlin and Modern Auto filed an answer denying that the automobile had been left unlocked with the ignition in a position to be activated without a key and also denying that Witlin was the agent of Modern Auto. Both appellees then moved for summary judgment.</p>

Since our Buie 1035(b) is identical to Federal Buie 56(c), reference to federal cases is certainly appropriate; and, in this instance, these eases are persuasive. Not only does the language of Buie 1035(b) dictate a holding that the affidavits alone may raise a genuine issue of material fact, but also to deprive a party of a right to trial where it is obvious that a good cause of action can be stated.would not be productive of substantial justice.
