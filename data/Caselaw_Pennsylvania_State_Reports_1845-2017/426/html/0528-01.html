On May 12, 1966, the executors of the Estate of N. L. Morell petitioned the Orphans’ Court of Lehigh County for a citation, which was awarded on the 16th, to show cause why the election of Angelina Morell should not be vacated; on June 15 appellant filed her answer to this citation.</p>
    <p id="b574-5" data-blocks='[["BL_574.5",574,[205,804,1159,426]]]'>In the interim, on June 14, appellant commenced an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania wherein she sought to have herself declared the lawful wife of the decedent, thereby establishing her right to participate in the decedent’s estate.

    <p id="b574-6" data-blocks='[["BL_574.6",574,[207,1239,1158,1020]]]'>On September 7, 1966, appellant filed a motion in the Orphans’ Court of Lehigh County to strike from the hearing list the executor’s citation to show cause why her election should not be vacated. In support of this motion appellant argued that the federal district court had, by reason of her commencing a suit therein, <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction to determine her relationship to the decedent. The following day, the Orphans’ Court of Lehigh County determined that it had jurisdiction over both the subject matter and the requisite individuals. It then proceeded to consider the show cause citation on its merits. Cathryn Morell testified that she had married the decedent on August 13, 1961 and introduced a certificate of marriage to that effect. Angelina Morell, through her attorneys, declined to proceed further in the hearing on the grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction. On September 9, the court below ordered appellant’s election vacated and set aside. This appeal followed.</p>

However, it seems appropriate to point out that counsel for the plaintiff may be proceeding on the erroneous assumption that the filing of the present action was tantamount to removal of the state court proceeding to this court. Obviously, it was not; and there would seem to be no conceivable basis for the assertion that plaintiff’s failure to present evidence in support of her alleged status, in the state court proceedings, was occasioned by lack of jurisdiction in that court. In. light of this observation, and upon further contemplating the possible effects of res adjudicata when the state court <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>proceeding is finally concluded, counsel may wish to consider the advisability of seeking a further opportunity to. present evidence in the state court litigation.”</p>

She maintains that her only voluntary contact with them was the filing of her election to take against the will of the decedent; because such notice is required under Pennsylvania law before she could legally participate in the distribution of the estate, it was likewise a necessary prerequisite to the establishment of her claim in federal court, but Pennsylvania could not by this requirement deprive her of her right to a federal forum.</p>
    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.6",576,[191,1337,1160,535]]]'>To begin with, appellant is wrong about her basic assumption. Whatever the effect of her notice to take against the will, her decision to answer on the merits the citation issued on May 16, rather than file preliminary objections as required by Pa. R. C.
