Eugene Vanderpool (relator), on October 10, 1965, enlisted the services, of various police officers, including members of the Pennsylvania State Police, in a search for his wife, Veronica Vanderpool, whom he claimed was missing. On October 12, 1965, relator and one Robert White, his brother-in-law, called upon Corporal Edward Bloomer, a member of the' Pennsylvania State Police who was in charge of organizing the search parties for Veronica Vanderpool, and it was then decided that Bloomer and the relator would go to the bus' station in- Towanda to- inquire into the possibility that the missing wife had departed the area by bus. Upon arrival at the bus station, relator was told by Bloomer that he knew something was bothering relator, that he knew relator was not telling everything he knew and that he was sending for a lie detector.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> There are two versions of that which then transpired: relator’s version is that he then said. “I shot my wife. I was scared and buried her.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Bloomer’s version is that relator then said “You won’t believe this, but I shot and killed my wife .and buried her behind the house”.</p>

Prior to interrogation by tlie district attorney, relator was warned of Ills right to remain silent. Relator contends' that, after he had told Bloomer that he had killed lii's wife, he was questioned by Bloomer without being advised of his constitutional rights. Between 6.30 and 7:0Q p.m. on the same date, relator and several police officers went to the home of relator’s foster parents where the wife’s body was found buried. Relator was then charged with murder, arraigned before a justice of the-peace and.no further interrogation took place. On October 19, 1965, the court appointed competent and experienced counsel for tlie relator and he was given a preliminary hearing on October 22, 1965. Relator’s counsel then petitioned the court to have relator taken to Clark Summit Hospital for thirty days for the purpose of observation, diagnosis and treatment which petition was granted.</p>

At no time has there been any denial by the [relator] that he made such a statement and that it was spontaneously made. No objection was made at trial to the testimony of the state policeman concerning the alleged statement by the [relator] nor were there any proceedings of any kind prior to trial relating to any objection to testimony or evidence to be presented at-trial.” We have recently held in <em>Commonwealth v.
