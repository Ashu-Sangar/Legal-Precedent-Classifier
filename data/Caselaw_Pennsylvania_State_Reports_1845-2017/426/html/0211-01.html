In August 1961, written notice of the impending closing was given to each employee and, soon thereafter, the plant was officially closed. At the time of the notice, there were approximately forty-four production employees in the unit represented by the United Brick and Clay Workers of America, AFL-CIO, Local Union No. 448 (Local), who would be affected by the plant closing. Previous to the closing, Narco, in consultation with officials of Local, unilaterally promulgated a written list of procedures relating to the transfer of the affected Lumber City employees to a similar Narco plant in Curwensville, Pennsylvania. These procedures proved unsatisfactory to Local.</p>

After the 1964 Agreement was effectuated, no former Lumber City employees were among those subsequently hired at Curwensville, even though such employees made application for available work. Narco’s position was that the 1964 Agreement abrogated the 1962 Agreement and relieved it of any preferential hiring obligation towards the former Lumber City employees. Local asserted that these new hires violated the contract rights of the Lumber City men and filed a grievance pursuant to the procedure established by the 1964 Agreement. Dean Thomas F. Quinn was agreed upon as Arbitrator and the following issue submitted to him: “Can the Company be required to employ former Lumber City employees at the Curwensville, Pennsylvania plant?”</p>

The dissatisfied employees then filed an action in equity, through union-retained counsel, requesting, in the alternative, compulsory arbitration of the grievances or damages for breach of contract. Narco filed an answer which asserted, inter alia, that the matter complained of had been conclusively decided by the Arbitrator in the <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>above submission. Narco then filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the action was “an appeal” from the Arbitrator’s decision and was forbidden by the Arbitration Act of 1927. (Act of April 25, 1927, P. L. 381, 5 P.S. §161).

The submission became solely for the purpose of determining which of the two extant preferential hiring agreements controlled the rights of the Lumber City employees. It went no further: After the Arbitrator decided the latter question, he specifically recognized his inability to take cognizance of the merits of any actual disputes arising under the 1962 Agreement<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> because of the explicit ban on arbitration contained therein. Thus the Arbitrator’s task was limited to a determination of the abstract, theoretical rights adhering to the Lumber City employees by virtue of whatever preferential hiring provision controlled. We do not agree with the court below then, that the appellants are foreclosed from <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>even attempting to seek any judicial relief because of the Arbitrator’s Award.</p>
    <p id="b261-5" data-blocks='[["BL_261.5",261,[150,471,1154,928]]]'>We next turn to Narco’s contention that, regardless of what effect is given to the Arbitrator’s Award here, the appellants have no right to press a claim under the 1962 Agreement because that Agreement provided an exclusive remedy for settling any dispute arising thereunder, i.e., “discussion” between Narco and the Union.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The question really comes down to whether the parties intended the “discussion” remedy to be a terminus so final and binding as to preclude any court from examining the merits of potential disputes. We will not lightly infer such an intent, even though we are well aware that federal labor law policy, in order to foster industrial tranquility, prefers that industrial disputes be settled by the internal grievance machinery provided for by the collective bargaining agreement. See LMRA §203 (d), <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7173" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §173">29 U.S.C. §173</a>(d) (1965); <em>Republic Steel Corporation v.

    <p id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.6",261,[144,1411,1156,814]]]'>In order for a contractual remedy to be considered as final and binding, it is our view that the intent of finality must be spelled out therein or at least contextually implicit from a reading of the agreement as in <em>Guille v. Mushroom Transportation Co., </em><a href="/pa/425/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="425 Pa. 607" data-case-ids="1906658" data-case-paths="/pa/425/0607-01">425 Pa. 607</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=229%20A.2d%20903" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="229 A.2d 903">229 A. 2d 903</a> (1967). The pertinent provision of the instant Agreement certainly does not spell out any element of finality; and from our reading of the provision in context, we do not find any intent strong enough to establish inferential finality. It is thus our conclusion that the “discussion” provision of the 1962 preferential hiring Agreement does not evince the requisite factor of mutually agreed upon finality, which would be necessary to preclude judicial review of a controversy under the contract involved.</p>

      <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>Narco next contends that the court below was correct in refusing equitable jurisdiction over the instant dispute, because the appellants should not be able to seek specific enforcement of a hiring provision that is vague, indefinite and uncertain. The court below made no finding that the provision in question is vague, indefinite and uncertain. Nor do we pass on this question. The request for specific enforcement meant that appellants asked the court below to order compulsory arbitration. Insofar as this latter request is concerned, we agree with Narco that equitable jurisdiction does not lie. Compulsory arbitration is not to be decreed here. The controlling 1962 contract provision specifically excludes disputes of the instant type from arbitration.' Any rights the employees may have, arise under the contract and, by the same token, they are bound by that contract’s explicit limitations. Hence, on this ground alone, the court below was correct in denying equitable relief. However, on the record before us, we are not persuaded that complete termination of the plaintiffs’ cause was justified. Even if equitable. relief were not warranted, but money damages for breach of contract were justified, judgment should not have been entered for the defendant, but rather the action should have been certified to the law side of the court. See <em>Wilson v. King of Prussia Enterprises, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/422/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="422 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="1901692" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0128-01">422 Pa. 128</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=221%20A.2d%20123" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="221 A.2d 123">221 A. 2d 123</a> (1966). And, it is fundamental that a summary judgment should be entered only where the right is clear and the matter free from doubt. See <em>Evans v.
