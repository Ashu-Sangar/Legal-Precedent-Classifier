The will appointed the present appellant-trustee execu<a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>tor and gave Mm the entire estate in trust for distribution “to and amongst such local charities as he shall determine in his sole discretion . . . .” In addition to the above mentioned will, a codicil dated April 26, 1962 was found. This codicil eliminated appellant-trustee from serving in any fiduciary capacity, appointed Bronte Greenwood, Esq., of Philadelphia, in his stead, revoked the residuary clauses of the 1959 will and, in lieu thereof, gave testator’s residuary estate “unto [his] loyal and faithful friend, Myra Parkhurst, to be owned outright and in fee by her,” and also gave Myra Parkhurst “the power to designate distribution therefrom to and amongst any charitable organizations she may desire and in any amounts she may desire.” In addition, the codicil specifically provided “that her conduct in such designation shall not be questioned, nor shall she be required to make any such designation.”</p>

The grounds of this appeal were: (a) at the time the codicil was executed, testator was not of sound mind; (b) the codicil was procured by undue influence. Preliminary objections to the petition challenging Mosher’s <em>standing to appeal </em>from probate were sustained. In <em>Thompson Will, </em>supra, we upheld Mosher’s <em>standing to appeal </em>and remanded the matter to the Orphans’ Court of Erie County for further proceedings to determine the validity of the codicil.</p>

The lower court, after noting the personal and professional difficulties faced by appellant-trustee and his counsel with respect to the will contest which had become a <em>cause celebre </em>in Erie County, reduced appellant-trustee’s commission as trustee to $20,000 for the reason that Mosher was not entitled to full compensation since “this trustee [appellant] did not have all the normal duties of a trustee in administering this fund, since most of it was disbursed to the selected charities shortly after it was received by him.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Similarly, the lower court reduced the fees paid the trustee’s counsel, determining that “the sum of ninety thousand dollars ($90,000) [was] a just, reasonable and equitable fee . . . .”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

      <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>Appellant-trustee preliminarily challenges the decree of the lower court on the ground that the court had neither the right nor power, on its own motion, to review and pass upon the trustee’s compensation or that of his counsel. His position is that notice had been given to all parties, including the Attorney General as <em>parens patriae, </em>and that no party in interest had objected to the compensation and fees paid. To support his position, appellant-trustee points to letters received from St. Barnabas House, the residuary charitable beneficiary under the will, and interprets these letters as a blanket approval of the fees in dispute. Assuming, arguendo, that the language of these letters does sustain the broad interpretation given them by appellant-trustee and that no other party objected to the fees, the lower court still had the right to examine the amount of the fees <em>since appellant-trustee himself had requested the court to do so. </em>Appellant-trustee, as we have mentioned, petitioned the court for approval of these fees and, in effect, it was on Ms own motion that the lower court turned its attention to this question.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Now that the court has disapproved the amount of the fees, appellant-trustee contends that he had withdrawn the petition for approval and, therefore, he argues the court could not act on it. The answer to this is that nowhere in the record is there any evidence of any motion withdrawing the petition. Further, appellant-trustee cannot point to any time or place where he, either formally or informally, withdrew or even attempted to withdraw the petition. On the contrary, at the hearing on the petition itself, appellant-trustee <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>voluntarily offered it into evidence and produced testimony and documentary evidence in support of it.

Appellant-trustee is acting under the misapprehension that a trustee, acting under a will for unnamed charities to be selected by him, can bind not only the charities but the court as well by entering into a contract for counsel fees on a contingent basis. A trustee is an officer of the court and, as we have previously observed, all of his acts of omission or commission are subject to the scrutiny and control of the orphans’ court. See: <em>Wilson v. Board of Directors of City Trusts, </em><a href="/pa/324/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="324 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1171330" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0545-01">324 Pa. 545</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.%20588" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="188 A. 588">188 A. 588</a> (1936); <em>Lafferty v.

The court has the power and the duty to examine any contract entered into by a trustee and is not bound by the terms of such agreements if the court is of the opinion such agreements are unreasonable or improper.</p>
    <p id="b325-5" data-blocks='[["BL_325.5",325,[183,1190,1152,793]]]'>Parenthetically, it should be noted that the Erie County Minimum Fee provides for a contingent-fee of <em>u4Á)°/o </em>of the amount recovered <em>in event of appeal to Appellate Court.” </em>(Emphasis added). The amount received in the case at bar was obtained through settlement. There was never an appeal to an Appellate Court <em>on the merits of the codicil contest. </em>Granted that appellant-trustee was before our Court previously, it must be noted that that appeal presented a very narrow — though extremely important — issue, i.e., the question of standing to appeal. The codicil contest was never presented on its merits. Thus, there would seem to be a serious question as to whether or not the contingent-fee would be payable under the facts presented herein.</p>

In so concluding, we are fully cognizant of the yeoman job done by counsel and that for the better part of two years they were engaged almost continually with the present litigation and were subjected to a great deal of criticism for the role they played in maintaining the integrity of testator’s will. Cognizant of all these facts, however, we are not convinced that the lower court’s determination was incorrect. We conclude that $90,000 was a just and reasonable compensation for the efforts of appellant-trustee’s counsel and that the action of the court below in fixing such fee was proper.</p>
