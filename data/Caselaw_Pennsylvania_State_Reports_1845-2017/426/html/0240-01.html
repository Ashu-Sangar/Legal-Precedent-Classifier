Plaintiffs are certain policemen, crime investigation officers and retired policemen on their own behalf and on behalf of all police and park police similarly situated. Defendants are the City of Philadelphia, the mayor and other city officials. The action from which this appeal arises was instituted in 1955 to compel the city to pay plaintiffs at overtime rates for working more than a five-day, 40-hour work week since January 7, 1952 and to restore a five-day, 40-hour work week for all city policemen and park police.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The agreement authorized provided that the regular work week for the union’s employees should consist of a five-day, 40-hour work week, that overtime beyond eight hours in any day or beyond five days any week should be paid for at the rate of time and one-half and that work performed on Sunday should be paid for at double time. On January 2, 1952, the ordinance of October 29, 1951 was amended to provide that on and after January 1, 1952 the standard work week of all city employees, including police, be in accordance with the 40-hour plan described above.

This regulation provided that effective January 7, 1952 the hours of work, the rates of pay and determination of compensation of all city employees should be as legally established on October 26,1951. Thus, following adoption of this regulation, policemen and park police were, in fact, returned to a six-day, 48-hour work week.

This view plaintiffs base on the contention that the regulations constituted an implied repealer of the ordinances of October 29, 1951 and January 2, 1952 and the doctrine that implied repeals are an affirmative defense. Because of our view that the Charter explicitly took from City Council the power to legislate with regard to the civil service matters covered by the regulations here in question, we do not consider that the regulations may be properly characterized as an implied repealer. Hence, we believe the normal presumption of validity attached to the regulations<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and that plaintiffs therefore had the burden of showing their invalidity.</p>

From the record it appears that the city called as a witness the present Secretary of the Administrative Board. In the custody of the secretary was the official minute book of the board. The secretary testified to the approval of the regulation from the contents of the minute book. On cross-examination plaintiffs’ attorney elicited from the secretary the information that all the minutes in the book including the approval of the regulation were in mimeographed form. Because of their mimeographed form, plaintiffs’ attorney urges, in effect, that there must have been “an original” and that failure of the city to produce this original or to satisfactorily explain nonproduction made the proffered document inadmissible.</p>

      <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>There are two answers to plaintiffs’ assertion with respect to the best evidence rule. The first is that the mere fact that mimeographs are made from a stencil does not indicate whether that stencil or a previous draft (if it existed at all) were approved by the Administrative Board as the minutes. It is just as likely that the minutes only became official in their mimeographed form. In other words, the fact that the contents of the official minute book are in mimeographed form fails to indicate with any certainty that better evidence, i.e., “an original” exists. This Court has maintained for well over a century that the failure of a document to indicate the existence of better evidence prevents that document’s exclusion from a judicial proceeding under the best evidence rule. <em>Western Union Tel.

In his capacity as Director of Public Safety, Mr. Rosenberg had supervision over the Philadelphia police for the four years ending January 7, 1952. Mr. Rosenberg testified, and it was stipulated by opposing counsel that certain policemen would testify to the same effect, that during the one week beginning January 1, 1952, when the police work week was in fact reduced from 48 to 40 hours, no problems were experienced and no emergency affecting the public health <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>or safety arose. Plaintiffs seek to draw from this testimony and from the absence in the record of testimony on behalf of the city from any police source a conclusive refutation of the city’s position. Indeed, plaintiffs assert that the court below was required to accept the conclusion of their witnesses because the city’s testimony from the Personnel Director and Deputy Finance Director to the effect that the reduction in wox*k would have reduced coverage was incompetent because not from witnesses qualified to express an opinion on matters involving police administration.</p>
    <p id="b294-4" data-blocks='[["BL_294.5",294,[200,979,1160,1476]]]'>In considering the plaintiffs’ argument with respect to the declaration of an emergency we have been guided by certain principles. To begin with we believe that §8-407 of the Charter, by vesting the mayor with the power to declare an emergency, imposes a heavy burden on any party who wishes to attack the validity of this declaration. We also believe the validity of the declaration should be controlled by the situation as it reasonably appeared to the mayor on January 7, 1952, rather than as it presently appears with all the advantages which hindsight may provide. Similarly, we believe that reliance by the mayor on the appraisal of the situation by financial and personnel experts was prefectly reasonable and hence we reject plaintiffs’ claim that their testimony at trial should have been excluded as incompetent. After all, the mayor might reasonably have declined to rely solely on the view of the police themselves, given the extent of their material interest in the matter. Finally, it must be borne in mind that the trial judge, affirmed by the court en bane below, chose to accept the city’s rather than the plaintiffs’ contention with regard to the emergency. Such a finding, insofar as it involves a question of fact, has the effect of a jury’s verdict and will not be disturbed on appeal if based on sufficient evidence, e.g., <em>Schofield v. Grossman, </em><a href="/pa/420/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="420 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1898603" data-case-paths="/pa/420/0196-01">420 Pa. 196</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=216%20A.2d%20455" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="216 A.2d 455">216 A. 2d 455</a> (1966).</p>

      <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>Against the background of these principles, we think that there can be little doubt of the propriety of the declaration of the emergency. As the able brief of the city states, it is a matter of simple arithmetic that the shift from a 48 to a 40-hour week without a corresponding appropriation would have reduced the number of police manpower hours by twenty percent. This, in turn, we believe, the new administration could, in the circumstances, reasonably have concluded would result in a reduction of police coverage of corresponding magnitude. It takes little imagination to suggest that in a metropolis like Philadelphia such a sudden reduction in coverage posed dangers to the public safety. And the testimony of police, even if believed, that no problems were experienced during the single week at the beginning of 1952 when the police work week was reduced from 48 to 40 hours does not refute this suggestion. For since part of the value of police coverage lies in deterrence, it may well be that, although the initial reduction failed to have an immediate adverse effect on public safety, a reduction persisted in for weeks or months might have become apparent to criminal elements and hence invited a dangerous increase in their activity.</p>

These regulations are known as Regulation XIX and Regulation XXVII, §2. It is completely unnecessary for us to consider either of these attacks. Regulation XIX merely directs the Personnel Director to perform duties prescribed by Article VII of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter. Hence, whether or not Regulation XIX is valid, the Personnel Director had a valid basis in law for the performance of the duties imposed by the regulation. Regulation XXVII, §2, which purported to place in effect the work and pay plan established by the ordinance of January 2, 1952 and which was specifically superseded by Supplemental Emergency Civil Service Regulation A, is totally irrelevant to the injury complained of by the plaintiffs in this litigation and hence the validity of Regulation XXVII, §2 need not be considered by us.</p>
