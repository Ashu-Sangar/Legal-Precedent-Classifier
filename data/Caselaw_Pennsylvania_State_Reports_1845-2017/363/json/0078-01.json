        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court refusing to permit the adoption of a minor. The question presented is whether the testimony supports the finding that respondent\u2019s written consent to the adoption of her infant son is not legally binding and effective?\nPetitioners, husband and wife, filed on May 3, 1948, a petition in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Yenango County praying for the adoption of Timothy Susko, an infant. Attached to their petition was the following \u201cConsent to Adoption\u201d executed by respondent:\n\u201cNow March 27,1948,1, Olga Susko, mother of Timothy Susko, born at Youngstown, Ohio, on June 8,1947, an illegitimate child whose father has never acknowledged the child, hereby irrevocably consent to the adoption of the said child by Dallas W. Milner and Mary E. Milner, his wife, of B. D. 2, Cranberry Township, Oil City, Yenango County, Pa., who have had the said child in their care and custody since February 21, 1948.\n\u201cI am white, 21 years of age and reside at 115 Owsley Street, Masury, Ohio.\u201d (Signed and acknowledged before a notary public.)\nBespondent on August 31, 1948, filed an Answer to the Petition and simultaneously filed a Writ of Habeas Corpus in the Common Pleas Court of Yenango County for the return of her child. She averred that the father of the child was a married man residing in Ohio, who was therein identified; that respondent at the time she signed the \u201cConsent to Adoption\u201d was under twenty-one years of age; and that when she signed that instrument she was mentally confused as the result of her mother\u2019s recent death, and was \u201cinduced by the duress and undue influence exerted by her seven brothers to deliver the custody\u201d of her child to Mr. and Mrs. Milner.\nThe child, Timothy Susko, was born to respondent out of wedlock. When Olga became pregnant with Timothy, she was seventeen years old, in high school, and residing with her mother and seven brothers at Masury, Ohio. On disclosing her condition to her mother, the latter on the same day suffered a stroke of paralysis and was hospitalized for a month. Olga\u2019s brothers on becoming aware of her condition were incensed and openly resented her presence. They called her vile and opprobrious names, and went so far as suggesting that an abortion be performed. Upon their persistence in February, 1947, Olga went to the Florence Crittendon Home at Youngstown, Ohio, where the child was born on July 8, 1947.\nAfter the child\u2019s birth respondent\u2019s brothers insisted that she give up the child before leaving the hospital. However, respondent refused, and upon leaving arranged with friends for the temporary care of the child. The child remained there for three months during which time respondent visited it daily and paid for its maintenance. Eespondent\u2019s mother then suggested that the child be brought home. Upon the arrival of the child the resentment was so strong that one brother left home. Two months later respondent took the child to an aunt\u2019s home in a distant city in the hope of relieving the tension. Several times thereafter the child was shifted from respondent\u2019s home to the aunt\u2019s and from the aunt\u2019s home to respondent\u2019s. In January 1948, Olga\u2019s mother died, and several members of the family accused her of being the cause of their mother\u2019s death. As a result of the constant discussion regarding the disposition of the child, respondent finally agreed to give up the child.\nPetitioner was informed of the child, Timothy, through his mother, a neighbor of respondent in Masury. On February 22, 1948, petitioner and his wife went to Masury at which time respondent turned the child over to their custody. On several occasions thereafter respondent visited the child when petitioners brought the child to Masury, but on such occasions made no visible protests against petitioners\u2019 custody. On March 27,1948, petitioners secured respondent\u2019s signature to the written \u201cConsent to Adoption\u201d above set forth.\nAfter visiting with the child in May, 1948, respondent became determined that she wanted her baby. After consulting with an attorney, respondent went in person to Oil City to the home of petitioners and asked \u201cif they would give up the baby.\u201d Petitioners refiised, and shortly thereafter instituted this petition for adoption.\nAt the hearing in reply to the direct inquiry why she had consented initially to the adoption, respondent testified: \u201cWell, after the confusion, after my mother had died, I just didn\u2019t know what to do. Everything was against me. My brothers were abusing me. It was the only thing I could do was to sign this paper.\u201d The trial judge in his opinion states that he was convinced that the respondent\u2019s consent to adoption was \u201csigned under insurmountable duress and coercion. Eespondent was baffled by a distressing situation that gave no hope of solution except that dictated by some of her brothers, \u2014-viz., consent to the adoption of Timothy.\u201d The record fully supports his conclusion.\nThe scope of review exercised by this Court in the instant case is that exercisable on certiorari; and, consequently, we are required to review the testimony in an attempt to ascertain whether there was evidence sufficient to support the findings: Weinbach\u2019s Appeal, 316 Pa. 333, 175 A. 500.\nUnlike custody cases, in adoption proceedings the welfare of the child is not material until either consent or abandonment as prescribed by the Adoption Act has been established. \u201cUnder the Adoption Act the welfare of the child is weighed only after the necessary consents have already been given or forfeited. The welfare of the child, as an element in adoption proceedings, has no relation to the question of the parent\u2019s abandonment\u201d: Schwab Adoption Case, 355 Pa. 534, 50 A. 2d 504. To the same effect see: Petition of Sulewski et al., 113 Pa. Superior Ct. 301, 173 A. 747.\nThe lower court concluded that neither a valid consent to adoption had been given by the distressed mother, nor had respondent\u2019s actions in giving the custody of her child to petitioners for a period of three months constituted abandonment as contemplated by the statute. Considering first abandonment, the Adoption Act, as amended June 30, 1947, P. L. 1180, \u00a71 (1 PS 1) provides that where abandonment is alleged, a statement must be attached to the petition for adoption that such abandonment has continued for a period of at least six months. This amendment envisages a case where the abandoning parent repents, perhaps, a hasty single act or a short period of neglect in providing for a child, and prescribes that the abandonment be continual for a minimum period of six months. Abandonment \u201cimports any conduct on the part of the parent which evidences a settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquishes all parental claim to the child: Weinbach\u2019s Appeal, 316 Pa. 333, 175 A. 500\u201d: Schwab Adoption Case, supra. Irrespective of the fact that the six months statutory period of abandonment was not persisted in by respondent, her conduct negates proof of that \u201csettled purpose to forego all parental duties.\u201d The affection respondent manifested for her child, the pressure under which she consented to give up the .custody of the infant, together with the fact that within three months she sought its return, clearly contravert proof of an intent to abandon.\nThe circumstances surrounding the execution of the formal instrument referred herein as \u201cConsent to Adoption\u201d warranted the trial judge in concluding that this young mother\u2019s action in signing the Consent to Adoption was not such consent as is required by the Adoption Act. Respondent signed this instrument when she was eighteen years and two months, at a time very soon after her mother\u2019s death, and while subjected to reprehensible coercion on the part of her brothers. The consent prescribed by the Adoption Act is a parental consent that is intelligent, voluntary and deliberate. Section 3 of the Act gives the trial judge discretion to require the presence of the natural parent or parents at the hearing on the petition for adoption where a formal consent has been executed. This implies that it is not too late even then to withdraw a previously given consent for adoption. If there is no voluntary consent at that time, the requirements of the Adoption Act have not been met. In the instant case the trial judge properly exercised the discretion granted him by the Act.\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed.",
