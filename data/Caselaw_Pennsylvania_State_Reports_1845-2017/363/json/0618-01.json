Hill, 359 Pa. 540, 541, 59 A. 2d 877, that: \u201c Our uniform rule is that, on an appeal from a decree which refuses, grants or continues a preliminary injunction, we will look only to see if there were any apparently reasonable grounds for tbe action of the court below, and we will not further consider the merits of the case or pass upon the reasons for or against such action, unless it is plain that no such grounds existed or that the rules of law relied on are palpably wrong or clearly inapplicable.\u2019 \u201d (Citing cases.)\nIn this case there are apparently reasonable grounds for the action of the court below and for this reason the decree is affirmed.\nCosts to be paid by the appellants.",
