The jury returned a verdict for defendant and plaintiff now appeals.\nPlaintiff\u2019s sole argument is that the charge to which he took only a general exception, contained errors and omissions. This case is clearly ruled by Steele v. France, 363 Pa. 165, 69 A. 2d 368, and Voitasefski v. Pittsburgh Rwys. Co., 363 Pa. 220, 69 A. 2d 370, where we restated the well-established principle that under a general exception only basic and fundamental errors ,ill be considered by this Court. Here, the learned trial judge carefully and completely summarized the evidence. His statement of the law was equally clear, correct and unbiased. Certainly under a general exception, plaintiff may not complain that a charge as thorough and unprejudiced as this one failed to emphasize sufficiently his position.\nJudgment affirmed.",
