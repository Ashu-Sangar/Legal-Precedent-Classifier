The court below, one judge dissenting, decided that the interest <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>was contingent and settlor’s heirs were to he determined as of the date of the death of the life tenant.

By the terms of the deed settlor transferred to the named trustee 300 shares of stock of a trust company. The trustee was directed to: . . collect the dividends declared and paid thereon and pay the same as they shall be collected unto my granddaughter, Bessie Emma Tayman Ginther, of said City of Pittsburgh, for and during the term of her natural life, and from and after the death of my said granddaughter, to pay said dividends, as they shall be received, unto her children, and as each child reaches the age of twenty-one years to transfer to such child a pro rata number of shares of said stock, and in default of any such child reaching twenty-one years, to transfer said stock to my own heirs; . .</p>
