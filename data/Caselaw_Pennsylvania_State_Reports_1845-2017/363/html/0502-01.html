To recover damages for the injuries he sustained he brought suit against both Parker and the Bakery Company. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants. Plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial assigning in support thereof nine reasons. The court en banc rejected all of these except two which it sustained, namely, that the court erred in charging that plaintiff could not recover against Parker for the latter’s negligence, and that the court erred in failing to charge that the defendants could be jointly liable to plaintiff. Because of these two assumed errors the court granted a new trial as against both defendants, from which order the Bakery Company appeals.</p>

At the time of the accident they were on their way to a restaurant for breakfast, and they also intended to make some business calls. The question as to the relationship between Parker, who was driving the car, and plaintiff, who was seated therein, is of no legal importance in the case because, whatever it was, plaintiff was entitled to recover from Parker if the latter was negligent in the operation of the car, for no person may negligently injure another without being responsible for damages: <em>Johnson v.

But while it is true, therefore, that the court erred in charging the jury that plaintiff could not recover against Parker for the latter’s negligence, this was a pure error of'law which did not affect the liability of the Bakery Company either factually or legally. Since it concerned only Parker, and did not involve any question in regard to the way in which the accident happened, <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>it did not warrant the granting of a new trial as to the Bakery Company or the nullification of the verdict in favor of that defendant: <em>Fitzpatrick, Administratrix, v.
