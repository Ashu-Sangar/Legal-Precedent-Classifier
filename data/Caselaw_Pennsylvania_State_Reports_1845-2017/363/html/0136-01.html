A verdict was directed in favor of the additional defendant, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of Tanner against Pennsylvania Truck Lines, Inc., in the amount of $15,000. Motions were filed by Pennsylvania Truck Lines for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>and for new trial. The motion for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>was refused, but the court below entered an order granting a new trial unless Tanner filed a remittitur reducing the verdict to $12,000. Remittitur was filed and judgment was entered for Tanner in the reduced amount.</p>

M., March 18,1946, Tanner was stationed on the traffic island between the northbound and southbound traffic at the south portal of the Liberty Tubes, in the City of Pittsburgh. According to his testimony and that of his witnesses, southbound traffic was stopped by a red light located at the intersection to the south and Tanner had stepped off the traffic island and through the line of traffic nearest the island, directly in front of the tractor-trailer of Pennsylvania Truck Lines, for the purpose of giving instructions to the operator of a Kraft Foods Company truck which was stopped in the next line of traffic, about four feet away, with the drivers’ seats of the two vehicles about even. Tanner spoke to the driver of the Kraft truck and turned to retrace his steps to the traffic island. Pie observed that the traffic light at the intersection was still red against southbound traffic and had taken one or two steps when the tractor-trailer unexpectedly moved forward and to the left, closing the gap between it and the traffic ahead. The cab of the tractor cleared Tanner, but due to the lateral movement of the trailer, he was struck by its right front corner, knocked down, and <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>run over by its right rear wheel, sustaining serious injuries.</p>

Edward J. Volzer, operator of the tractor-trailer, admitted that he had Tanner in full view from the time he stepped from the traffic island until the tractor-trailer was moved forward. He admitted that he was “uneasy” because of Tanner’s position on the highway between the two vehicles, and that he knew he Avas “taking a chance” in moving forward, for the reason that “I didn’t think that there was enough clearance,” and he stopped after proceeding forward a distance of about 20 to 24 feet, “to see Avhat things were like,” because “I figured he might have got squeezed in there.” Volzer denied the traffic light was red against him Avhen he moved forward, testifying that it had changed to green in his favor, and denied that no warning Avas given, stating that he “hollered” to plaintiff, “You had better get out of there, the light has changed,” and that Tanner replied, “Go ahead, son, I’m alright.” However, the verdict of the jury implies that they disregarded this testimony, and Ave cannot do otherAvise on appeal: <em>Mackin v.
