Bottles of skins of animals, as of goats, sewn up in the form of a bag and tied at the neck, were used by the Hebrews, and are still in use, especially among the ruder peoples.

In attempting to jutify such a restriction it will be confronted with the facts (quoting from the lower court’s findings in the instant case) that the Secretary of Health of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has approved the use of “Pure-Pak” containers for distribution of milk in Pennsylvania; and that the use of the paper container, which is also called the “single service container”, is approved for the packaging and distributing of milk by the United States Department of Public Health Service.</p>

Their proof shows that single service containers have, in recent years, been widely used in various cities; that no illness or disease has been traced to them, and that their use has been approved by the United States Public Health Service, the Chicago Board of Health, and the Illinois Department of Health.” In that ease the Illinois court held that the Chicago city ordinance which required milk sold in less than gallon quantities to be delivered in “standard milk bottles” excluded paper single service containers, and was a valid exercise of the city’s police power. The use of the word “standard” in the Chicago ordinance distinguishes that case from the one before us.</p>
