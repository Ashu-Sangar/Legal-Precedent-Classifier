After argument on the exceptions filed the Commonwealth amended the prayer of its Bill and prayed in the alternative that the court enjoin defendants’ mining operations until the latter have secured the approval from the Sanitary Water Board of a required proposed drainage and disposal plan. After exceptions were filed and argument heard before the court en banc and the filing of the amended prayer of the Bill, the Chancellor filed another opinion in which he directed attention to the alternate theory of the Commonwealth. The court therein held that as the testimony established that there would be no acid mine draining from defendants’ mining operations into the streams, procurement of a permit from the Sanitary Water Board was not required under §313 of the Act of 1945, P. L. 435, as no public nuisance existed.</p>

This tract contains about 95 to 100 acres of coal which the defendants propose to remove by the strip mining method. The lease contract provided that the mining operations were to begin within 60 days. In August defendants moved their equipment onto the property and began operations. On September 16, 1948, defendants made <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>application under section 7 of tlie Act of 1945, P. L. 435 (35 PS 691.311) to the Sanitary Water Board for approval of a plan of the proposed drainage and disposal of the acid mine drainage of the mine. Late in September a conference was held, but no action was taken by the Board. "Within a few days thereafter, September 30th, the owners of the property and defendants joined in a petition for a declaratory judgment, filed in Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas asking that court to declare that the defendants were not required to obtain the approval of the Sanitary Water Board<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> on the basis that §313 of the above Act was inapplicable to a strip mining operation. The Westmoreland Court entered the decree as prayed for. Relying on the declaratory judgment defendants began their mining operations without obtaining the approval of the Sanitary Water Board.

Tbe averments of tbe bill with reference to that Board were deemed to be but incidental to the threatened pollution. By far tbe greater part of tbe testimony as a whole, and of tbe plaintiff’s brief, were directed to tbe threatened' pollution. Having made an issue of the pollution, it comes with ill grace to say that that aspect of tbe case should now be disregarded, and that the findings of fact, based upon the testimony of record, should all be set aside and tbe case resolved upon an entirely different and alternate theory. However, since tbe prayer of tbe bill has been amended, we shall direct our attention to tbe alternate theory on its merits.” Tbe court then points out that the “statute involved relates to preserving and improving tbe purity of tbe waters of the Commonwealth. It is found in 1937 P. L. 1987, as amended by 1945 P. L. 435, 35 PS 691.1 et seq”. The court then said: “Tbe record testimony in this case shows conclusively that there is no acid mine <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>drainage from the operation of the defendants into the streams involved. Hence, there is no unlawful act and no nuisance.”</p>
    <p id="b285-3" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[128,466,1152,1844]]]'>The court then cites Section 691.313 of 35 Purdons Statute, which provides: “Before any existing or new coal mine may be opened or reopened, and before any existing coal mine may be continued in operation, a plan of the proposed drainage and disposal of industrial wastes, and acid mine drainage of such mine, shall be submitted to the Sanitary Water Board, and it shall be unlawful to open or reopen any such mine, or to continue the operation of any mine, or to change or alter any already approved plan of drainage and disposal of industrial wastes, and acid mine drainage from such mine, unless and until the board, after consultation with the Department of Mines has approved such plan or change of plan: Provided, however, That this section shall not apply to the continuation of the operation of an existing mine until sixty (60) days after the effective date of this act.” The court said: “All of these sections are part of Article III and must be consideréd with reference to each other. They exhibit a plan designed to protect clean streams as far as possible. When acid mine drainage may be diverted from a clean stream to a polluted stream, the act provides a method by which that result may be accomplished. In that event, the Sanitary Water Board is clothed with authority to approve such plans, and proceeding without such approval is made unlawful. But these provisos were never intended to apply to a situation where there is no acid mine drainage into a clean stream. To so interpret them would be unreasonable and absurd. In the present case, where the record shows no acid mine drainage into clean streams, it would be futile to submit plans for drainage into polluted streams. There can be no such plan unless drainage into a clean stream is first established. It has not been established in the present case.”</p>

As such, it is his duty to advise the agents and officers of the Commonwealth, including the Sanitary Water Board. Complying with the request for an injunction until the Sanitary Water Board has approved plans of disposal would mean that that Board might act upon an entirely different record than that before us and might reach a different conclusion. We feel that the Commonwealth, having brought about this dilemma, should be bound by the record before us. Having asked the Chancellor to find facts and to make conclusions of law, it now wants the court to set them aside because they are not favorable to it. We cannot condone this practice. The record having been made, the parties are bound by it.”</p>

But since defendants made no objection to this amendment and since the court dealt with the bill as thus amended, we need not pass on the question of whether this amendment to the prayer of the bill amounted, at least by implication, to pleading a new cause of action,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> to wit, defendants’ failure to obtain <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>the required permit for its mining operation.

    <p id="b287-4" data-blocks='[["BL_287.7",287,[149,845,1153,1134]],["BL_288.1",288,[310,299,1151,640]]]'>The language of Section 313 of the Act of 1945, P. L. 435 (35 PS 691.313) is unambiguous. It clearly prohibits the opening of any new coal mine, or the reopening of an old coal mine or the continuance in operation of any existing coal mine, until a plan of mine drainage has been approved by the Commonwealth, acting through its official agency. The statute does not say that <em>if </em>the mine owners can show that there will be no acid mine drainage into clean streams, such approval need <em>not </em>be obtained. In order to avoid the peril of having its streams polluted the Commonwealth assumes that the drainage from every coal mine is a potential menace to the purity of nearby waters, and provides that before such a mine can be opened plans must be submitted which will satisfy the Commonwealth that this peril will be obviated. The defendants’ mine is subject to this Act, for we agree with the findings of fact of the court below that the streams involved “are clean streams devoted to public use” and “the coal to be mined and the overburden above it contain oxidizable material which will form acid mine water”, and that <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>“it is impossible to determine how soon, or for how long, a mine will produce acid water”, and that “it is possible, under favorable conditions, to treat acid mine water and remove the deleterious substances”, and that “it is possible to collect and treat the acid mine water which will develop on the tract here involved”. The court’s other additional finding, the 28th, to wit, “The defendants have not polluted, and do not intend to pollute the streams here involved, but on the contrary have offered a consent decree against pollution”, is a finding that is immaterial and irrelevant to the issue framed by the pleadings.</p>
    <p id="b288-4" data-blocks='[["BL_288.4",288,[307,951,1154,971]]]'>When Section 313 of the Act of 1945 became the law the answer to the question: Will the drainage from any coal mine pollute our streams? ceased to have any bearing on the duty imposed on anyone opening or operating such a mine to submit a plan for the drainage of the mine to the Sanitary Water Board for appropriate official action in respect thereto.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> If a municipality, for the declared purpose of decreasing fire hazards, should by ordinance provide that no person should erect any building within the boundaries of that municipality without first securing official approval of the building plans, the fact that a person proposed to erect a building ■entirely of fire-proof material would not absolve that person from the duty of obtaining the required permit.
