On the second or hindmost trailer there were coils of steel which, according to plaintiff’s testimony, had been improperly and insecurely anchored, with the result that one of them fell off as the trailers weaved along the highway; in falling it carried with it a black tarpaulin covering. The operator, not realizing what had occurred, proceeded on to Ravenna, leaving the coil, which was about 4 feet in diameter and 2% feet high, lying in the middle of the westerly or southbound lane of the black-top macadam road. Shortly thereafter plaintiff,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> operating a tractor-trailer outfit from Cleveland toward Pittsburgh, was proceeding south over this same road at a speed of about 30 miles per hour when the undimmed headlights of a truck moving in the opposite direction temporarily blinded him as it passed. He thereupon for the first time saw, at a distance of 40 feet ahead of him, the coil of steel, but he testified that it appeared to him to be merely a patch in the road, its real character being indiscernible because of the black tarpaulin covering on the black-top highway. Accordingly he made no effort to slacken his speed or to stop, and it was only when he was practically on top of the obstruction, or within a distance of not over 10 feet from it, that he discovered its true nature; it was then, of course, too late to avoid running into it. As a result of the collision his tractor-trailer swerved completely off the road and he sustained injuries for which he seeks <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>to recover damages in the present suit. At the conclusion of his testimony the trial judge entered a compulsory non-suit on the ground of contributory negligence as a matter of law. The present appeal is from the refusal of the court en banc to remove the non-suit.</p>

L. 905, section 1002; it provides that motor vehicles driven on a public highway must not be operated at a speed that will prevent their being stopped within the assured clear distance ahead. The question arises, then, as to the meaning of this latter phrase, that is to say, whether the word “assured” is to be interpreted in an objective or a subjective sense. Does it mean the <em>actual </em>clear distance ahead, or does it mean what <em>appears </em>to a reasonably prudent driver, exercising due care, to be the clear distance ahead? To “assure” means to render safe, to make secure, but it also means “to give confidence to”; “to make (one) sure or certain”; “to put (a person) beyond doubt” (Webster’s New International Dictionary, 2nd ed.); “to cause to feel certain”; “give confidence to”; “convince” (Funk &amp; Wagnalls’ New Standard Dictionary). It would seem wholly unreasonable and unjust to hold that the operator of a motor vehicle was guilty of a violation of the statute and therefore subject to the criminal penalty prescribed by it and to the characterization of his conduct as contributorily negligent because he did not lessen the speed of his car in the face of what was actually an obstruction on the roadway but was so camouflaged or deceptive in appearance that even a reasonably careful driver would not have been able to <em>realize </em>that it was such until he was actually upon it.

To this it may be added that “the forum will apply the standard in the same manner although under the local law the case would have been for the judgment of the jury on the facts in question”: §380, comment b. The phraseology employed in the Ohio Code is the same as that of our own statute, but defendant insists that it has received in Ohio a different interpretation. We find nothing in the decisions of the Ohio courts to justify that contention.

The word “discernible” ordinarily implies something more than “visible”. “Visible” means perceivable by the <em>eye </em>whereas “discernible” means <em>mentally </em>perceptible or distinguishable, — capable of being “discerned” by the <em>understanding </em>and not merely by the senses. In <em>Sidle v. Baker </em><a href="/ohio-app/52/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="52 Ohio App. 89" data-case-ids="1348599" data-case-paths="/ohio-app/52/0089-01">52 Oh.

E. 2d 537</a>, 542, it was said that “whether one has an assured clear distance ahead may turn on whether <em>he may assume that to be the fact. </em>That assumption, where permissible, defines and determines the assured clear distance ahead. It is as essential to the definition of the statutory phrase as the requirement that one see what may be observed by looking, and that he keep in mind those unseen dangers which he is bound to anticipate. The <em>subjective </em>test includes them all.” (Italics supplied.) We see nothing, therefore, in the decisions of the Ohio courts to indicate that plaintiff in the present action would, in Ohio, have been held criminally guilty of a violation of the Ohio code or, in a civil action, guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law, if the fact be, as a jury might well find, that he was reasonably justified in believing that the dark coloring which he saw ahead of him was not a physical object on the highway but merely a patch in the macadam road.</p>

Stipp, </em><a href="/pa/270/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="270 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="1066053" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0401-01">270 Pa. 401</a>, 407, <a href="/citations/?q=113%20A.%20567" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="113 A. 567">113 A. 567</a>, 568, 569. And while the failure of plaintiff to slow down during the time he was temporarily blinded by the lights of a passing truck might ordinarily weigh seriously against him on the question of contributory negligence <em>(Vierling v. Fry, </em><a href="/pa/354/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="354 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="467466" data-case-paths="/pa/354/0066-01">354 Pa. 66</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20A.2d%20473" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="46 A.2d 473">46 A. 2d 473</a>), if his story is to be believed the speed of his car had no causal relation whatever to the accident. According to his version the accident would have occurred no matter how slowly he would have been traveling, it being caused, not by his <em>inability </em>to stop the car because of its speed <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> (which is the evil with which the statute is concerned) but because, seeing no need of attempting to stop or to slow down, he <em>voluntarily </em>refrained from doing so.
