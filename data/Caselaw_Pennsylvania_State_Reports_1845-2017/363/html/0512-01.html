(4) To be ‘earned’ and taxable, the net profits must result from the use of some labor, management or supervision. ... (6) The inheritance, purchase and holding of mortgages by the plaintiff did not constitute a business activity under the Ordinance.... (7) The purchase and holding of stocks and securities by the plaintiff was not a business activity under the Ordinance. ...

Prior to January 1, 1939, the plaintiff owned thirteen rented parcels of real estate, eight of which were acquired through inheritance and five of which were acquired on various dates by purchase. 14. Between 1939 and 1947, the plaintiff acquired by mortgage foreclosures or purchase certain additional properties and sold others. . . . 16. In 1939-1940 the plaintiff owned seven mortgages, six of which were inherited by him, and in the following years he never held more than seven mortgages, though he bought and maintained them for income. ... 19. The plaintiff employed several licensed real estate agents who handled the various real estate transactions for him. 20. In 1945 the plaintiff employed a janitor to service part of a property consisting of one-story stores and garages at 467 Queen Lane, 5305-07 Laurens Street, and 5323-31 Newhall Street. He also furnished electricity to the thirty-four individual garages. 21. For the properties, described in Finding No. 20, the plaintiff relied upon the real estate agents to make necessary repairs and to deduct from the rentals, expenses for repairs, insurance and the like. 22. Aside from the above, the plaintiff spent only a little time in connection with the realty by way of telephone conversations and occasional correspondence regarding acquisition, disposal, repairs, and advertising of the property, and maintained no office other than his law office. 23. Generally, the plaintiff acquired or sold his real property upon report of a satisfactory price by the agents who negotiated with the other parties, and he participated only to the extent of executing documents and accepting prices offered. 24. Except for the instance noted in Finding of Fact No. 20, the plaintiff did not furnish any service to the tenants of his real estate, nor did he directly employ any labor in operating the real estate. ... 27.

[supra].” At page 17 of the brief, its contention is: “Hence, the test is not whether the net profits are ‘earned’ or ‘unearned,’ but rather whether the net profits <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>are derived from an undertaking of any nature, either conducted for profit or ordinarily conducted for profit. To that extent the net profits are limited by the Ordinance and in no other respect, regardless of what language was used heretofore in any of the briefs of arguments.” We must reject these contentions. It clearly appears, both in the title to the ordinance and in section 2, that the tax is on “(c) the net profits <em>earned </em>after January 1, 1939, of businesses, professions or other activities conducted by such residents . . .” The City’s definition of “business”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> has been quoted from the ordinance and expressly includes both words “profession” and “activity.” The application of the rule <em>ejusdem generis </em>to the context “businesses, professions, or other activities” restricts the meaning that may be given to the word “activities” by limiting it to what is included in the words “businesses and professions.” And this accords with section 33 of the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, 46 PS 533, providing: “General words shall be construed to take their meanings and be restricted by preceding particular words . . .” The ordinance makes a distinction between net profits earned, as taxable income, and net profits not taxable because not gain resulting from professional or business activity as defined in the ordinance. The use of the words “operation” and “net gain” seem clearly to refer to a taxable’s active conduct of a moneymaking occupation and not to the kind of acts done by one not engaged in business but merely conserving his property.</p>

E. 2d 881</a> (1940), it was decided that tenants in common of nine parcels of inherited land held for income purposes, who received the income from the real estate agent who operated the properties for annual compensation, were not engaged in business within a taxing statute. The court said, “It is clear that appellants are not engaged in a trade or occupation, and respondents do not argue to the contrary. Appellants are subject to the tax, therefore, only if their activities as tenants in common constitute the doing of business. The term ‘business’ is of very broad significance and has a great variety of meanings. (Murray, English Dictionary on Historical Principles [1888], vol. 1, part 2, p. 1205; 3 Encycl. of the Social Sciences, pp. 80-86; 5 Words and Phrases [perm, ed.], 970; 13 id. 126, 184.) The precise meaning depends upon the context. In the case at bar the word ‘business’ must be construed as part of the phrase ‘trade, business or occupation.’ Although business is not thereby rendered the equivalent of trade or occupation, the several words of the series do establish the context; and the context determines which of the several meanings was intended by the Legislature. (People ex rel. Parker Mills v. Comrs. of Taxes, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20N.Y.%20242" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="23 N.Y. 242">23 N. Y. 242</a>, 244.) When used in tax statutes <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>similar to that involved in the ease at bar, ‘business’ or ‘doing business’ connote something more than the ownership of property and the receipt of income derived from property.” (citing cases) See also <em>Higgins v.
