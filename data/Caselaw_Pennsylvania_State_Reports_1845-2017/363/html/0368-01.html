    <p id="b417-10" data-blocks='[["BL_417.16",417,[123,1265,1157,644]]]'>Defendant appeals from judgment on a verdict for $30,000 in plaintiff s suit for personal injuries sustained when defendant’s street car smashed into the rear of an automobile driven by plaintiff. Defendant now makes three points: (a) that the verdict is excessive, (b) that it is capricious and perverse, and (c) that the trial judge’s reference in his charge to “the law of workmen’s compensation in illustrating to the jury what is meant by present worth is not merely an unfortunate one but a wholly misleading and dangerous one, and one which cannot be regarded as harmless.” There is no merit in any of these contentions.</p>
    <p id="b417-11" data-blocks='[["BL_417.17",417,[129,1920,1153,259]]]'>The jury was justified in finding permanent injury, was faced with the problem of present worth and required instructions on the subject.

The award for permanent impairment of earning power must not exceed, though it should equal, <em>the worth at the date of the verdict, </em>of a sum payable in normal future installments during what would be the period of the injured person’s ability to earn money had he not received the injury or injuries complained of. . . .

He says, ‘That does not do me any good. Give me a lump sum so I can buy a business or house and I will be more benefited.’ And the Workmen’s Compensation sometime says, ‘All right, but wo will give you a smaller amount if we give it to you now because those payments you are entitled to receive are not yet due and will not be due for a long time.’ ”</p>
