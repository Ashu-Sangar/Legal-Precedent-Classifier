      <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>On July 13, 1946, the defendant insurance company issued a <em>written </em>fire insurance policy on appellant’s garage. The term of the policy was for one year. It had been obtained by appellant, the owner, through Merle A. McKee, a local soliciting agent of the insurance company. Appellant averred that at the expiration of its term McKee <em>orally </em>agreed to continue the policy for another year and that he had paid the premium to McKee. This was denied by McKee. Ten months after the alleged renewal, the garage was destroyed by fire. The insurance company refused to pay the amount of loss and this suit was instituted.</p>
