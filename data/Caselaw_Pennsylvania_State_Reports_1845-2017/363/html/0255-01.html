Two questions are presented.

Prom this information Dennison concluded that these individuals had been engaged in several fraudulent schemes and were securing advertising contracts through unfair and illegal means. On June 4, 1945, a person who referred to himself as “Mr. Callahan” and as a “former business associate of Harris and Bloom” telephoned Mr. Dennison from Harrisburg, informing him that Harris and Bloom had entered into a contract with the “Post Office Custodian”, the official publication of the National Association of Post Office Custodial Employees, for the purpose of soliciting advertising for this journal, and further advising Dennison that plaintiff, editor of the journal, had received $1,000 from Harris and Bloom to sign the contract. The tenor and purport of the information was that Mr. Montgomery had accepted a bribe for the purpose of committing the national official publication to this advertising contract. Belying on this information and without any acquaintance with Montgomery, Dennison wrote a letter to Jesse M. Donaldson, Chief Post Office Inspector at Washington, D. C., now Postmaster General of the United States, in which Den<a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>nison referred to Harris and Bloom as “a vicious and persistent combination”. This letter contained the following paragraph which constitutes the basis of the present action: “We were informed on June 4 (and have not yet had an opportunity to confirm these statements) by a Mr. Callahan, who represented himself as an employee of Harris and Bloom, that this firm had paid a man named Montgomery $1,000 to sign a contract whereby the promoters were to become the official representatives of the subject Association. Montgomery is connected with the Philadelphia Post Office, presumably as a janitor, and is editor of the subject publication.” Copies of this letter were mailed to the General Managers of the Scranton Better Business Bureau and the Philadelphia Better Business Bureau, respectively, the Postmaster at Pittsburgh, the United States Attorneys at Phila; delphia and Pittsburgh, and to two officers of the National Association of Post Office Custodial Employees. All copies were typed on the Pittsburgh Better Business Bureau stationery and were signed by Dennison as its General Manager. The original letter is now in the “John D. Montgomery Personnel Pile” filed in the United States Post Office Department at Washington.</p>
    <p id="b307-3" data-blocks='[["BL_307.4",307,[145,1563,1163,642]]]'>The trial developed the following facts: Montgomery as editor of the Post Office Custodian did on April 30, 1945, enter into a written contract with Harris and Bloom. Under the terms of the contract Harris and Bloom had the exclusive authority to solicit ads for the “Post Office Custodian”, had authority to pay from the proceeds certain expenses, and the profits were to be' divided equally between Harris and Bloom and the National Association of Post Office Custodial Employees. Plaintiff testified that he received nothing for entering into this contract and that there was nothing fraudulent about the contract. This testimony was undisputed.</p>

This official told Montgomery that it was his duty to protect the government from fraud and that he would have to make an investigation. Montgomery then went to Pittsburgh, consulted a lawyer and had a conference with Dennison. Montgomery demanded that Dennison make a retraction and undo as far as possible the harm that he had done him. Plaintiff claimed that Dennison offered to make a retraction. Dennison denies this, and declared that he wanted to investigate whether or not this plaintiff was acting in good faith. Plaintiff testified that his reputation suffered from the defamatory letters Dennison sent out to about ten people. He also claimed that he paid out $50 for attorney fees, $40 for a trip to Pittsburgh and $8 or $9 for other expenses,</p>

It is argued here that the Better Business Bureau had certain information with reference to this plaintiff and it was part of their duty to protect the members of this Association of custodians down in Philadelphia, and that the proper way to do that was to notify officers in charge of that Association that some endeavor, which they may have believed, had existed to get money fraudulently from that Association. ... if you believe there was reasonable and probable cause to send the letters, then, under those circumstances, this defendant brings himself within a privilege in the law and you should not find a verdict in the case for the plaintiff unless you find that the defendant abused that privilege.</p>

Now, compensatory damages are damages allowed to compensate the plaintiff for some loss; in this case the loss he has suffered in his reputation and this one hundred dollar expense,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> if you believe that was caused by the conduct of the defendant. ... If you allow compensatory damages then say a certain amount for compensatory damages, and another amount for punitive damages.” This was not an adequate charge in respect to the general damages which the plaintiff stressed in his statement of claim (as above quoted). Plaintiff said nothing in his Statement of Claim about “$100 expenses.” The trial judge further said: “Punitive damages are damages which a jury may give in a proper case by way of penalty to the defendant. In other words, it is punishment. You give punitive damages, perhaps, to teach a lesson to somebody not to do this sort of thing again. The plaintiff in this case, in addition to claiming compensatory damages, asks you to give puni<a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>tive damages too.'

The court in its opinion refusing defendants’ motions for judgment non obstante verdicto and for a new trial stated: “. . . the jury was justified in finding that Dennison was recklessly indifferent to the harm which Montgomery might suffer as a result of the letter.

Dennison’s training and experience should have made him alert in distinguishing between well-supported and ill-supported accusations; his warring against frauds should have made him cautious in putting the fraud label on anyone on evidence which was discredited by the anonymity of its origin. It does not require either superior intelligence or extensive experience to acquaint one with the fact that no reliance whatever can be placed on anonymous communications charging others with substantial wrong-doing. Anyone who accuses another of wrong-doing but is not willing to stand behind his accusations and furnish evidence to support it commands respect neither for himself nor for his accusations. If honorable reputations can be blasted by “broadcasting” charges received either by telephone or by letter from persons unknown, no individual’s reputation is safe. Any fair man before crediting any calumniating statement made against another will ask the defamer <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>to either confront the individual calumniated or to furnish competent evidence in support of the defamatory statement. When recklessness in conduct or spoken or written communications cause harm to another, the party responsible must answer in damages. It has often been said by this court that malice does not necessarily mean a particular ill-will toward another; it comprehends in certain cases <em>“recklessness of consequences </em>and a <em>mind regardless of social duty.” </em>

Rather, it aggravates it. The fact that he was acting in the capacity stated added weight to the publication of the accusation. If he had written to Chief Inspector Donaldson and the eight others merely as an individual his accusation would have been much less impressive. For example, if a member of the F.B.I. would write to the Attorney General of the United States stating that he had heard from a “Mr. Callahan” that a certain “vicious combination” (giving the names) had paid $1,000 to some Federal official to influence the latter’s official action, such a communication would receive attention proportionate to the importance of the position of the man who made it.</p>
