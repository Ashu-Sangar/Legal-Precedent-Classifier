    <p id="b234-5" data-blocks='[["BL_234.8",234,[305,732,1150,532]]]'>The original bill was filed on June 2, 1948. Preliminary objections raising the defense of the Statute of Frauds (Act of March 21, 1772, 1 Sm. L. 389, 33 PS 1) were sustained and the bill dismissed. On appeal to this Court, the decree was reversed, the bill reinstated, and the record remitted to afford an opportunity to amend by averring facts sufficient to take the case out of the Statute of Frauds and for further proceedings consistent with the Rules of Equity Practice: <em>Haskell v.

Alfred Richard, acting for the White Fathers of Africa, Inc., and had deposited in escrow with the Exchange Bank and Trust Company, Franklin, Pennsylvania, a deed of conveyance to him for the property dated February 4, 1948; that in reliance upon her mother’s oral promises and representations she had sold securities, some of them at considerable loss, to obtain the sum of $35,000 which she tendered to her mother as down payment on February 13,1948; and that subsequent to filing of the original bill in equity, she sold additional securities and forwarded to her mother checks in payment of the full purchase price in the alleged amount of $125,000, <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>which checks her mother held lor a period of five weeks before returning them. Preliminary objections were again filed to the amended bill raising the defenses of the Statute of Frauds and adequate remedy at law. Pending disposition of the preliminary objections Mrs. Haskell filed a petition under the Acts of June 25, 1895, P. L. 279, 28 PS 6, and June 8, 1911, P. L. 709, 28 PS 9, for a rule to show cause why the testimony of Mrs. Heathcote should not be taken <em>de bene esse </em>by deposition, averring, <em>inter alia, </em>that if Mrs. Heathcote were required to testify under oath, she would admit the alleged oral contract. A responsive answer was filed in which Mrs. Heathcote specifically denied that she had entered into an oral contract for the sale of “River Ridge Farm” to her daughter as alleged. The court discharged the rule and entered a decree dismissing the amended bill. This appeal followed.</p>

To hold otherwise would be tantamount to setting aside the Statute of Frauds. Nor are the averments as to appellant’s tender of'the purchase price and sale of securities in reliance on the oral representations sufficient to entitle appellant to specific performance. Our law is very explicit as to the requirements which must be met to take an oral contract for <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>tlie sale of real estate out of the statute. While a refusal to perform may entitle the vendee to recover in damages, it is well settled that the statute prevents the entry of a decree of specific performance against the vendor under the oral contract, if he elects to invoke it, unless it appears that continuous and exclusive possession was taken under the contract <em>and </em>improvements were made by the vendee not readily to be compensated in money, or other equitable considerations make it impossible to do justice save by specific performance: <em>Axe v.

The object of the statute is to prevent the assertion of verbal understandings in the creation of interests or estates in land and to obviate the opportunity for fraud and perjury. It is not a mere rule of evidence, but a declaration of public policy. In the absence of equities sufficient of themselves to take the case out of the statute, it operates as a limitation upon judicial authority to afford a remedy unless renounced or waived by the party entitled to claim its protection. See <em>Brotman v. Brotman, </em><a href="/pa/353/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="353 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="465705" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0570-01">353 Pa. 570</a>, 573, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20A.2d%20175" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="46 A.2d 175">46 A. 2d 175</a>. Both parties are presumed to have known that either might take advantage of the terms of the statute. Appellant had the same right as her mother to refuse to perform the alleged oral agreement, and in availing herself of that right the latter is guilty of no fraud or wrongdoing cognizable by a court of equity: <em>Davis v.

These decisions do not apply in the situation here presented. In answer to the petition to take her deposition <em>de bene </em>esse, Mrs. Heathcote, the titleholder, denied existence of the alleged oral contract and there is no contrary admission by her of record in the proceedings to constitute a waiver. She elected to invoke the statute, as was her right, and gave appellant timely notice of such election by filing preliminary objections to the bill. Without a renunciation or waiver of the protection of the statute, within the rule of the cases cited by appellant, specific performance could not be awarded in the absence of facts sufficient to fulfill the explicit requirements which must be met to take the contract out of the operation of the statute. Since appellant failed to aver such facts, although given ample opportunity so to do, there is nothing to take-the case out of the general rule of law that an action for damages is the remedy against a vendor of real estate under an oral contract unperformed.</p>

In numerous equity cases arising both before and since promulgation of Pa. R. C. P. No. 1030, the practice of raising the Statute of Frauds by preliminary objections has been permitted without question. See <em>Axe v. Potts, </em>supra; <em>Sneiderman v.
