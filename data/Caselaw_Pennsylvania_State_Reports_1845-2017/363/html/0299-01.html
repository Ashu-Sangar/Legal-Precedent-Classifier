On May 8, 1939, the Commonwealth met this objection by stipulating to judgment one of such appeals which had been filed by the Philadelphia Felt Company to No. 624, Commonwealth Docket 1938, from a settlement of its 1935 corporate net income tax account, in which interest on United States securities had been subjected to tax in the manner referred to above.</p>

As a result of this stipulation, the Department of Revenue, in a ruling issued June 28, 1939, provided that, in those cases in which taxpayers had claimed a deduction for interest on United States securities in Petitions for Resettlement involving the tax years 1935 to 1937, inclusive, the interest on United States securities should be deducted in full from the “net income” before computing the tax. This ruling of the Department of Revenue further provided that, for the tax year 1938 and thereafter, interest on United <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>States securities should he deducted from the net income in all cases of original settlement.</p>
    <p id="b353-3" data-blocks='[["BL_353.4",353,[135,400,1157,1752]]]'>Due to the fact that the stipulation in the case of Commonwealth v. Philadelphia Felt Company was not made until May 8, 1939, settlements or resettlements of the Pennsylvania Corporate Tax so as to exclude interest from United States securities from the Pennsylvania tax base were made for the years 1936, 1937 and 1938. This adjustment was effected by means of an “independent deduction” of all interest received on United States securities from the net income figure previously filed by the corporate taxpayers, but the Pennsylvania tax forms themselves were not amended. Beginning with the taxable year 1939, an additional portion of the federal corporate income tax return form was incorporated in the Pennsylvania tax form which amendment consisted of adding two lines used on the federal form to arrive at “adjusted net income”. “Adjusted net income” was at this time utilized in the federal form as the base in computing the “normal tax” on corporate income as distinguished from “surtax”. Prior to 1941 interest on United States securities was included in computing “net income” on the federal forms but this interest was deducted from “net income” in arriving at “adjusted net income” on which “normal tax” was payable. As a result, “adjusted net income” was “net income” less interest on United States obligations. See 26 U. S. C. A. Internal Revenue Acts, 1924 to date, 1938 Act. p. 1001, et seq. §13(a). The effect of using federal “adjusted net income” as a base for the Pennsylvania Corporate Income Tax resulted in automatically eliminating all interest on United States securities from the Pennsylvania tax base. This method was used in 1939 and 1940.</p>

As a result of this statute, the interest on practically all United States securities, issued on or after March 1,1941, became wholly subject to Federal income tax liability — both normal tax and sur-tax. It followed that interest on United States securities issued on or after March 1,1941, was no longer included in the deduction of interest on United States securities <em>used in the Federal return in arriving at “adjusted net </em>incomeBecause of the foregoing, the utilization by this Commonwealth of the taxpayer’s <em>federally found </em>“adjusted net income” <em>as the Pennsylvania tax base </em>became ineffective to exclude from such base interest on United States securities issued on or after March 1, 1941.</p>

Maryland had enacted a statute which required any bank doing business in that State, but not chartered by the legislature thereof, to issue its notes only upon paper bearing stamps of specified denominations. This paper was sold by the State and payment of the amounts indicated by the stamps was required at the time of purchase of the paper. The statute provided that any institution could relieve itself of the necessity of complying with the foregoing requirements by paying the annual sum of $15,000 to the State. In striking down the Maryland statute Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the United States Supreme Court, said: <em>. . </em>the power to tax involves the power to destroy; ... If the States may tax one instrument, employed by the government in the execution of its powers, they may tax any and every other instrument. . . . This was not intended by the American people. They did not design to make their government dependent on the States. . . . The Court has bestowed on this subject its most deliberate consideration. The result is a conviction that the States have no power, by taxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burden, or in any manner control, the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by Congress to carry into execution the powers vested in the general government. This is, we think, the unavoidable consequence of that supremacy which the constitution has declared.”</p>

This would exempt their full value rather than a proportion of their taxed value as ascertained by the use of the proportional method above described.

That would be an extreme case, the conclusion hardly doubtful. Even though hostility were not so pointed as in the case supposed, there might still be an invidious distinction if securities in substantial competition with evidences of indebtedness issued by the national government had been given a preferred position. Nothing of the kind appears.” Justice Cardozo adds: “The situation, then, is this. Vast classes of securities — bonds and notes of every kind, as well as shares of stock in many and varied enterprises — are in the same position for the purpose of the tax in suit as government bonds and notes. The few investments that occupy a different position are not comparable in kind or in attractiveness to the obligations of the government and do not substantially compete with them. To hold that there was discrimination here in any forbidden sense is to hold that bonds and notes of the United States must be deducted from the value of the shares if there is a deduction of any form of investment, no matter how <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>minute in amount or alien in quality. . . . discrimination . . . must be so marked as to justify the inference that it was unfriendly in design or at the very least it must favor forms of investment that are in substantial competition with government securities.”</p>

The interest on these bonds was exempt from the Wisconsin income tax imposed upon the corporation, but the taxpayer was taxed with respect to the dividends received from the corporation. Speaking through Justice Holmes the United States Supreme Court said: “If the avowed purpose <em>or self-evident operation of a statute is to follow the bonds of the United States </em>and to make up for its inability to reach them directly by indirectly achieving the same result, the statute must fail even if but for its purpose <em>or special operation </em>it would be perfectly good.” (Italics supplied)</p>

In that case a New York statute taxed each domestic, corporation of certain classes for the privilege of exercising its franchise in that State. The tax was payable in advance for each year beginning November 1st, and was at a specified rate on so much of the corporation’s entire net income for its preceding fiscal year as was, under other provisions, allocated to its business carried on within the State. Net income was defined as embracing income <em>from any source, </em>and entire net income as meaning the total net income, including all dividends received on stocks and all interest received from <em>federal, state, municipal or other bonds. </em>The income upon which the tax was measured in that case was derived in part from copyrights by the United States. It was held that the tax <em>as measured </em>was not void as a tax on federal instrumentalities. The Supreme Court said, in an opinion by Justice Stone : “But the nature of a tax must be determined <em>by its operation </em>rather than by particular descriptive language which may have been applied to it.

This meant that a portion of the company’s taxed income amounting to $54,552 (after the required statutory allocation) was income derived from federal securities. Since there are approximately 38,000 corporations paying the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax and since a large proportion of these corporations presumably derive a portion of their income from their holdings of United States securities, it can be readily seen that for Pennsylvania to tax <em>these </em>securities while it does not tax <em>its own, </em>will to a very substantial degree impair the marketability of national securities in Pennsylvania. A discrimination effecting such a result cannot be dismissed as merely “casual or incidental” (as the appellant asserts). The United States Supreme Court has never hesitated to <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>strike down such state discrimination against national securities. Nor is there any merit in the contention that this discrimination was <em>not intended </em>by Pennsylvania but resulted from the passage of the Public Debt Act. The constitutionality of any statute cannot be determined by a consideration of the motives behind its enactment. As the Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly pointed out, while a taxing act’s character in respect to its being discriminatory against federal securities may be determined by its expressed or implied intention, <em>it may also be determined by its operation and effect. </em>Taxing acts (like human acts) usually take their character from their consequences.</p>
