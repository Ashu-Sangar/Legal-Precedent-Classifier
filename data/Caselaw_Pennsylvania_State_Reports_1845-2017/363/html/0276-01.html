Paragraph (a) of Sec, 801 prescribes the <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>voting strength at the general election, preceding the primary, necessary to be shown in order to entitle “a political party within the State” to have its name automatically go upon a ballot at the subsequent primary for the purpose of nominating its candidates for office, and, paragraph (b) of the same section prescribes the voting strength at either the general or municipal election preceding the primary, necessary to be shown in order to entitle “a political party within said county” to have its name automatically go upon a ballot at the subsequent primary for the purpose of nominating its candidates for office.</p>

The Progressive party, being “a political party within the State”, Avas entitled to nominate its candidates for office at the September primary in eArery one of the sixty-seven counties of the State the same as the Republican and Democratic parties Avere entitled to do. Sec. 801(a) expressly provides that “a political party within the State . . . <em>shall </em>nominate <em>aill </em>its candidates for <em>a,ny </em>of the offices provided for <em>in this </em>act,...” (Emphasis supplied). And, upon turning to Sec. 602 of the Election Code (25 PS §2752), we find that the officers provided for in this Act, to be elected at a municipal (odd-numbered year) election, are “All judges of courts of record of the various judicial districts and counties, and all county, city, borough, township, ward, school district, poor district and elections officers . . ,” and judges of the Supreme and Supe<a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>rior Courts who may also be elected at a general (even-numbered year) election. There are, therefore, no offices within any county for which nominations may not be made on the primary ballots of a political party qualified as a party within the State under Sec. 801(a). In short, a party that is a political party within the State under Sec. 801(a) is at once a political party in every county of the State. The scope given Sec. 801 by the court below far exceeded its intent and purpose.</p>
    <p id="b331-3" data-blocks='[["BL_331.4",331,[136,800,1149,645]]]'>The effect so accorded Sec. 801 by the court below patently disregarded the express provisions of Secs. 952 and 976, in violation of the rule of construction that a statute is to be construed so as to give effect, if possible, to all of its parts: see Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, Sec. 51, 46 PS §551. The court’s action in such regard is all the more incongruous when it is perceived that Sec. 801 has nothing whatsoever to do with the contents of nomination papers, restrictions on the use of party names or the rejection of offending nomination papers, as do Secs. 952 and 976 which Sec. 801 was permitted below to vitiate.</p>

Sec. 801 was designed to prevent election ballots and voting machinery from being cluttered with the names of inactive or defunct political parties and their candidates, — a condition that can become especially serious in connection with voting machines: cf. <em>Davidowitz v. Philadelphia County, </em><a href="/pa/324/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="324 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1171326" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0017-01">324 Pa. 17</a>, 20-21, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.%20585" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="187 A. 585">187 A. 585</a>. Paragraph (b) of Sec. 801 was inserted in order to allow any political group or body in a county, not sufficiently numerous in the State to be able to qualify as “a political party within the State”, to have its name automatically appear on a primary ballot if it polled in the county at the preceding general or municipal election the number of votes required by <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>paragraph (b) of Sec. 801 to qualify it as a political party within such county. In no way is Sec. 801 concerned with the organization and operation of political parties or their traditions. The section is a part of an election and ballot law whose historical background has been a constant break with tradition in furtherance of statutory election reform. Sec. 952, which contains the prohibition against the use by a political body of an identical or deceptively similar name to that of an existing political party, makes no distinction whatsoever between a political party within the State under paragraph (a) of Sec. 801 and a political party within a county under paragraph (b). The inhibition of Sec. 952 goes to the use in nomination papers of any name “identical with or deceptively similar to the words used for a like purpose by any existing political party <em>as defined by section 801 </em>of this act . . .” (Emphasis supplied). It makes no difference whether such existing party qualified as a political party under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of Sec. 801. All that is required to save a party’s name from being imitated or pirated is that it be a political party as defined by Sec. 801. The Progressive party being such, its name could not lawfully be used in any nomination <em>papers </em>(to be distinguished from nomination <em>petitions) </em>in Pennsylvania in 1949. When thus read together, Sec. 801 and Sec. 952 help effectuate the legislative intent and purpose of the statute as a whole.</p>

It will be borne in mind that the County Board of Elections had to provide official Progressive party ballots for use at the September 1949 primary. The certification by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, above referred to, <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>made that certain. And, in the very same certification, the Secretary had also certified each, the Republican party and the Democratic party, as “a political party within the State” and, as such, entitled to nominate its candidates at the September 1949 primary. Certainly, the ballots for the two major parties had to allow for the nomination of their candidates for <em>all </em>offices to be voted for within the county at the ensuing election: see Sec. 801(a). Plainly enough, therefore, the ballots furnished by the Board of Elections to Progressive party voters could not have provided for any less. The registered voters of that party were not to be handed a bobtail ballot limiting them to the nomination of candidates for State office only Avhile registrants of the Republican and Democratic parties could, by their ballots, vote for candidates for each office for which nominations Avere to be made in the respective election districts of the county. Art. VIII, Sec. 7, of the State Constitution provides that “All laws regulating the holding of elections . . . shall be uniform throughout the State.” That provision is as applicable to a primary election as it is to a general or municipal election. See <em>Winston v. Moore, </em><a href="/pa/244/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="244 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="1003531" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0447-01">244 Pa. 447</a>, 461-462, <a href="/citations/?q=91%20A.%20520" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="91 A. 520">91 A. 520</a>; and <em>Wasson v.

To be uniform in the constitutional sense, such a laAV must treat all persons in the same circumstances alike: see <em>Winston v. Moore </em>at p. 461 and cases there, cited. It is beyond question that the County Board of Elections was under a duty to provide, for use at. the September primary, a Progressive party ballot. AVhose facilities for making nominations (even though by write-ins) were not one bit inferior to the nominating facilities of the ballots furnished voters of the major parties.</p>

Witness, then, the utter confusion that would have ensued had the lower court’s direction to the Board of Elections to accept and file the plaintiffs’ nomination papers been followed. As is well known, the names of candidates nominated by <em>papers </em>do not go upon a primary ballot. They appear directly on the election ballot under the party name pre-empted by the <em>papers. </em>With nominations made at the primary on ballots of the Progressive party as a party within the State and with nominations of candidates for some of the same offices supplied by the nomination <em>papers, </em>the result would have been an insurmountable impasse. There could have been no merger of the two (both Progressive) groups of candidates. That is particularly obvious where the candidates nominated at the primary and those nominated by <em>papers </em>for the same offices were not the same persons, as actually happened to be the case in several instances in the record now before us. The confusion that would have followed had the nomination papers been given legal effect is thus evident enough. Certainly, the legislature is not to be presumed to have intended any such result: see Sec. 52(1) of the Statutory Construction Act, supra.</p>

The contention is without merit and stems from the underlying fallacy of the appellees’ argument throughout that a political party within the State is not a political party for any county of the State. The phrase “for a like purpose” in Sec. 952 means the nomina<a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>tion of candidates for public office without regai-d to whether the nominations are for State office or municipal office. Sec. 976, which prohibits the acceptance by county boards of election of nomination papers containing an identical or deceptively similar name to that used by an existing political party, recognizes no such distinction as that urged by the appellees.
