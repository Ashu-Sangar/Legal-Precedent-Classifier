    <p id="b99-10" data-blocks='[["BL_99.10",99,[157,998,1150,969]]]'>The appellant filed a bill in equity for the cancellation of a deed purported to be executed by Waclaw Paprocki, father of the appellant, during his lifetime, which conveyed to his son, Walter Paprocki, and the latter’s wife, Cora Paprocki, certain real estate in the Borough of Arnold, Westmoreland County. The consideration set forth was $3200.00. Waclaw Paprocki died on April 25, 1948. Five days later the above deed was recorded in Westmoreland County. Appellant then filed a bill, asking that the deed be set aside, and alleged, inter alia, fraud and undue influence, mental incapacity on the part of the grantor and lack of consideration. On May 25, 1948, there was filed what purported to be the last will and testament of Waclaw Paprocki in the Office of the Register of Wills of Westmoreland County, and in this Will, he devised, inter alia, the above mentioned property to Walter Paprocki, one of the appellees. This Will was dated February 8, 1944.</p>

At the close of appellant’s testimony the appellees moved to dismiss the bill and the Chancellor granted the motion. The matter was later heard by the court en banc.

The exceptions were placed on the argument list and heard by the court en banc. The exceptions were overruled in an opinion filed by Judge Bauer and a final decree was entered.</p>
