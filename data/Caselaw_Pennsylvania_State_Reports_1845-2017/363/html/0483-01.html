Van Tassell was engaged by plaintiffs to buy and sell automobiles on their behalf, they being dealers in used cars. On May 27, 1947, he received from them the sum of $3,100 for the purpose of purchasing certain automobiles; of this amount he returned the sum of $450 but fraudulently withheld and embezzled the balance, $2,650, which he converted to his own use. Plaintiffs brought the present suit against the bonding company to recover that amount. Defendant claimed that Van Tassell was not an employee of plaintiffs within the meaning of the bond but an independent contractor.</p>

He was to receive $50 commission on each car I directed him to buy. He ivas to work from 9:00 o’clock in the morning until 6:00 o’clock at night, and I directed him to go within an area or radius of 150 miles, to locate and inspect ears. He was to call me on the telephone, reverse the charges, describe the condition of the car, and the price that he elected, and I would then advise him to come to the office where I would give him the money for the car and he would go and bring the car in. . . . At the end of each day’s work, he was to call me on the telephone, or report in person if he was close to the office, and tell me his day’s activities. At that time I could then direct him where to go the following day to conduct the following day’s work.” Van Tassell paid for <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>Ms own meals, hotel Mils, oil and gasoline, and for the upkeep of his car.

And if, instead of using the legal standards thus prescribed for the determination of the question, we turn to the provisions of the bond itself, the same result inevitably follows.</p>

He was clearly not a broker, nor a factor, nor a commission merchant, nor a consignee, nor a contractor, nor an agent or representative “of the same general character”. He thus came wholly within the express terms of the bond itself.</p>
    <p id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.4",536,[342,1157,1152,1053]]]'>A case strikingly similar to the present is <em>Magarian v.

There the person whose status was in question had the duty of locating, inspecting and buying citrus fruit for a packing concern; he had no authority to use his independent judgment in determining whether or not he would buy any particular fruit, that decision remaining entirely with the employers; neither did the work require his entire time, but he was to go where the employers directed and do what they required; he received compensation on a percentage basis for all fruit which was bought through his services. Pointing out that the method of determining the amount of his compensation had no controlling effect in the case, that his services could have been terminated at any time with or without cause, and that the employment was in the business of the employer, the court held that he occupied the status of employee and not that of an independent contractor.</p>

      <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>Defendant makes much of the fact that plaintiffs filed no reports, as far as Van Tassell was concerned, of social security, federal income, or city wage taxes, nor made any deductions of such taxes from his compensation ; it is urged that this indicates that plaintiffs did not regard him as being their employee. To this contention it may be answered, in the first place, that the determining factor is not the way in which plaintiffs or Van Tassell may have regarded their relationship but what it really was under the facts and the applicable rules of law: see <em>Magarian v. Southern Fruit Distributors, </em><a href="/fla/146/0773-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="146 Fla. 773" data-case-ids="1935812" data-case-paths="/fla/146/0773-01">146 Fla. 773</a>, 778, <a href="/fla/146/0773-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="146 Fla. 773" data-case-ids="1935812" data-case-paths="/fla/146/0773-01">1 So. 2d 858</a>, 861; 27 Am. Jur. p. 503, §23. Another answer is that the failure to file such reports and make such deductions was explained by one of the plaintiffs, who testified that Van Tassell was in their employ for a period of only two weeks during the middle of a month and that it was only at the end of each month that an accountant would prepare their records and provide for such deductions. This explanation was for the consideration of the jury, to whom the learned trial judge submitted it. A witness may always explain an apparent inconsistency in his position: <em>Maculuso v.
