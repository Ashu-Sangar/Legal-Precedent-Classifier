After Mrs. Hummel’s death she continued to live in the property occupied by Hummel as his housekeeper, and remained in that capacity until his death. Her claim, as set forth in her petition, is that four days after Mrs. Hummel’s death Hummel orally requested her to live in his house, perform for him all the duties of a housekeeper, and, during his illness, nurse and take care of him during the remainder of his life; in return he orally agreed to make a will giving and conveying to her for such services all of his property, real and personal; she orally agreed to his request and, relying on his promise, remained with him from 1939 until his death in 1947, performing the household work, nursing him from time to time, and assisting him by financial advancements, for all of which services and advancements she received no compensation at the time. Hummel died without a will. Claimant prayed for a decree of specific performance of the alleged agreement. This the court below refused, but it awarded claimant the sum of $3,888 as compensation for the services she rendered decedent and the sum of $800 in satisfaction of her claim for money loaned to him.

There were four witnesses upon whose testimony she relies for that purpose. Of these, a Mrs. Williams testified that decedent said: “I’ll take care of her”; a Mrs. Deppen testified that decedent said: “I don’t know why she wants to go to work, because after I’m gone there will be enough there for her”; a Mrs. Hastings testified that decedent said “he would take care of her.” Such loose and vague declarations of testamentary intentions certainly do not constitute a contract and are wholly insufficient to warrant a recovery: <em>Roberts Estate, </em><a href="/pa/350/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="350 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="461201" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0467-01">350 Pa. 467</a>, 472, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.2d%20592" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="39 A.2d 592">39 A. 2d 592</a>, 594. The only testimony in regard to an agreement between claimant and decedent was given by her daughter, a Mrs. Meier, who stated that on one occasion, while visiting her mother, she asked decedent, in her mother’s presence, “if he was paying her, and he said ‘no’. He had made an agreement with her. He was going to give her the property. He was going to make a will, and I should consider that place as my home.” She also testified that he repeatedly said that “he was going to fix everything for her [Mrs. Stafford] and make a will so she wouldn’t have to worry about the rest of her life <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>like lie had to worry about his,” and that “he always assured me he was going to take care of my mother; that he was going to make a will.” It should be immediately obvious, even accepting all of this testimony as true, that it falls far short, both quantitatively and qualitatively, of establishing claimant’s case. While decedent is said to have referred to an “agreement” there is nothing to show that his promise to “give her the property” was in return for any promise on her part to work for him until his death or that there was any other consideration necessary to create a <em>contract; </em>it does not appear that his statement that he was “going to make a will” was anything more than a voluntary declaration on his part, lacking wholly the binding force of a contractual obligation (cf. <em>Reynolds, Executrix, v. Williams, Executor, </em><a href="/pa/282/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="282 Pa. 148" data-case-ids="1088408" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0148-01">282 Pa. 148</a>, 152, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20A.%20473" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="127 A. 473">127 A. 473</a>, 474). Moreover, Mrs. Meier’s testimony does not support Mrs. Stafford’s claim that decedent was to will her “all of his property”, since it refers only to the property in which she was then living with him. The fact, too, that decedent allegedly declared that Mrs. Meier was “to consider that place as my [her] home” necessarily militates against the acceptance of her testimony, in that, in addition to her being claimant’s daughter (cf. <em>Smith Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/162/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="162 Pa.
