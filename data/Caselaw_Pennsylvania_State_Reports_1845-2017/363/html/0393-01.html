Plaintiff is mortgagee of a purchase money mortgage made by Robert Wasyl, dated October <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>6, 1928, securing a debt payable in three years. After reducing the principal to $1,700, he conveyed the mortgaged property to the defendant, Galasso, in 1937 subject to the balance due, Galasso assuming and agreeing to pay the debt. Such liability continues until the debt is paid: <em>Kirker v. Wylie, </em><a href="/pa/207/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="207 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="933624" data-case-paths="/pa/207/0511-01">207 Pa. 511</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.%201074" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="56 A. 1074">56 A. 1074</a> (1904). In 1945, after expiration of the mortgage term, defendant conveyed the property to Maurice Murphy, who also assumed and agreed to pay the debt. Wasyl died in 1937; the mortgage has not been foreclosed; no proceedings to collect were taken against him; no letters testamentary or of administration have issued. We have, then, a suit by the mortgagee against the mortgagor’s grantee who had assumed a continuing liability and had conveyed the property to another. The defendant has not averred that his conveyance was bona fide though we predicate nothing on that omission.</p>

The mortgagee sues directly in her own name. By the second section of the Act of 1878, “The right to enforce such personal liability shall not enure to any person other than the person with whom such an agreement is made, etc.’ [the rest of the section is quoted below<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>]. As the plaintiff mortgagee is not a person with whom the covenant in the deed from Wasyl to Galasso was made, she is directly excluded by the statute from bringing an action against Galasso to enforce the agree<a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>ment; and as the statute must be strictly pursued, she cannot maintain her present suit.”</p>
    <p id="b444-4" data-blocks='[["BL_444.4",444,[313,407,1150,753]]]'>In other words, defendant contends that section 2 of the Act of June 12, 1878, P. L. 205, 21 PS 655, 656, disqualified plaintiff-mortgagee from enforcing, in this suit, defendant’s promise to pay the debt. He contends that, within the words of the statute, he “has bona fide parted with the encumbered property” and that his assumption was not a “continuing liability.” This contention was properly rejected by the common pleas of Allegheny County, whose judgment for plaintiff was affirmed by the Superior Court: <a href="/pa-super/163/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="163 Pa.

    <p id="b444-5" data-blocks='[["BL_444.5",444,[315,1181,1151,759]]]'>It is settled that by taking “under and subject” without more, the grantee agrees to indemnify his grantor against loss and that a grantee who, (in the words of the Act of 1878) “shall, by an agreement in writing, have expressly assumed a personal liability” for the debt, thereby agrees to indemnify not merely against loss but against liability: <em>Ruzyc et ux. v. Brown et ux., </em><a href="/pa/320/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="320 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="1163688" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0213-01">320 Pa. 213</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=181%20A.%20783" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="181 A. 783">181 A. 783</a> (1936). In taking “under and subject,” the grantee assumes an obligation enforceable when (but not before) the grantor sustains a loss, but in cases of agreement to pay the debt, the grantor’s liability to his creditor may be enforced Avhen the debt matures and remains unpaid, without Avaiting until the grantor has paid.</p>

United Traction Co. of Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/320/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="320 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1163618" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0196-01">320 Pa. 196</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=181%20A.%20775" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="181 A. 775">181 A. 775</a> (1935). The use-suit is familiar procedure, probably originating in this Commonwealth <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>as an incident of administering equity under common law forms. In <em>Ruzyc v.

When the debt matured and defendants failed to pay they became liable on their contract with the grantors. . . .’ The action was properly brought in the name of the grantors to the use of the mortgagee: Britton v. Roth, <a href="/pa/313/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="313 Pa. 352" data-case-ids="1152654" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0352-01">313 Pa. 352</a>, 356; Frey v.

The mortgagee might also have brought suit in her own name as beneficiary of the contract by which defendants expressly assumed payment of the mortgage debt: Fair Oaks Building &amp; Loan Association v.

The argument continues that as Wasyl, the mortgagor, is dead, and as no administration has been raised, there is no nominal or legal plaintiff to consent and therefore his obligation cannot be enforced although he has no defense on the merits. Plis suggestion must be rejected. He has no defense. His agreement to pay the debt which was then overdue, created liability which continued until the debt was discharged; it was a continuing liability as the words were used in section 2 of the Act of 1878; <em>Kirker v. Wylie, </em><a href="/pa/207/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="207 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="933624" data-case-paths="/pa/207/0511-01">207 Pa. 511</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.%201074" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="56 A. 1074">56 A. 1074</a> (1904).

But there will be no advantage in requiring that for the mere purpose of obtaining the name of the personal representative to be used in amending the title to this suit.

Rule 2002 superseded actions to the use as theretofore understood excepting where required by the terms of the rule.
