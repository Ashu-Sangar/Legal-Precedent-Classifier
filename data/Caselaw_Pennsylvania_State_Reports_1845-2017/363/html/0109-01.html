In pursuance of this authority the City of Pittsburgh, on December 1, 1947, enacted an ordinance imposing annual mercantile license taxes upon persons engaged in certain occupations and businesses at the rate of one mill on each dollar of the volume of the annual gross business transacted by wholesale vendors and dealers and two mills in <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>the case of retail vendors and dealers; the terms “dealer” and “vendor” were not to include, however, persons vending articles of their own growth, production or manufacture thereof.

L. 454, to pay, for each establishment operated by them, an annual fee of $10 at the time they apply “for registration and license.” The 1945 Act, which imposed this charge, made it unlawful for any person to operate such an establishment unless it was duly licensed in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p>

We are not in accord with that conclusion. The mere name that may be given in a statute to a tax or a license fee is not determinative of its real nature, and we do not believe that the $10 fee prescribed in the Act of May 11, 1945, P. L. 454, to accompany the application “for registration and license” is a true “license fee” within the meaning of that term as employed in the Act of June 25, 1947, P. L. 1145. A license fee is one exacted for the purpose of regulating an occupation or privilege which <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>is deemed to be in need of public control, and, ordinarily, it is designed for tbe sole purpose of reimbursing the sovereign, in whole or in part, for the necessary expense of enforcing and administering such control; if it exceeded the amount required for that purpose it would become a tax for revenue and cease to be a valid license fee. “A license fee is a charge which is imposed by the sovereign, in the exercise of its police power, upon a person within its jurisdiction for the privilege of performing certain acts and which has for its purpose the defraying of the expense of the regulation of such acts for the benefit of the general public”: <em>Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board v. Publicker Commercial Alcohol Co., </em><a href="/pa/347/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="347 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="1217382" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0555-01">347 Pa. 555</a>, 560, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.2d%20914" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="32 A.2d 914">32 A. 2d 914</a>, 917. It would be wholly absurd to suppose that the charge of $10 imposed by the 1945 Act was intended by the legislature to constitute a license fee in the sense thus indicated, especially in view of the tremendous size of the industry involved and the elaborate inspections which its regulation requires. On the contrary, the charge is obviously one designed to cover merely the clerical expense of registration and issuance of the license certificate. It is of the same nature as the $1 permit fee imposed by the Cigarette Tax Act of May 13, 1947, P. L. 215, as to which we said, in <em>Rice Drug Co. v. Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/360/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="360 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="475081" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0240-01">360 Pa. 240</a>, 244, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.2d%20878" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="61 A.2d 878">61 A. 2d 878</a>, 880, that “Clearly the imposition of this, nominal charge was not intended to be an excise tax for the privilege of selling cigarettes.” It is of the same nature also as of the annual fee of $2 for a mercantile license prescribed in section 3 of the Act of June 20, 1947, P. L. 745, imposing a mercantile license tax in school districts of the first class; that fee was to be paid to the receiver of school taxes or school treasurer, who was to issue the license upon receiving such payment. The fee provided for in the Milk Control Law of April 28, 1937, P. L. 417, was a <em>real </em>license fee, as we held in <em>Pittsburgh Milk Co. v. Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/360/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="360 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="475090" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0360-01">360 Pa. 360</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20A.2d%2049" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="62 A.2d 49">62 A. 2d </a><a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a><a href="/citations/?q=62%20A.2d%2049" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="62 A.2d 49">49</a>, 52, which is the case relied upon by the packers; that fee was a graded one imposed upon milk dealers according to the average quantity of milk daily receive# or produced by them, ranging from a minimum of $1 to a maximum of $5,000, thus indicating that it was intended by way of reimbursement for the expense of supervision and regulation of the milk industry, the burden being placed upon the dealers in the proportions in which the magnitude of their respective business operations required such supervision. The charge here in question is wholly different from the license fee thus exacted of the milk dealers, and we are clearly of opinion that the meat-packers are not entitled to exemption from the City of Pittsburgh mercantile license tax merely because of their $10 payments to the Department of Agriculture. Their liability under the City tax is in all respects the same as under the tax of the School District.</p>
    <p id="b162-4" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[339,1222,1151,1025]]]'>We come, then, to the question as to which of the operations carried on by these meat-packers are in the nature of manufacturing and therefore excluded from liability for the tax both under the ordinance of the City of Pittsburgh and under the Act imposing the mercantile license tax in school districts of the first class. The City ordinance exempts persons who vend articles “of their own growth, production or manufacture,” the Act imposing the school district tax exempts persons who vend articles “of their own growth, produce or manufacture.” The words “production” and “produce” were undoubtedly intended to have the same meaning, and it was held in <em>Rieck-McJunkin Dairy Co. v. Pittsburgh School District, </em><a href="/pa/362/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="362 Pa. 13" data-case-ids="477338" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0013-01">362 Pa. 13</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.2d%20295" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="66 A.2d 295">66 A. 2d 295</a>, that neither the word “growth” nor the word “produce” as used in the Act qualified or enlarged the word “manufacture”; here, therefore, as in that case, our discussion may be confined to the import and application of the word “manufacture”.</p>

The packers appeal from that ruling, but their attack upon it is unjustified. Of the animal carcasses handled in their establishments some, after being skinned and de-haired, are merely halved or quartered and then refrigerated for the purpose of preservation until sold as fresh, unprocessed meat, — beef, mutton, lamb or veal, as the case may be. Others are cut up into their various parts and the different portions subjected to such operations as cleaning, drying, pickling, salting, smoking, boiling, baking and the like, — all in order to prepare them for the market but without causing any appreciable alteration in their sizes, forms, textures, substance or composition. Such treatments do not constitute manufacturing as that term has been construed in repeated decisions of this Court, but are merely processing operations analogous to the milling of grain, the spinning of cotton, or the pasteurizing and homogenizing of milk; curing meat consists merely of drying, salting and smok- . ing it in order to keep it indefinitely in an edible condition and impart to it a desired flavor; it is “the perma<a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>nent halting ... of the destructive processes of nature” : <em>Commonwealth v.

It was there said (pp. 452, 453, A. p. 150) : “From the moment of its separation from the carcass of the animal, the ham remains constantly intact, it retains practically its original shape and size, and neither the curing solution that is ‘pumped’ into it, nor the solution in which it is steeped, nor the chemical preparation with which it is ‘scrubbed’, nor the ultimate ‘smoking’ applied to it, has done anything more in changing the original meat than to modify its color and taste and prevent deterioration and decay; and the purpose and use for which it was originally cut from the carcass as a ham is exactly the same, — to be used as food. In like manner, the recital in the case stated of the methods by which bacon and pickled and dry salt pork are treated to prepare and cure them for the market comprises a similar use of solutions and final smoking ; and, in the matter of skins taken from the animals, these are scraped and soaked in salt, remaining what they were originally, — untanned skins. The methods, labor and skill which actual manufacturing requires are here wholly absent. We find no application of labor or skill whereby the original article has been changed to a new and different substance to be put to a use not intended for the original.”</p>

In our opinion, none of these products is a manufactured article. <em>Lard </em>is hog fat cooked in tanks under steam pressure whereby the rendered fats are drawn off to the top and separated from the water and other residue; it is then refined, bleached, mixed with a preservative ingredient, textured and packaged; sometimes it is also hydrogenated.
