The Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia, two judges dissenting, sustained exceptions to the appraisement by the register of wills. There was allowed as an exempted deduction the balance due by decedent to a bank on his note, secured by collateral consisting, inter alia, of assigned life insurance policies. The policies were on the life of settlor and were payable to designated beneficiaries. The insured reserved the right to assign and to change the beneficiaries. Settlor died. His estate was solvent. The executors paid the debt out of assets of the estate which thus released the collateral, and the policies were re-assigned. The register ruled that when the insured assigned the policies as collateral for his debt, he thereby appropriated the proceeds of the policies (to the extent of the loan) to his estate and made them part of it. The learned hearing judge rejected this contention. He ruled, however, that the trust agreement disclosed an <em>intent </em>by the insured to pay his debt out of the insurance proceeds. The court in banc reversed.. This appeal followed.</p>

In the present case the insurance proceeds were made payable to <em>designated beneficiaries. </em>In <em>Myers’s </em>and <em>Kenin’s Estate, </em>the insurance proceeds were directed to be distributed <em>in accordance with the terms of settlor’s will. </em>Such designation was ambulatory.

    <p id="b598-4" data-blocks='[["BL_598.4",598,[352,404,1151,1248]]]'>The Commonwealth, in support of its contention that the insured appropriated to his estate the amount of the proceeds of the insurance necessary to pay the loan, <em>when he assigned the policies as collateral, </em>relies principally upon <em>Fidelity Trust Company, Admr., v. Union National Bank of Pittsburgh et al., </em><a href="/pa/313/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="313 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1152658" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0467-01">313 Pa. 467</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=169%20A.%20209" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="169 A. 209">169 A. 209</a>. In that case the facts were exceptionally complicated. They need not be herein recited. It will suffice to state that the insured, while insolvent, made fraudulent transfers of insurance policies <em>for the purpose of defrauding his creditors. </em>This Court, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Linn, directed the rescission of the fraudulent transfers and that the insurance fund be paid into the estate for the benefit of general creditors. See discussion of this case by Mr. Chief Justice Maxey in <em>Kenin’s Trust Estate (No. 1), </em>supra, p. 559 et seq. In the present case there was neither allegation nor proof of fraud. The settlor merely reserved the right to change his insurance beneficiaries and to assign the policies. When he assigned the policies <em>as collateral </em>for his loan, he did not thereby transfer the proceeds of the policies (to the amount of the loan) to his estate and thus subject them to transfer inheritance tax.</p>

In that case a husband and wife purchased real estate, taking title as tenants by the entirety. They executed a bond and mortgage, and were therefore jointly and severally liable on the bond. The husband died. The wife thereupon became the sole owner of the encumbered real estate by survivorship. In assessing the transfer inheritance tax on the deceased husband’s estate the widow claimed as a deduction the <em>full amount </em>of the bond. The Orphans’ Court allowed one half the amount of the bond as a deduction. On appeal to this Court the action of the court be<a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>low was affirmed. As Mr. Justice Horace Stern pointed out in Ms opinion: the decedent was, with his wife, personally liable on the bond, which liability continued after his death and constituted a debt of his estate; had collection on the bond been made from the estate, it would have had a right of <em>contribution </em>from the widow for one half; that the right of contribution was, therefore, a taxable asset. In that case the court below, therefore, correctly allowed such deduction in assessing the tax. But this is <em>not </em>the situation in the present case. Decedent (settlor) merely assigned the insurance policies <em>as collateral </em>for his loan. As with any other collateral, when a loan is repaid the collateral is returned to the owner. Had the creditor bank used decedent-settlor’s insurance collateral to liquidate its loan, the designated insurance beneficiaries could have enforced their claim against the estate of the decedent under their right of <em>subrogation, </em>to the same extent as if they had been the original creditor.</p>

If only part of such proceeds were used, it would be only the unused portion which would be returned to the trustees as part of the trust res. This is a reasonable construction of the clause which we adopt. Furthermore, the <em>habendum </em>in this deed was certain and definite. It does not contain the clause found in the recital.
