There is a ‘deadline’ or last day fixed for filing a nominating petition; namely, 20 days before the date of the Primary as provided by Section 953 (25 PS 2913), but there is no last day specifically fixed, either in the Movie Act or the Election Code, for filing a movie referendum petition. It does not seem logical to apply a section dealing with things to be done with respect to a Primary Election to similar things to be done before a Municipal Election. Certainly, it cannot be successfully argued that the date for filing a movie petition with corporate authorities shall be the ‘last day’ for filing, because the petition must thereafter come over to the Election Bureau by certification of those authorities. This, it seems to us, may be done within 60 days of the date of the election.”</p>

Second, the argument is negatived by the fact that the Act governing a referendum on exhibiting motion pictures on Sunday provides that such petition shall be filed with the corporate authorities <em>at least </em>
      <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>
      <em>60 days </em>before the day of any municipal election at which the question is to be submitted for decision. There is nothing ambiguous about that provision and its plain mandate must be recognized and obeyed.</p>
    <p id="b515-3" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[142,541,1155,1271]]]'>If analogies are to be helpful in determining the question before us we can find one in Article V of the Liquor Control Act of June 16, 1937, P.

This Act and the Act providing for a referendum on the subject of Sunday moving pictures furnish evidence of the fact that the legislature in providing for local option referendums on such matters as the sale of liquor and exhibiting motion pictures on Sunday believes that petitions asking for such referendums should be filed at least 60 days before the election date. This 60 day period affords ample time for the filing of objections to the petition, for the court to pass upon the objections, and for public discussion of the desirability or undesirability of the matter to be decided by the referendum. In construing any act which requires construction “good sense and practical utility” are always to be considered: 1 Kent 310.</p>

That is the <em>only “filing” </em>for which the Act provides. What would be the situation in the event that the corporate authorities negligently or fraudulently delayed the <em>certification </em>of the petition to the County Commissioners we need not now decide because here there was no delay. The petition was filed with the City Clerk of Pottsville and was acted upon by the Council of the City of Pottsville, on September 6,1949.

If we now affirmed the order of the court below the vote on the moving picture referendum would be adjudged a nullity, but deciding as we do, that the order of the court was erroneous and should be set aside, the referendum must be adjudged legal and the majority of votes cast in favor of the question submitted must be given the effect prescribed by law.</p>
