        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Walling,\nClause eight of the last will of the late Mitchell Harrison, of Philadelphia, is: \u201cI forgive my son Kearsley and my daughter Nathalie any advances which may be charged against them upon my books as of the date of this will.\u201d Its proper construction as relates to the son, Kearsley, is the only question involved in this appeal by him from the decree of the orphans\u2019 court. Testator died August 19, 1927, having executed the will here in question on May 23d of the same year. He was survived by his widow and by certain children and grandchildren for whom the will provides. Testator kept books in which was entered an account, inter alia, of financial transactions with his son, Kearsley. At the date of the will and also at testator\u2019s death there appeared therein, under the head of \u201cAdvancement Ac.,\u201d amounts totalling $60,000 and under the head of \u201cLoan Ac.\u201d a balance of $12,870.88, and for which latter amount testator held the son\u2019s note dated February 15, 1924. This note was found among testator\u2019s papers and the question is, Was the indebtedness represented thereby forgiven by the eighth clause of the will? We have reached the conclusion, in harmony with that of the majority opinion of the orphans\u2019 court, that it was not.\n\u201cAdvancement,\u201d as a law term, signifies \u201ca pure and irrevocable gift, by a parent, in his lifetime to his child, on account of such child\u2019s share of the estate, after the parent\u2019s decease\u201d: Miller\u2019s App., 31 Pa. 337; Long\u2019s Est., 254 Pa. 370, 375. While one meaning of the word \u201cadvance\u201d is payment before maturity, yet in a broader sense it may include gifts, loans, or advancements. \u201cWhile the word in its strictly etymological significance indicates money paid before or in advance of the proper time of payment, and does not therefore imply a loan, it has been so frequently used as its equivalent that it may be said that the word, whether taken according to its meaning in law or according to its meaning in common usage, includes loans as well as gifts\u201d: 2 C. J. 32. This is quoted with approval in Mosser Co. v. Cherry River B. & L. Co., 290 Pa. 67, 70. 2 C. J. 32 also says that in its strict legal sense the word \u201cadvances\u201d does not include \u201cadvancements,\u201d yet, in the instant case, it manifestly does. The same volume at page 33 refers to the word \u201cadvances\u201d as used in contracts as follows: \u201cWhile the use of the word in contracts has been in many instances construed, the word has no such certain meaning that the court can determine the sense in which the term is used by the parties without examining the contract as an entirety and seeking the aid of the surrounding circumstances and the practical construction of the contract by the parties themselves.\u201d In High\u2019s App., 21 Pa. 283, Mr. Justice Lewis, delivering the opinion of the court, says, inter alia (page 287) : \u201cThe word \u2018advanced\u2019 may mean a \u2018giving beforehand without expectation of recompense\u2019; or, \u2018the furnishing of money or goods in expectation of reimbursement.\u2019 \u201d Had the will here stated as in Wright\u2019s App., 89 Pa. 67, viz.: \u201cI have loaned sundry amounts of money to my children and some of my grandchildren, as hereinafter set forth, which loans I wish to be considered as advances to them, and to be taken as money due from them to me, and in the distribution of my estate amongst them, to be deducted from his, her or their share thereof,\u201d the solution would be easy. In view of the language and circumstances of the case just cited, it was held that the words \u201cloaned\u201d and \u201cadvanced\u201d were used interchangeably. It is also true that the words \u201cadvances\u201d and \u201cadvancements\u201d are sometimes used interchangeably. The question in the instant case is the meaning of the word \u201cadvances\u201d as used by the testator. Keeping in mind that the books to which he refers contain an account of advancements and an entirely separate account of loans, we are not persuaded that he intended to include the loans with the advancements by the words \u201cany advances.\u201d Had he so intended, it could easily have been expressed. Testator\u2019s retention of the note until his death and leaving it as an apparent asset of his estate is a circumstance against the theory that the will forgave the debt thereby secured. We have so held where the contention was that the will converted a loan into an advancement. See Strock\u2019s Est., 158 Pa. 355, 358. True, a will silent as to advancements may operate as a forgiveness of them, yet we are not impressed with the argument that,therefore the expression would be purposeless unless including loans. It was, at least, explanatory and proper as showing testator had not overlooked the advancements. Many expressions in wills are without legal effect, as the direction for the payment of testator\u2019s just debts, or giving the wife all her legal rights. The name of the daughter Nathalie appears in the same clause, which it would not if that word was merely intended to embrace loans: for testator\u2019s books show substantial advancements to her, but no loan is charged against her. We are clear it was intended to embrace the advancements; the only question is whether it was also intended to embrace loans. The parol evidence taken throws no important light on the question here involved. That no authority called to our attention seems to come close to the instant case may result from the fact that the construction of each will depends largely on its own facts. While the question is debatable, we are not convinced that error was committed by the orphans\u2019 court.\nThe decree is affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of appellant.",
