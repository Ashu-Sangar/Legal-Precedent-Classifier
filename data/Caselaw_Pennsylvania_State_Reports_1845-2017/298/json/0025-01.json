The court below awarded the widow \u201c$5,000 and one-half of the remaining residuary estate\u201d; these appeals followed.\nSection 2(a) of the Intestate Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 429, as amended by the Act of July 11, 1917, P. L. 755, provides that, where an intestate leaves a spouse surviving and other kindred, but no issue, if the estate for distribution exceeds in value $5,000, \u201cthe surviving spouse shall be entitled to the sum of five thousand dollars absolutely, to be chosen by him or her from real or personal estate, or both, and in addition thereto shall be entitled to one-half part of the remaining real and personal estate.\u201d\nTestator, instead of stating the exact amount of his property which the widow should take, provided that she should have so much of his estate \u201cas she could claim under the intestate laws.\u201d As said in Carrell\u2019s Est., 264 Pa. 140, 144, this provision \u201ccould not have been more direct had [it] been followed by a recital or specification of the preferences given by law to the widow in cases of intestacy.\u201d In the words of the learned court below, \u201cthe [present] testator in effect says, \u2018even should I die testate, I direct the portion of my wife in my estate shall be the amount which she could claim under the intestate laws if otherwise she fell within its provisions, and this is the method which shall be used in arriving at the determination of her share.\u2019 \u201d\nThe award to the widow is affirmed at the cost of the appellants.",
