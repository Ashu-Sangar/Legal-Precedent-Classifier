The latter is level at and near the crossing and then to the north passes over a hill. The railroad consisting of a main track, on the south of which <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>is a siding, approaches the crossing from the east on an ascending grade. The plaintiff, Hannah Hall Rhodes and her husband, Frederick A. Rhodes, resided in Chester and at about 1:15 on the morning of January 10, 1926, returning home from a social in a Dodge automobile, came from the north down the Concord Road on to the main track, where the automobile was struck by the engine of a westbound passenger train. Mr. Rhodes was killed .and his wife very seriously injured. This suit, brought to recover the damages plaintiff sustained in the death of her husband and on account of her own injuries, resulted in verdicts for plaintiff, upon which judgments were entered, and the defendant has appealed.</p>
    <p id="b130-4" data-blocks='[["BL_130.4",130,[283,1051,1152,1345]],["BL_131.1",131,[156,343,1152,1393]]]'>We will discuss only the question of contributory negligence; because of which, in our opinion, the judgment cannot be sustained. Mr. and Mrs. Rhodes were entirely familiar with the crossing and when they came to within ten feet of the first rail of the main track had an unobstructed view thereof to the east for thirteen hundred and fifty feet. Plaintiff says they stopped the automobile when about six feet from the track. It was a clear, quiet, starlight night. No other train or traffic was moving in the vicinity and nothing to obstruct the view or deaden the sound of the approaching train. Furthermore, it was moving up a grade, where, as matter of common knowledge, the working of an engine can be heard a long distance. In fact plaintiff’s witness, Vernon Hart, testified that he heard the train while it passed over the entire thirteen hundred and fifty feet. This is contradicted only by the bald statement of the plaintiff that neither she nor her husband heard the train. It is as much the traveler’s duty to listen as to look; he is as bound to hear what is audible as to see what is visible. Because of darkness or other obstructions to view, the sense of hearing is often vital. See Hess v. Williamsport, etc., R. R., <a href="/pa/181/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="181 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="891391" data-case-paths="/pa/181/0492-01">181 Pa. 492</a>. In Paul v. P. &amp; R. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/231/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="231 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="973875" data-case-paths="/pa/231/0338-01">231 Pa. 338</a>, the rule as summarized in the syllabus, states: “The unbending rule as to the <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>duty of a traveler on a public highway, as he approaches a railroad crossing over it, is to stop, look and listen. He must listen as well as look, for conditions may be such that though, when he stops at a proper place and looks, he cannot see a coming train, he yet must hear it if he listens. And if he then, in spite of what he hears, walks or drives on into almost instant collision with the train, he is as guilty of contributory negligence as if he had plainly seen its coming.” This principle is also stated in Sefton v. B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa-super/64/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="64 Pa. Super. 218" data-case-ids="457870" data-case-paths="/pa-super/64/0218-01">64 Pa. Superior Ct. 218</a>, 220. As to this, in the instant case there was no conflict in the evidence. It was practically in the open country where at this hour of night there would normally be no sound find so far as the proof shows was none when the automobile stopped, save that of the train. For the traveler to say he did not hear the oncoming train, is as vain as to say he did not see it in broad daylight. If they stopped to listen for the train they must have heard its approach and, in attempting to cross in front of it, took the chances; while if they arove onto the track without stopping to look and listen, of course there could be no recovery.

However, we deem the failure to hear, in the instant case, conclusive proof of contributory negligence. The rule of Carroll v. P. R. R. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=12%20W.N.C.%20348" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="12 W.N.C. 348">12 W. N.

In the instant case, the automobile was struck when near the center of the first track; hence, it had moved only a few feet from where plaintiff says they stopped. Therefore the engine, moving thirty or thirty-five miles an hour, must have been only a few rods away, probably not over a hundred feet, when they attempted to cross the track.</p>

Unfortunately this cannot be done under her testimony, for she says she was sitting with him on the front seat and advising with him as to crossing the track, and says in direct examination: “Q. As I understand it, Mrs. Rhodes, when you came there, and you say that you stopped at that point, when you and your husband were six feet away from that rail, when you were in the front seat, you say you both looked to the left, in the direction in which this train was coming? A. We did. Q. And then you both decided to go forward? A. We did”; and reiterated it on cross-examination. She also says her hearing is good. Her opportunity to control the situation was equal to his. It therefore appears that she voluntarily joined in testing the danger and as he was negligent she was equally so. In such case the wife who encourages her husband to proceed in the face of obvious danger cannot recover: Morningstar v. N. E. Penna. R.

Her failure to do so, even if there had been negligence on the part of the defendant would deprive her of her right of action.” See also Kirschbaum v. P. R. T.
