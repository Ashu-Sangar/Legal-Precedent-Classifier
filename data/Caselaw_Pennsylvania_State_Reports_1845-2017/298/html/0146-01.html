The transfer contemplated was made and the consideration paid. Later, the buyer discovered that misrepresentations had been made, and he filed a bill in equity, demanding that the obligation given be returned and the money consideration be repaid, with interest. The court found as a fact that the statements made to induce the plaintiff to enter into the contract were false, and that the sale had been consummated on the faith thereof for a sum much in excess of the actual value of the property sold, and a final decree was entered as prayed for. The defendant returned the note, but failed to repay the $7,000, as directed, and an attachment was then asked to compel him to do so. After answer filed, the rule was discharged, the court holding that it was without power to proceed as requested. From this order the present appeal has been taken.</p>
    <p id="b174-5" data-blocks='[["BL_174.4",174,[269,1270,1152,1061]]]'>The question before us is the power of a court of equity to enforce by attachment a decree for the payment of money obtained under a contract entered into as a result of false representations made by the defendant. The bill of complaint in the present case was based on the written agreement of sale, and it is the violation of the order to return the purchase price which is made the foundation for the demand for attachment. Section 1 of the Act of July 12, 1842, P. L. 339, provides that “No person shall be arrested or imprisoned on any civil process issuing out of any court of this Commonwealth, in any suit or proceeding instituted for the recovery of any money due upon any judgment or decree founded upon contract, or due upon any contract, express or implied, or for the recovery of any damages for the nonperformance of any contract,” etc. The party injured saw fit to base his claim on the agreement, though an action for deceit might have been instituted. He waived the right to so proceed, and filed his bill to compel repayment to him of the sum advanced.</p>

It is, therefore, obvious to my mind that this action is an evasion of the principle of the Act of 1842. It is not an action founded merely in tort, but an attempt to elude the effect of the contract on the remedy, by seizing hold of a circumstance leading to the contract.” In Com. ex rel. v.
