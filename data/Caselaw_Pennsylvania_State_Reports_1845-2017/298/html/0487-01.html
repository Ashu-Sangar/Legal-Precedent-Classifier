He prosposed to build in its center a one-story garage, 160 by 200 feet, with basement, to accommodate in its entirety about. 400 cars. The entrance was to extend 80 feet from the Pine Street line to the main building. The structure was to be surrounded and enclosed by units of apartment houses, the first starting from its opening on Pine Street and extending thence along the street lines around the block.

The court below found the entire district to be “exclusively residential,” containing no commercial buildings or shops with the exception of a drug store in an apartment house, and that the proposed use to be made of Siegel’s building then under construction was to supply gasoline and to store cars; also that the exterior appearahce of the structure was not objectionable and that the ventilating system designed to remove gases and odors and the other effects from the use proposed would not give the desired protection to the neighborhood.

    <p id="b520-4" data-blocks='[["BL_520.4",520,[287,474,1151,1183]]]'>It is contended, first, that a court of equity has no power to modify a final decree after the term at which it was entered, except by a bill of review based on sufficient grounds. Without discussing the matter at length, we may say, in the first place, that in this State there are no term times in equity. Hence the common law rules as to term time do not apply. Our equity rules providing for a decree nisi, exceptions and final decree contemplate finality apart from term rules in all cases where the nature of the decree calls for finality. An appeal to a higher court may of itself suspend the force of such a decree, but when action is taken by that tribunal affirming the decree, the suspension is lifted and the decree is in full force; if the time for appeal is allowed to run, at the expiration thereof the decree becomes unchangeable as though it had been affirmed on appeal. Rule 78 permits a rehearing, but it must be requested before the time for an appeal expires. Under these proceedings our decrees possess all the attributes of finality, as do those spoken of in Wetmore v. Karrick, <a href="/us/205/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="205 U.S. 141" data-case-ids="3637772" data-case-paths="/us/205/0141-01">205 U. S. 141</a>, 157, and Simmons v.

    <p id="b520-5" data-blocks='[["BL_520.5",520,[286,1669,1151,466]]]'>There are many equitable proceedings that illustrate the general rule, such as specific performance, bills to reform instruments and others. A final decree in such equitable proceeding is unchangeable except possibly through gross mistake to be corrected by a bill of review, and not then if any intervening right has appeared since entering the decree. In all such proceedings the decree calls for definite action and the law presumes such action to follow the order.</p>

    <p id="b521-4" data-blocks='[["BL_521.4",521,[168,579,1155,1453]]]'>An injunction is the form of equitable proceeding which protects civil rights from irreparable injury, either by commanding acts to be done, or preventing their commission, there being no adequate remedy at law. Granting an injunction rests in the sound discretion of the court, that discretion to be exercised under well-established principles, and there are no statutory limitations on the power of the court in relation thereto. While the decree in such action is an adjudication of the facts and the law applicable thereto, it is none the less executory and continuing as to the purpose or object to be attained; in this it differs from other equitable actions. It operates until vacated, modified or dissolved. An injunction contemplates either a series of contiguous acts or a refraining from action. A preventive injunction constantly prevents one party from doing that which would cause irreparable damage to his neighbor’s property rights. The final decree continues the life of such proceeding, not only for the purpose of execution, but for such other relief as a chancellor may in good conscience grant under the law. This is the practical effect of County of Butler v. Pittsburgh, etc. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/298/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="298 Pa. 347" data-case-ids="1120320" data-case-paths="/pa/298/0347-01">298 Pa. 347</a>: “Where there is a final decree contemplating the performance of a series of acts,......the decree......continues the life of the equity proceedings; ......the decree cannot be executed by a bill to revive, nor can it be enforced by mandamus.”</p>

The chancellor in granting it placed the protecting arm of the court about this right and prevented Siegel from using his property in such a way as would injure his neighbors. It was to remain so long as the court felt that protection necessary to complainant’s rights, or until conditions demanded a <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>modification of that protection or its entire removal. The power of the chancellor to modify in such cases cannot be controlled by term rules, otherwise equity would cease to be equity and become a hard and fast taskmaster.</p>

The injunction in this case is purely preventive. It restrains the defendant from doing the prohibited acts, and nothing more. It prevents a threatened injury to, and encroachment on, the rights of the plaintiff. It is not of the nature of a decree or judgment, which, when executed, has served its purpose. Its force and effect continues so long as it shall remain without modification......

We have discussed in Nesbit v. Riesenman, the preceding case (which should be read in connection with this opinion), the basis on which decrees of this nature are entered. It was there stated that the operation of a so-called public garage in an exclusively residential district is a nuisance per se; this was held Avithout regard to the location of the residential district or the class or uses of the buildings making up the residences. The rule was announced in accord with the common law principle and in protection of the common laAV right that an OAvner has the right to the use of his property. Avithout injurious interference from other owners. Later, it was found, through the increased use made of automobiles as a means of transportation, that the employment of property for public garage purposes in or close to business localities had become and was generally considered a necessity and not an outright nuisance; though it might be so conducted or operated as to become one. In applying the common law, we explained the term “residential district,” — and stated that the “nuisance per se” rule was not intended to cover apartments, business houses and dwellings close to commercial centers in cities of larger size; such a location was not “exclusively <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>residential.” See Burke v. Hollinger, <a href="/pa/296/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="296 Pa. 510" data-case-ids="1116676" data-case-paths="/pa/296/0510-01">296 Pa. 510</a>. Still later, following the principle of the common law which through its flexibility adapts itself to changed conditions, we found that the use of buildings for public garage purposes, as described in the present case, in a residential district composed of apartment houses, hotels, schools and clubs, was not to be regarded as a nuisance per se, but might become a nuisance in fact from operation, the latter being left to the sound discretion of the chancellor. We further explained that the “residential district” described in this case, was not an exclusively residential district within the meaning of that term, where the nuisance per se rule would apply to a building built and used as this one was. This fact was not considered on the first appeal. It becomes apparent that the second and third reasons amply justify the modification of the decree, if there is nothing else to prevent it.</p>

We have no doubt that, when the federal Constitution said, “Nor shall any <em>state </em>deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law,” it included all functionaries of state government, judicial as well as political (Scott v. McNeal, <a href="/us/154/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="154 U.S. 34" data-case-ids="3581847" data-case-paths="/us/154/0034-01">154 U. S. 34</a>, 35; Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R.

S. 266</a>), and the courts may not, through judicial decrees or judgments, violate the due process or equal protection clauses. The state cannot, through legislation, take away a vested right secured by a final judgment (Penna. v.

The “term rule,” our rules of court, become peculiarly applicable in the enforcement of the principle (Wetmore v.

Riesenman, supra, we said: “The same reasons that would strike down an act of assembly regulating nuisances as an infringement of rights guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, would, no doubt, condemn a decision of a court that would hold a particular act a nuisance, or its repetition a nuisance per se; that is, that the action is arbitrary, unreasonable or an unjust discrimination.” But, says the federal Supreme Court, “We cannot interfere unless the judgment amounts to a mere arbitrary or capricious exercise of power, or is in clear conflict with those fundamental ‘principles which have been established in our system of jurisprudence for the protection and enforcement of private rights’ ”: American Express Co. v.

An injunction decree does not create a right; it protects the right of the owner to the enjoy<a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>ment of Ms property from injurious interference by the uses of other land. The right protected is an attribute of property existing through the application of common law principles. A decree preventing its injury does not give to the complaining party a perpetual or vested right either in the remedy, the law governing the order or the effect of it. He is not entitled to the same measure of protection at all times and under all circumstances. A decree protecting a property right is given subject to the rules governing modification, suspension or dissolution of an injunction. The decree is an ambulatory one and marches along with time affected by the nature of the proceeding. Two cases illustrate this. In Penna. v. Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co., <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Howard%20421" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="18 Howard 421">18 Howard 421</a>, a bridge across a navigable river was ordered abated and its construction enjoined as being in conflict with the then existing regulations of commerce enacted by congress. Later that body passed an act declaring the bridge a lawful structure. In modifying the injunction, the Supreme Court said: “If the remedy in this case had been an action at law, and a judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff for damages, the right to these would have passed beyond the reach of the power of congress. It would have depended, not upon the public right of the free navigation of the river, but upon the judgment of the court. The decree before us, so far as it respects the costs adjudged, stands upon the same principles, and is unaffected by the subsequent law. But that part of the decree, directing the abatement of the obstruction, is executory, a continuing decree, which requires not only the removal of the bridge, but enjoins the defendants against any reconstruction or continuance. Noav, whether it is a future existing or continuing obstruction depends upon the question whether or not it interferes with the right of navigation. <em>If, in the meantime, since the decree, this right has been modified by the competent authority, </em>so that the bridge is no longer an unlawful obstruction, it is quite plain the de<a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>cree of the court cannot be enforced. There is no longer any interference with the enjoyment of the public right inconsistent with law, no more than there would be where the plaintiff himself had consented to it, after the rendition of the decree. Suppose the decree had been executed, and after that the passage of the law in question, can it be doubted but that the defendant would have had a right to reconstruct it? And is it not equally clear that the right to maintain it, if not abated, existed from the moment of the enactment?” In accord with this is Clinton Bridge, 10 Wallace 454. There is no vested right in an existing law: Mondou v. New York, etc., R. R., <a href="/us/223/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="223 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="3662361" data-case-paths="/us/223/0001-01">223 U. S. 1</a>; 12 C. J. 958.</p>

W. 867</a>, the officials were enjoined from acting as a school district organization. Later the defect in the organization was cured, and in dissolving the injunction the court said: “In the case at bar, plaintiffs had a right to injunctive relief at the time the action was brought, because of the then law; this right, as to the future, rested solely upon the continuance of such law; this was not a vested right, and no decree of the court could make it such; it was subject to be terminated whenever the law changed. The change in the law, therefore, did not deprive any one of a vested right to an injunction, because no one was possessed of such right. The only vested right created by the judgment before us is the right to recover the costs adjudged in favor of the successful party. That a person cannot have a vested right in an injunctional order or decree is made perfectly clear by the opinions in the cases cited above.” What is here said as to the federal Constitution applies to our own. Neither have been breached by the decrees in this case. To reduce the case to a reductio ad absurdum: suppose the neighborhood in which the garage is situated became predominantly a business one, no one living in it but Ladner, could he insist on the continuance of the injunction? His pres<a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>ent contention, if approved, would necessarily result in saying that he could; but it is clear that he could not.</p>

Bearing in mind, however, what we have just discussed with relation to the modification of the final decree, an examination of the record in the light of the principles above set forth is convincing that appellant is in no position to press this objection, even if it was serious, as it was not, as shall be shown. Standing on the record before us, any one of five reasons would be sufficient to prevent our consideration of it. First, the question is not covered by the statement of the questions involved; second, there is not a single assignment of error which raises this contention; third, there is no offer to prove the subject-matter, nor of course is there an exception to such refusal; fourth, ample authority lies in our equity rules for appellant to have taken depositions and placed them on record verifying the facts it is now asserted he was denied the right to show; and, fifth, all appellant desired to prove, as set forth in his paper-book, is of no consequence in the present issue. It is as follows (we quote from the paper-book) : “Plaintiff believes with confidence that they can establish by credible evidence that the traffic situation on Pine Street has greatly changed for the better since the repaving of Spruce Street; that, further, the inevitable injury to their property will continue as long as the entrance of this garage is maintained on Pine Street, conceded to be the most residential of all four streets surrounding the garage.” In addition to the fact that the latter part of this offer was always before the court, what he wishes to prove is what would happen as a result of the operation of this garage.</p>

A§ operation becomes the decisive factor, we suggest that the manner in which the place is conducted, particularly as it refers to the properties on Pine and 47th Streets, should receive careful attention. Congestion on the street in and about these houses or any of the plaintiffs’ houses, due to improper management and use of the garage building, or any unusual disturbance on the street from the same operation, should be carefully guarded against by the court below in future orders.” It will be seen that the very matter complained of rests entirely in the discretion of the court below and may be raised at any time; it would serve no useful purpose to reverse an order which refused the right to take testimony when that right is and always will be present at any time plaintiff feels he is aggrieved within the meaning of our later decisions.</p>
