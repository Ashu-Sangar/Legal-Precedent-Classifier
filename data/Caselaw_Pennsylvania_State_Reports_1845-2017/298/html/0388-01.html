Both parties brought suit against the bank, and, on the latter’s petition, interpleaders were decreed, with Trestrail, the administrator, as plaintiff, and Johnson, the sheriff, as defendant.

In Hunter v. Henning, <a href="/pa/259/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="259 Pa. 347" data-case-ids="1038376" data-case-paths="/pa/259/0347-01">supra,</a> we held that, as between the personal representative and third parties, while the representative might be regarded as the owner of the fund for its protection, yet where, by his act, there was a possibility of the funds being in jeopardy to the detriment of the tr,ust estates, we kept them inviolable as far as that proceeding was concerned. The personal representative was committing an act (attempting to set off the trust funds against his individual liability) which would injure the trust estate, and by which he would personally benefit. To the same effect was Wilmarth v. Mountford, 8 S. &amp; R. 124, where the trustee of an insolvent debtor sued to recover the price <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>of trust property which had been sold to a creditor of the insolvent. We refused to permit the creditor to set off a claim which he had against the debtor, when he was sued for the price of the property which he purchased. There the trustee was protecting the trust estate, while the creditor was trying to injure it through a preference which he would get if his claim were allowed in that suit. In holding the creditor could not set off against the demand of the trustee his claim against the trust estate, we said the trustee for that purpose was suing to recover his own property.</p>

First National Bank, supra, the bank was trying to recover an overdraft traced into borough orders paid by its cashier, who was also treasurer of the borough, whose funds were depleted through misappropriation by the cashier. The bank was attempting to reclaim its money through these orders. The parties were endeavoring to shift the loss caused by this embezzlement. The equity of the bank Avas not as high as that of the borough, and it Avas made to suffer. The .bank was bound to know, when an account is kept as treasurer of a borough or in some other fiduciary character, that when the officer draws checks in proper form he is lawfully performing his duties and the bank may honor the checks accordingly; but when against such an account it seeks to assert its lien for an obligation such as a loan, overdraft or note, it must know how it was incurred as a loan and for Avhom. It kneAV the fund was not the cashier’s individual property, but was shown to consist in whole or in part of money which he held in a trust relation. It knew how the overdraft was occasioned, the officer’s knowledge being that of the bank. Hence the bank could not charge such a loan against that account, nor could suit on the orders representing the same thing be fruitful of results: Nat. Bank v. Ins. Co., <a href="/us/104/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="104 U.S. 54" data-case-ids="3494530" data-case-paths="/us/104/0054-01">104 U. S. 54</a>; Bank v.

What we said in that case, so urgently relied <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>on, is therefore far from saying the funds were not trust funds; and in the Henning Case, we said, “If it be assumed that the legal title to the funds that are the basis of these demands was once in him [Henning]......he had divested himself of that legal [actual] title when he segregated them from his own funds in the manner he did, depositing neither in the bank as his own, but designating each in a way showing unmistakably to whom it belonged. In doing so he put it beyond his legal right to exercise any control whatever over either deposit, unless in his representative capacity.” There are circumstances where the. ownership of public funds may be deemed to be in the individual, but this is only for the purpose of protecting the funds and permitting them to remain within the control of the designated responsible officer of the cestui que trust, as in Swartwout v. Bank, 5 Denio (N. Y.) 555; and this case by no means holds that, because the fund may be regarded as that of an individual in one instance, it loses its character as trust funds, and when the ownership of the fund is in question, it should be so treated. This is so, even if, in a bank failure, the accounting officer is responsible for the loss. That is because the officer’s obligation was not only to keep the fund safely, but to have it ready when the government called for it. Another instance of such a fund being regarded for particular purposes as that of the individual is where the officer of a municipality states an account of his stewardship, in which case he is charged with the total amount received from a designated source, or what should be received, as, for instance, taxes for the current year, and he is credited with disbursements and uncollected taxes. His bank account plays no part in the matter and for auditing purposes may be considered the accounting officer’s money. - But should that officer be insolvent, the hand of the law would be firmly laid on the money in that account as trust funds.</p>

Savings Fund, nor Wagner’s Estate, relied on by appellants, supply such imperative reasons for a change. The reasons underlying these cases have been mentioned above. The administration of funds by private individuals acting as administrators or trustees, is to be regarded in some aspects differently from the administration of public moneys by public officers, or money secured by virtue of their office. There can be no difference in the relation of the particular individual, public or private, to the fund in question, and all legal obligations which flow from that relation would no doubt attach to all. There is a difference, however, in the administration of a fund or estate. The guide for trustees or administrators is largely the exercise of the fiduciary’s best judgment within certain legal limitations. It is a personal concern up to the point of distribution. The administration of public funds secured through a public office is, on the other hand, largely gov<a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>erned by statute. Therefore, the reasoning employed to hold cash in a bank in the hands of the estate of the administering officer does not apply to a statutory administrator, such as a, sheriff, clerk of court or other public officer.</p>
    <p id="b425-3" data-blocks='[["BL_425.4",425,[159,625,1153,1129]]]'>The chief reason in the cases relied on by appellant for their holding was the right to collect claims for services and to be reimbursed for disbursements. Funds collected from execution carry with them their own specific fees and costs of execution. Payment for the services of the sheriff is provided in fees and commissions by statute, and the disbursements for printing and so forth are likewise taken care of. These items are the first to be liquidated if a sale takes place, or money is received; they are no part of the debt collected. The fees and other expenses are charged separately on each writ. In some counties the latter are paid by the sheriff and belong to the sheriff, but are charged on the writ; in others, including Delaware, the counties pay all the charges of executing the writ and secure all the fees. There are in this case no disputed or uncertain questions. If there are commissions which belong to the deceased sheriff, the court may order such fees turned over to his administrator when an audit or other distribution is made. The reasoning of the two cases relied on does not apply to the type of case before us.</p>
    <p id="b425-4" data-blocks='[["BL_425.5",425,[158,1766,1152,413]]]'>There are other reasons for keeping the funds in the sheriff’s office for distribution. The money remains in the same court in which it originated. If it is turned over to an administrator, it goes to another court where the law has provided six months’ delay before litigants receive their claims. The sheriff’s office requires speedy distribution of funds like these. If is perhaps its chief claim for effectiveness.</p>

(Allegheny <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>Bank’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=48%20Pa.%20330" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="48 Pa. 330">48 Pa. 330</a>), the bondsmen of the deceased sheriff to be released pro tanto by such payment. The fact that a coroner or appointed sheriff filled the office before the present sheriff litigant is immaterial and does not disturb our conclusion, nor does the fact that the sheriff’s bond stands good for the fund.</p>
