The legislature has fixed the standard of measurement; “scientific formulas” predicated on theoretical uses, location and the like applied to property should have small consideration in fixing assessable or market value. So also, little weight should be given the testimony of experts who go into strange localities to estimate assessable values and frequently base their conclusions on a theory built on an impossible or impracticable conception of uses or possible uses, with their own idea of ratio of worth as between vacant and improved realty.

      <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>The market value of coal land, on which assessment is based, takes into consideration, in addition to what has been discussed, actual conditions existing on the ground such as locality, coal formation, number, thickness and depth of the veins; quantity, quality, stratification, nature of overlying strata and pitch of the seam, and the difficulty in mining; whether the coal is gaseous, outcrop, basin, and such other elements as shown by experience to be necessary in determining values. Important, of course, is availability and possible demand for the product of the land. An estimate is made of possible tonnage; due allowance being made for coal that would be lost. For the purposes of assessment all these considerations must be reduced to market value of the tract as a whole.</p>
    <p id="b327-4" data-blocks='[["BL_327.4",327,[168,1181,1149,956]]]'>The county concedes that market value as a general rule must be used, but say this land is all owned by five large companies, and there have been no sales of large or fairly large tracts of coal land upon which market value may be based; that there is no market value. It insists, therefore, upon the right to use the so-called foot-acre unit and justifies the result by evidence of sales of small tracts, prior assessments, and other similar transactions. In effect, the county authorities may set up their own base value per acre and conclude that it should be called market value. The foot-acre is one acre of coal one foot thick. If a vein or veins have a 10 foot thickness, there are 10 foot-acres of coal. An ideal acre of coal is an acre of virgin coal with all of the veins in the particular region of normal thickness, aggregating 60 feet. We will discuss later, in detail, the application of the foot-acre rule, and how its value was reached in- this case.</p>
    <p id="b327-5" data-blocks='[["BL_327.5",327,[168,2157,1148,261]],["BL_328.1",328,[287,376,1148,747]]]'>The court below used, as one of its major elements in finding assessable value, the assessments of previous years made under the foot-acre rule. Another element was the fact coal was not sold on an acreage basis, but on a royalty basis of tons that could be mined and re<a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>covered when coal was in normal use in former years, the court supplying its own royalty figure. These facts were supplemented by sales of fractional acreages. The court below, in using such factors, neglected to take into consideration economic factors which had a depressing influence on market value in its true sense, or on any value theretofore existing. Too much weight was given the county’s evidence and too little to that of the companies. Had all factors been given due weight a different result would have been reached. Because of the effect given previous assessments made when anthracite coal was flourishing, and because the court failed to consider other vital elements, we will state briefly the matters which influence market value.</p>
    <p id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[285,1135,1149,419]]]'>One of the most potential elements of market value is the demand for the thing to be sold or valued. Any contingency which detrimentally influences demand will have a corresponding effect on market value. If you cannot sell anthracite coal, the land from which it is to come would be practically worthless. If the demand for the product decreases, the market value of the land suffers accordingly.</p>
    <p id="b328-5" data-blocks='[["BL_328.5",328,[284,1566,1149,530]]]'>Anthracite coal from Pennsylvania has for many years been the chief heating fuel in the northeast, including the Lake States, the New England States and Canada. The first decisive inroad on that market came from the great strike in <em>1925-26; </em>that was most serious. The effect of the strike was the introduction of active potential competitors of anthracite; this was, and still continues to be, a great menace to the whole industry. It cannot be shaken off and the complete picture of the loss to the anthracite industry is yet to come.</p>
    <p id="b328-6" data-blocks='[["BL_328.6",328,[284,2109,1145,314]],["BL_329.1",329,[161,370,1152,525]]]'>The chief substitute for anthracite at that time was soft coal; it still stands as one of its strongest competitors, followed by oil, coke, gas, anthracite from Wales, and now from Soviet Russia, to say nothing of electric power. The latter during the last decade has, from water power supplemented by steam, expanded into mil<a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>lions of what is commonly termed horse power. Indeed it may be asserted that we are in the age of giant power. Those substitutes take the place of coal which heretofore was the means of producing power or heat. Soft coal in competition with anthracite has also been aided by low freight rates to tidewater from southern states. It could be placed in New England harbors at a more attractive price than anthracite. The result is that the demand for anthracite has diminished to the point where it reacts on the market value of the land.</p>
    <p id="b329-3" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[160,914,1152,1129]]]'>Figures tell the story. Prom the federal government’s Mining Bureau Reports of 1926, the first year covered by this assessment, the loss to the industry over 1919-20-21 was approximately 5,000,000 tons, and for 1927 approximately 10,000,000 tons, — in dollars, close to 1100,000,000. The 1928 report shows a greater loss. The place of anthracite was taken by the substitutes mentioned above. If this competition is increased by the lowered cost of mining soft coal in the southern states, through a reduction in mining wages, it is at once apparent that the additional burden of unfair assessments, producing high taxes in the anthracite fields, will increase the difficulties of the coal producers as well as that of their employees. The State has seen this difficulty and is gradually eliminating its tax upon anthracite. This is being done to aid one of Pennsylvania’s chief industries.

The highest market price for these lands was no doubt reached when the coal was being intensively mined and sold with competition not as keen. Public improvements, financing and municipal living were based on these assessments, and the style of the latter, in some instances brought before this <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>court, has been, to say the least, astonishing. In making or providing for these expenditures, whether through bond issues or future taxation, due allowance has not been made for the fact that when all the available coal has been exhausted, the coal lands, as a subject of taxation, will cease to exist, and there will be no such property to tax. There must be a corresponding diminution in the gross value of taxable property from which the municipality or county may recover taxes, or on which the value for past bonded indebtedness may be sustained. When to this feature is added a reduction in market value because of economic disturbances discussed, the net result must be a much lower market value for all assessable ’property. But the peak in valuation cannot be sustained, or, as is done in this case, added to through an arbitrary inflation of value. Here the market value, when coal was at its highest price, was raised 10%. Why this was done does not appear. We are not advised whether it was to stabilize existing values, or to provide an increased fund for expenditures.</p>

Exorbitant real estate values, causing high taxes, are no comfort to taxpayers, nor, as has occurred in some cases in this region, is the embezzlement of public funds, reckless expenditures, or a style of municipal living beyond reasonable requirement. Under all the circumstances, a lessening of the cost of government should follow. Governments should not be conducted on the basis of excessive taxation. It must be remembered that in this region a reduction in the market value of coal land, or lessening of value by removing the coal, ultimately throws the burden of taxes and payment of loans on the surface land or home owners.</p>

The price fixed for a foot-acre of coal was $550, or for an ideal acre of 60 foot thickness $33,000. This, it was claimed, was the real market value. Counsel admitted that from the many, many thousands of acres of coal in this district, no tract or fair sized <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>piece was ever sold at such a high figure or near it. The figure of $33,000 was reached, we understand, upon the basis of small sales or the present worth of sales or leases on royalty. This character of exchange yields a much higher price ultimately than an immediate sale for cash, but to take the total tonnage of a given tract and apply thereto a royalty price for a present-day sale, would make the sale price so high that it could not be secured for any fair acreage. The wide difference in the valuation, by the parties, comes from taking the top prices of small sales, the present worth of high royalties extending over a short period of time, or other inflating considerations to make up the county’s claim, and low royalties over a long period of time, sales not fairly reflecting present-day prices and other deflating causes to lower the value. Royalties as low as 7% cents a ton and as high as 50 cents a ton were used as a base. It has been testified that royalties have been as high as 75 cents, $1 and $1.25 a ton.” To maintain overhead expenses, such as interest, school, township, county taxes, and other charges based on such an assessment as the county made for the intervening years, would place upon this coal, when marketed, a price so high that it could not be realized in the market.</p>

Again no sale of any acreage at or near this figure has been pointed out, including the sale made of the Halbach Tract by the alien property custodian in 1928. The assessors then, for the purpose of carrying out the foot-acre unit, divided the land into four major classes: coal under surface controlled, surface not controlled, area under saturated wash and area under river warrants. The ratio value for assessment purposes was applied over the entire field as the class warranted. Thus to fee ownership without liability for surface support or surface controlled $330 was <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>the assessable foot-acre value. Other foot-acre values for the various classes were as follows: Pillar coal under surface controlled $165; surface uncontrolled, solid $264, pillar $132; coal under saturated wash or where there was danger of water flooding the mines, solid $264 a foot-acre, pillar $100; river warrant, solid $200 and pillar $50. Under the last three general classes the assessor’s theory was that there should be sufficient pillars to support the surface, lessening the cost of all these classes.</p>

Reserve coal land does not possess the same value in the market as that being actively operated. It may be years before this land would be devoted to actual production. To value such coal on the basis of present-day royalty would be to pyramid prices and disregard the fundamental idea of royalty sale.

Some coal operations possess both active and inactive land, but reserve territory beyond land in active operation would not be of as high a value as that close to active operation. It would be a mistake to value such tract on a tonnage basis of either class, consequently a medium price should be adopted, based on reasonable judgment, that would fairly reflect a market value under the system used for the entire tract. A higher market value attaches to many separate contiguous tracts of land brought into one ownership. It thereafter is one piece of land and presents a much wider field for operation sustaining a greater investment of capital in production.</p>

Testimony of experts on the county’s behalf was produced to establish what was regarded as a market value. While these witnesses wished to avoid the foot-acre rule, their so-called “market value” was obviously based on it. The county also presented evidence of sales by lessees of rights under mining leases and similar transactions that included the settlement of disputes under the lease; sales of leases at discount values or royalties; sales of corporate stocks which included personal property, rights and equipment; of the right of surface support, or a covenant not to mine coal <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>under a city lot or small piece of ground, or by one company to another as lessee; fee simple sales of a fraction of an acre of coal which reduced to an acreage price in one instance would be as high as $107,000 an acre; and sales of tons of coal at present-day tonnage prices.

The fact that the companies controlled surrounding territory might not of itself prevent the price paid for individually owned coal from reflecting market valued When such land is sold, it is not entirely fair to assume, as did the court below, that the price paid was below market value in the sense in which the term is', used in the statute and defined by the courts, namely— a sale after full notice where it was open to all parties to bid.

We have accordingly arrived at the following conclusions: Market value is the standard for measuring value to be used in all cases of assessment. Where the parties fail to present sufficient evidence on which to find it, the authorities may use the best evidence obtainable: DuBois’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/293/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="293 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="1111100" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0186-01">293 Pa. 186</a>. Where evidence of market value is lacking, and there is evidence tending to show foot-acre value, due weight must be given, before deciding what it should be, to all the conditions which would ordinarily affect the market value if there was one. The court erred in applying too high a royalty figure as the market value rate when the demand for the production is so low that a sale, public or otherwise, could not be effected at that rate. In considering previous assessments or royalty rates fixed some time prior to the instant assessment, the <em>present-day </em>condition of the market for coal must be taken into account. A prior assessment of property covering a given district cannot be increased by a fixed horizontal percentage; due regard must be had for the surrounding conditions affecting values, and each valuation must stand on its own facts. Reserve or remote coal should be assessed as such, distinct from many considerations affecting active coal or that close to active production, <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>The court below did not give sufficient consideration to the testimony of the landowner, attaching to it too little weight, and too much was given the evidence submitted by the county.
