L. 957, passed a zoning ordinance on May 24, 1926. It provided a comprehensive plan to divide the land included into districts, regulating the construction of buildings thereon. It required, in its third article, that houses, when erected in the residential area known as U 1, should conform in their front building-line to that fixed on recorded plans, but in case no such restrictions appeared of record, then <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>a set-back should be made, at a distance to be determined by that established by 80% of the buildings constructed on the same street at the time the ordinance was passed.</p>

Whether permits were issued allowing such construction, or, if so, any steps to cause the removal of the prohibited projections have as yet been taken by the township authorities, does not appear.</p>

These maps were required to be drawn to a scale, showing the size of the proposed structure, and its relation to the highway and adjoining properties, so as to indicate whether there was a compliance with the regulations as to front, rear, and side yards. The draft, found by the court to have been actually submitted, was in pencil, having marks thereon showing the house was to be built 30 feet back from the street, without disclosing a projection of any kind. A duplicate, later produced by the contractor, had noted thereon the lines of a proposed porch within the proscribed area, though not stating its height, but this second map was not shown to the township officer, as the trial tribunal determined on this appeal. It is urged that the true in<a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>tention of the appellant could have been learned had the house plans been examined, but this was not required by the ordinance. Nor was the township bound to know that an unlawful projection was contemplated because such appeared on two other houses on another street, on the same plot, and four on other plans had been thus built within the residential district.</p>

The carpenters began the superstructure on January 2, 1929, and practically completed their work by the 23d. The foundation for the porch was laid on February 2d, when the inspector then discovered that the intention was to build it with a closed second story thereon, which, in fact, was to form part of a bedroom of the house itself. A prompt protest followed, with notice to desist from further work. This was disregarded, with the result that a summary proceeding was instituted against Valicenti before a justice, as the ordinance provided, and a fine imposed. NotAAdthstanding, the contractor continued to complete the projection planned, and, on the 18th, was again' notified to cease operations. This he refused to do, claiming the protection of the original permit issued, asserting that the structure objected to was in reality but a bay window. Negotiations for an adjustment were ineffective, and, on March 2d, adjoining owners appealed to the board of adjustment, created under the terms of the ordinance, asking that the permission to erect a house theretofore granted by the inspector be revoked. In the meantime, the top over the porch was enclosed with sides and roof, and prepared for plastering within. The appeal board heard the parties, revoked the permit, and directed the removal of the unlawful projection. It further ordered that, if this direction was not complied Avith, the inspector should refuse permission to occupy the completed dwelling. These <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>remedies Avere proper under the ordinance, if the board Avas justified in granting any relief.

The question raised has been so frequently discussed in our recent cases that a mere reference to the previous decisions will suffice: Liggett’s Petition, supra; Ward’s App., <a href="/pa-super/89/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="89 Pa.

It was urged in the present case that the permit must be sustained because not fraudulently obtained, but the court found the original plan presented to the inspector did not show the projection complained of, and the character of the actual construction above the porch, which was in reality a part of a bedroom of the house, was not made known until after the building was in part erected. The court was of opinion that the inspector should have known of the contractor’s intention to so build within the 30 feet, since this fact would have been disclosed had the building plans been examined, though the projection did not appear on the plot filed, as required by the ordinance. In reaching this conclusion, the court was influenced by the fact that other buildings had been constructed with like obstructions, on a different street, on the same plan, and at some distance on Arden Road, on lots laid out on another plot. It held that the refusal of the board to permit Valicenti to proceed would be unfair and discriminatory, and therefore illegal.</p>

The legislation was, therefore, held unconstitutional, as an attempted unlawful use of the police power. An entirely different situation is found in the present case. The zoning ordinance fixed the building lines, as determined by plans recorded prior to its passage, as the proper set-back, and it applied to all property similarly situated. It was not, therefore, arbitrary or discriminatory, and the ruling in the au<a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>thority cited is not controlling here. Had the attempt been made to fix the line as that existing, at the time of the passage of the ordinance, in the case of 80% of the buildings then erected, a different conclusion might be reached, but that proposition is not before us in the present proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b309-5" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[146,670,1152,1020]]]'>A further position was taken that, by reason of the expenditure on the faith of the permit, the appeal board should not have insisted on a strict compliance with the terms of the ordinance. It is true that variations may be permitted, but only in cases of practical necessity, and for reasons that are “substantial, serious and compelling”: Junge’s App., supra; Johnson’s App., <a href="/pa-super/89/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="89 Pa. Super. 543" data-case-ids="671350" data-case-paths="/pa-super/89/0543-01">supra.</a> An examination of this record leads to the belief that Valicenti was not misled as to his rights by any act of the building inspector. Instead, he secured a permit, not by affirmative misrepresentation, but by failing to disclose the fact that any projection within the 30 feet was intended. When his purpose was discovered, he received prompt notice of the illegality of his act, and, upon refusal to cease his operations, was brought before a justice and fined. He still persisted in continuing the work despite a second warning, and cannot now be heard to say that he was deceived and injured through the fault of the municipality.</p>

The public authorities owe a duty to enforce the lawful regulations of the township against each and every violator. All such are liable to summary proceedings by section 5 of article V of the ordinance, and by article VIII there is given the power to restrain, correct or abate any violation that may exist, and also to prevent the use or conduct of business in any structure erected contrary to the requirements of the zoning legislation. The fact that such action has not as yet been instituted against others furnishes no excuse to the defendant. “The validity of the ordinance does not usually depend on a completely successful enforcement of its provisions, nor can one who violates it be discharged, merely because it is shown that there are other violators who have not been convicted, or that those whose duty it is to perform the duties required by it have fallen short, through inattention or intentional omission or neglect”: People v.
