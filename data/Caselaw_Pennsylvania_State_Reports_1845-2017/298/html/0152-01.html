Defendant corporation, the Pennsylvania Coal &amp; Coke Company, holds the coal property in ques<a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>tion as grantee from those who acquired it by deed from John Stiffler and Mary Stiffler, they being vested with power of sale by the sixth paragraph of Jacob Stiffler’s will as follows: “After the death of my said son John Stiffler and my said daughter in law Mary Stiffler, the real estate......bequeathed to my daughter in law. shall descend to the children of my said son John Stiffler and to Anna Bell White and Henry Elias White their heirs and assigns forever. Nevertheless, they my said son John Stiffler and his said wife shall have full power to sell said land or any part thereof, subject however, to the charge thereon as aforesaid, and make deeds therefor.”</p>

Defendant answered that the before mentioned deeds to its predecessors in title had been made and executed by John Stiffler and Mary Stiffler, after the death of those persons in whose favor a charge upon the land had been created by Jacob Stiffler, deceased, and that said John and Mary Stiffler were vested with full power, under the above sixth paragraph of the will of Jacob Stiffler, deceased, to sell and grant the land in fee at the time they made the deeds to defendant’s predecessors in title; hence plaintiffs could make no proper claim thereto.</p>

It is plain that Mary, John’s wife, had a life estate, and we agree with the court below that it is equally plain that the testator, for purposes of his own, vested in Mary and John “full power to sell” the property, which they deeded to defendant’s predecessors in title.</p>
    <p id="b182-5" data-blocks='[["BL_182.5",182,[281,848,1151,1231]]]'>The court below well states: “It is certain that, in the lifetime of the three parties [in whose favor testator had created a charge upon his real estate], the land could not have been sold by Mary Stiffler or......her husband, unless it was sold subject to the charge upon it for the maintenance of the three objects of [testator’s] bounty; [but, aside from this,] there is no reservation whatever in the power of sale contained in the sixth paragraph of the will. Although [testator] provides in the first part of this paragraph that, after the death of his daughter-in-law, the land shall descend to the children of his......son, John Stiffler, and to Anna Bell White and Henry Elias White, their heirs and assigns forever, yet, in the same paragraph, and the last expression of testator, [he] gives to John Stiffler and Mary Stiffler......absolute authority and full power to sell the lands or any part thereof,......, and also power to make deeds therefor. At the time when this power was exercised......, [testator’s] widow and [two] sons [in whose favor the charge was created] had died; therefore, the question of a charge upon the land does not arise......, [and] the absolute power to sell...... rested in the grantees of the power.”</p>

The answer <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>is, however, that such a sale in no wise defeated any vested rights. This case is ruled in principle by Gelb v. Wisberger, <a href="/pa/247/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="247 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="1009371" data-case-paths="/pa/247/0416-01">247 Pa. 416</a>. There the testator devised real estate to his wife for life, “with the privilege to dispose of any or all of the real estate if she chooses,” and with remainder over to others at the death of the wife. We held, adopting the opinion of Judge Schafer, of the Common Pleas of Allegheny County, that, while it was plain the testator did not intend his widow to .have more than a life estate, she had power under the will to convey a fee, saying: “We are of opinion that testator intended his wife should have [for life] all his property, and that she might turn the real estate into money if she so decided...... As to whether [she] has power to expend more than the income of the property is a matter......which is within the jurisdiction of the orphans’ court and can be regulated by them so as to do justice and secure the rights of the remaindermen: Watson’s Est., <a href="/pa/241/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="241 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="976008" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0271-01">241 Pa. 271</a>.” In Watson’s Estate, just mentioned, where a life tenant, with power to sell, had converted the property into money, we said, at page 280, that she held “the fund for the specific purpose named in the will,” and that, as to it, she occupied “the position of a quasi trustee for herself and the remainder-man.” So here, the purchase money for the property in controversy took the place of the coal conveyed. Those who made the conveyances in fee to defendant’s predecessors in title exercised the power of sale vested in them by the will of Jacob Stiffler, and they held such purchase money as quasi trustees for whomever had a life interest and for the ultimate remaindermen. With this proper construction placed upon the will of Jacob Stiffier, deceased, the question, so forcibly argued by counsel for appellants, as to the power of sale being in conflict with, and defeating attributes of, the absolute estates in remainder given to testator’s ultimate beneficiaries, disappears from the case.</p>

      <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>It seems that the coal here involved was not opened or operated before the death of testator, though he knew his lands were underlaid with good, marketable, bituminous coal; and it is quite probable that testator gave the power of sale contained in the sixth paragraph of his will, appreciating the fact that, under certain circumstances, the life tenants might be able to create a source of income only by selling this underlying coal. However this may be, yet, defendant’s predecessors in title through the exercise of that power, acquired a fee simple estate; and the court below properly so held.</p>
