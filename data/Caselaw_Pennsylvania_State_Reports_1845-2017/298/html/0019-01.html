Defendant refused to give the permit, whereupon plaintiff sought, by mandamus, to compel him to issue it. The court below overruled plaintiff’s demurrer to the return to the alternative writ, and dismissed the proceedings; whereupon he prosecuted this appeal.</p>

The owner of property covered by the permit shall be held responsible for any damages that may result from any obstructions placed on the street or otherwise.”</blockquote>
