In the center thereof is defendant’s double track electric street railway, — that to the south being eastbound. This leaves a space of ten and one-half feet on each side of the rails. On the afternoon of September 17, 1927, the plaintiff, Mrs. Riff, while a passenger on a westbound car was injured by a collision <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>between it and an autotruck. The suit brought to recover for the injuries thus sustained resulted in verdicts and judgments for the plaintiffs and the defendant has appealed.</p>
    <p id="b285-3" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[137,576,1157,1837]],["BL_286.1",286,[294,351,1148,366]]]'>There was a sharp conflict in the evidence, but in view of the verdict, we must assume the truth of that offered for plaintiffs: Frank v. Reading Co., <a href="/pa/297/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="297 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="1118202" data-case-paths="/pa/297/0233-01">297 Pa. 233</a>. By this it appears that an eastbound trolley car and trailer passed from Wylie Avenue into and along Center Avenue, followed for some two miles by a large autotruck, weighing five tons; that, as the street car stopped at or near Junilla Street, the truck turned to the left into the westbound track and attempted to pass the car. It started forward, however, and they ran side by side for some distance. Then the truck driver increased his speed and, seeing a westbound trolley car approaching on the track he was occupying, turned to his right when it was approximately one hundred feet distant, and attempted to pass in front of the eastbound car, but collided with it and was shoved forward. Meantime, the westbound trolley car, with a trailer attached and loaded with passengers, came down the track rapidly and crashed into the left side of the truck, wedging it between the trolley cars.. This forcible and abrupt stop threw the wife of plaintiff, a passenger on the westbound car, from her seat and inflicted the injuries complained of. Parked cars prevented the truck driver from leaving the track by turning to the left and the presence of the eastbound trolley car prevented his attempted escape by turning to his right. The motorman on the westbound car had a full view of the oncoming car and truck for about four hundred feet and could see what prevented the latter from clearing the track. As a carrier of passengers it was the motorman’s duty to exercise the highest practical degree of care for their safety. It was manifest that they would be imperiled by a crash of the car and truck. As to this there is no question and the motorman testified that he stopped his car and that the <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>truck came on, by its own power or pushed by the eastbound car and collided with his car. He was corroborated by some other testimony; but, on the other hand, several witnesses for plaintiffs testified positively that the westbound car moved at high speed until it crashed with the truck. This made a question of fact for the jury and taking it from them would have been error.</p>

The first question so raised alleges error in the failure of the trial judge to charge that the proximate cause .of the accident was the conduct of the truck driver. There was no request to so charge and had there been it could not have been granted in view of plaintiffs’ evidence, for thereunder it was at most a concurrent cause; in which case plaintiffs might sue either: Gates v.

This the defendant recognized and did not raise the question of proximate cause in the trial court. Hence, even if it had merit, which it has not, it could not be raised here. We will not consider the case upon a different theory from that upon which it was tried in the lower court, nor decide it upon a point not raised there: Moyer v. Blue Mt.

Of course it was necessary to find that the negligence complained of was the proximate cause of the injuries, but no other finding was possible under plaintiffs’ evidence. To sustain a recovery, how<a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>ever, the negligence complained of need not be the sole cause of the accident.

As the question of excessive verdict is not suggested in the statement of questions involved nor properly brought upon the record by assignment of error, we will not consider it. Moreover, the plaintiffs’ evidence, if credited, made out such a case of serious injury to the wife plaintiff as to support the verdicts. We can interfere in such case only to prevent manifest injustice. To justify this court in-granting a new trial on that ground the verdict must be such as to demonstrate that the jury abused its powers and that the trial court failed to grant relief: Goldman v.
