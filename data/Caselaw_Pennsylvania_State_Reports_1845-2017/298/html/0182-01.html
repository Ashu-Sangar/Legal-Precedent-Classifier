Welton Engineering Co., <a href="/pa/283/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="283 Pa. 91" data-case-ids="1090524" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0091-01">283 Pa. 91</a>, 98), or, in rare instances, where the hardship or inadequacy of the common law procedure is manifest: Sauber v.

Prior to the passage of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act of May 21, 1921, P. L. 1045, the method just described was the exclusive procedure. That statute gives an additional optional remedy, by bill, to set aside the conveyance to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor’s claim (Sauber v. Nouskajian, <a href="/pa/286/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="286 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="1096453" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0449-01">supra, 454, 455</a>), but it does not deprive a creditor of the right, as formerly, to work out his remedy at law.</p>

To this, defendant duly excepted, and now assigns the ruling as error. Subject to all rights reserved by its exception, defendant filed an answer. The case went to a hearing, in the course of which appellant offered no evidence, but requested a finding that the property had been conveyed by the <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>Blairsville Company in fraud of its, the defendant’s, rights as a creditor. The court below determined that this request for a finding amounted to an election by appellant to avail itself of the alternative equitable remedy, provided by the Act of 1921, and precluded it from further proceeding at law. Then it decided that there was no fraud in the transfer; and, finally, it enjoined defendant from pursuing its prior legal action.</p>

Under the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, which gives the right of appeal from preliminary adjudications, no appeal is allowed from the decision of questions of jurisdiction which go to the form of the action alone as between law and equity: Rutherford Water Co. v.

It might well be, in such a proceeding as this, that defendant, the court having determined to take jurisdiction in equity and enjoin the action at law, would feel compelled to meet the issue raised by plaintiff, that there was no fraud in the transaction, for fear, if it did not, the question would be foreclosed, in the event that, on appeal under defendant’s exception, the point of jurisdiction should be decided against it.</p>
    <p id="b213-4" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[173,1756,1150,523]]]'>We conclude that the court below lacked jurisdiction on the bill as filed and on the proofs as submitted, and, further, that nothing which appellant did by pleading or at trial made it an affirmative actor, thereby conferring jurisdiction. Defendant had elected to proceed at law, as was its right, and the request for a finding in its favor on the issue of fraud did not, under the circumstances, amount to an election to pursue the alternative remedy provided by the Fraudulent Conveyance Act of 1921.</p>
