    <p class="syllabus" id="b412-15" data-blocks='[["BL_412.7",412,[277,1119,1178,438]]]'>In an action by a woman against a street railway company to recover damages for personal injuries, plaintiff testified that she stopped three times when within forty feet of the track, and looked and listened for a car; that the last stop was made when she was close to the track; and that when on the track she first saw the car which struck her; that the car was suddenly lighted and was 125 feet from her. She testified that she stopped the fourth time when she was between the rails. The inference from her whole testimony was that the last stop was made when she first saw the light and in her effort to get out of danger by going back. <em>Held, </em>that the case was for the jury, and that a verdict and judgment for plaintiff should be sustained.</p>

    <p id="b413-5" data-blocks='[["BL_413.12",413,[156,906,1176,874]]]'>The negligence alleged is that the defendant’s car was run at a high rate of speed on a public highway on a dark night without lights and without giving any signal of its approach. The plaintiff’s testimony in support of her action is vague and unsatisfactory and her account of the occurrence was met by countervailing proof of much more clearness and force. The case could not, however, have been withdrawn from the jury unless the rule that a person struck by a moving car, which was plainly visible when he was in a place of safety, must be conclusively presumed to have gone into an obvious danger, is to be applied to it. But the rule stated in Carroll v. Penna. Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=12%20W.N.C.%20346" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="12 W.N.C. 346">12 W. N. C. 346</a>, and Myers v.

She said she stopped the fourth time when she was between the rails, but the fair inference from her whole testimony is that this stop was made when she first saw the light and in her effort to get out of danger by going back.
