Wallace, the survey and appraisement made in pursuance thereof and the patent of August 14, 1822, from the commonwealth to Wallace are prima facie evidence that the property therein described was in fact an island in 1822, and that it was properly patentable under the act of January 27, 1806. <em>Answer : </em>In answer to this first point, I will say that, while not affirming this point as stated, the papers which have been put in evidence in this case by the plaintiff as the application and proceedings in the land office of one Thomas K. Wallace, under which the patent to him was issued, are legitimate subjects for the consideration of the jury in deciding whether the land comprised within the original Wallace grant was or was not an island at the time of that grant, and whether or not it was properly patentable as such under the act of January 27,1806, and after the lapse of the great number of years from the date of these proceedings, as shown by these papers, and in the absence of any direct proof to the contrary or proof from which they could reasonably make a finding to the effect that it was not an island as it is designated in the patent and other state papers, this patent and the other papers in evidence might well <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>be accepted by the jury as in the nature of prima facie evidence as stated in this point.

Wallace a valid fee simple title to the island therein described and its appurtenances. <em>Answer: </em>In answer to this second point, I will say that if the jury find that the land comprised within the original Wallace grant was an island, then, after the lapse of the long number of years since the date of that patent, the jury would be justified in presuming that'all of the proceedings leading to the issuance of the patent were regular, and in treating the patent as conveying a valid fee simple title to the island therein described and its appurtenances.

The island to which Wallace acquired title from the commonwealth under the patent of August 14, 1822, is admitted by the disclaimer and plea filed by the defendant in this case to be a part of the premises described in the plaintiff’s writ, and the premises so described and claimed by the plaintiff are identical with the boundaries of Cabin island as shown upon the Gillingham plan of October 7, 1891. It is, therefore, admitted of record by the defendant that the island originally patented to Wallace is part of Cabin island, as shown upon the said plan of October 7, 1891. <em>Answer: </em>In answer to this eleventh point, I will say that the land covered by the Wallace patent is stated by the disclaimer and plea filed by the defendants in this case to be a part of the premises described in the plaintiff’s writ. You have the evidence of the surveyor, Gillingham, that the description in the plaintiff’s writ is coextensive with what the plaintiff now calls Cabin Island. If you believe this testimony, which has not been denied, to be correct, it, therefore, follows that the defendants have practically stated in their own disclaimer that the part as to which they disclaim and which they describe particularly as an undivided interest in the tract or parcel of land described in the patent to Wallace, is not a part and parcel of Cabin island as shown by the plan of October 7, 1891, which you have in evidence.

There <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>is a presumption of fact that such portion of the property within these limits as lies outside the metes and bounds specified in the Wallace patent is appurtenant to the island conveyed to Wallace, and not to land on the northwestern side of the back channel or to laud on the southwestern side of the big gut. <em>Answer: </em>In answer to this twelfth point, I will say that there is evidence in the case that the land called Cabin island, as shown on the Gillingham plan of October 7, 1891, was within the memory of persons now living, a tract apparently separated from Province island by a channel or waterway, and in front of the government property by a gut, gully or ditch. As to what this evidence proves and as to whether it is uncontradicted or not is a matter entirely for you to consider. As to the balance of the point, I will say that there would be a presumption of fact that the land formed by accretions exclusively to the fast land of what was originally the island which lias been called in this case Cabin island, would belong to that island, and not to tbe land on the northwestern side of the back channel, or the land on the southwestern side of the big gut, this being subject, of course, to your finding that such an island as Cabin island existed as a distinct entity.

Jones, District Surveyor and Regulator of the Twelfth District of Philadelphia, on the seventh day of October, 1891, as follows.” The deed contains a description by metes and bounds of the island conveyed without giving the acreage, and excepts from the grant “ the area embraced within the courses and distances given in a patent made by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to Thomas K. Wallace on the fourteenth of March, 1822.” The habendum includes “the appurtenances, accretions and alluvion thereto belonging.” By a recital in the deed it appears that the grant conveys “ the right, title and interest of the United States in and to so much of the land described in deed by John W. Ashmead and wife to the United States, dated the twenty-eighth day of March, eighteen hundred and fifty-one, being in the vicinity of Fort Mifflin, on the Delaware, lying outside the dike or river bank and eastward of the fort, as will .... not be prejudicial to the interests of the United States.” In pursuance of a warrant dated March 13, 1851, the deputy surveyor of Philadelphia county surveyed to Ashmead “an island in the river Delaware (sometimes called Cabin Island), Kingsessing Township, Philadelphia County, at the mouth of the river Schuylkill, within about one quarter of a mile southeast from State Island ” except that part of the island patented to Thomas K. Wallace. A patent was issued to Ash-mead on March 27, 1851, and he, by deed dated March 28, 1851, conveyed the island to the United States.</p>

The first is, that the plaintiff has not proved his case; that is, that he has not shown facts which would justify a finding, that he holds title to the land described in the writ; next, that if he has shown a good title to any part of the land so described he has not shown such a title to a full one-third undivided interest; next, that they, the defendants, hold title by a grant from the United States government, and that the United States'government took this land back in 1795, as part of an island, known as Mud island, or as marsh land appurtenant thereto, which was ceded to the government by the state of Pennsylvania under and by force of a certain act of assembly; next, that even if this land in question was not included in the land of the United States government, then, that all of the land, excepting that originally included in the description in the Wallace grant, that is, all the land which has been formed by accretions was granted by the state of Pennsylvania to one Ashmead in 1851, and that they hold through the Ashmead title.” Numerous points for charge, raising all the legal questions involved in the case, were submitted by counsel for both parties, and were, as we think, correctly answered by the court.

It is contended, however, by the appellant that the appellee was <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>required, in order to sustain .the Wallace patent, to show that the island was a natural island, that it had a soil capable of cultivation, that the appraisers had regard to the soil in making their appraisement. These facts must appear, it is claimed, by-evidence dehors the warrant, survey and patent. With that conclusion we do not concur. Eighty-four years have elapsed since the Wallace patent was issued, and if the present holder of that title is required to prove those facts by evidence aliunde the papers themselves his title must fail, and the grant of the state for which it received full consideration goes for naught. That position, as we think, cannot be sustained by reason nor by any decisions called to our attention. The presumption is that an officer performs his duty, and that his acts are regular and in conformity with the requirements of law. If the performance of any precedentact is necessary to the validity of his official act, there is a presumption in favor of his official act, which amounts to presumptive proof of the performance of the precedent act: 22 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (2d ed.), 1267. To support a tax sale of real estate in this state, it is indispensable that the purchaser give to the treasurer his bond for the surplus of purchase money over and above the taxes and costs, but it was held in Lackawanna Iron &amp; Coal Company v. Fales, <a href="/pa/55/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="55 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1470723" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0090-01">55 Pa. 90</a>, an ejectment for land by the purchaser thii'ty years after he bought it, that as the treasurer’s deed contained a receipt for the consideration and costs of the bond and he had paid the taxes and had recovered against the grantor of the defendant for trespass on the land, it would be presumed the bond had been duly given. In Jackson v. Cole, 4 Cow. (N. Y.) 587, Sutherland, J., delivering the opinion (p. 596) said: “ So in this case, the fact that the officers of government, whose duty it was to see the provisions of the act of 1787 carried into effect and complied with on the part of the trustee have proceeded as they could not, consistently with their duty have done, unless the trustee had performed whatever it was incumbent on him to do, is prima facie evidence of performance on his part.” Wray v.

The question was whether the Indian reserves had preference over a subsequent patentee of the government. The evidence of the location of the land was a certify<a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>cate of the register of the land office subsequent to which a patent was issued. It was contended that it was not shown that the requisite preliminary steps were taken authorizing the location. But it was held that the evidence was not necessary. The court said : “ The location is in itself evidence that all the prerequisites were complied with. A violation of duty on the part of the officers who made the location cannot be presumed. A grant raises a presumption that all prerequisites have been complied with. The principle is a general one and applies to most acts of an official and an administerial character.” Ward v.

It was contended that the certified copy of the return of the delinquent tax was irregular in certain details required by statute. The court said (p. 247) : “The law will presume all to have been rightly done unless the circumstances of the case overturn this presumption, and, consequently, as stated by the supreme coui't of the United States in Bank of the U.

It was alleged that some of the proceedings necessary to support the title were irregular. Maxwell, J., delivering the opinion, said (p. 284) : “ The law will presume official acts of public officers to have been rightly done unless the circumstances of the case overturn this presumption ; and acts done which presuppose the existence of other acts to make them legally operative are presumptive proof of the latter.” Bixler v. Baker, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Binn.%20213" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="4 Binn. 213">4 Binn. 213</a>, was ejectment. The act of 1794 authorized the land office to issue patents for lands “ whereon a settlement has been or shall be made, grain raised, and a person or persons residing thereon.” A party cleared and cultivated about three-fourths of an acre o.f the 100 acres in dispute. Two justices agreeably to the statutory provision, gave him a certificate “ that the laud was improved, and had been so since the spring of 1795.” Upon it a warrant was issued, and a survey was made and a patent issued to another person, the plaintiff, who held <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>the warrantee’s title. Another party subsequently entered upon the land and made an actual settlement. The first party brought an action against the actual settler. Tilghman, O. J., in delivering the opinion, after deciding that the legislature had in contemplation an actual personal resident settlement, said (p. 218) : “ But it is contended, that supposing this to be the true construction of the act, the patent is conclusive evidence, that such settlement was made, because the officers of the commonwealth would not have issued it, without proof of the settlement. This argument is not correct. I agree that the patent is strong presumptive evidence of a settlement, and if the court had said so to the jury, all would have been right. But I cannot allow that the patent is conclusive evidence.” Allegheny v. Nelson, <a href="/pa/25/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="25 Pa. 332" data-case-ids="975768" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0332-01">25 Pa. 332</a>, was ejectment to recover an island in the Allegheny river. A patent was issued, under the act of 1806, but the return by the appraisers was silent as to the susceptibility of the island to cultivation. The defendants resisted recovery on the grounds that the land embraced in plaintiff’s survey was not in fact an island and that, even if it was, it was not susceptible of such cultivation as the law required; and that, therefore, the acts of the officers, in granting the warrant and making a survey were unauthorized and void. As to the silence of the return on the facts required by the act, Lewis, C. J., speaking for the court, said (p. 334) : “ His application, and the proceedings in the land office, were therefore legitimate subjects for the consideration of the jury in deciding whether the land was an island or not in 1828 and 1829, when it was applied for, appraised and surveyed as such. It is true that the appraisers omitted to certify according to the directions given to them, ‘ whether the land was susceptible of cultivation in grain or esculent roots, in common seasons.’ They are .silent on this point in their return; but they speak therein of. having had regard to the ‘ soil,’ etc., in fixing its value, and' as their report was not rejected, but was accepted and acted on by the receipt of a portion of the purchase money, and the granting of a warrant, and causing a survey to be made, in pursuance of the application, the presumption is that the irregularity was dispensed with on other satisfactory evidence, that the island was susceptible of cultivation. These proceedings, as against a mere stranger, were surely prima facie evidence that all was <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>rightly done; and, as the evidence is not given' on the paper-book, we are not to intend that the city, of Allegheny was anything more than a stranger.”</p>
    <p id="b595-4" data-blocks='[["BL_595.4",595,[159,506,1180,863]]]'>It is clear, we think, that under the authorities it must be presumed that all the necessary statutory prerequisites to give validity to the Wallace patent have been complied with by the land office. The patent shows that it was issued in pursuance of a warrant and survey. The warrant recites that the application was made pursuant to the provisions of the act of 1806 for an island in the Delaware river “ lying at the mouth of the Schuylkill, near the upper end of Fort Island; ” that the board of property issued an order for its appraisal by three appraisers ; that two of the appraisers had made a report that they had appraised the land at $2.00 per acre, a one-third part of which had been paid to the state treasurer. We think the warrant, survey and patent were prima facie evidence that the conditions of the act of 1806 had been fully observed by the officials of the land office, and that the land described therein was, in 1822, an island and patentable as such under the act of 1806.</p>

This, however, was a question of fact and was for the jury. Fixing the location of the island was necessarily attended with difficulty under the circumstances and while the evidence possibly was not as explicit and convincing as might be desired, yet it was sufficient to justify a finding by the jury. In locating the Wallace tract the surveyors made use of the original survey of 1822, the Shallcross survey of 1851 on which the Ashmead patent was issued, the Miller survey of 1860 made for the United States government, and the Gillingham survey of 1891. Gillingham testified that Cabin island was bounded on the north by the old Back channel, on the east and south by the low-water line of the Delaware river, on the west by United States government property, and that “ the Schuylkill river and the Delaware river join just about ” the island. He located the Wallace tract within the lines of the land described in the writ. It is 'true, one of the surveyors testified that the Wallace patent gives no monuments on the ground by which the location of the island could be made, but the several surveys were <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>used and by this assistance the location was made. Both parties put in evidence the Shallcross survey of Cabin island showing the area and giving a description by courses and distances of the island patented to Ashmead in 1851. On this survey the Wallace tract appears as part of Cabin island and a description by courses and distances is given of the tract substantially as it appears in the patent of 1822. The Wallace tract is included within the boundaries of the Shallcross survey, but the acreage was excluded from it in issuing the patent to Ashmead. In addition to this, the disclaimer filed by the appellant locates the Wallace tract as a part of the premises which the appellee designates as Cabin island and for which this action was brought. The documentary evidence, the disclaimer and the oral testimony were sufficient to go to the jury on the questioh of the location of the island.</p>

Whether the land in dispute was accretions to the original island was purely a question of fact and was properly submitted to the jury.</p>

The company, the plaintiff in that action, recovered a judgment and obtained possession of the premises. It relied on the same chain of title to Wallace island in that action, that the appellee relies on here, and on the strength of that title it recovered in the action. The record in that case was offered and admitted here, not as proof of the appellee’s title, but in rebuttal as an admission by the present appellant in regard to the title to the premises in dispute in this case.

Under these instructions, the verdict establishes as a fact that the land sued for in this action was not a part of Mud island and that there is no outstanding title in the United States as the owner of that island. The appellant company, therefore, is compelled to rely on the Ashmead grant, a part of which was, as appears by the deed, conveyed to it by the United States in 1899. It did not include the island covered by the Wallace patent, and hence did not include the accretions’ to that island.

The appellant’s explanation that it was done for the purpose of clearing the title is not sufficient. That is simply a theory with no evidence to support it.
