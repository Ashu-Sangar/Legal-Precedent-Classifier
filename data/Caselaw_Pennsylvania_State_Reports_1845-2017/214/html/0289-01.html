Words of express joinder are not necessary for this purpose ; but, on the other hand, there should be words of severance, in order to produce a several responsibility or a several right.”</p>

But when further on it expressly states that, “ it is agreed and distinctly understood that each of the undersigned is to be liable for only one-tenth of the above amount ” —$350—these are words of severance and make the responsibility of the signers several and not joint.</p>

But their promise to pay for it is several and not joint. It is true that they expressed themselves in the plural number and use the expression, ‘ we will pay,’ in reference to the several installments that were to become payable at various stages and upon the final completion of the contract. But the terms of this promise must be considered as qualified by the stipulation that each of the defendants is to pay one-half of the entire price in installments. Taking the whole instrument together, it must be in<a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>terpreted as providing that each defendant shall pay one-half of each installment, as it becomes due, and no more. . . . It is very plain that no judgment could be rendered against the two jointly for any installment, without rendering them jointly and severally liable for the amount and making each to that extent a surety for the other, and for that reason the plaintiff is not entitled to such a judgment.”</p>
