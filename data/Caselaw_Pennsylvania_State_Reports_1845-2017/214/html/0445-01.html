    <p id="b476-7" data-blocks='[["BL_476.9",476,[280,1341,1181,1074]]]'>Lucious S. Beaumont assigned and transferred to The Provident Life &amp; Trust Company of Philadelphia certain securities in trust, to be held and employed for uses defined and declared in an instrument of writing, sealed and executed by him September 26,1893. Beaumont died March 29,1903. The Provident Life &amp; Trust Company shortly thereafter settled an account of its trust in the common pleas court of Philadelphia, showing a balance in its hands of $15,993.08. Opposing claimants of the fund appeared; certain parties named in the instrument creating and defining the trust claimed by and through it as beneficiaries thereunder; the widow of Beaumont, who was not named in the instrument, but who had become administratrix c. t. a. claimed it as legal representative of the dead man’s estate. The court awarded it to the latter. The appeal is from the decree of award, and it raises but a single question: is the instrument which gives rise to the dispute a will ? If it is, the fund' was properly awarded to the legal representative of the estate, executing a probated later will; if a deed which upon its delivery to the trustee vested in the opposing claimants a beneficial interest in the property transferred, the fund should be awarded them.</p>

      <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>The answer to the question must be derived from what appears within the four corners of the paper as written. No difficulty results in the present case from the fact that the field of inquiry is thus restricted, for the reason that the instrument is so intelligible, both as to purpose and scheme, that it furnishes within itself a convincing and conclusive answer to the question. It is contended that it is not complete, in that it does not contain all that was intended; but, that what it does contain was intended, and that the intentions so far as expressed are clearly intelligible, is not disputed.</p>

It is admitted that the instrument neither directly nor by implication makes any final disposition of the bonds after they should have served this one purpose. Either the death of the insured or the maturity of the policy in his lifetime, would have wholly discharged the trust so far as it concerned them ; the first would have brought them into his estate ; the second would have made them his own absolute^. No present beneficial interest therein passed with the execution and delivery of the paper to anyone; the bonds remained Beaumont’s ; the accumulations therein were payable only at his death; the insurance was intended for the benefit of the mother, brothers and sisters, to the exclusion of the wife; but they were to get it only upon the death of Beaumont; no uses or trusts were declared with respect to it, except in the event that it reached the hands of the trustee, and under the terms of the gift it could only pass to the trustee in case the policy did not mature in Beaumont’s lifetime. Then too, there is the additional fact that the instrument asserts its revocability. Here is quite enough without considering the circumstances that attest very clearly both the testamentary purpose and testamentary disposition of property. The paper is essentially a will, in that it is a declaration of the maker’s intentions with respect to his property, which he wills to be performed after his death; it is this and nothing more. Being in law and in fact a will, its revocability was a necessary incident. The fact that the right of revocation is in terms reserved, may afford some indication that the maker thought it a deed and not a will, and that he did so think, is altogether likely from the fact that in the instrument he speaks of it as a <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>deed ; but this circumstance is without significance. We hare repeatedly said that in such cases, the inquiry is not what the maker called the instrument, or. what it was in his'conception, but-what it is in contemplation of the law and- in effect. Everything can be' affirmed of the paper under consideration, that was said of that discussed in Rick’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/105/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="105 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="454289" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0528-01">105 Pa. 528</a>; in effect it is a mere power of attorney; it was made for the grantor’s own personal ' convenience; the' trustee therein' was' to account to the grantor for all that might be done under the powers granted; it passed no beneficial interest during the lifetime of the grantor! In Turner v. Scott, <a href="/pa/51/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="51 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="999790" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0126-01">51 Pa. 126</a>; Frederick’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/52/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="52 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="1002226" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0338-01">52 Pa. 338</a>, and in Rick’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/105/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="105 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="454289" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0528-01">105 Pa. 528</a>, may be found abundant authority for all we have said in connection with the present case, and further citation is unnecéssary.
