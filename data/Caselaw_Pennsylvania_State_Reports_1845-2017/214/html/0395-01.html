The alleged fraud upon which the appellant relies for a reversal of the judgment is thus set forth: “ Frederick Fries, John M. Carroll, T. J. Breslin, and others were stockholders in the Fries-Breslin Company, a corporation created by and existing under the laws of the state of New Jersey, with its principal offices at Camden, N. J., and the said Frederick Fries claimed, on or before November 25, 1901, that the said Fries-Breslin Company was indebted to him for dividends in a large sum of money. This was denied by the defendant company, chiefly on the ground that the said dividends had not been regularly or formally declared. After suit in the courts of the state of New Jersey it was adjudged that the said dividends were regularly declared, and thereupon the note in the aforesaid suit was given, together with several other notes.” This is an admission by the defendant that the note in suit was given in payment, or part payment of the dividends to which it had been judicially determined Fries was entitled. The affidavit of defense then proceeds to aver: “ After giving the said note it was discovered by the stockholders of the said company that the said dividends had not been earned, but had been made to appear as due by a fraudulent conspiracy among Frederick Fries and Thomas J. Breslin, whereby, by means of fictitious inventories, dividends were made to appear as earned, when as a matter of fact they had not been earned.”</p>

      <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>It is to be noted that there is no averment by the defendant that the judicial determination of the regularity of the award of dividends to Fries does not still stand as a judgment that he is entitled to them, and, this being so, his right to receive them cannot be attacked in this proceeding. Until the judgment establishing their regularity has been opened, modified or-reversed, the defendant can make no defense in a suit to collect a note given in payment of them. In the suit brought to determine the regularity of the dividends and the right of Fries to receive them every question relating to them was raised, or ought to have been raised.</p>

But there is nothing in this averment to show that the company was enjoined from paying to Fries the dividends judicially found to have been regularly awarded to him, and in payment of which the company gave the note in suit. There is no allegation that the company was enjoined from paying him his dividends, or that he was enjoined from collecting the note in suit. In short, in this last averment nothing appears as a reason why the company should not pay the note to Fries or to the present holder. Breslin has been enjoined from collecting his judgment, and the Fries-Breslin Company has been enjoined from paying him and Fries any money on account of alleged profits, are the averments of the affidavit of defense; but there is no averment, as stated, that the company has been enjoined from paying the dividends to Fries, or the note given for them. The affidavit <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>of defense must lie taken most strongly against tbe defendant which made it, and as there is no averment that Fries has been enjoined from collecting the dividends awarded to him, it is to be assumed that the defendant could not make it.</p>
