    <p class="syllabus" id="b348-9" data-blocks='[["BL_348.9",348,[267,1835,1176,450]]]'>In an action to recover commissions on the sale of real estate, it appeared that the defendant agreed to pay plaintiff $20,000 if he sold certain coal land for a price named. Plaintiff secured a purchaser, the land was sold, and the plaintiff received the consideration in stock of a corporation. The defendant agreed that out of the proceeds of the stock as it was sold, he would pay plaintiff one-fourth of the proceeds of each sale until the sum of $20,000 was paid. This arrangement was carried out until the defendant sold for a reduced sum the whole balance of the stock which he had. <em>Held, </em>that plaintiff was entitled to receive out of the sum paid for the balance of the stock, whatever portion of the $20,000 had not been paid to him.</p>
