    <p class="summary" id="b67-6" data-blocks='[["BL_67.5",67,[167,1292,1179,764]]]'>The testamentary trust of $40,000 was in these words: “ In trust for George W. West and Rebecca West, to be invested in accordance with the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, the net income to be paid in equal amounts quarter yearly to said George W. West and Rebecca West, during their lives, and at their deaths the principal to their respective heirs. In case I survive them or either of them, then the principal of his or her portion to his or her heirs.” George W. West afterwards died, leaving a widow, and a sister, and nephew and nieces, but no issue. The auditing judge held that the estate in the first taker was equitable, and that to the heirs was legal; that the two estates did not coalesce, and that the rule in Shelley’s case therefore did not apply. He decided further that in a gift of personalty, heirs in Pennsylvania are synonymous with the next of kin, and that the widow was entitled to share.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b67-7" data-blocks='[["BL_67.6",67,[168,2068,1176,354]],["BL_68.1",68,[281,353,1173,96]]]'>We think that upon principle and the authorities, many of which he referred to, the auditing judge was right in his conclusions. The trust for the first taker was definite and ended with his life; and the words immediately following, “ the principal to his heirs,” imported a direct gift to the heirs as purchasers, precisely as in the next clause, where the testator provides “ in case I survive, then the principal of his portion to <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>his heirs.” The words of direct gift are in both instances manifestly implied.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b68-4" data-blocks='[["BL_68.4",68,[280,457,1175,560]]]'>It was contended at the argument that both estates were equitable; that the will was “ in trust to pay the income to the life tenant, and the trust to pay the principal to the heirs.” But if the words “ to pay ” are inserted in the gift to the heirs, the result will not be varied. The trust for the first taker was active; it was to invest and to pay the net income, duties which, under Bacon’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/57/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="57 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1010429" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0504-01">57 Pa. 504</a>, and many later cases, involve the performance of active duties. The trust to the heirs, assuming that a trust as to them was created, on the contrary was simply to pay, and was a dry trust which was immediately executed, and the heirs took a legal estate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b68-5" data-blocks='[["BL_68.5",68,[279,1025,1176,713]]]'>The position taken by the auditing judge that no trust existed for the heirs and that they took an absolutely legal estate, we think is the correct solution of the question, and is amply vindicated by the authorities. Among those may be named Rife v. Geyer, <a href="/pa/59/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="59 Pa. 393" data-case-ids="426935" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0393-01">59 Pa. 393</a>, in which an active trust had been created in favor of one for life, and at his death the trustee was directed to hold the estate for the use of the heirs of the life tenant, and it was held that the heirs took a legal remainder in fee. So in Chamberlain v. Maynes, <a href="/pa/180/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="180 Pa. 39" data-case-ids="888278" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0039-01">180 Pa. 39</a>, the trustee was empowered to convey, at the death of the life tenant, the estate to the daughter of the grantor, and it was decided that the daughter could herself convey the legal title without the intervention of the trustee. See also Renziehausen v. Keyser, <a href="/pa/48/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="48 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="422129" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0351-01">48 Pa. 351</a>.</p>
