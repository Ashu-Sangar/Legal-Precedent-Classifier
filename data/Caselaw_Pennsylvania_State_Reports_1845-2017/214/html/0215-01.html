The cope • is hoisted by a crane and suspended by chains to a hook: The sand is then punched or rammed out. This was the work in which plaintiff was engaged when the accident occurred. The cope “ wobbled ” or “ tilted,” slipped off the hook and struck .plaintiff on his foot,, injuring him severely. It had “ wobbled ” or “ tilted ” frequently before and plaintiff had been engaged in the same work for a number of days previously,’having abundant opportunity to observe the operation. It was ordinary labor, requiring no skill or instruction.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b247-4" data-blocks='[["BL_247.5",247,[202,844,1176,770]]]'>The evidence as to the insufficiency of the hook was not sufficient to convict defendants of negligence. It had been used frequently before, had answered its purpose and although, it might have been larger or of a different shape this .was a matter of judgment. The witnesses who spoke of its defects or insufficiency had used others of different make or size, but as there was no standard hook or method of attaching the cope to the crane chain this 'testimony was of little importance. Besides, it was entirely theoretical. The party charging negligence does not show it by showing that the machinery was not in common use. If it should be so held the use of the newest and best machinery if not generally adopted, could be adduced as évidence of negligence: Smith v. Traction Co., <a href="/pa/202/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="202 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="992261" data-case-paths="/pa/202/0054-01">202 Pa. 54</a>; Cunningham v.

The attempt at the trial seems to have been, not to develop the facts immediately connected with the occurrence, but to establish by expert testimony a theoretical cause which at most was one of many equally probable causes.” In many respects the case cited is analogous, and there as here “ it did not appear whether the dropping of the bucket was caused by overloading, by defects in the machinery, or by unskillful management.”</p>

He had ■been engaged in the particular work- at the crane apparatus <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>for twenty-six days prior to the accident and had assisted in raising the cope during that period seventy-eight times, i. e., three times each day — that he had assisted in freeing the cope from sand once each day during the said period. During this time the apparatus was in the same condition as at the time of the accident. There was no latent defect in the apparatus and nothing broke. If to the mind of the plaintiff, who was engaged in the work, there was no defect in the machinery, how could his employers be any wiser? If it was dangerous why did he continue in the work? Iiis ejms showed him everything that was necessary to be known as regards the safety of the operation. Instruction was not necessary, and any ordinary laboring man could have done the work. When the cope “ tilted ”-it was because it was overloaded, improperly balanced or punched too hard, and this should have pub plaintiff on his guard; and if for either reason the chains- slipped — the most plausible theory — the defendants are not liable.</p>
