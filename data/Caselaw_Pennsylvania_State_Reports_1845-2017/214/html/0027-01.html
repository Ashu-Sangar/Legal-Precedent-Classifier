He was an experienced driver and had driven the log truck three or four times before. He claimed that a pin on the rear end of the log truck came out, that the columns were thrown to the ground, and that he was knocked from his position and injured. The evidence tended to show that the plaintiff knew as much of the condition of the truck as the defendant did.</p>
