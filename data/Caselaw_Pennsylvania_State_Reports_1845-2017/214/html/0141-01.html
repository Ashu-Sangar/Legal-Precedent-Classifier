The court in banc confirmed the adjudication, saying: “ It is very clear that no valid gift of the note presented as a claim against the estate of the decedent was <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>shown and the auditing judge has found as a fact that payments of interest which .prevented the running of the statute of limitations, were made within six years.” The appellant’s counsel, in his printed brief, has confined his discussion to the sufficiency of the evidence to prevent the running of the statute. He, however, suggests in his argument that Lydia Muringer, the claimant, was not a competent witness to testify to matters occurring in the lifetime of Valentine Clad, and that “ any declarations alleged to have been made to Mrs. Schussele (by Clad) were not binding on the estate because made to a stranger.”</p>

When Lydia Muringer was called as a witness to support her claim against the estate, her examination was confined to matters occurring since the death of Mr. Clad. To that extent she was clearly competent. When the learned counsel for the appellant cross-examined her, however, he did not confine himself to occurrences since the death of Mr. Clad, but went beyond that date and interrogated her fully as to matters occurring prior to his death. This made her competent for all purposes, and her counsel was then at liberty to examine her on all matters relative and material to her claim against the estate.</p>

The note was given in 1881 for money which it was admitted was received by Clad from his mother-in-law, and which he used in his business. The interest, as shown by the note, was due semiannually, on January 1 and July 1 of each year. Clad paid this interest, 152.50, regularly and semiannually until the death of the payee, Mrs. Eva S. Muringer, in 1889. From that date till 1894, the same amount of money was paid to Mrs. Muringer’s executrix by Clad or his daughter, Eva S., on or about the times the semiannual payments of interest were due. From 1894 until Clad’s death in 1902 like sums, except on two or three occasions, were paid at or about the same dates to the executrix of the payee by Miss Eva Clad, and the payments were continued until January, 1904. The original payee and her executrix have had possession of the note from its date till the present time, and during all those twenty-three years it is admitted there has been paid by the maker or a member of his family to whom he paid a like sum on each occasion, semiannually, on or about January 1 and July 1, a sum of money exactly equal to the interest due on the note on those dates. In the face of these facts alone the allegation of the appellant is incredible that subsequent to the death of Mrs. Eva S. Muringer, the payee, the semiannual payments were presents and not interest. The learned judge below correctly held that there had been no gift of the note by the payee in her lifetime to the children of the maker, as claimed by the appellant, and that ruling is not seriously controverted here by the appellant. The note, therefore, properly passed into the possession of the executrix of the payee at the latter’s death, and it, as well as the indebtedness secured by it, is a part of Mrs. Muringer’s estate. The definite sums paid semiannually to the executrix of Mrs. Muringer were due her on the note on these dates, and on no other claim or obligation, either individually or as executrix. If it was a present, and was not paid as interest, why was the exact sum to the very cent, $52.50, handed to the executrix, to whom the interest was payable every six months, for fifteen <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>years, during all of which time the appellant, who made these presents, alleges the note as well as the indebtedness belonged to her children ? Again, if the payment was a present, why did the maker of the note pay, with the same regularity and on the same dates, to his wife and daughter, who delivered it to the executrix, a sum of money the exact equivalent of the interest due semiannually on the note ? The evidence discloses no satisfactory answer to these questions, but, on the contrary, as said by the learned auditing judge, “ whether paid by himself (Valentine Clad, the maker,) or his daughter, the peculiar amounts and the definite periods of its payment certainly earmark it as interest on this note.”</p>

There is no evidence in the case, and it is not claimed, that Clad was indebted to Mrs. Eva S. Muringer or her executrix in any other sum or on any other note ; nor does the evidence show, nor is it contended, that Clad or his children paid to the payee or her executrix any other moneys as interest. Lydia Muringer, the executrix and appellee, testified that when Miss Eva Clad made the semiannual payments she said it was a present, but that she, the witness, “ would object every time, because it was not a present.” Mrs. Schussele is a daughter of Mrs. Eva S. Muringer and the sister of Mrs. Clad and of Lydia Muringer, the appellee. She testifies that about one and a half or two years before Clad’s death she had a conversation with him in which he said: “I am a very sick man ; we have such discussions at home, such quarrels with my wife and Miss Muringer about this interest business that I am going to forbid Miss Muringer the house.” The witness replied : “ That is all very well, to forbid her the house, but you pay her first that $2,100 of mother’s note, then you can forbid her the house.” Clad then said: “ Why, she don’t need that money; you big fool, how can I take $2,100 out of my business as if it was so many cents ? She don’t need the money ; I will go on and pay her interest, and that is all she needs.” In view of the fact that the semiannual installments of money paid to Mrs. Muringer in her lifetime, and being paid her executrix at the time of this con<a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>versation by Clacl’s daughter with moneys furnished by him, were the semiannual payments of $52.50, the exact amount due on those dates as interest on the note, it is manifest the money paid by the daughter was Clad’s money, and was paid and received as interest on the note. On another occasion, two or three years before his death, Mrs. Schussele heard a conversation between Miss Muringer, the executrix, and Mr. Clad, in which Miss Muringer said to him she had come to see if she could “ get her interest, it is over ten or twelve days,” and that he then paid her the interest. Mrs. Schussele further testifies that during Clad’s absence and within three or four years of his death, she saw Mrs. Clad pay Miss Muringer the interest in cash several times and take receipts. Miss Muringer testifies that the interest was paid her till January, 1904, by Mrs. Clad or one of her daughters, and she frequently gave receipts for it.</p>
    <p id="b177-5" data-blocks='[["BL_177.4",177,[161,1199,1178,460]]]'>It is manifest, we think, that calling the sums paid by Clad’s wife and daughter <em>“ </em>presents ” was a subterfuge, conceived and resorted to by Clad for the purpose of avoiding the effect which they would have as payments of interest on the note which he knew would prevent the running of the statute of limitations. By this artifice, Clad desired to prevent a suit on the note within the time required by the statute of limitations, and thereafter he expected to defeat a recovery of the claim by the legal holder of the note by pleading the statute.</p>
