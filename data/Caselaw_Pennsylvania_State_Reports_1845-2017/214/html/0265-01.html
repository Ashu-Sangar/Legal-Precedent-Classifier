The condition of such a bond was to pay “any and all persons, any and all sums of money which may be due, for labor and material supplied or performed in and about the said work.” The contractor and the subcontractor for bricks both became financially embarrassed, and a material man of the subcontractor continued to furnish bricks to parties who were carrying on the original contracts who had an interest to do so. Suit was brought by the material man against the contractor, the surety in the bond, and the subcontractor. Another person was by amendment made a codefendant. Neither this person nor the subcontractor were partners of the contractor, and the surety was not charged as a surety for a partnership. The court amended the record by striking out the name of the subcontractor, and of the-additional codefendant, as parties defendant, and a judgment was obtained against the contractor and the surety. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the bond was not broader than the purpose and scope of the ordinance, and could be enforced according to its terms; (2) that the surety was not relieved by reason of the work being carried on under the original contract by one having an interest in seeing that the contract was executed; (3) that the amendment of the record was properly allowed; (4) that a verdict and judgment for plaintiff should be sustained.</p>

In the course of such performance Harffey ordered bricks from Edmund Webster &amp; Nephew, the plaintiffs. Before bidding on the work Harffey had applied to the plaintiffs for prices and had been quoted a price of $7.25 per thousand for hard bricks and $13.00 per thousand for re-pressed bricks. After the date of the contract between Harffey and the Nichols company, when Harffey gave an order for bricks, Edmund Webster, one of the plaintiffs, went to the office of the Union Surety and ■ Guaranty Company and was there told that as the Nichols company and Harffey had given bond for the completion of the schoolhouse, there would be sufficient money to erect the building and that all would be paid: “ All of us would get our money.” A price was accordingly made by the plaintiffs to Harffey somewhat more favorable than the price originally quoted, to wit.: $7.00 per thousand for hard bricks and $13.00 per thousand for re-pressed bricks. The bricks were ordered from time to time as they were needed. They were delivered by the plaintiffs at the schoolhouse. All the bricks specified in the plaintiffs’ statement were in fact so delivered and were used in the construction of the building.</p>

On or about January 15,1900, Harffey got into financial difficulties, and Diamond, his bondsman, completed the work under the subcontract. On or about said date Diamond filed with the Union Surety and Guaranty Company a form of notice or assignment, signed by Harffey, and authorizing Diamond to receive such sums as would otherwise be payable to Harffey. Such bricks as were delivered by the plaintiffs after that date appear to have been charged upon their books just as they had previously been, and they appear to have been consigned to Harffey. The exact relation between Harffey and Diamond does not seem to have been clear to the plaintiffs; but at least one of the partners in the plaintiff firm had notice during the continuance of the work that Diamond had taken up the Harffey contract.</p>

Thereupon one Levin took up the work and completed it. Levin’s action in the matter is explained by the circumstances that he had made himself liable to indemnify the Fidelity and Deposit Company, which had in turn given a counter indemnity bond to the Union Surety and Guaranty Company in respect of the risk assumed by the last named company as surety upon the bond of the Nichols company to the city. On April 1, 1900, plaintiffs had delivered bricks of an aggregate price of $1,983.70, and they had received payments on account, one on “ 3/22/00 of 11,200 ” and one on “4/21/00 of $720.40,” making a total of $1,920.-40; so that the balance due the plaintiffs at the time of the abandonment of the work by the Nichols company was only $63.30. All the bricks for the price of which this suit is brought were (with the exception of the small balance just mentioned) delivered by the plaintiffs at the schoolhouse after the failure of the Nichols company. The contract price of the bricks so delivered, plus the balance due April 1, 1900, was $2,725.75, upon which the plaintiffs are entitled to interest from July 6, 1900 (the date of the delivery of the last order), provided the Union Surety and Guaranty Company is liable at all.</p>

The exact question here raised as to the construction of the ordinance was decided in Bowditch v. Gourley, <a href="/pa-super/24/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="24 Pa. Super. 342" data-case-ids="849764" data-case-paths="/pa-super/24/0342-01">24 Pa. Superior Ct. 342</a>, and we concur in the conclusion announced by that court that “ to sanction any other construction would be destructive of the very purpose of the ordinance by taking from the honest labor or material man the particular security which the city councils had provided for his protection.”</p>

After the failure of Harffey the use plaintiffs continued to furnish bricks consigned and charged to him, but with notice that his bondsman had taken up the contract. New contracts were not made but the original contracts were carried to completion by parties having an interest to do so. There was no change in the relation of the contracting parties. The work was done under the contracts either by or for the parties who had agreed to do it, and the Union Surety and Guaranty Company was not relieved from liability on its bonds.</p>

Diamond was by amendment made a codefendant, and judgment was entered against him for want of an affidavit of defense. This judgment on his motion was opened and the record was amended by striking therefrom his name and that of Harffey after the expiration of the period <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>specified in the bond as the limit of time in which suit could be brought. The writ was issued against the Nichols Company Harffey and the Union Surety and Guaranty Company as individuals, and Diamond was brought in as an individual defendant. The four defendants were not named in the statement as partners but it was averred in the statement that “ Harffey and Henry C. Nichols Co. formed a partnership with one Andrew Diamond for the purpose of erecting and constructing the said building.” This averment was erroneous and would have been useless if correct. But it did not charge the Union Surety and Guaranty Company as a partner, nor charge it as surety for a partnership. The amendment was therefore properly allowed. The cahse of action was the obligation of the bond. The striking out of the names of those defendants who had assumed no liability did not change the cause of action against the obligors, nor alter nor increase their liability, nor charge them in any other capacity than that in which they had been sued.</p>
