There was no sufficient evidence of fraud in its procurement to require the submission of that point to the jury.\nOn the main contention that this mortgage was a mere security for the husband\u2019s debt or undertaking the law is conclusively settled against the appellant. A wife under the law of this state had the power to mortgage her separate estate to secure her husband\u2019s debt, and the act of 1893 has not taken it away: Kuhn v. Ogilvie, 178 Pa. 303; Herr v.
