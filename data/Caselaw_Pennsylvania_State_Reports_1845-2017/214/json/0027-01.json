McCullough.\nNegligence \u2014 Master and servant \u2014 Driver of wagon \u2014 Log truck.\nIn an action by a driver of wagon against his employer to recover damages for personal injuries sustained while the plaintiff was driving a log truck on which were loaded iron columns, a nonsuit is properly entered where it appears that the plaintiff was an experienced driver, had driven the log truck three or four times before, and that whatever danger there was in its use, was as apparent to him as to his employer.\nArgued Jan. 9, 1906.\nAppeal, No. 265, Jan. T., 1905, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. No. 3, Phila. Co., June T., 1903, No. 4364, refusing to take off nonsuit in case of John Gr. Zeilmann v. John McCullough.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for personal injuries. Before McMichael, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that on April 22, 1903, plaintiff was engaged in hauling iron columns on a log truck. He was an experienced driver and had driven the log truck three or four times before. He claimed that a pin on the rear end of the log truck came out, that the columns were thrown to the ground, and that he was knocked from his position and injured. The evidence tended to show that the plaintiff knew as much of the condition of the truck as the defendant did.\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nError assigned was refusal to take off nonsuit.\nHenry Birok, for appellant.\nFrancis Shunk Brown, with him Alex. Simpson, Jr., and B. W. Archbald, Jr., for appellee.\nFebruary 12, 1906:"
