But in so doing they are bound to exercise care according to the circumstances, and especially bound to the alert and watchful performance of the duty of all travelers on all highways to look where they are going: Robb v. Connellsville Boro., 137 Pa. 42.\nThe appellant, about nine o\u2019clock on an October evening, while on the footwalk on Parrish street, started to cross that street diagonally about fifteen feet from the crossing at Forty-fourth, and tripped over the curbstone which at that point projected two or three inches above the pavement. There was an electric light at the corner but the plaintiff testified that at this point \u201c it shaded off this curb.\u201d She further testified \u201c I suppose I was looking ahead of me \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I was looking. I guess I must have been looking ahead of me somewheres.\u201d And again, \u201c I guess I must have been looking ahead of me. I don\u2019t know where I was looking. As you go along or I go along, I go right on.\u201d Though she varied the form of her expression somewhat in answer to different questions yet the substance of her testimony was the same and had at least the merit of frankness. It discloses such an inattentive and heedless disregard of the care which the situation required as to effectually defeat her right of action.\nJudgment affirmed.",
