And, secondly, that even conceding defendant\u2019s title to the center of the street there was no evidence that the obstruction existed at the time defendant leased the premises to- Kauffman. Even if the obstruction was one which the owner in any event was bound to remove,, an owner out of possession of premises which are in the actual occupation of' a tenant cannot be held liable without proof of an obligation to repair and notice of the necessity of doing\u2019 so: Lindstrom v. Penna. Co., 212 Pa. 391. There was no such evidence in this case.\nJudgment affirmed..",
