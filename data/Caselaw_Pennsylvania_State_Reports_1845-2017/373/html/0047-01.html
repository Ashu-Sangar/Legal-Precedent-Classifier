Much of the argument in this, connection relies on the theory of the lav/ of cotenancy as applied to real property in the civil law. The criminal law is not controlled by the civil law and, while arguments and analogies from the civil law may be of value in determining the relationship of- the- parties as between themselves and with respect to the property in question, the final determination of this case must lie in the precepts of the criminal law, ■ in the enforcement of which the Commonwealth is an interested party. A private wrong when made a criminal offense becomes a public wrong. Moreover, while textbooks . and other authorities relied on by the defendant state generally that a cotenant who takes possession of the common property can be subjected only to an action for accounting, a distinction is made where the property is divisible in character. Thus in 14 Am. Jur., Cotenancy, §71, it is stated: “It is a general rule that trover will not lie in favor of one cotenant against another who has taken possession of the common property, unless it can be shown that the latter did so with an intent to appropriate it to -himself or otherwise to deprive the plaintiff of its use or value. This doctrine is based on the theory that the foundation of the action- is the right of possession and that, where two or more persons are equally entitled <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>to possession, the one who has it cannot be guilty of a conversion by retaining it. But the rule can have no reasonable application in respect of things that are readily divisible into portions absolutely alike in quality, such as grain, money, etc. As to such things, the general view is that an action will lie whenever a co-tenant in possession uses more than his share or refuses to permit his cotenant to take his proper moiety. . . .”. In <em>Stitt v. Felton, </em><a href="/pa-super/136/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="136 Pa. Super. 338" data-case-ids="1018247" data-case-paths="/pa-super/136/0338-01">136 Pa.

Unlike the partnership relation where each partner automatically becomes the agent of the other partner, an agreement is required for one cotenant to become an agent for the others, and such an agreement creates an additional relationship different and apart from the relationship as owners in common. A reading of the agreement involved clearly shows that “operating for petroleum and natural gas” was the principal purpose of the associa<a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>tion of the parties, and the “acquiring” of real estate but a necessary prerequisite. In this connection it may be noted that title to some of the properties later acquired was improperly taken by defendant in his own name. The agreement predominantly created an agency relationship under which the defendant Bovaird was to manage and operate the enterprise for all of the parties thereto. The label “Cotenancy Agreement” could not change the actual relationship disclosed by the terms of the agreement. The defendant’s status, therefore, was not merely that of a tenant in common as the relationship ordinarily arises by operation of law as, for example, in the case of acquisition of real estate by several grantees. His status was specially fixed by agreement between the parties. Under it he became a co-owner but he primarily became the agent for the other co-owners. In consideration of the salary paid for his services he undertook the management of the enterprise under the terms prescribed in the agreement, by all of which he was bound. One of these terms was that none of the gross income of Carter &amp; Company should be distributed to any of the associates until after the payment of company obligations and expenses, and the repayment of advances made by the cotenants. This provision he grossly violated by appropriating $235,000 to his own use. It was by virtue solely of his employment as agent and not by reason of his right as a cotenant that he came into possession of the monies which he was charged with converting or embezzling. He had no immediate right of possession as cotenant to these monies received <em>qua </em>agent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

There the defendant Mitchneck who owned a coal mine, deducted from the wages of his employes certain sums which he was to pay to the grocer with whom the employes dealt. Mitchneck failed to pay the grocer and he was tried for and convicted of fraudulent conversion. The Superior Court reversed the conviction. Careful reading of the case reveals that the decision was based on the fact that a debtor-creditor relationship existed. In its opinion' the Superior Court said: “The defendant in the present case had not received, nor did he have in his possession, any money <em>belonging </em>to his employees. True he owed them money, but that did not transfer to them the title to and ownership of the money. His deduction from their wages of the amounts of the store bills which they had assigned to Vagnoni, did not change the title and ownership of the money thus withheld, nor did his agreement' to pay to Vagnoni the amounts thus deducted constitute the latter the owner of the money. It effected only a change of creditors. . . In the present case there was no debtor-creditor relationship, but an agency. The money received by the defendant Bovaird did not belong to him as it did to the defendant in the <em>Mitohneoh </em>case, but belonged to all of the parties to the agreement, and the major portion of .the monies appropriated • represented the interest • therein of his associates for whom he was acting as agent.</p>

      <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>In claiming that a, new trial should be granted, defendant contends that the court below erred in rejecting testimony offered by the defendant to prove the market value of the cotenancy. Appellant argues that he should have been permitted to present the value of the properties of Carter &amp; Company at the time of trial in order to show the relationship between such value and the amount of withdrawals made by him. Upon his direct examination his counsel asked, “What would those properties bring now?”, and he answered, “Well, we could sell out our holdings, I feel sure we could sell out our holdings for $1,300,000.”. The court ruled that “. . . the jury should disregard the testimony of the witness as to the value of the property at this time.”. Passing the question whether such testimony properly established market value, and also the question whether the value of the properties to be relevant should not have been related to the time of the misappropriations,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> it is apparent that the purpose of the proffered testimony was to establish the defendant’s ability to repay the monies he withdrew, that is, in equalizing distribution upon liquidation of Carter &amp; Company, the amount of defendant’s overdraft of $196,-704.28 could be charged against his share. The testimony was clearly inadmissible. The monies which he misappropriated were monies received by him as agent and not taken in an attempt to accomplish a withdrawal of his interest in the whole, and his contention reduces itself to the ability to “make good”. It is fundamental that neither ability nor intention to repay is a defense against fraudulent conversion or embezzlement. See <em>Commonwealth v.

He therefore wilfully and wrongfully converted and embezzled the monies as charged in the indictments. The fraud and the crime inhere in the act and cannot be excused or justified by ability or intention to make restitution at some future or indefinite period. Where one is charged with embezzlement or fraudulent conversion, the intention to abstract the money and appropriate it to his own use has been fully executed upon its wrongful taking; the ability and intention to indemnify the party from whom it has been withdrawn remains unexecuted, and such intention, even if conscientiously entertained, may become impossible of fulfillment.

There the defendant, a private banker, was indicted under the Act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 145, for receiving money from a depositor with knowledge that his bank was insolvent. In reversing the lower court, the Superior Court held that the defendant banker could in defense not only show that he was solvent at the time he received the deposit, but, to rebut criminal intent, could show that he believed he was solvent. This is in essence exactly what the court charged in the present case, i.e., that the defendant Bovaird was entitled to acquittal if he had the right to make the withdrawals or if he believed he had such right. Neither in the conclusion reached by the Superior Court in the <em>Hazlett </em>case nor in any of the language used in the opinion was it declared that a defendant’s ability or intention to repay constitutes a defense.</p>

It follows that the Commonwealth was not <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>required to elect as between prosecution for embezzlement and fraudulent conversion as claimed by the defendant. A prosecution for fraudulent conversion . . is properly brought against one who has received property in any capacity and afterwards fraudulently misapplies it, even though an indictment for a different statutory offense would have been proper under the circumstances.”: <em>Commonwealth v. Schuster, </em><a href="/pa-super/158/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="158 Pa. Super. 164" data-case-ids="1063345" data-case-paths="/pa-super/158/0164-01">158 Pa.

The fact that §834 (fraudulent conversion) may have been drafted for the purposes of embracing situations not falling within the provision of §824 (embezzlement) does not preclude an indictment on a specific set of facts under either of these sections. Nor is there merit in the contention that the indictments were not sufficiently specific. Section 11 of the Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 427, 19 PS §261 provides: “Every indictment shall be deemed and adjudged sufficient and good in law which charges the crime substantially in the language of the act of the assembly prohibiting the crime, . . .”. The indictments here unquestionably charged the crimes substantially in the language of the Act of Assembly and it cannot be said that defendant was not apprised of the charges he had to meet. It was not required that facts be set forth therein which were matter of proof at the trial. As said in <em>Commonwealth v. Wooden, </em><a href="/pa-super/94/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="94 Pa. Super. 452" data-case-ids="679894" data-case-paths="/pa-super/94/0452-01">94 Pa.

Apple, a member of the Bar of McKean County, “. . . to represent the Commonwealth before the grand and petit juries, during the October Sessions, 1950, . . . said appointment to expire with October term of Court.”. The appointment was made in accordance with the provision of Article III, §260 of the Act of May 2, 1929, P. L. 1278, 16 PS §260, which provides: “In any case where there is no regularly appointed assistant district attorney, if in case of sickness or from any other cause the district attorney shall be unable to attend to the duties and business of the term of a court, he may appoint some competent attorney of the county, with the approbation of the court, to act as his deputy for one term, but for no longer period.”. Apple as attorney of record for Beth M. Putnam, the prosecutrix in the present case, had entered a confession of judgment in favor of Mrs. Putnam and against the defendant at No. 214 October Term, 1946, in the Common Pleas of McKean County. Before the trial commenced defendant in a motion to quash the indictments, alleged that they were void because Apple was disqualified from presenting the indictments to the grand jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> It is extremely doubtful whether defend<a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>ant’s motion in arrest of judgment may be construed to include as a reason therefor the refusal of the court below to grant the motion to quash. However, we find no merit in the contention that the indictments were void for the reason asserted. In its opinion the Superior Court pointed out that the attorney’s commission of $1,500 included in the judgment confessed did not belong to the attorney but to his client, citing <em>Commonwealth v. Pennsylvania Loan Corporation, </em><a href="/pa-super/127/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="127 Pa.

However, whether or not Apple received this commission or other fee from Mrs. Putnam for services in that transaction, there was no evidence that he represented her at the time he acted as deputy district attorney in the October 1950 Session of the court when the indictments in this case were found. Apple was an officer of the court as a member of the bar and was acting officially and specially for the court. Defendant did not claim that Apple exercised improper influence upon the grand jury or in any way deviated from the proper performance of his duties in this regard. The defendant would have misconduct inferred or presumed because of his representation of the prosecutrix on a previous occasion. To subscribe to such contention would mean that no district attorney could act as such in a case where he had sometime in the past represented the prosecutor in private litigation. Such <em>ipso facto </em>disqualification is not justified.</p>

The Trial Court refused the offer as irrelevant. The Superior Court reversed the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. In its opinion, the Superior Court said: “The evidence embraced in the offer which is the subject of the tenth assignment might not shed any light upon the question whether the defendant had sufficient assets at the time he received this deposit to meet and pay his liabilities in the regular course of business, as counsel for the commonwealth truly say, but we are clearly of opinion, that, if believed by the jury, <em>it would have had a legitimate tendency to repel the inference that it was because of his Imowledge or belief that he was insolvent that he closed his bank ”</em>
