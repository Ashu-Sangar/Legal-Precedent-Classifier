      <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>On February 19, 1930 the relator, then seventeen years old, was convicted in Jones County, Mississippi, of assault with intent to rape and was sentenced to life imprisonment. On July 15, 1943, Hatton, a negro, escaped from the state penitentiary in Parchman, Mississippi, and eventually settled in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he married and became the father of two children. On May 15, 1952 he was arrested and charged by his wife with assault and battery. Subsequent to this arrest it was discovered that Hatton was a fugitive from justice from the State of Mississippi, and in due time a request for extradition was forwarded from the State of Mississippi to the Governor of Pennsylvania. On June 6,1952 the Governor’s warrant duly issued and was executed.</p>
    <p id="b532-4" data-blocks='[["BL_532.4",532,[253,1190,1155,708]]]'>Thereafter relator filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Common Pleas Court of Allegheny County alleging that he was unlawfully restrained of his liberty in violation of his constitutional rights. He later filed a supplemental petition in which he admitted being the person demanded by the State of Mississippi but denied guilt of the charge for which he was there imprisoned. The supplemental petition also alleged that his trial was a mockery of justice; that he was not represented by counsel; that while he was in the state penitentiary in Mississippi he was the victim of cruel and inhuman treatment; and that if he were returned, his life would be in danger at the hands of his jailors.</p>

L. 288, 19 PS §191 et seq., the extent of the proof required to sustain a State’s requisition of another State for the extradition therefrom of a fugitive from justice is that the subject of the extradition is charged with a crime in the demanding State, that he was present in the demanding State at the time of the commission of the crime charged, that he is a fugitive from'the demanding State and that the requisition, papers are in order: see Commonwealth ex rel.

In that Opin<a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>ion the following was quoted from the recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Sweeney, Sheriff v.

Respondent [prisoner] should be required to initiate his suit in the courts of Alabama, where all parties may be heard, where all pertinent testimony will be readily available and where suitable relief, if any is necessary, may be fashioned.”. It should be noted that both of these opinions were filed subsequent to the hearing in the court below in the instant case so that the hearing judge did not have the advantage of reference to them.</p>

If this Court were to consider the constitutional questions raised by relator’s petition, it would be undertaking to review the proceedings of a trial court in the State of Mississippi. This is a function reserved to the appellate courts of that state. The constitution.and statutes-of Mississippi provide for-: appeal from a- criminal conviction and. from the. refusal of .a writ of habeas corpus; the writ, of,coram nobis is recognized, and statutes regulate the administration.;.of the penal system;.'
