      <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>Mike Matil, twenty years of age, unmarried, a truck driver, without dependents, on June 14, 1952, drove his passenger car at seventy miles per hour on the public highway where traffic was “moderate” at 7:30 p.m. on a dry, clear night. He has operated an automobile for three years; has been arrested before for fast driving; and has had one accident. He testified that his driving record is “fair.” The learned court below revoked the suspension and restored the license solely because of economic hardship. The court said in its order: “. . . it having been shown that the operator’s license of the petitioner is necessary to enable him to get to and from his place of employment at the plant of the National Tube Company in Ellwood City, Pennsylvania; further that his license is necessary in connection with his employment by the Steen Machine &amp; Supply Company, Connoquenessing, Pennsylvania; that the testimony of the arresting officer being to the effect that the only offense committed was that of traveling in excess of the established speed limit and that no other provisions of the motor code were violated to the best of the officer’s knowledge; that the arrest occurred on a three-lane concrete surfaced highway where traffic and weather conditions were such as to not aggravate the offense; and the Court being satisfied that the deprivation of the petitioner’s operating privileges for three months would work an undue hardship upon him, the Order of the Secretary of Revenue suspending the petitioner’s license is hereby set aside and the operating privileges of Mike Matil are hereby restored.”</p>
