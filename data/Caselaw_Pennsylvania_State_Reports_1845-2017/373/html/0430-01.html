The bill prayed that an injunction be granted to restrain defendant from the acts in question, and that he be required to reimburse plaintiffs for their damages.</p>

Those findings are not challenged by plaintiffs. Concisely stated, they are to the effect, (finding number 4) that plaintiffs’ property is below the natural grade of defendant’s property and therefore, even before the latter began the improvement of his property, surface water flowed from it onto plaintiffs’ property, where it was satisfactorily dissipated by means of a storm sewer which was constructed there; (finding number 5) that, in the course of improving his property, defendant raised its natural grade; (finding number 6) that during the course of the improvement, which lasted about 12 months, a large amount of earth and other material was permitted to fall on Ingomar Way and some on plaintiffs’ property; that rain and other surface waters were diverted from their natural courses to Ingomar Way and the rear of plaintiffs property in such quantities as to exceed the capacity there of the disposal facilities, with the result that on several occasions water entered the basement of plaintiffs’ building causing damage thereto and to the business there carried on; (finding number <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>7) that in a proceeding in equity brought by the City of Pittsburgh against defendant the latter was ordered to remove all the dirt, fill and other material deposited by him on Ingomar Way; (finding number 8) that defendant complied with this order, did remove the dirt and other material, and constructed cribbing on the line of his property along Ingomar Way, which prevented any such material thereafter from falling thereon; (finding number 9) that defendant asphalted the surface of his land and constructed a raised area or curbing along a portion of the line of Ingomar Way, which prevented thereafter any surface water from flowing directly from his property onto Ingomar Way; (finding number 10) that defendant has constructed on his property basins and sewers which catch a great deal of the surface water, and, even though at times they do not prevent some water from flowing down Ingomar Way and onto the rear of plaintiffs’ property, such flow is much less in amount than reached plaintiffs’ property from defendant’s property at its natural grade and causes no damage to plaintiffs’ property beyond that which surface water formerly caused.</p>
    <p id="b461-3" data-blocks='[["BL_461.4",461,[190,1562,1146,765]],["BL_462.1",462,[244,340,1152,311]]]'>It must be immediately obvious from these findings that, at the time of the hearing and adjudication, the conditions complained of by plaintiffs had been remedied and therefore the court was justified in refusing, as it did, to grant an injunction. This left open the sole question as to whether plaintiffs should, in these proceedings, have been awarded compensation for the expense and losses alleged to have been incurred by them during the period of the making of the improvements on defendant’s property. The damages claimed by them may be classified as (1) losses incurred in their business by reason of the deposit of earth and fill on Ingomar Way and on part of plaintiffs’ property, whereby, as they contend, the traffic of trucks <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>through the alley was impeded; (2) expense incurred in repairing the damage caused by the greater flow of the surface waters during that period onto their land and into the basement of their property. The court refused to allow recovery for any such damages and dismissed the bill.</p>
    <p id="b462-4" data-blocks='[["BL_462.4",462,[239,673,1154,374]]]'>(1) As to the deposit of earth and fill on plaintiffs’ property, the court pointed out that this was not alleged nor made the subject of any claim in the bill of complaint and therefore cognizance could not be taken of it in the present proceedings; accordingly, plaintiffs were relegated to an action of trespass q.c.f. in regard thereto.</p>
    <p id="b462-5" data-blocks='[["BL_462.5",462,[234,1061,1155,871]]]'>As to the blocking of Ingomar Way by the deposit thereon of earth and material, whereby the passage of trucks thereon was interfered with, no items of damage were specifically proved as arising from that situation and any award of damages therefor would have been unwarranted and wholly speculative. The court properly said as to this claim that “From the evidence, it would be impossible for the Chancellor to assess the damages which may have resulted to the plaintiffs from the obstruction of the alley. The plaintiff, Robert L. Chamberlin, contends that access to the rear of his property was prevented and hence his business was damaged. To separate the damages which may have resulted from that cause from the total damage including the flooding of the basement, would be purely conjecture.”</p>

Under the so-called “common-law” or “common-enemy rule,” not only is an owner of higher land under no liability for damages to an owner of lower land caused by water which naturally flows <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>from the one level to the other, but he can, at least in the development of urban property, improve his land by regrading it or erecting buildings thereon, without legal responsibility for any consequent diversion of surface waters from his property to that of adjoining owners, it being recognized that changes or alterations in the surface may be essential to the enjoyment of his property.</p>
    <p id="b463-3" data-blocks='[["BL_463.4",463,[181,796,1147,544]]]'>As early as a century ago it was declared in Pennsylvania in <em>Kauffman v. Griesemer </em><a href="/pa/26/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="26 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="977244" data-case-paths="/pa/26/0407-01">26 Pa. 407</a>, 413, that “Because water is descendible by nature, the owner of a dominant or superior heritage has an easement in the servient or inferior tenement for the discharge of all waters which by nature rise in or flow or fall upon the superior.” And it was there held that the superior owner might improve his land by throwing increased waters upon the inferior owner’s property through the natural and customary channels.</p>
    <p id="b463-4" data-blocks='[["BL_463.5",463,[181,1353,1147,763]]]'>In <em>Strauss v. Allentown, </em><a href="/pa/215/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="215 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="948385" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0096-01">215 Pa. 96</a>, 98, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20A.%201073" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="63 A. 1073">63 A. 1073</a>, it was stated that “Every man has the right to the natural, proper and profitable use of his own land, and if in the course of such use without negligence, unavoidable loss is brought upon his neighbor, it is damnum absque injuria. This is the universal rule of the common law, and nowhere is it more strictly enforced than in Pennsylvania.” Hence it was held that a city was not liable to a property owner for the increased flow of surface water over or onto his property arising merely from the changes in the character of the surface produced by the opening of streets and building of houses in the ordinary and regular course of expansion of the city.</p>
    <p id="b463-5" data-blocks='[["BL_463.6",463,[182,2129,1145,213]],["BL_464.1",464,[256,348,1152,823]]]'>In <em>Rielly v.

Chief Justice Mitchell said (p. 256, A. p. 1099) : “The owners of lots in cities and towns buy and own with the manifest condition that the natural or existing, surface is liable to be changed by the progress of municipal development. All such owners have equal rights neither lessened nor increased by priority of improvement, and the primary right of each owner is to protect himself and his lot from loss or inconvenience from the flow of surface water. . . The owner cannot be coerced as to time or manner of improvement by risk of having put upon him the burden of providing for the flow upon others.”</p>
