Automobiles on land, airplanes in the air, and ships on and under the sea have effected an incredible widening of the perimeter of human activities. Time and space have been contracted in unbelievable measure. In the present appeals we are only concerned with vehicular operation upon land. Auxiliary to automobile movements, to facilitate such travel in safety and speed, the Commonwealth has expended enormous sums of money in the construction and maintenance of modern highways. It has authorized a quasi-public authority to construct, operate, and maintain at least one toll road of over three hundred miles in length extending entirely across the Commonwealth. This highway was designed for high speed and reasonably safe automobile travel. In increasing numbers highways have interlaced the entire country from coast to coast and from border to border. This has contributed to an enormous increase in automobile travel in the United States. Automobiles and trucks are self-propelled vehicles of great weight and are frequently capable of speed equal to, if not exceeding, that of a locomotive running on rails erected on rights of way and guided and partially controlled by electric signal devices and automatic safety controls. The Commonwealth has consequently been required to enact and enforce comprehensive traffic rules and regulations, culminating in the amended Vehicle Code, supra. It has a vital interest concerning possible loss of life and injury of <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>automobile operators and their passengers and also in the safety of other occupants of automobiles, pedestrians, property, and of the public generally. Highways must be made and kept as safe as possible for use by the public. The tremendous traffic, together with the facilities for high speed over improved roads, creates a real hazard and a necessity for comprehensive, detailed regulatory and supervisory measures which have been enacted by the Legislature in The Vehicle Code and its amendments. The issuance and use of vehicle title certificates; motor registration; license plates, operating licenses [with revocation and suspension] and the numerous other provisions in the code are consequently matters of vital necessity in motor operation, control, and supervision.</p>

Accordingly, the delegation of such power to him by The Vehicle Code is not prohibited by article V, section 1, of the Constitution of this State. This question of the delegation of power to an administrative officer was definitely settled by the decision of this Court in Gima v. Hudson Coal Co., <a href="/pa/310/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="310 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="1144272" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0480-01">310 Pa. 480</a>. We decided there that while the legislature cannot delegate its power to enact a law, it may make a law which delegates the power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes its own action depend.

Similarly, under the federal Constitution administrative boards, such as the Interstate Commerce Commission, have been created. These agencies perform an administrative rather than a legislative or judicial function, their determinations by express statutory provisions being subject to review by the courts.

Unfortunately for that contention, it. was ruled by this court a number of years ago that the original requirement of Sec. 616 of The Vehicle Code of 1929 that the hearing court ‘. . . determine whether the petitioner <em>is subject to suspension of operator’s license . . . </em>under the provisions of this act [emphasis supplied]’ meant that ‘. . . the court [was] to hear de novo the witnesses of the Commonwealth and the witnesses of the licensee, and, from the testimony taken, . . . determine <em>anew whether the operator’s license should be suspended’ </em>(Emphasis supplied): Commonwealth v.

The wisdom of this procedure Is questioned by-the Commonwealth. It is argued that <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>since the licensee appeared <em>before the Secretary </em>and was given full opportunity to cross-examine his accusers and to present his defense the Secretary’s discretion should be final except for fraud, accident, or mistake and that no appeal <em>on the merits </em>should be allowed. But, as above stated, under The Vehicle Code the Legislature has merely created an administrative agency, albeit the exercise of its administrative function is in some instances necessarily judicial in nature: cf. <em>Cowperthwait v. Lamb, </em><a href="/pa/373/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="373 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="1240410" data-case-paths="/pa/373/0204-01">373 Pa. 204</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=95%20A.2d%20510" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="95 A.2d 510">95 A. 2d 510</a>. Such situation is well pointed up by Chief Justice Vanderbilt of the New Jersey Supreme Court in his published lectures upon “The Doctrine of the Separation of Powers and Its Present-Day Significance.” So frequently we observe legislation enacted which is in derogation of the powers of the judiciary. This our own Pennsylvania Legislature purposely refrained from doing. As Justice Linn said in <em>Commonwealth v. Irwin, </em><a href="/pa/345/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="345 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1213344" data-case-paths="/pa/345/0504-01">345 Pa. 504</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.2d%2068" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="29 A.2d 68">29 A. 2d 68</a>, (p. 507): “A qualified person may not be deprived of the privilege of obtaining a license by arbitrary action of the officers entrusted with the administration of the code.” But on a hearing <em>de novo, </em>on appeal, the court of common pleas, while entitled to act independently in the exercise of its discretion, must, nevertheless, act in accordance with the evidence and circumstances presented. The court should also always keep in mind the important and heavy responsibilities imposed by the Legislature upon the Secretary of Revenue in enforcing the Vehicle Code, which was enacted for the benefit, care, and protection of <em>all </em>the people. • While, as above indicated, the court below is not bound by the Secretary’s exercise of discretion or the evidence taken - before <em>him,- </em>nevertheless the exercise of his discretion,- if- made • in accordance with, the provisions and-spirit-of the statute,- is entitled to consideration.

However, it is well settled that where the right of appeal is not provided by statute, but is not prohibited, it is our duty to examine the testimony to determine whether the findings of the court below are supported by competent evidence, and to correct any conclusions of law erroneously made: Weinbach’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/316/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="316 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="1159063" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0333-01">316 Pa. 333</a>; Rimer’s Contested Election, <a href="/pa/316/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="316 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="1159019" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0342-01">316 Pa. 342</a>; Fleming v.

    <p id="b427-2" data-blocks='[["BL_427.4",427,[178,835,1148,923]]]'>We have carefully reviewed the present record. The testimony is undisputed. Marl E. Emerick, Jr., is the licensee. A state policeman testified that the licensee, at a high rate of speed, drove through an intersection without stopping, ignoring a stop sign erected at the junction. The officer followed in his police car intending to charge a “stop sign violation.” The licensee speeded up. He was “clocked” at eighty miles an hour. Upon being overtaken the licensee was charged with a speed violation: Vehicle Code, supra, Sec. 1002, 75 PS 501. Licensee testified that he had no excuse. The only testimony given in extenuation was his statement that if his license was suspended, he would experience difficulty in reaching his place of employment; that he had driven for six years and that this was the first charge of motor vehicle code violation; and that he was a married man with two children.</p>
    <p id="b427-3" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[182,1778,1146,587]]]'>The learned court below set aside the suspension of the operator’s license and restored same <em>solely </em>upon the ground of economic hardship. The court said in its order: “[It] would work an undue hardship upon the defendant and his family, in that he is a steel worker with no other practical means of obtaining transportation to his employment and that in his spare time and in that in his off hours he aids his father-in-law in his delivery service, the appeal of the defendant is allowed and the suspension of his operator’s license is set aside and the same restored to him.”</p>

      <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>This constitutes a manifest abuse of discretion by the hearing judge. Every time a person is convicted of a crime and is sentenced to prison, he and his family doubtless suffer an economic loss. But this constitutes no excuse for defendant’s wrongdoing. The defendant manifestly was speeding in an endeavor to elude arrest and thus jeopardized his own life and limb and those of other users of the highway. Economic hardship standing alone is insufficient to excuse such a violation.</p>
