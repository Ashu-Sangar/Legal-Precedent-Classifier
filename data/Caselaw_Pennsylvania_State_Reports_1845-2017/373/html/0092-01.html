The dump was quite large, constituting part of an abandoned quarry pit. It was not adequately enclosed by a fence or barrier. The rubbish deposited there consisted of paper, cartons, boxes, tin cans, bottles, glass, furniture, ashes, pieces of iron, newspapers, mattresses, sofas, bicycles, tires, broken wheels and toys; some of it was inflammable and occasionally fires raged on the dump. The children of the tenants were accustomed to play on and around it. One afternoon the minor plaintiff, then 7 years of age, was searching there for junk; his clothing caught on fire and he sustained severe burns about his body which resulted in serious permanent injury. In the present suit brought by his father against the Authority on his behalf, and <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>in .Ms own right, the' court, sitting without a jury, found a, verdict in favor of the father in the sum'.of $18,000 and as ¡guardian of his minor son-in the sum. of $30,000.

Indeed the decisions on this subject have been more or less arbitrary, and not wholly consistent with one another, perhaps because they have been based" primarily on'practical considerations of public policy rather than oh any principles of logic. - What at least; is firmly established is, that, in the- case of acts of mu-nicipalities performed as functions of government dele-' gated by the State to its agencies as public instru-' mentalities, there is immunity from such- liability, whereas in the case of acts of municipalities performed in their proprietary or business capacity the doctrine of respondeat superior applies and liability exists.

L. 955, created Authorities for the proclaimed purpose of providing safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low incomes. The powers granted to them are enumerated at great length in section 10 of the Act, one of which (cláiise j) 'is, “To arrange with <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>. . . any county, city or other municipality of the State ... to cause the services customarily provided by each of them to be rendered for the benefit of such housing authority, or the occupants of any housing projects of the Authority; and ... to provide and maintain parks . . . sewerage, . . . water, and other municipal facilities adjacent to, or in connection with, housing projects.” Parallel with this provision is section 4 of the Housing Cooperation Law of May 26, 1937, P. L. 888, which provides that “For the purpose of aiding and cooperating in the . . . operation of housing projects located within the area in which it is authorized- to act, any State public body may upon such terms, with or without consideration, as it may determine . . . cause . . . community facilities ... to be furnished adjacent to or in connection with housing projects.”</p>

While, therefore, a Housing Authority is undoubtedly a public body “exercising public powers of the Commonwealth as an agency thereof” (section 10 of the Act) and accordingly may, perhaps, be regarded as exercising a function of government in providing dwelling accommodations for persons of low income, it does not by any means follow that if it chooses to extend its activities by itself furnishing ancillary services instead of contracting to obtain them from other public bodies of the State it can thereby extend its tort immunity. over the field of all such assumed activities by the contention that in furnishing such services it is exercising a governmental function. Here the maintenance of the dump was not necessary to carry out <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>the legislative mandate of providing dwelling house accomodations for persons of low income; at most it may have constituted a convenience for the tenants.</p>
    <p id="b124-4" data-blocks='[["BL_124.4",124,[266,522,1153,650]]]'>It would seem reasonably inferable from the welter of decisions on the subject that the mere maintenance of a refuse dump, as in the present case, on land owned by a public agency, is not such an activity as constitutes the performance of a governmental function, but that, on the contrary, a municipality or other public body owning land is legally responsible for the maintenance of it in a safe condition to the same extent as any private owner. Thus tort liability has been imposed on municipal corporations in connection with parks, playgrounds, swimming pools, city-owned buildings, fire-houses, incinerators, and vacant lots.</p>

The ownership of property entails certain burdens, one of which is the obligation of care that it shall not injure others in their property or persons, by unlawful use or neglect. This obligation rests, without regard to personal disabilities, on all owners alike, . . . by virtue of their ownership, and municipal corporations are not exempt.” In that case water seeped into premises adjoining a school building owned by the city because of a defectively constructed privy well on the city’s property.</p>

Apart, however, from the fact previously pointed out that activities of this nature were not imposed by ■the statute upon Housing Authorities and therefore could not be said to be exercised by them in their capacity as governméntal agencies, the <em>Bandos </em>and <em>SeibiUa- </em>cases were different from the present one in that there the persons injured were struck by a vehicle of the city engaged in conveying ashes and refuse to <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>one of the city’s dumps; the question involved, therefore, was not concerned, as here, with the duty imposed upon public bodies as well as upon private individuals in connection with their possession and control of land.
