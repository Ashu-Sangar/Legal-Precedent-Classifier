We agree that this was in accordance with the facts and the law applicable thereto.</p>
    <p id="b133-5" data-blocks='[["BL_133.4",133,[180,561,1148,818]]]'>We also agree that defendant wus not entitled to any compensation for services in operating the partnership business after plaintiff withdrew from active participation. Generally speaking, a partner is not entitled to compensation for services in performing partnership matters or in winding up its affairs. A right to compensation arises only where the services rendered extend beyond normal partnership functions: <em>Bracht v. Connell, </em><a href="/pa/313/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="313 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="1152689" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0397-01">313 Pa. 397</a>, 404, <a href="/citations/?q=170%20A.%20297" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="170 A. 297">170 A. 297</a>, 300; <em>Herman v. Pepper, </em><a href="/pa/317/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="317 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="8845855" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0349-01">317 Pa. 349</a>, 352, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.%20201" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="176 A. 201">176 A. 201</a>, 202. The facts of this case quite clearly demonstrate that the services in question were only those necessary to the successful operation of an existing partnership, and therefore no compensation for the performance of such services could properly be claimed.</p>
