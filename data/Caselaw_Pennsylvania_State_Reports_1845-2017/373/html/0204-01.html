Cowperthwait, administrator of the estate of his deceased son, Douglas Cowperthwait, brought an action of trespass in Lackawanna County against Frederick T. Lamb, arising out of a fatal automobile accident occurring in Susquehanna County. Both plaintiff and defendant were residents of the latter county. The complaint in the action was served upon the defendant Lamb in Lackawanna County as he was leaving a hearing in the Lackawanna County Court House at Scranton, held before a representative of the Secretary of Revenue of the Commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of Section 192(b) 4 of The Vehicle Code, Act of May 1,1929, P. L. 905, as amended, 75 PS §192. The defendant had been notified of the hearing which involved the suspension of his motor vehicle operator’s license, and had entered Lackawanna County for the purpose of attending such hearing. The defendant filed preliminary objections in the nature <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>of a motion to strike off the service of the complaint which the court overruled, and this appeal followed.</p>

In reaching this determination the lower court principally relied on the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Cronin, </em><a href="/pa/336/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="336 Pa. 469" data-case-ids="1195659" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0469-01">336 Pa. 469</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.2d%20408" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="9 A.2d 408">9 A. 2d 408</a>, where it was stated at p. 473: “. . .

This language refers to the <em>act </em>of suspension. The power to suspend is vested in the Secretary of Revenue as an administrative officer and suspension is an administrative act.

A distinction must be made between the origin of the power and the incidents to its proper exercise. This is recognized in <em>Commonwealth v.

Since it has been repeatedly determined that the reason for the immunity of witnesses in private litigation is that public policy requires that those able to shed light on the questions for determination should not be deterred from attending, it follows as an a fortiori matter that in such hearings as those of this commission, in which, not only a large number of individuals, but the state itself, is vitally interested, the same reasons would apply to an even greater degree.”.</p>
