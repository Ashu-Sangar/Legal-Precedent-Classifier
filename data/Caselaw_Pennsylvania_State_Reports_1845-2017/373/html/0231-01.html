In pursuance of that object Congress, in the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of October 6, 1949, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20Stat.%20716" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="63 Stat. 716">63 Stat. 716</a>, authorized the President to furnish military assistance, as therein provided, to the Republic of Korea and the Republic of the Philippines. On June 25, 1950, a commission having reported that North Korean forces had made an unprovoked assault upon the Republic of Korea, the Security Council denounced the attack as a breach of international peace, called upon the authorities of North Korea to withdraw their armed forces forthwith, and asked all members of the United Nations to render every as<a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>sistance in the execution of the resolution. On June 27, 1950, the President made a public statement in which he referred to this call by the Security Council and stated that under such circumstances he had ordered United States air and sea forces to give the Korean government troops cover and support. On that same day the Security Council by a second resolution recommended that the members of the United Nations furnish whatever assistance to the Republic of Korea might be necessary in order to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area. On July 7, 1950, still another resolution of the Security Council recommended that all members provide military forces and other assistance for a unified command under the United States, requested the United States to designate the commander of such forces, and authorized the use of the United Nations’ flag in the action against the North Korean invaders.</p>

Since, therefore, it is Congress that has the power under the Constitution to declare war, and since that power is exclusive <em>(Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, </em><a href="/us/343/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="343 U.S. 579" data-case-ids="11341177" data-case-paths="/us/343/0579-01">343 U. S. 579</a>, 642), it is clear that the action, being waged in Korea is not a “war” within what may be termed the “constitutional” or “legal” sense of that term. Defendant urges, however, that it is in <em>fact </em>a war, because what started apparently as a minor “police <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>action” has developed, by reason of its duration, its bitterness, and the number of its casualties, into a sanguinary struggle of grave proportions, and urges further that the connotation of the word “war” in the Company’s insurance policies should not be limited to a formally declared war, but embraces any clash of arms in which the methods of war are pursued, and especially where the conflict is, as in Korea, of such extensive dimensions. The trouble with this argument is that if the word “war” in such policies were to be interpreted as other than one declared by Congress, courts would be utterly at sea whenever the question arose as to whether certain expeditions in which United States forces were engaged constituted a war. It has been pointed out in a report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives that during the period between 1798 and 1945 there were some 150 or more occasions on which our military forces were engaged in various countries, notably in China, Mexico, Central America and Caribbean Republics, in the course of some of which incidents there were really serious engagements and many casualties. Who, then, would be the tribunal to decide whether such an undeclared Conflict did or did not amount to a “war,” —a jury, a court? What would be the criterion of decision, — the number of troops involved, the number of casualties, the duration of the hostilities? If, for example, Beley had lost his life' in action in Korea a day or two after our troops first arrived there, would a war have then existéd, or would it not have become a war until the magnitude Of the'struggle finally revealed itself and'- the casualty-lists'became so distressingly long and frequent?</p>

Even were it to be conceded that the meaning of any of its terms was really involved in doubt, that doubt, according to all established canons of construction, should be resolved in favor of the insured. A policy of life insurance is a highly technical instrument, drawn up presumably with meticulous care by legal experts on behalf of the Insurance Company, and who not only intend to use all terms in their legal sense but know how to accomplish that result; it may be assumed, therefore, that if defendant had here meant to invest the term “war” with a broader connotation than its “constitutional” or “legal” intendment, it would have effected this by the addition of words indicating such an intention as, for example, “declared or undeclared” war.</p>

Courts know that in Korea, armies are pitted against each other utilizing <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>every device known to modern warfare in the effort and determination to exterminate each other. We know this to be true because every medium of communication extant informs us that it is true. There is not one voice, one printed word, or one picture in the newspapers, radio broadcasts and television images which present themselves before our eyes or appeal to our ears that bespeaks anything to the contrary.

There, the New York Life Insurance Company, on December 1, 1943, issued a policy of insurance on the life of Lewis Durham conditioned that the amount payable should be restricted if the death of insured should occur “ ‘outside the home areas while the insured is in the military or naval forces of any country engaged in war . . . “war” includes undeclared war.’ ” On September 25, 1945, while the policy was in full force and effect, and the insured was in the military forces of the United States, he died outside the home areas from wholly non-military causes. The Insurance Company denied liability for the face amount <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>of the policy, contending that the death of the insured came within the excluding provisions of the policy. The lower court entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the full face value of the policy and the Circuit Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit, on March 4, 1948, affirmed the judgment, on the basis that as the death of the insured occurred after the surrender of the enemy, even though no treaty of peace had been signed, the insured “was not in the service of a ‘country engaged in war’, as those words were used to measure coverage in the insurance contract.”</p>

The likelihood of death occurring and the consequent increase in the risk assumed by the insurer if an insured voluntarily or involuntarily engages in military service in time of war, is manifest. The exclusion or termination of liability of the insurer in such event is therefore founded upon good reason, readily understandable by both parties to the insurance contract. The greater likelihood of an insured’s death when engaged in military service in time of war exists whether the war is a declared or “constitutional” war, or an undeclared war. The reason for the exclusion applies equally in either instance. The word “war” used without limitation or restriction, in my opinion should be construed as the word would ordinarily be used and understood and calls for no technical construction. Certainly a major conflict between the armed forces of two nations under authority of their respective governments would be commonly regarded as war. I think that the present conflict in Korea is a war within the meaning of the exclusionary provisions of the policy, and therefore dissent from the view of the majority.</p>
