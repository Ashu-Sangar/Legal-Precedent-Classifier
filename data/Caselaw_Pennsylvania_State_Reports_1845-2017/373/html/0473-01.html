Do these words, appearing-on the carbon copy, apply to Mrs. Kehr’s original will? The facts and circumstances in this case are obviously very unusual. Mrs. Kehr could not obtain from her attorney her original will so that she might revoke or cancel or destroy it. She therefore did a natural and plausible thing for any laywoman to do under the circumstances— she wrote “Null and Void” on the carbon copy, thereby intending and declaring her will to be null and void. It must be recalled that she had only one will, viz., that of August 7, 1942; and when she wrote the words “Null and Void” on the exact copy of her original will it could refer to no other instrument than her original will. It would have been useless to write the words “Null and Void” on the copy if all Mrs. Kehr was referring to and declaring null and void was the copy, since the copy was unexecuted and had no validity or life. It would therefore be unreasonable to construe the revocation as applying to the carbon copy as distinguished from the original will, since the carbon copy, we repeat, never had any validity or life. This interpretation of the testatrix’s intent is corroborated and confirmed by the facts in the case, viz., (1) she could not obtain her original will to revoke or cancel it; and (2) she wrote her attorney stating (a) that her will was null and void and had been cancelled and (b) that she intended to make a new will; and (c) memoranda of a new -will were found in her handwriting among her personal effects.</p>

The inquiry is confined to the meaning of what the testator has said, and does not extend to the consideration of what he <em>might </em>have said but did not: <em>Nebinger’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/185/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="185 Pa. 399" data-case-ids="897978" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0399-01">185 Pa. 399</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.%201049" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="39 A. 1049">39 A. 1049</a>; <em>Conner’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/346/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="346 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="1216463" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0271-01">346 Pa. 271</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.2d%20514" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="29 A.2d 514">29 A. 2d 514</a>. Interpretation is never permitted to assume the proportions of reformation: <em>DeSilver’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/142/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="142 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="976762" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0074-01">142 Pa. 74</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20A.%20882" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="21 A. 882">21 A. 882</a>; <em>Jacob’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/343/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="343 Pa. 387" data-case-ids="1208307" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0387-01">343 Pa. 387</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20A.2d%20744" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="22 A.2d 744">22 A. 2d 744</a>. It is true in construing <em>ambiguous </em>language of a will we must put ourselves in testator’s “arm chair” in order to determine his intention but we are still required to declare the meaning of the <em>language used, </em>and not some other possible but undisclosed purpose: <em>Yate’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/281/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="281 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="1087058" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0178-01">281 Pa. 178</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.%20254" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="126 A. 254">126 A. 254</a>. If intent cannot be gathered from the writing itself, words cannot be supplied to disclose it: <em>McKeehan v. Wilson, </em><a href="/pa/53/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="53 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="1004686" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0074-01">53 Pa. 74</a>; <em>Rouse Estate, </em><a href="/pa/369/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="369 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="1232327" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0568-01">369 Pa. 568</a>, 573, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20281" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="87 A.2d 281">87 A. 2d 281</a>. The only words which Susanna Kehr used were “null and void.” The majority are obviously supplying words for testatrix when they determine <em>from extrinsic evidence </em>that she meant to say but did not: “I hereby declare that my last will and testament of which this is a copy is null and void.”</p>
