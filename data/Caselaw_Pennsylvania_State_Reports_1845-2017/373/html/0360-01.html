Charlotte appointed a portion of the corpus for the use of her husband, Joseph, Sr. and gave him a testamentary power of appointment. The fund amounted to $38,058.63. JOSEPH S.

(Although not presently involved, it is to be noted that from this portion of Joseph, Sr.’s residuary trust estate there was first to be set aside an amount equal in value to the share which each of Joseph, Sr.’s two eldest sons received from their paternal grandfather, Charles W.

The principle of presumed equality applies only when the language is lacking in clarity and its meaning is uncertain: <em>Davis’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/346/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="346 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="1216415" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0247-01">346 Pa. 247</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.2d%20700" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="29 A.2d 700">29 A. 2d 700</a>; <em>Friday’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/150/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="150 Pa.

Joseph, Sr. unquestionably did intend equality but <em>ONLY until the proviso became effective. </em>The proviso <em>revolted </em>the life estate of his wife Amelia and terminated the trusts as well as the powers of appointment.

Even though the claimed equalization had been intended but had been prevented because of the testator’s or a scrivener’s error of <em>omission, </em>such omission may not be supplied by the court: <em>Rouse Estate, </em><a href="/pa/369/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="369 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="1232327" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0568-01">369 Pa. 568</a>, 573, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20281" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="87 A.2d 281">87 A. 2d 281</a>.

We agree with the able and eloquent counsel for appellant that “The purpose of the proviso was to avoid a perpetuity.” We surmise, but do not decide (because this is not before us), that the proviso <em>was </em>motivated by such thought. This illuminates the likely reason for such proviso. The appointed estates were erected respectively in 1869, 1881, 1886 and 1897, the first eighty-three years, the last fifty-five years, and all the appointments of Joseph, Sr. twenty-one years ago. The time fixed by Joseph, Sr. for the ter<a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>ruination of the trusts was <em>twenty-one years after his death, </em>which occurred as stated on March 17, 1931. The rule against perpetuities (a rule of public policy against remoteness), is that executory interests must commence <em>“within the period of a life or lives in being and twenty-one years, allowing for the period of </em>gestationIn trusts <em>created by testator </em>the validity of the disposition is tested by <em>possible </em>events, but where created (as here) by a <em>donee of a testamentary power of appointment, </em>it is the <em>fact </em>and not the possibility which governs. Trusts created after January 1, 1948: Sec. 4 (b), Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 100, 20 PS 301.4. Remoteness, however, is <em>measured </em>from the creation of the power: <em>Warren’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/320/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="320 Pa. 112" data-case-ids="1163620" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0112-01">320 Pa. 112</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.%20396" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="182 A. 396">182 A. 396</a>, and <em>Harrah Estate, </em><a href="/pa/364/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="364 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="1223487" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0451-01">364 Pa. 451</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20A.2d%20587" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="72 A.2d 587">72 A. 2d 587</a>, and the host of cases therein cited. It is <em>probable </em>that Joseph, Sr. considered that the life estates and the unexecuted powers of appointment were valid, and would remain so during the period of twenty-one years from his decease. In this again he was probably correct, although we do not pass upon this question because it is not before us. A remainderman must take within the period specified in the rule against perpetuities. Joseph, Sr., doubtless considered the <em>possibility </em>that his sons or grandson, through inadvertence or design, <em>might </em>violate the rule in the exercise of their <em>powers of appointment, </em>and thus invalidate the trust in whole or part. In such event the fund would revert to the estates or next of kin of the <em>original </em>donors.</p>

He may exclude any one whom he wishes, except a surviving spouse. The reason for the exclusion need not be stated by testator and will not be passed upon by a court.

The will and all the codicils <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>were obviously drawn by a professional scrivener. Beyond all question, Joseph, Sr.’s intent is skilfully, accurately and ably expressed. Whether or not the <em>purpose </em>for the proviso was testator’s true intention is immaterial since the language employed, considered in connection with the entire will and all its codicils, is clear and unambiguous. As this Court has so repeatedly decided, in construing a will, the question is not what testator may have meant but the meaning of the language used. In <em>Farmers Trust Company v. Wilson, </em><a href="/pa/361/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="361 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="476445" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0043-01">361 Pa. 43</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20A.2d%2014" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="63 A.2d 14">63 A. 2d 14</a>, Mr. Justice Jones, speaking for the Court, said p. 46: “In Weidman’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Walker%20359" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="2 Walker 359">2 Walker 359</a>, 361, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20Leg.%20Int.%20338" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="42 Leg.

    <p id="b399-5" data-blocks='[["BL_399.6",399,[180,673,1147,810]]]'>The interpretation which this court places upon the testamentary writing here involved works to the obvious impairment of the appointment made by one of the testator’s three sons. If that is what the testator intended, it would of course be an end of the matter. But such is not the case. The rationale of the construction adopted by the learned court below, and now approved by this court, rests upon what I take to be a patent misconception of the purpose and import of the proviso in Item Two of the testator’s Seventh Codicil with respect to the distribution of the one-half of the “appointed estates” after the expiration of twenty-one years from the testator’s death during which period the income from such portion was payable to the testator’s widow.</p>
    <p id="b399-6" data-blocks='[["BL_399.7",399,[181,1504,1146,817]],["BL_400.1",400,[260,350,1154,534]]]'>The scheme of the Seventh Codicil (which is all that this ease is concerned with) was to make an identical disposition of the testator’s own residuary estate (in Item One) and the estates over which he had powers of appointment (in Item Two), Thus, in Item Two, he devised and bequeathed to his trustees the estates over which he had powers of appointment “upon the trusts and for the purposes and in the manner set forth in Item One of this codicil with respect to my residuary estate . . . .” To that, he appended a proviso that the trust of the portion of the “appointed estates” under Item Two for the benefit of the widow was to terminate <em>not </em>with her death, as in the case of the similar trust for his wife’s life under Item One, but <em>twenty-one years </em>from the death of the testator. This <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>arbitrary time limit was undoubtedly injected because of an apprehension on the part of the testator that he might otherwise violate the rule against perpetuities. Out of the wording of that cautionary provision, the majority deduces the construction which gives to the appointee of- the testator’s son, Samuel, a lesser proportion of the “appointed estates” dealt with in Item Two than the same appointee receives from the testator’s residuary estate comprising the trusts under Item One.</p>
    <p id="b400-5" data-blocks='[["BL_400.4",400,[258,905,1153,1148]]]'>Not only does the majority’s interpretation of Item Two thus ignore the evident scheme of Item One and Item Two of the Seventh Codicil but it also produces an inequality adverse to Samuel in respect of his exercise of the power of appointment conferred by the testator upon Samuel and his brothers alike. Such an intent is manifestly foreign to what the testator’s will and various of his many codicils plainly evidence. Throughout, equality of interest among his sons or their representatives was the testator’s guiding beacon. See, for example, the Fourth Codicil of April 9, 1929, where, after giving Samuel $10,000 absolutely, he explained that “in order that the shares of all my said sons shall be <em>equalized </em>I make this provision for my said son, S[amuel] Brinton Wharton” (Emphasis supplied) <em>; </em>or paragraph two of Item One of the Seventh Codicil where the testator, out of his own residuary estate, <em>equalized </em>Samuel for bequests which Samuel’s brothers had received under the will of their grandfather, Charles W. Wharton, Samuel apparently not having been in being when that will was executed.</p>
    <p id="b400-6" data-blocks='[["BL_400.5",400,[258,2066,1152,264]],["BL_401.1",401,[195,351,1147,1485]]]'>The result produced by the majority’s interpretation is, moreover, attended by glaring' incongruities which are allowed to arise because of no more than the fortuity of Samuel’s relatively early death. He was a minor in 1925, as his father’s will of March 11th of <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>that year indicates, but was evidently of age when the Fourth Codicil was executed in 1929. Samuel died testate December 13, 1943. By his will, he devised and bequeathed to his wife, Katherine C. Wharton, absolutely, his entire estate <em>including that over which he had power of appointment. </em>The twenty-one years following the death of the testator, Joseph Lovering Wharton, expired on March 17, 1952, with his widow, Amelia, still surviving. Had Amelia died prior to Samuel or had Samuel survived the twenty-one year period following his father’s death, it is beyond dispute that Samuel’s exercise of his power of appointment under his father’s Seventh Codicil would have effectively transmitted to his widow, Katherine, his one-third of the one-half allocation of the “appointed estates” from which Joseph’s widow, Amelia, received the income for twenty-one years following his death but no longer. Or, suppose that Samuel, having died when he did, had left to survive him a child or children to whom he had appointed under the power conferred upon him by his father’s will, such children would not have taken what represented Samuel’s interest in the one-half of the “appointed estates” whereof the widow Amelia had the benefit for the twenty-one year period. Neither the codicil here involved nor any other of Joseph Lovering Wharton’s testamentary writings requires an interpretation fraught with such anomalous possibilities.</p>
    <p id="b401-5" data-blocks='[["BL_401.4",401,[195,1849,1146,487]],["BL_402.1",402,[245,351,1155,1527]]]'>The thing whereon the construction, which the majority approves, is based is the clause in the proviso in Item Two which states that, upon the termination of the trust for Amelia after twenty-one years from the testator’s death, the principal was to be distributed and paid over to the persons “who would then be entitled to receive the income from said trusts if my said wife were then deceased . . . .” The purpose of this provision, as evidenced by the testator’s indicated fear <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>lest lie violate the rule against perpetuities in disposing of the appointed estates, was to vest effectually and unequivocally, in possession, the corpus of the trust for Amelia under Item Two upon the expiration- of the twenty-one year period folloiving the testator’s death. However, the disposition of the corpus of Amelia’s trust in the “appointed estates’? was actually provided for in Item Two where the testator unqualifiedly subjected such corpus to the same provisions of ultimate disposition as were contained in Item One with respect to his residuary estate. The clause in the proviso upon which the majority rely is by no means so clear or unambiguous as to be capable of cutting down the absolute grants antecedently devised and bequeathed in Item Two: <em>see Harris Estate, </em><a href="/pa/351/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="351 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="462747" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0368-01">351 Pa. 368</a>, 377, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20715" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="41 A.2d 715">41 A. 2d 715</a>; and <em>Cross v. Miller, </em><a href="/pa/290/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="290 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="1104407" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0213-01">290 Pa. 213</a>, 216, <a href="/citations/?q=138%20A.%20822" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="138 A. 822">138 A. 822</a>. In short, the proviso.was not intended to, nor does it, constitute a limitation upon the interests or powers of the testator’s sons. It was correlated to a supposititious basis, namely, the widow then being dead, but that was without reference to any of the sons also being dead. Nowhere in the proviso is there expressed or even suggested any contingency predicated of a son’s surviving either Amelia or the twenty-one year period following her husband’s death. Admittedly, no such contingency exists with respect to the ultimate disposition of the trust fund for Amelia under Item One.</p>
    <p id="b402-5" data-blocks='[["BL_402.4",402,[248,1901,1153,430]],["BL_403.1",403,[194,343,1149,1708]]]'>Nor is it to be overlooked that, while the clause in question contemplates distribution of the principal to those entitled to receive the income, such persons were to receive the principal (the trust being terminated by Amelia’s assumed death) “ <em>in the same proportions in lohich the income would be received by them in such case” </em>(Emphasis supplied). It is plain enough, under the scheme of the testator’s Seventh Codicil, ■ that <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>Charles would be . entitled to but one-third of the income from the trust (lately for Amelia) and that Joseph, Jr., and his son Joseph, 3rd, would, likewise, be entitled aggregately to but one-third of the income of the trust property in question. Who then should receive or be entitled to receive the income from what had been Samuel’s interest in the trusts of the appointed estates? None other than his widow, Katherine, by virtue of his testamentary appointment to her. Her receipt of the principal carried with it the right to the income therefrom. The case of <em>Jacobs’ Estate, </em><a href="/pa/343/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="343 Pa. 387" data-case-ids="1208307" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0387-01">343 Pa. 387</a>, 391-392, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20A.2d%20744" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="22 A.2d 744">22 A. 2d 744</a>, upon which the learned auditing judge relied, is not presently pertinent. It was there held that bequests of surplus income did not in the testamentary circumstances present constitute a gift of principal. But, here, the situation is precisely the converse. It is too well settled for further argument that a gift of principal automatically carries with it a right to the income which the principal produces. The persons entitled, therefore, to the income from the “appointed estates” upon the termination of the trust for the testator’s widow, Amelia, were Charles, Joseph, Jr., and Joseph, 3rd, and Katherine who, by virtue of Samuel’s will, received outright his income-producing interest in the trust of the “appointed estates”. The proviso cannot justly be read otherwise or properly be accorded any greater effect. There is no basis whatsoever' for concluding, as does the majority, that the testator’s two sons, surviving Amelia, would each be entitled to one-half of the- income from the trust for her in the appointed estates.</p>

Further answer lies in the fact that, as already pointed out, had Samuel survived Amelia or even the twenty-one year period following his father’s death, there could be no question that his wife, Katherine (not of the blood), would be entitled to one-third of the one-half of the “appointed estates” lately in trust for Amelia. Finally, why would Joseph Lovering Wharton so restrict Samuel’s ultimate disposition by will of the one-third of the one-half of the “appointed estates” in trust for Amelia when he made no such restriction with respect to the one-third of the one-half of his residuary estate in trust for Amelia for life?</p>
