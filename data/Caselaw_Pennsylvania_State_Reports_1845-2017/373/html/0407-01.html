The road was dry and traffic moderate. Such speed was a violation of The Vehicle Code. Defendant did not deny the violation, and the only reason given by him for such violation was, “I was late for an appointment.” He was twenty years of age, unmarried, and living home with his father and mother. He had been driving for four years; had been fined several times for “going through a stop sign”; and had been involved in an accident, although no charge was made against him. The order of suspension was rescinded solely on the ground of economic hardship. In the order the court said: “. . . it appearing to the Court that the petitioner’s violation did not endanger the life or property of any person; and it further appearing to the Court that the petitioner would be unable to continue in his employment without a driver’s license which would result in a great and undue hardship not justified by the facts of this case, the prayer -of said petition is granted, and the Order of the Secretary of Revenue suspending the li<a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>cense of Charles Cornetti, Jr. is hereby set aside and full driving privileges are hereby restored to the said Charles Cornetti, Jr.”</p>
