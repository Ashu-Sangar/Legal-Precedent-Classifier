    <p id="b542-10" data-blocks='[["BL_542.14",542,[251,1167,1153,657]]]'>The plaintiff was engaged in the business of dealing in insecticides, disinfectants, cleaners, polishers, and equipment used in connection therewith, sanitation services and matters incidental thereto. The defend: ánt was employed under a written contract as salesman, maintenance technician and service supervisor, devoting his entire time to the business of the employer until June 30, 1952, when he gave 30 days’ notice of his intention to terminate the agreement in accordance with paragraph (1) thereof. The contract had specified the area for his operations, which was extended to additional areas by riders.</p>

The opinion was by the then Judge Knappen. - At page'704 appears-the following: “It is true that the covenant in question contains no ■ specific limitation as to the <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>territory over which the restraint shall operate. It may be conceded, for the purposes of this opinion, that a covenant by appellant not to engage in business anywhere throughout the world would be unreasonable and unenforceable. . . The bill alleges that the business of the firm, at the time of the purchase of appellant’s interest, extended throughout the United States; that the stipulation in question was intended to prevent competition throughout that territory; and the prayer is that the restraint extend throughout the United States. . . The covenant in question does not in express terms extend the restraint throughout the world. It is only by inference, drawn from the lack of specific definition, that a construction can be adopted that restraint throughout the entire world was intended and attempted. Taking into account the circumstances of the case, the nature and extent of the business, and the situation, objects, and interests of the parties, we are satisfied that the restraint was intended to apply to the entire United States, but not to other parts of the world. Being so satisfied, we have no difficulty in construing the covenant accordingly. Such construction is not only permitted by the general rules for the construction of contracts, but has been specifically applied under facts similar to those existing here.” See Williston on Contracts, Revised Edition, §1639, which gives the rule that unlimited space does not necessarily involve the invalidity of a promise, and unless the restriction be greater than is needed for the • protection of the promisee, the promise- is -valid, -And “where there is no express limitation in space, • the courts will endeavor to interpret-the ..contract-as-providing for a i*easonable limitation .'-in ..view -. of - the attendant-. circumstances-. ”• (Citing -eases') {■ The. court below determined, that; the. stipulation,-.-even; though ;unlimited- in-spacej should receiye .a; reasonable -construction, The- court <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>limited its preliminary injunction to the territory provided in the original contract and the riders thereto.</p>
