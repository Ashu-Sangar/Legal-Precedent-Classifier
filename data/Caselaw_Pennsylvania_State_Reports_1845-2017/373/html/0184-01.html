The trailer which <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>was 5 feet wide and over 10 feet high, had been stopped for about 5 or 10 minutes under a dim are light on the south side • of Lincoln Highway. Lincoln Highway is a four-lane highway, which is perfectly straight for a distance of at least 100 feet, from the direction in which decedent was approaching, to the scene of the accident. There was no eye witness of the accident; and no evidence whether the lights on the truck were lit at the time of the accident, although one witness did not see any lights burning on the back of the trailer. The night was clear and there was no obstacle to obstruct the decedent’s vision before he hit the truck; and no automobiles which might have blinded decedent were approaching from the opposite direction.</p>

While there is a presumption that a deceased driver exercised due care, it is a rebuttable presumption of fact, and the facts in this case unquestionably overcome the presumption. Even if the decedent had been driving 50 miles an hour he undoubtedly could have stopped his automobile in sufficient time to avoid running into the trailer if he had been paying proper attention to the road, or he could have pulled a few feet to his left and easily avoided the collision on the straight four-lane highway.</p>

It was dark enough for lights. Plaintiff’s automobile, when it was being driven about 20 to 25 miles an hour, ran into the rear of the parked trailer. The Court’s opinion is particularly appropriate (page 403-404): “There was nothing to prevent him from seeing and avoiding the huge trailer . . . the lights upon his car, would have shown Mm, if he had been looking, the trailer on the road before him, and if he had his car under control, as was his duty, he would have driven into the next traffic lane and passed the trailer without any difficulty.</p>

Fullerton T. Co., [<a href="/pa/318/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="318 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1159656" data-case-paths="/pa/318/0541-01">318 Pa. 541</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=179%20A.%2084" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="179 A. 84">179 A. 84</a>].’ The evidence in the instant case, when viewed in the light most advantageous to plaintiff, clearly establishes the contributory negligence of Father Zywicki and it is necessary for us to so declare it as a matter of law.”</p>

Fullerton Trucking Co., </em>318 Pa., supra, the Court aptly disposes of the contentions made by plaintiff in the instant case (page 544) : “This implies that the driver will always be carefully watching so much of the road as is included within that <em>‘assured clear distance ahead,’ </em>and will always keep his car so un<a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>der control that he can stop it within that distance. What this will be, of course, will vary according to the visibility at the time and other attending circumstances, but, after taking those circumstances into consideration, the requirement is fixed and unchangeable. There is no excuse for a failure to obey the statutory requirement unless the obstacle in front is for the first time in the driver’s view, after the car has passed the point where the ‘assured clear distance ahead,’ quoad that point, has been reached and passed, and the obstacle is then too close to be avoided. This can never be where, as here, the dangerous object is standing still before the outer limit of the ‘assured clear distance ahead’ has been reached, and continues in that one position. It is no answer to say, as appellant seems to attempt here, that decedent had no reason to expect a stalling on the highway of the automobiles into which he crashed. The statute was passed to protect life and limb; decedent was bound to guard, to the extent stated, against that and every other possibility, and the statute must be construed and applied to further that purpose. It may be conceded that ordinarily decedent’s death would raise a presumption that he had taken all necessary precautions for his own safety, but this presumption has no existence as against the certainty that if he had done so here he would not then have died: Tull v. B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/292/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="292 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="1109635" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0458-01">292 Pa. 458</a>, 461.”</p>
