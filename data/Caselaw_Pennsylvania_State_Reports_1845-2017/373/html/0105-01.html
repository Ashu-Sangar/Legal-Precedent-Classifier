No plan of rehabilitation was attached to the petition or offered at the trial and the Court below doubted that an acceptable plan could, under all the conditions here present, be devised. Judge Neely, after lengthy hearings, found in a very able and painstaking opinion of 97 pages: (1) that the decree of dissolution of <em>June 26, 1947 </em>was validly entered; (2) that the Commonwealth and the intervenors who supported the petition to vacate the decree of 1947 had the burden of proving that the decree was entered under a mistake of fact or law; and (8) that the petitioners failed to sustain their burden of proof. The “Policyholders’ Committee” took an appeal from the decree of the Court below which dismissed the Commonwealth’s petition to vacate, but the Commonwealth, which was the original petitioner, refused to take an appeal or to join in this appeal. The Insurance Commissioner in his answer to a petition for supersedeas, doubts whether a rehabilitation of the company could now be consummated even if the company were solvent, and avers that “he believes that compliance with [the] admonitions [of the Court below] is in the best interest of the public and of the company, its creditors and policyholders and will not adversely affect the interest of any of them and that further delay would be subversive of the interest of the public, policyholders, creditors and claimants.” Briefs were filed in support of the appellant by the “Perks Committee”; and in opposition to the appellant’s position by the “Goldstein Committee” and by the “ITitke Committee”.</p>

As of December 31, 1946, the company was writing 19 different classes of casualty insurance and had approximately 1000 agents who were operating in 26 states in which the company was authorized to do business. From this business it derived net premiums in 1946 in excess of 7% million dollars. In its annual statement filed with the Insurance Department of the Commonwealth, as well as with the Insurance Department of other states, the company reported a surplus as of December 31, 1946, of $1,439,066.36. This report aroused the suspicions of the officers of the Insurance Department of Maryland and of the Insurance Director of the State of Kentucky, who called certain items in the report and certain practices of the company which they considered unsound and improper to the special attention of the Insurance Commissioner of Pennsylvania. In May of 1947, the Insurance Commissioner directed that a special examination should be made of the Keystone Mutual Casualty Company, which was joined in by examiners representing the Insurance' Commissioner of Kentucky and of Maryland. Shortly after-the examination Was begun, N. P. Kann, Secretary, Director,-Chairman :-of the-Finance Committee, and the active Manager of-the company, and A. J. O’Leary, Vice President,. Director'and Comptroller of the company, came with the company’s attorney to the <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>office of the Insurance Commissioner in Harrisburg to discuss the company’s affairs. During the course of this conference with the Insurance Commissioner <em>both Kann and O’Leary admitted that the company was insolvent. </em>They also admitted that the annual statement of December 31, 1946, deliberately concealed the extent of the company’s liabilities; thus enabling the company to show a surplus. Kann requested the Insurance Commissioner to discontinue the examination and to permit the company to operate for the balance of the year in the hope that the company could “run off” the bad debts on its books before the regular examination which would be held on or about January 1, 1948. The Insurance Commissioner refused to discontinue the examination and insisted that additional funds must immediately be raised, otherwise the company would be taken over by the Insurance Department. He also notified the District Attorney of Allegheny County of the criminal acts of Messrs. Kann and O’Leary. The officers and directors were unable to borrow additional funds to bring the reserves up to the legal requirements and to rehabilitate the company. Kann and O’Leary were convicted in Allegheny County on a criminal charge arising out of the falsification of the company’s books. On June 1, 1947, the Insurance Commissioner of Maryland ordered the company to cease doing business in that state. Upon being informed of this action, the then Insurance Commissioner of Pennsylvania, Mr. James F. Malone, Jr., on June 2, 1947, prohibited the writing of any new business.</p>

The Court below found that the examiners’ report showing as of June, 1947, an additional reserve for liability and compensation losses in the amount of $1,511,255.93, was inaccurate and undependable, for. the reason in substance that it was based upon a case-by-case examination of only 175 claims out of several thousand claims and some erroneous computations therefrom. The claims records of the company in the remaining claims were so inadequate and contained such meager information that an accurate case-by-case determination was impossible and consequently the examiners determined the balance of necessary reserves on a percentage method derived from the percentage of undervaluation found in the aforesaid 175 claims. The Court below found that this item in the report was necessarily inaccurate and that some of the computations were erroneous, without determining whether the “reserves for liability” was higher or lower than that found by the examiners, or what it actually amounted to, or what the actual deficit of the company was. Such a mistake was not conclusive proof on the important issue of solvency; it is not sufficient proof that the financial condition of the company was not what it was represented to be and what its officers and directors admitted it to be merely because some part of the examiners’ report was inaccurate. Moreover, the Court specifically found that the company in June 1947 was in an unsound financial condition and <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>the transaction of further business would have been hazardous to policyholders, creditors and public alike.</p>
