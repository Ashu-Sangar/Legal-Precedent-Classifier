On March 7, 1951, a well preserved head, which had been severed from the body at the neck, and a part of the pelvis of a female Avere found encased in concrete buried in a wash tub in the cellar of the Homeyer home.

Although he alleges she had no friends, she became angry, according to him, because no one called on her to wish her a happy birthday. Consequently defendant went to a store and purchased a cake and whipping cream for the purpose of making her a birthday cake. When he went back to her bedroom he found her dead. She had been sickly for five years and had had high blood pressure. On the floor in her bedroom defendant said he found a sleeping pill and an empty bottle which he had received from Doctor Patrick the day before and which had contained 20 Napentals. He said the bottle was open and only one capsule remained. Eighteen capsules would be a fatal dosage to a person in the physical condition of Anna 'Homeyer. ' Upon discovering the body defendant alleged that he was <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>seized -with, panic; fearing lie would be held responsible for Ms wife’s death, he decided to dispose of her remains. According to his story he carried the body to the bathroom and dismembered it; then he burned certain portions of her body in the furnace of their home on the night of March 29th and the night of March 30th. He said the odor from the burning body was so terrible it made him sick and he had to drive around the country for several hours. Neighbors testified that they smelled the odor and the nearer they got to the Homeyer house the stronger the stench became. Defendant then buried his wife’s head and the portion of the pelvis in cement in the cellar of the residence. Defendant put her stomach and some of her intestines in a package and part of the torso, legs and arms in another package and threw one into the Susquehanna River at Owego on March 29th, and the other package into the Delaware River at Delaware Water Gap on the 30th. He then left town on <em>March 31st </em>and went to Florida and then to California.</p>
    <p id="b181-3" data-blocks='[["BL_181.4",181,[170,1450,1148,654]]]'>Defendant, like most defendants, proceeds on the assumption that you must believe all of his statements or confessions; of course, that is erroneous; a jury can believe all or a part of or none of a defendant’s statements, confessions or testimony. The theory of the defense is that Anna committed suicide, and the dismemberment of her body after she was dead does not constitute a crime. Defendant’s principal contention on this appeal is that, apart from his own statements or confessions, there was no proof of the corpus delicti and consequently an acquittal should have been directed, or a new trial must be granted.</p>

Homeyer and Anna Homeyer, his wife. She opened a savings account at an undisclosed date in her own name in the First National Bank of Factoryville. Between the time of the opening of this account and the date of her death defendant withdrew $4400 from the savings account hy forging his wife’s name on 12 withdrawal slips. On March 29, 1950, he withdrew an additional $500 by means of a withdrawal slip purporting to have been signed by his wife. The Commonwealth also proved that in June 1950 defendant had in his possession saws, knives and a meat cleaver which are useful tools for beheading and dismembering a body.</p>
    <p id="b182-4" data-blocks='[["BL_182.4",182,[264,1120,1154,930]]]'>In the Fall of 1949 defendant began corresponding with a woman named Nancy Parker through a “Lonely Hearts” magazine. In his letters he told her he was a widower, said he had a house, a diamond ring and an engagement ring which he offered her and suggested marriage. In March, 1950 he wrote her and secured her telephone number at a near-by drug store. On March 29 he telephoned her, arranging to meet her at New Castle, Pa., on March 31. He took her to California under promise of marriage; what happened thereafter is not clear. On the way to California and after he got there he wrote many cards and letters to Anna’s friends and neighbors telling them Anna was with him, was happy and never felt better in her life, loved California and planned to sell her Factoryville home and live in California. He told Nancy Parker that his wife had died the year before.</p>

    <p id="b183-3" data-blocks='[["BL_183.4",183,[164,624,1147,875]]]'>Defendant on his return to Factoryville did some cementing inside his house, sold the household furniture, burned Anna’s clothing; sold meat saws and gave away butcher knives. He likewise sold the house for approximately $5700; forged his wife’s name to the deed and had a notary public acknowledge it even though his wife was not present. He again sent letters and cards to Anna’s friends saying how much she was enjoying California. He then returned to California with another woman, Maggie Woodal, whom he first contacted in July 1950, and married in September 1950. He told Maggie that his wife had died in bed five years before of kidney trouble. After that, he wrote an acquaintance of Anna’s in New York that Mrs. Homeyer had passed away in her sleep the morning of September 3 and there had been no illness</p>

On January 24, 1951, he was located in Los Angeles by a deputy sheriff who asked him the present whereabouts of his wife, Anna. He told the sheriff that Anna died March 7, 1950, in Bronx, New York, from high blood pressure and was buried March 11, 1950, in St. John’s Cemetery and that she had no life insurance. Defendant left Los Angeles immediately after this statement, but foolishly returned a week later and was arrested, charged with forgery. While being brought back from California by detectives, defendant attempted suicide on the train. It is unnecessary to narrate any more of defendant’s many fabrications, lies and conflicting statements.</p>

There is no merit in this contention. Proof of a head severed from the body and encased in concrete in the cellar of <em>defendant’s home </em>followed by proof of the identity of the head as that of Anna Homeyer was sufficient evidence, without anything more, of the corpus delicti. Apart from any confession by the defendant, it is obviously impossible for a woman to dismember her head and bury it in concrete in defendant’s cellar.</p>

The Commonwealth in such a case, in order to establish the corpus delicti, must prove (1) that the alleged victim is dead, and (2) that the death occurred as a result of a felonious act. The corpus delicti, like other facts, may be shown by circumstantial evidence; it is sufficient if these circumstances are consistent with crime even though they are also consistent with suicide or accident; if it were otherwise it would be impossible in many cases, where there were no eye witnesses, to convict a criminal. <em>Commonwealth v.

Human bones were found in the ashes of a building together with several articles belonging to his wife which were likewise burned and identified.

The language of the Court’s opinion (page 332) is equally applicable to the facts in the instant case. “We think there was sufficient in the case without the statements made by defendant to warrant his conviction. The proofs established that he was the last person seen with his wife, that partly burned bones shown to be those of a human being were found in the burned house in connection with articles of jewelry worn by her, and that in the cellar of their residence, which was occupied by no one except him, burned articles of wearing apparel belonging to her were discovered. These circumstances in themselves were sufficient to establish a criminal agency in causing her death. That he attempted to destroy what he must have deemed to be incriminating evidence against himself by burning it in the heater is a circumstance from which guilt may be inferred: 2 Wharton, Criminal Evidence, section 748, p. 1490 et seq.; Com. v.

The jury when polled returned a verdict of “guilty of murder in the first degree and the death penalty”; or “guilty of murder in the first degree and the penalty of death.” The jury thus returned a proper verdict and one which was in accord with the law. Unfortunately, the Clerk said “you say you find the prisoner at the Bar, Charles Homeyer, guilty of murder in the first degree and recommend the death penalty.” The verdict was recorded as the Clerk announced it and not as the jury rendered it.</p>

However, it would be a travesty on justice to hold, especially after such a horrible crime, that an error of a clerk could not be corrected, or that an erroneous entry or recording could not be cured. As the Court below wisely said: “A clear unquestionable verdict should not be prejudiced [or invalidated] by an improper recordation of it. Here there can never be any doubt as to the verdict of this jury.” The Court then corrected the Court Record of the verdict to read exactly as the jury found.
