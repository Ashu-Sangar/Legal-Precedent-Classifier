The <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>lease contained the following clause: “In the event that the premises demised. . . is taken or condemned for a public. . . use, this lease shall, as to the part so taken, terminate as of the date title shall vest in the condemnor. .</p>

Levines, or any transferee, lessee, or sublessee, shall have the right to terminate possession and vacate the premises and be relieved of all future obligations under the terms and conditions of this Agreement by giving notice to the United States thirty days in advance of such termination and vacation, and that in the event of such voluntary termination and vacation by Levines, or any person holding under them, the United States shall not be obligated or liable to make any payment for the unexpired period of occupancy and possession.” The plaintiffs thereupon took the $35,500.</p>

The defendant then vacated and removed from the premises on December 31, 1951; whereupon the plaintiffs confessed judgment for $15,550 plus interest, being the amount of the accelerated rent for the balance of the term. Even without the specific provision of the lease relating to the rights of the lessee in the event of condemnation, the condemnation of the land for public use effected a termination of the existing lease: <em>Dyer </em>

In addition thereto, the stipulation between the Federal Government and the Levines was not binding upon the defendant, Horwitz.</p>

But this was done after the defendant had served upon them and the United States notice of termination of the lease. It was also entered into without the knowledge, consent or approval of Horwitz, the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b309-6" data-blocks='[["BL_309.6",309,[197,1431,1146,595]]]'>It therefore appears: (1) that the defendant, acting under clause 22 of the lease, had a right to terminate the lease by reason of the condemnation; (2) that the defendant had a right to terminate the lease regardless of clause 22 of the agreement; (3) that under the original stipulations, if binding, between the United States of America and the Levines, the defendant had the right to terminate this lease; and (4) the supplemental stipulation was entered into without defendant’s knowledge or consent and after he had exercised his rights, and was not binding upon him.</p>
