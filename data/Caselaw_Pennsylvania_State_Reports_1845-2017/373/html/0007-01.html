The jury answered the questions (a) and (c) in the affirmative and (b) in the negative. The verdict sustained the will. Upon refusal of motion for judgment for contestant n.o.v. this appeal followed. Appellant does not seek the grant of a new trial. Therefore, we need not consider alleged trial errors.</p>

William J. Roberts, tbe decedent, died May 20, 1949, at the age of eighty-three. He was unmarried, without issue; his next of ldn were nephews and nieces and issue of a deceased niece. His estate is estimated in value to be over $300,000. The business was appraised at $39,933 and the real estate at $32,150, a total of $72,083. Decedent resided in the home of Ella Greenfield, the widow of a former business associate. Margaret Harrison (appellant), daughter of Mrs. Greenfield, lived next door. The business of decedent ivas conducted directly across the street from where he lived. William Hottenstein, the proponent, had been employed by decedent in the business since 1924, and after 1936 had become the manager of the business, in full charge and control of it. In January, 1941, decedent executed a will prepared in the office of Frank B. Rhodes who was apparently associated with his nephews, Walter L. Rhodes and William X. Rhodes. Under the terms of this will (i.e. 1941) there were bequeathed to named nephews and nieces and grandnephews and grandnieces legacies to the total amount of $29,000; $30,000 was bequeathed to Mrs. Greenfield and $3,000 to Margaret Harrison, daughter of Mrs. Greenfield (appellant). William Hottenstein, the appellee, was devised and bequeathed the business and the real estate on which the business was conducted. Walter L. Rhodes was named as executor. There was no disposition of the residue.</p>

Hottenstein thereafter called Walter Rhodes and took a copy of the letter to him; Mr. Walter Rhodes suggested that the matter be taken up with his office associate, William K. Rhodes, Esq. Mr. Rhodes, after going over the matter with Mr. Hottenstein, told him that in his opinion decedent apparently intended to execute another will, but had not yet done so, but that if anything unusual happened to let him know. Mr. Hottenstein testified that he thereafter “kept an eye” on decedent’s home. On <em>March 18, </em>Mrs. Harrison (contestant) called Mr. Hottenstein on the telephone at the place of business and asked him <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>to send decedent home.

If I or somebody else who ivas a stranger, who wouldn’t normally be around the yard, Avere present, Mrs. Harrison or Mrs. Greenfield Avould quite probably have seen us there, would have inquired of Mr. Roberts what had occurred, and would have learned that a new will had been signed.

      <em>Contestant </em>in the present contest over the will dated May 11, 1948, is a <em>proponent </em>in the probate of the previous will dated March 18, 1948, less than two months prior thereto. It is difficult to comprehend how the present claim of testamentary incapacity could logically be made. The earlier will was prepared by a highly reputable lawyer, from directions given him by decedent, and it was witnessed by decedent’s own physician and a bank president. There is not the slightest testimony of mental or physical deterioration during the intervening two months.</p>

It is alleged that Mr. Hottenstein occupied a confidential relation to decedent. But even if he did, there is no evidence of decedent’s <em>weakened intellect. </em>The burden was therefore on contestant to prove undue influence: <em>Ash Will, </em><a href="/pa/351/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="351 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="462704" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0317-01">351 Pa. 317</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20620" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="41 A.2d 620">41 A. 2d 620</a>; <em>Snedeker Estate, </em><a href="/pa/368/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="368 Pa. 607" data-case-ids="1230340" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0607-01">368 Pa. 607</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.2d%20568" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="84 A.2d 568">84 A. 2d 568</a>. We have repeatedly defined undue influence. In <em>Ash Will, </em>supra, we said, p. 322: “To constitute undue influence <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>sufficient to void a will, there must be imprisonment of the body or mind, fraud, or threats, or misrepresentations, or circumvention, or inordinate flattery, or physical or moral coercion, to such a degree as to prejudice the mind of the testator, to destroy his free agency and to operate as a present restraint upon him in the making of the will: (citing cases).” While contestant’s counsel regards the advice of Mr. Rhodes and the actions of Mr. Hottenstein in the above recited circumstances as “villainy”, we are not prepared to hold that it was either fraudulent or unethical. Decedent’s will of 1941 discloses that decedent <em>at that time </em>intended Mr. Hottenstein to inherit the business and its real estate. The scrivener’s letter forwarding the will of March 18, 1948, to decedent for execution, and which left Mr. Hottenstein only $10,000, queried: “The only other question involved was whether or not [decedent’s] bequest to Mr. Hottenstein was sufficient. It would be presumptuous for me to make any suggestion along this line. <em>I think you should review this and then let me hear from you.” </em>(emphasis supplied) Apparently decedent <em>did </em>review this question and decided to give Mr. Hottenstein the business and real estate as he had done by his will of 1941. Perhaps the methods and secrecy which Mr. Hottenstein and Mr. Rhodes employed might not ordinarily be regarded as commendable. Nevertheless, in the circumstances, neither Mr. Hottenstein nor Mr. Rhodes owed any duty of disclosure or loyalty to either contestant or her mother. The jury believed proponent’s testimony. The controverted issues are questions of fact which depend upon credibility of witnesses. The jury has resolved the questions in proponent’s favor, and the chancellor has approved its verdict. There appears no reason why such a verdict, so approved, should be set aside.</p>
