The pecuniary legacies and trusts established by the will totaled $49,550. The first and final account of the executors and the adjudication thereon showed a balance of principal of $46,065.22, which was composed mainly of unconverted securities. Since there was a deficiency of assets, it was stated in the adjudication that the pecuniary legacies must abate proportionately.</p>
    <p id="b314-5" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[263,1020,1153,873]]]'>The will established a trust of $30,000, the income from which was to be paid to the decedent’s son, Eugene S. Kneedler, for life, and upon his death the principal was to revert to the residuary estate. Certain real estate was also placed in trust for Eugene S. Kneedler for life, and upon his death it was to be sold and the proceeds added to the residuary estate. A trust of $15,000 was established for the decedent’s grandson, Robert K. Todd, one of the appellants. The terms of this trust were that the income was to be paid to Robert K. Todd until he reached the age of 30 years, at which time the trust was to terminate and the principal was to be paid over to him. A trust of $500 was also established for the decedent’s great-grandson, Eugene G-. Kist, the principal of which was to be paid over to him when he reached the age of 21 years.</p>

(Emphasis supplied). In the attached schedule of distribution appellants’ trust legacy was awarded to the trustees at its full value. The words of the agreement in reference to the trusts are: “. . . the several Trusts . . . shall be taken, from the Personal Property Principal at the aforesaid values, for the time being, and so remain to and until the values thereof shall, in the discretion of the Trustees . . . justify and warrant a sale or disposition thereof, and a reinvestment . . There is nothing in the agreement to indicate that the value of the unconverted securities was less than the appraised value in the inventory, which is the value referred to by “at the aforesaid values” in the agreement. The words “for the time being” as used in the agreement cannot be construed to mean that this was merely a temporary or partial distribution, but refer to the right of the trustees to retain the unconverted securities “for the time being”. The rest of the provision makes it clear that it looked <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>toward the sale of the securities by the trustees at a later time as the trustees in their discretion should determine.</p>
