The policy is not an insurance of the specific thing without regard to the ownership, but is a special agreement of indemnity with the person insuring against such loss or damage as he may sustain.

New Amsterdam Casualty Co., </em>335 Pa., supra, is on all fours with and decisive of the instant case. In that case, Wayne Watterson, on February 1, 1931, took out a personal liability insurance policy covering his Austin automobile. On April 3, 1931, Wayne Watterson died intestate, leaving as his only heir his father, C. H. Watterson, and his only possession the Austin car. On January 6, 1932, one Martz, while operating the Austin car, injured Antone. On January 11, 1932, the Department of Motor Vehicles transferred the title of the Austin car to C. H. Watterson and issued to him the registration plates for 1932. On October 23, 1933, Antone commenced an action in trespass against C. H. Watterson for the injuries he sustained in the accident of January 6, 1932. The Insurance Company entered an appearance and filed an affidavit of defense to Antone’s statement of claim in trespass and in the affidavit of defense averred that at the time of the accident C. H. Watterson was the owner of the Austin car. On May 1, 1934, the Insurance Company discovered the actual facts and disclaimed liability and withdrew its appearance. On January 10, 1935, Antone recovered a verdict and judgment against C. H. Watterson and issued attachment execution against the Insurance Company. Recovery was denied by this Court which held, inter alia, that insurance contracts cannot be created by estoppel or waiver. The Court said (p. 138): “At the time of the accident, January 6, 1932, C. H. Watterson had acquired no rights under the <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>policy covering this Austin touring car. He was then a total stranger to the insurance policy herein invoked. . . . Before a court can say that a company is estopped to deny that ‘it waived the condition of the policy,’ there must be a covering policy. But where there is no policy, there is no condition to be waived. . . . Here the doctrine of estoppel is being used, not to make a contract operative, but to create a contract where none existed. In McCoy v. Northwestern Mutual Relief Assn., <a href="/wis/92/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="92 Wis. 577" data-case-ids="8706698" data-case-paths="/wis/92/0577-01">92 Wis. 577</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20N.W.%20697" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="66 N.W. 697">66 N.W. 697</a>, 699, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin said: ‘What is insisted upon is not really the waiver of a forfeiture, or an equitable estoppel against insisting upon a condition of the policy, the violation of which would otherwise work a forfeiture. . . . What is here sought is not to prevent a forfeiture but to make a new contract. . . .”</p>
