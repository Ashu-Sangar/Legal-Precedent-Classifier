      <em>Shipley’s Estate (No. 2) </em>is analogous. In <em>Shipley’s Estate </em>testatrix provided for the payment of inheritance taxes out of her general estate. She then bequeathed 15 pecuniary legacies. Thereafter she divided her residuary estate, <em>including </em>her appointive estate, into three equal parts. Her individual or general estate was insufficient (after payment of inheritance taxes) to pay all pecuniary legacies and the legatees naturally claimed that there had been a blending and that they were entitled to be paid their legacies out of the blended estates. The Court rejected their contention and held that a general estate customarily meant “the entire estate held by a person in his individual capacity and did not include property over which he had a power of appointment.” The Court then held that the provision “all the rest, residue and remainder of my property and estate, <em>including </em>all property and estate over which I may have testamentary power of appointment” meant all her own property which she had not already disposed of, together with the property over which she had a power of appointment.</p>
