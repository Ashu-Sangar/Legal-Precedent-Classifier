What, then, are the factors marking the difference between proceedings to effect an “annexation” and proceedings to effect an “alteration of boundary lines”? They would seem to be, first, the amount of the territory involved in the change, and, second, the real objective to be accomplished. Ordinarily the desire to alter a boundary line arises because of some dispute in regard to it, or because it may be uncertain, or may happen to divide an owner’s land, or may so awkwardly meander in its course as to require straightening, the change in each of these cases involving but a comparatively negligible detachment of territory on the one side and its addition to the other side of the original boundary. Where, however, the avowed purpose to be accomplished is to detach from the one political subdivision a substantial portion of its territory and to annex it to the other, the reason for the change being based on some such <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>consideration as relative school facilities, questions of taxation and assessed valuations of property, social conveniences, or the like, the proceeding becomes obviously one of annexation and the alteration in the boundary line merely incidental to the accomplishment of the larger objective.</p>

Leading to this same conclusion is the fact that in the annexation statutes there are elaborate provisions for notice to the official authorities of the political subdivisions concerned — burgess, council, commissioners or supeiwisors as the case may be — and also a requirement that assent to the annexation be given by a vote of the inhabitants of the respective townships, boroughs or cities concerned; in the case, however, of the statutes providing for the alteration of boundaries there is no mandatory provision for the giving of such notice or the obtaining of the consent of the electorate.</p>
    <p id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[231,1232,1153,918]]]'>It may appear strange that, while there is an abundance of legislation covering annexations as between counties and boroughs, boroughs and townships, boroughs and cities, and townships and cities, and while there is a provision for the consolidation of two or more first class or two or more second class townships (Act of June 24, 1931, P. L. 1206, section 210, as amended by the act of May 27, 1949, P. L. 1955; Act of May 1, 1933, P. L. 103, section 205, as amended by the Act of July 10, 1947, P.

The sole decision in that case, however, was that in the proceeding there instituted it was not necessary to have a concurring vote of the people affected by the change, because the Act of March 14, 1857, P. L. 93, which required such a vote, related only to proceedings to divide a township into two or more, and the Act of April 24, 1857, P. L. 304, which also required an election, related only to the erection of a new township out of two or more adjoining ones, and therefore neither of those acts was applicable. The question as to whether the annexation of the territory there involved could be effected under the Act of April 15, 1834, P. L. 537, section 13, which provided merely for the alteration of the lines of two or more adjoining townships, was not directly presented to, nor decided by, the court.
