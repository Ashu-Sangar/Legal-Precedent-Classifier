Relator specifically contends that because of Dr. Drayton’s mental condition in September 1951 and January 1952, his opinion of the defendant in July 1950 was worthless, and the sentencing Court was erroneously guided by this worthless opinion and consequently came to an unjust conclusion.

On October 28th and November 5, 1948, defense counsel introduced evidence tending to show that Smith was insane. After a consideration of all the evidence the sentencing Court on February 4, 1949, sentenced Smith to death. The conviction and sentence were affirmed by this Court in <em>Com. v. Smith, </em><a href="/pa/362/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="362 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="477371" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0222-01">362 Pa. 222</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.2d%20764" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="66 A.2d 764">66 A. 2d 764</a>. Thereafter Smith filed several (successive) petitions for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court, one of which was recently heard and decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. Smith alleged he was denied due process because the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania should first have formally adjudicated the question of his mental coinpe<a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>tency before allowing him to plead guilty; and secondly, he should have been afforded the technical services of a psychiatrist before pleading at all to a capital offense; and thirdly, the incompetence of Dr. Drayton amounted to a denial of due process. These contentions were rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States and the appeal was dismissed. That case is a far stronger case for the defendant than the instant one since in the instant case defendant and his attorney and Dr. Moore, his psychiatrist, as well as Dr. Drayton, the Commonwealth’s psychiatrist, and all the prior history of the defendant agree that the defendant was sane, but was a moron or mentally deficient.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">*</a> There is, therefore, no reason or justification for granting the writ in this case, or holding that the failure to review the death penalty which the sentencing Court had imposed constituted an abuse of discretion or a denial of due process.</p>

The province of the Board of Pardons is to consider not only all the facts pertaining to the crime, as disclosed in the Opinion and decision of the Court, but also and equally important, any and all extenuating' circumstances. The Board of Pardons is primarily a tribunal of <em>clemency; </em>and by recommending to the Governor of Pennsylvania the reduction or commutation of a sentence or the grant of a pardon, the Board of Pardons does not overrule a Court, but because of equitable or extenuating circumstances, recommends clemency. The Board’s recommendation seldom, if ever, is based upon the legal principles or technicalities of the law upon which the Court’s decision is necessarily based. Pursuant to the Act of April 24, 1931, P. L. 71, the Board of Pardons requests every trial Judge to briefly state in writing the facts of the crime, the extenuating circumstances, if any, and equally important, his recommendations with respect to the defendant’s application, as well as the reasons for his recommendation. On at least one occasion a former Chief Justice of this Court recommended to the Board, clemency for a petitioner whose conviction of first degree murder and sentence of death had been sustained by this Court. The Board of Pardons has always welcomed recommendations not only from Judges conversant with the case, as well as district attorneys and prison authorities, but also from private citizens who may be familiar with the defendant and his past or present history or his repentence and future rehabilitation.</p>
