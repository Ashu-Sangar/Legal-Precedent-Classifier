      <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>The minor plaintiff, about eight and one-half years of age, was playing with three other boys on the sidewalk at the northeast corner of Rose Street and Edson Avenue, in the City of Johnstown. The defendant drove his loaded coal truck in a northwesterly direction along Rose Street toward Edson Avenue and stopped at the stop sign prior to turning right into Edson Avenue. It was then approximately 10:30 a.m. on the morning of October 27, 1945. The boys were playing with a rope. The minor plaintiff was standing on the curb of Edson Avenue at an angle facing a house in front of him. The other boys were farther back on the sidewalk. The boys that testified stated that none of them saw the truck which was about to make the right hand turn until after the minor plaintiff was injured. The defendant saw the boys, however, as he proceeded along Rose Street. As the truck turned right into Edson Avenue, the minor plaintiff in <em>some manner </em>fell into the street and was crushed between the right rear dual wheels of the truck and the radius curb.</p>
    <p id="b574-5" data-blocks='[["BL_574.4",574,[252,1459,1156,210]]]'>The question is whether there was sufficient evidence to support a finding by the jury that the overhang of the defendant’s truck, or the truck body, struck the minor plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b574-6" data-blocks='[["BL_574.5",574,[253,1681,1156,482]]]'>The minor plaintiff testified that he was standing on the curb of Edson Avenue with his back to the street and while in this position “. . . felt a blow on my left shoulder, and I don’t remember what happened after that,, and then I remember I was lying down in the street looking up and I saw the back wheels of a truck coining' at me, and then I don’t remember any more until-1 was'lying in thé street after the truck had gone by...-</p>

    <p id="b575-5" data-blocks='[["BL_575.4",575,[185,850,1146,201]]]'>Furthermore, reasonable minds could infer from the testimony that the minor plaintiff was not struck by the other young boys who were there on the corner with him.</p>

Neither of these two boys from whom testimony was received could give an explanation of what caused the minor plaintiff to fall into the street.</p>
    <p id="b575-7" data-blocks='[["BL_575.6",575,[187,1530,1147,310]]]'>At the trial the minor plaintiff exhibited a scar on his left shoulder where he testified he was struck.

    <p id="b575-8" data-blocks='[["BL_575.7",575,[189,1869,1147,427]],["BL_576.1",576,[246,341,1151,97]]]'>The mother of minor plaintiff testified that when the defendant brought the boy to his home immediately after the accident the defendant stated that “. . . Well, I hit your boy with my truck . . .”. About three weeks after the accident the defendant drove by the home of minor plaintiff and stopped to inquire about his condition. There is testimony to the effect that the defendant told the plaintiff’s mother at this time that <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>the posts on his truck must have extended over the curb and bumped the boy off the curb.</p>
    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[242,451,1156,209]]]'>The plaintiffs introduced evidence which if believed was sufficient to enable the jury to decide whether or not the defendant caused the injuries of which the plaintiff complained.</p>
    <p id="b576-6" data-blocks='[["BL_576.5",576,[236,673,1161,870]]]'>The lower court charged as follows: “If you are satisfied by the weight of the evidence that the defendant was negligent in that he drove his truck so that a portion of the truck, the overhang or the wheels or any other part of the truck, came into contact with this boy upon the sidewalk and knocked him into the street, and as a result of such contact injuries were received, your verdict should be for the plaintiffs. If, on the other hand, the injuries were received by this boy in the manner that the defendant indicates, in that the boy was pushed or was thrown or fell against the rear of the truck, out of the vision of the driver of the truck, then your verdict should be for the defendant because there would be no. negligence under the law chargeable to the defendant in that situation. So, you have to determine just what did happen there.”</p>
    <p id="b576-7" data-blocks='[["BL_576.6",576,[234,1555,1154,263]]]'>Since the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, the jury must have found that the defendant “. . . drove his truck so that a portion of the truck, the overhang or the wheels or any other part of the truck, came into contact with this boy upon the sidewalk . . .”.</p>

His argument is that the front portion of the truck bed could only protrude past the curbline if the rear wheels ran over the curb, and since there is no testimony that this happened, the truck bed could not have extended over the curb and struck the <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>minor plaintiff. The fallacy in this argument is that the position of a moving truck cannot be fixed by oral testimony as an “incontrovertible physical fact”. We said in <em>Snyder v. Penn Liberty Refining Co., </em><a href="/pa/302/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="302 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1129052" data-case-paths="/pa/302/0320-01">302 Pa. 320</a>, 322, <a href="/citations/?q=153%20A.%20549" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="153 A. 549">153 A. 549</a>, (Kephart, J.) : “. . . the position of a moving object that causes the injury, as shown by certain evidence, cannot be called an ‘incontrovertible physical fact’ when other evidence or inferences therefrom show the position of the object to be elsewhere at the time of the accident.” See also <em>Ross v. Riffle, </em><a href="/pa/310/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="310 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="1144304" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0176-01">310 Pa. 176</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=164%20A.%20913" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="164 A. 913">164 A. 913</a>.</p>
    <p id="b577-4" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[179,956,1147,544]]]'>From a review of the entire record, it cannot be said that there was not sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that minor plaintiff’s injuries were the result of being knocked into the street by the overhang of the truck as it turned the corner. Furthermore, the defendant may not be exonerated from liability by claiming physical impossibility because such facts as position, speed, and distance are so nebulous that we must leave them for the determination of the jury.</p>
