The offense charged was speed on a public highway at eighty miles per hour where the maximum lawful speed was fifty miles per hour.</p>

    <p id="b429-8" data-blocks='[["BL_429.12",429,[209,1611,1146,594]]]'>Paul M. Greer, defendant, was charged by a state police officer with travelling on a public highway on May 3, 1952, at 7:30 p.m. on a dry, clear night at eighty miles per hour where the lawful maximum speed was fifty miles per hour. The charge is not denied. His only excuse was, “I was going to Ohio and was a little late and making up a little time.” Defendant had been driving for fifteen years, was never before arrested for speeding, was thirty-two years of age, worked in shifts in a machine shop and used his car for transportation both for pleasure and business.</p>

In the order the court said, “. . . the operator’s license ... is necessary and that the loss thereof would work an undue hardship on [defendant].” Such an order in the circumstances of this case constitutes a manifest abuse of discretion.</p>
