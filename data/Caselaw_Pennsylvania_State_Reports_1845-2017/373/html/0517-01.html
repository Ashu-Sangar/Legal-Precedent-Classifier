The power to tax necessarily includes the power to sell for nonpayment of taxes, and thus the property of a public corporation, without which it could not perform its duties to the public, could be sold piecemeal and the corporate purpose be defeated by divesting the title to certain portions of the real estate against which tax liens were filed. Again, many quasi public corporations extend into and through different municipalities, and as a question of public policy, it has not been deemed wise to subject them to the exactions of the taxing officer at every municipal division line, but rather to authorize the commonwealth to impose a capital stock tax upon such corporations, and in appraising the same for the purpose of taxation, the real estate, franchises, earning power, dividends and all other matters which affect the value. thereof, must be taken into consideration. In this manner the real estate of a quasi public corporation is taxed, and while the tax goes directly to the state in the first instance, cities, boroughs, townships, school districts and other municipal divisions receive the benefits of such taxation by appropriations made to the public schools, to hospitals, to eleemosynary institutions and to charities of different kinds located throughout the state. But without further discussion of the policy of the law, which is the foundation of the rule, it is settled in this state that the words 'real estate’ in our taxing statutes do not include lands or appurtenances essential and necessary to the exercise of the franchise of a public <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>corporation: Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company v.

The transit company in that case was a common carrier in motor busses of <em>passengers </em>for hire. The property levied upon for taxes consisted of real estate used for “. . . offices for carrying on appellant’s business; for the storage, maintenance and inspection and repair of motor busses; and for the storage of bus chassis, parts of oil burners, tool boxes, winter fronts for busses, filing records, supplies and equipment.

    <p id="b550-4" data-blocks='[["BL_550.4",550,[239,743,1157,1254]]]'>The test as to whether or not a corporation is quasi-public was stated in that case by Chief Justice Maxey (then Justice) in these words (p. 97) : “The question whether or not a corporation is quasi public is for the courts to determine on the facts of each case. A corporation cannot obtain judicial recognition as quasi public unless the service it renders to the public or a large part of it are so essential to public well-being that any interference with its functions by local administrative agencies would be insufferable to the sovereign Commonwealth. The functions of the appellant company do not bring it within this class of corporations. It is only a private corporation which does not have to possess even chartered rights, much less sovereign rights, to carry on its activities. It renders no service which cannot be furnished through the ordinary channels of private competitive business. The State has no more solicitude for its continued operation unhampered by local taxing agencies than it has for the continued activity of an individual who owns a jitney and who after receiving a certificate of public convenience engages for his personal profit in the carrying of passengers for hire.”</p>

Such a corporation cannot be said to render such essential public service that any interference with its func<a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>tions by local administrative agencies would be insufferable to the Commonwealth. Motor vehicles using the public roads are in a far different situation than railroads, street railways and pipe lines (water, gas and oil) where a sale of a portion might seriously jeopardize essential public requirements. Further elaboration would appear to be unnecessary.</p>
    <p id="b551-3" data-blocks='[["BL_551.4",551,[171,727,1150,764]]]'>There is no merit in the contention that discrimination against appellant is shown because in the same county the taxing authorities permit an interstate common carrier by motor vehicle, which did not own real estate in the county, to make some joint use with a railroad company of tax exempt real estate owned by the railroad company. If such an exemption is invalid, clearly it forms no basis for exempting the real estate here in question. Appellant does not allege that a general scheme of taxation exists which results in a different standard being applied to it than is applied to all other taxpayers in the county possessing a similar status. An illegal exemption to one other corporation cannot be the basis for an exemption to appellant.</p>
