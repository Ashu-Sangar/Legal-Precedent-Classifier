By necessary implication testator required his trustees to invest the corpus, because he directed them to distribute the “earnings and income,” with the corpus, for the purposes of the trust. The clearly expressed purpose of the trust was “for the maintenance and upkeep” of the devised real estate. Testator directed his trustees to pay his daughters or the survivor out of the trust fund the annual sum of $2000, <em>for that purpose. </em>Such a trust is valid. It is an active trust for a lawful purpose.

But testator’s directions concerning the consequences of the devisees’ disregard of his attempted restriction against alienation illuminates his obvious intent that the trust provision in relief of his daughters continued <em>only while they owned the real estate and ceased upon its sale. </em>While testator manifestly contemplated that the payments of $2000. per annum would at the end of twenty years consume the trust corpus of $40,000, what he overlooked was that his devisees might retain title for over twenty years and that “earnings and income” might enhance the trust fund. <em>No dispositive direction was made by testator concerning any unexpended portion of the trust estate in the event of a sale after the twenty year period. </em>As also stated the real estate was held for twenty-four years; $2000. was paid in each and every year for twenty-four years and $17,500. remained unexpended in the fund when the <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>sale took place. Since the terms of the trust were fully performed <em>without exhausting the fund, </em>and because testator in erecting the trust made no provision for the disposition of this unexpended balance, the trustees hold this portion of the fund under a resulting trust for the benefit of the estate of testator and it is distributable under the terms of testator’s testamentary residuary clause: Restatement, Trusts, Section 430: “Where the owner of property gratuitously transfers it upon a trust which is properly declared but which is fully performed without exhausting the trust estate, the trustee holds the surplus upon a resulting trust for the transferor or his estate, unless the transferor properly manifested an intention that no resulting trust of the surplus should arise.” See to the same effect, Scott on Trusts, §430 et seq.</p>

She points to items 5 and 6 as substantiating her claim. With this contention we do not agree. Item 5 relates to the same devisees with a trust for a similar purpose, concerning other real estate, probably testator’s <em>town house. </em>In that trust of $20,000 the trustees were directed to pay to the daughters or survivor the annual sum of $1500. for “maintenance and upkeep” of the real estate. True there is <em>no provision </em>in this item against alienation, nor a provision that in case of violation the fund should be paid into the residuary estate. But here again, the trust was an active one. For the foregoing reasons any unexpended portion of the fund after the termination of the trust <em>passes by operation of law </em>into testator’s residuary estate. In item 6 the <em>real estate </em>was not devised under testator’s will. It was owned by the daugh<a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>ter Mary in her own right. The <em>trustees </em>were directed to pay out of the $10,000 trust fund with “earnings and upkeep” the annual sum of $700 for “maintenance and upkeep” of the real estate. In neither item 5 nor 6 was there the slightest indication of an <em>absolute gift </em>of the trust funds.</p>
