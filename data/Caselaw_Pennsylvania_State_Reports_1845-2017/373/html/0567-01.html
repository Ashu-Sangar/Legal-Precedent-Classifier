Musante, from the decree of the register of wills, revoking letters of administration issued to him as administrator of the estate of Louise Musante Obici, deceased. The question is whether or not the intestate had a “family or principal residence” in Luzerne County, within the meaning of sec. 2 (a) of the Fiduciaries Act of June 7, 1917 P.

She died August 29, 1938, in the City of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. She left to survive her, as her only heirs and next of kin, her husband, Amedeo Obici, three sisters, one nephew (appellant) and a niece. Appellant in his petition for letters dated December 3, 1947, nine years after intestate’s death, averred that she was a resident of the City of Wilkes-Barre and was possessed of personal property to the value of $500.

An answer in denial was filed by appellant and issue was joined. Upon a hearing by the register of wills, he decided that intestate at date of her death was not domiciled in Pennsylvania, but was domiciled in the State of Virginia. The register revoked the letters of administration. On appeal to the Orphans’ Court of Luzerne County, appellant’s appeal was dismissed. An appeal to this Court then followed.</p>

A heavy burden rests upon him who alleges a change in domicile to establish not only that decedent had acquired another domicile but that he <em>manifested and carried into execution an intention of abandoning his former domicile. </em>Such change must be <em>“animo et </em>facto”: <em>Lowry’s Estate, </em>supra; <em>Price v.

From the time of their marriage until January, 1937 — a period of twenty-one years — they resided together as husband and wife in the State of Virginia. In 1937 the wife came to Wilkes-Barre to her sister’s home where she remained until her death in August, 1938 — a period of nineteen months.

He became eminently successful and wealthy. The husband and wife maintained an elaborate estate, lived in a luxurious manner, with servants, chauffeurs, automobiles, yachts, swimming pool, etc. They entertained lavishly. The husband’s business required numerous journeys to the West Coast, Canada, and even abroad. There were no children born of the union. The wife’s relatives were the chief visitors at their home. There was testimony that the wife was lonely in this vast estate when her husband was away on the above trips — one of which was in Italy where he donated and endowed a hospital wing in memory of his deceased mother. Beyond slight marital differences, there appears to have been no serious rift in the domestic relations of the couple. In 1935 the wife became ill, and in 1936 was stricken with an at<a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>tack of hypertension.

Her physical and mental condition, due to the recurrent attacks, gradually deteriorated, and from the latter part of the following November until her death she never left the sick room. In the period from November, 1937 to July 20, 1938, the patient received 22 blood transfusions. A reaction from the hypodermic injections caused an inflammation of her right arm, which required hot applications, and after the arm was opened and drained in April, of 1938, it required constant care until her death.

But summarized by the orphans’ court, it is stated: “Throughout the illness of his wife, Mr. Obici kept in constant contact, by telephone and/or mail, with the doctor, the nurse and his wife. His business affairs necessitated an extended trip to San Francisco during the yearly period of his wife’s illness. From the latter part of July, 1937 until the middle of September, 1937, he was in Italy to attend a dedication of a hospital wing in memory of his mother, and while there he received treatment for a leg ailment. These extended trips apparently were made by Mr. Obici after assurance from his wife’s attending physician that her condition should not prevent his going. Correspondence between Mr. Obici and the attending physician reflected Mr. Obici’s concern as to his wife’s welfare. His letters to his wife were anticipated and welcomed by her; messages from his wife to him through the nurse, reflected her feeling of affection and regard. The record does not show whether or not Mrs. Obici was able to write. During periods other than those covered by the extended trips, Mr. Obici made bi-weekly visits to his wife, coming up from Suffolk, Virginia. During these visits he stayed at his sister’s home near Wilkes-Barre. When his wife’s condition became grave, he stayed at a hotel in Wilkes-Barre. Apparently, due to the confinement of his wife and her required attendants, there was no room in the Santucci home to accommodate Mr. Obici, although it appears he stayed for dinner in the Santucci home on many of his visits.</p>

It is stated in Restatement, Conflict of Laws, §27: “Except as stated in §28, a wife has the same domicil as that of her husband.” Sec. 28 reads: “If a wife lives apart from her husband,. . . she can have a separate domicil.” But in the facts of this case the mental and physical illness of the wife, when coupled with the testimony of the sisters, nephew and niece, <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>did not establish the erection of a separate domicile of the wife in Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b605-5" data-blocks='[["BL_605.4",605,[164,469,1145,154]]]'>It is stated by counsel for both parties, either at argument or in their paper books, matters which do not appear in the printed record:</p>
    <p id="b605-6" data-blocks='[["BL_605.5",605,[162,644,1149,597]]]'>(a) that the real purpose for seeking the appointment of the administrator in Pennsylvania is to seek to establish the existence of an oral partnership agreement between the husband and wife — made allegedly many years ago — relating to the vast and extremely lucrative business ostensibly conducted by the husband in his lifetime; that pending this litigation, and after the letters of administration had been revoked, appellant instituted an action in the federal court (on diversity of citizenship) seeking to have a partnership decreed and for an accounting.</p>
    <p id="b605-7" data-blocks='[["BL_605.6",605,[163,1261,1147,209]]]'>(b) that the personal counsel for the register at times conducted some of the hearings, ruled upon credibility of witnesses, etc., and that this constituted an improper delegation of authority.</p>
    <p id="b605-8" data-blocks='[["BL_605.7",605,[163,1490,1147,99]]]'>Since neither of these matters was presented to the court below, we express no opinion concerning them.</p>
    <p id="b605-9" data-blocks='[["BL_605.8",605,[163,1609,1147,316]]]'>The orphans’ court was not required to call witnesses since, by written agreement of counsel for all parties dated December 6, 1951, filed of record, it was stipulated that on appeal to the orphans’ court from the decision of the register “the parties will not introduce any new evidence. . .”.</p>
    <p id="b605-10" data-blocks='[["BL_605.9",605,[162,1948,1148,145]]]'>All remaining objections to the decree of the orphans’ court are obviously without merit and do not warrant discussion.</p>
    <p id="b605-11" data-blocks='[["BL_605.10",605,[163,2122,1147,99]]]'>The decree of the orphans’ court is affirmed, at the cost of appellant.</p>
