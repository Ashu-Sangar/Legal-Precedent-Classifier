Brumbach, died May 1, 1933, survived by a son, Frank, and a widow, Carrie E. Brumbach, to whom he gave his estate in equal shares. Frank died December 15, 1934, intestate, unmarried, without issue, survived by his mother, who was Albert D.’s wife. Frank’s mother died July 19, 1938, intestate; Letters of Administration on her estate were granted to Stuart E. Brumbach, the exceptant, and Raymond J. Bulles, the latter now deceased. Appellants contend that the gift to Albert D.’s issue was <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>contingent upon their surviving Emma Ammon, the life tenant; appellee contends that the gift to (Frank, who was) Albert D.’s only issue, was vested upon the death of Albert D. before the life tenant.</p>
    <p id="b333-4" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[190,562,1147,596]]]'>Stated in simple language the scheme or plan and intent of the testator was to give to each of his children, including his son Albert D., a l/6th equal share of his residuary estate. The share for his daughter Emma was to be held in trust to pay the income to her for life and after her death (and the death of her husband) to pay the principal in equal shares to each of Ms other (4) children (three sons and daughter) whom he <em>specifically named </em>and to the family of his deceased daughter, Ida, viz., her three children whom he likewise specifically named.</p>
    <p id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.5",333,[191,1179,1148,865]]]'>With respect to the gift or share for each son, it is clear from a consideration of the entire will — from its language as well as from its scheme or plan — that the testator intended to and actually did bequeath 1/5th of the principal of Emma’s share to his son Albert, or if Albert died before the life tenants, to Albert’s issue. The gifts to his daughter, whom he named, and to the children of his deceased daughter, whom he named, were unquestionably vested and became a part of their respective trusts; it would be unlikely that the testator intended to make the gifts to his daughters vested and the gifts to his sons contingent; the language itself makes clear, we repeat, his intention to give each of his sons a vested remainder, subject to be divested and paid to the son’s issue if the son predeceased the life tenants.</p>
