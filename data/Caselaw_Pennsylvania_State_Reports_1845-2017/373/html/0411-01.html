    <p class="author" id="ARc" data-blocks='[["BL_440.17",440,[566,1801,692,43]]]'>Mr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,</p>
    <p id="b440-11" data-blocks='[["BL_440.18",440,[240,1911,1152,263]]]'>This is an appeal by the Commonwealth from an order of the court of common pleas setting aside an order of the Secretary of Revenue suspending defendant’s <em>reciprocal, nonresident’s </em>operating privileges for operating a motor vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b440-12" data-blocks='[["BL_440.19",440,[241,2187,1151,154]],["BL_441.1",441,[174,340,1146,266]]]'>The Vehicle Code, §603, 75 PS 163, provides that a non-resident, duly licensed in his home state, may operate in Pennsylvania without obtaining a Pennsyl<a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>vania license. And §615(d) of The Vehicle Code, 75 PS 192, provides that the Secretary of Revenue may suspend a non-resident’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle in Pennsylvania <em>for any reason which would justify suspension of a resident’s license.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b441-3" data-blocks='[["BL_441.4",441,[174,617,1148,379]]]'>It therefore follows that what we said in <em>Commonwealth v. Emerick, </em><a href="/pa/373/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="373 Pa. 388" data-case-ids="1240391" data-case-paths="/pa/373/0388-01">373 Pa. 388</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=96%20A.2d%20370" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="96 A.2d 370">96 A. 2d 370</a>, relating to suspension of operator’s licenses for operating motor vehicles has similar application. By necessary implication, a non-resident under the above language of the Code possesses the same right of appeal under §616 of The Vehicle Code, 75 PS 193, as a resident.</p>
    <p id="b441-4" data-blocks='[["BL_441.5",441,[175,1008,1146,373]]]'>Billy Starcher, non-resident defendant, was charged by a state police officer on April 25, 1951, at 8:45 p.m., on a clear, dark night with driving a motor vehicle on a public highway at seventy miles an hour where the lawful speed limit was fifty miles an hour. Defendant does not deny the charge and offers no extenuating circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b441-5" data-blocks='[["BL_441.6",441,[176,1395,1146,255]]]'>The learned court below revoked the Secretary of Revenue’s order of suspension solely upon the ground of economic hardship. Such an order in the circumstances of this case constituted a manifest abuse of discretion.</p>
