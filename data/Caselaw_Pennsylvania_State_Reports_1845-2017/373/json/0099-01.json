        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Arnold,\nThis is an action of trespass for recovery of damages for injuries to plaintiff-wife resulting from a collision between a car operated by one Fozard and defendant\u2019s automobile in which plaintiff-wife was a guest-passenger. Verdict and judgment were for plaintiffs, and defendant appeals from refusal of judgment n.o.v.\nAll of the testimony was produced by the plaintiffs; the defendant did not testify nor did he offer any testimony. Interpreting this evidence in \u00e1 light most favor' able to the plaintiffs, as we must, the following facts are established: On a clear, dry day, defendant was proceeding in a northerly and Fozard in a southerly direction on a 3-lane, concrete highway. The collision occurred on a level stretch of the road, from which point there was an unobstructed view of % mile in either direction.\nBoth drivers had been traveling in their own respective right lanes. Three cars, proceeding in the same direction, were in front of Fozard, while a car in front of defendant was traveling in his same direction at a distance estimated as \u201croom for two or three cars to be traveling.\u201d The defendant\u2019s speed was \u201cmoderate\u201d; and the only estimate of Fozard\u2019s speed was his own guess that \u201cwith the weight on my car, I would say not more than thirty or thirty-five, at most, with the damage done to the other car;. . . I couldn\u2019t have been traveling very fast.\u201d\nWhen the two cars were \u201cmore than the length of this Court Room\u201d from each other, plaintiff-wife saw the Fozard car \u201cswerve out of his lane of traffic a little bit, and go back in.\u201d She observed that defendant had not seen it. \u201cHe was playing the radio . . . dialing and tuning.\u201d She then saw that Fozard again slowly left his lane, \u201cknew he [defendant] hadn\u2019t noticed it, because he was dialing\u201d and said, \u201cLook out for that car.\u201d Defendant then looked up, saw the Fozard car, and veered into the center lane at the same time that Fozard attempted to return to his own lane. Each again changed course, and finally collided, with defendant\u2019s car partially in his own and center lane and Fozard partially in defendant\u2019s lane of travel. Plaintiff-wife testified that when defendant did see Fozard, \u201che had time to get his equilibrium\u201d; that \u201cit seemed a long time,\u201d \u201ca few seconds\u201d from the time of her warning to the collision; that he had time to \u201cget the situation in hand.\u201d Fozard testified he had fallen asleep.\nDefendant contends that the sudden emergency rule excused him from liability; and in the foregoing testimony as to distance and time seeks to set up definite mathematical calculations as a basis for invoking the rule.\nAs can readily be seen, no yardstick was supplied by which he can justify his statement that defendant had only \u201ca distance of 100 feet, or less than 1 y2 seconds, to meet a sudden emergency\u201d created by Fozard. Moreover, the question of fact as to whether there was a sudden emergency was for the jury. This was particularly so here, where the court made a full and accurate charge on the rule and its possible application to the facts of the case. Cf. Dupont v. Gallagher, 360 Pa. 419, 62 A. 2d 28. \u201cWe have frequently stated that the sudden emergency rule will not apply if the emergency arises through the prior negligence of him who seeks the protection of the rule. . . When the driver of an automobile claims that he has been subjected to a sudden emergency in driving on- the highways, to enable him to claim the. benefit of this rule, it must appear that he was not' driving in a reckless or careless manner, but with due regard, to the condition of the highway and the traffic. One driving carelessly cannot say he was placed , in sudden peril. - If driving in a careful manner, the peril would not have arisen. The question, therefore, is usually one for the jury to determine, under proper instruction.\u201d: Casey v. Siciliano, 310 Pa. 238, 241, 242, 165 A. 1.\nThe question of. proximate cause was for the jury, and it cannot be said as a matter of law that'defendant\u2019s inattention was not the'direct cause of' plaintiff\u2019s' loss. He was guilty:, of.'.negligei\u00edc\u00e9'. in net driving -with due regard to' the'..traffic.'. What was-said'in Dupont v. Gallagher, 360 Pa. 419, at. page 421, 62 A. 2d 28, where-in plaintiff sued for damages as defendant\u2019s guest-passenger, is equally applicable here: \u201cIt was plaintiff\u2019s contention that the proximate cause of the accident was defendant\u2019s negligence in not watching the road more carefully. . . It was the defendant\u2019s contention that the proximate cause of the accident was the sudden pulling out of the other [third party] car, without warning of any kind, on a wet road. These respective contentions made a clear cut issue for the jury. . . under proper instructions.\u201d In Malitovsky v. Harshaw Chemical Company, 360 Pa. 279, 284, 61 A. 2d 846, the Court stated: \u201cOrdinarily, it is for the jury to determine whose negligence, of several persons contributing to the injury, was the proximate cause: Helmick v. South Union Township, 323 Pa. 433, 185 A. 609. Section 447 of the Restatement of Torts, cited with approval by this Court in Nelson v. Duquesne Light Company et al., 338 Pa. 37, 53, 54, 12 A. 2d 299, states: \u2018The fact that an intervening act of a third person is negligent in itself or is done in a negligent manner does not make it a superseding cause of harm to another which the actor\u2019s negligent conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about. . . .\u2019 See also: Kline v. Moyer, 325 Pa. 357, 364, 191 A. 43; Mautino v. Piercedale Supply Company, 338 Pa. 435, 13 A. 2d 51.\u201d\nJudgment affirmed.",
