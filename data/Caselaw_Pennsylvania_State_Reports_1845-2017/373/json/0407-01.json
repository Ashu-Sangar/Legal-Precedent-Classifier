        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nThis is an appeal by the Commonwealth from an order of the court of common pleas setting aside a suspension by the Secretary of Revenue of an operator\u2019s license for operating a motor vehicle. The offense charged was speed on a public highway at seventy miles per hour when the maximum lawful speed was fifty miles per hour.\nWhat we said in Commonwealth v. Emerick, 373 Pa. 388, 96 A. 2d 370, relating to legal principles and construction of The Vehicle Code, has similar application to the facts in the present case.\nCharles Cornetti, Jr., defendant, was charged by a state policeman with traveling on a public highway on March 22, 1952, after dark, at a speed of seventy miles per hour. The road was dry and traffic moderate. Such speed was a violation of The Vehicle Code. Defendant did not deny the violation, and the only reason given by him for such violation was, \u201cI was late for an appointment.\u201d He was twenty years of age, unmarried, and living home with his father and mother. He had been driving for four years; had been fined several times for \u201cgoing through a stop sign\u201d; and had been involved in an accident, although no charge was made against him. The order of suspension was rescinded solely on the ground of economic hardship. In the order the court said: \u201c. . . it appearing to the Court that the petitioner\u2019s violation did not endanger the life or property of any person; and it further appearing to the Court that the petitioner would be unable to continue in his employment without a driver\u2019s license which would result in a great and undue hardship not justified by the facts of this case, the prayer -of said petition is granted, and the Order of the Secretary of Revenue suspending the license of Charles Cornetti, Jr. is hereby set aside and full driving privileges are hereby restored to the said Charles Cornetti, Jr.\u201d\nSuch an order under the circumstances of this case constitutes a manifest abuse of discretion.\nThe order is reversed at the cost of the appellee.",
