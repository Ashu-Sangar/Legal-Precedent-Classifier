        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nThis is an appeal by the Commonwealth from an order of the Court of Common Pleas setting aside a suspension by the Secretary of Revenue of an operator\u2019s license for operating a motor vehicle. The offense charged was speed on a public highway at eighty miles per hour where the maximum lawful speed was fifty miles per hour.\nWhat we said in Commonwealth v. Emerick, 373 Pa. 388, 96 A. 2d 370, relating to legal principles and the construction of The Vehicle Code has similar application to the facts in the present case.\nPaul M. Greer, defendant, was charged by a state police officer with travelling on a public highway on May 3, 1952, at 7:30 p.m. on a dry, clear night at eighty miles per hour where the lawful maximum speed was fifty miles per hour. The charge is not denied. His only excuse was, \u201cI was going to Ohio and was a little late and making up a little time.\u201d Defendant had been driving for fifteen years, was never before arrested for speeding, was thirty-two years of age, worked in shifts in a machine shop and used his car for transportation both for pleasure and business.\nThe learned court below revoked the Secretary of Revenue\u2019s order of suspension solely on the ground of economic hardship. In the order the court said, \u201c. . . the operator\u2019s license ... is necessary and that the loss thereof would work an undue hardship on [defendant].\u201d Such an order in the circumstances of this case constitutes a manifest abuse of discretion.\nThe order is reversed at the cost of appellee.",
