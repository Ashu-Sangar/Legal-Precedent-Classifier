        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nThis is an appeal by the Commonwealth from an order of the court of common pleas setting aside an order of the Secretary of Revenue suspending defendant\u2019s reciprocal, nonresident\u2019s operating privileges for operating a motor vehicle.\nThe Vehicle Code, \u00a7603, 75 PS 163, provides that a non-resident, duly licensed in his home state, may operate in Pennsylvania without obtaining a Pennsylvania license. And \u00a7615(d) of The Vehicle Code, 75 PS 192, provides that the Secretary of Revenue may suspend a non-resident\u2019s privilege to operate a motor vehicle in Pennsylvania for any reason which would justify suspension of a resident\u2019s license.\nIt therefore follows that what we said in Commonwealth v. Emerick, 373 Pa. 388, 96 A. 2d 370, relating to suspension of operator\u2019s licenses for operating motor vehicles has similar application. By necessary implication, a non-resident under the above language of the Code possesses the same right of appeal under \u00a7616 of The Vehicle Code, 75 PS 193, as a resident.\nBilly Starcher, non-resident defendant, was charged by a state police officer on April 25, 1951, at 8:45 p.m., on a clear, dark night with driving a motor vehicle on a public highway at seventy miles an hour where the lawful speed limit was fifty miles an hour. Defendant does not deny the charge and offers no extenuating circumstances.\nThe learned court below revoked the Secretary of Revenue\u2019s order of suspension solely upon the ground of economic hardship. Such an order in the circumstances of this case constituted a manifest abuse of discretion.\nThe order is reversed at the cost of appellee.",
