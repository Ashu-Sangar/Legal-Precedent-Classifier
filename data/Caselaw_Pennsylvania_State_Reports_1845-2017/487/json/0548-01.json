        "text": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nOn October 27, 1973, Henry Gnas, appellee in No. 158 January Term, 1978, drove to State College, Pennsylvania to attend a Penn State football game at Beaver Stadium. After the game, he and his companions drove to downtown State College for dinner. Mr. Gnas parked his car illegally in a private parking lot near the restaurant in violation of the Vehicle Code, 75 P.S. \u00a7 1021.1, as amended (1971), which provided:\n\u201cNo person shall park or leave unattended a vehicle or tractor on private property without the consent of the owner or other person in control or possession thereof, except in. the case of emergency or disablement of the vehicle or tractor, in which case, the operator shall arrange for the removal of such vehicle or tractor as soon as possible.\nThe owner or other person in charge or possession of any land on which a vehicle or tractor is parked or left unattended in violation of the provisions of this section may remove such vehicle or tractor at the reasonable expense of the owner thereof.\u201d (emphasis added).\nUpon finding his car missing from the parking lot, Mr. Gnas was informed it was at an auto pound owned and operated by Natalie\u2019s Towing Service, Inc., (hereinafter Natalie\u2019s) appellant in No. 158 January Term, 1978. Mr. Gnas\u2019 brother then went to Natalie\u2019s and was apparently told he would not be able to remove the car unless he paid the towing charge of $25.30, which he did. Subsequently, Mr. Gnas filed a complaint in assumpsit in the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County asserting that Natalie\u2019s had wrongfully withheld and deprived Gnas of his motor vehicle, and demanded the refund of the towing fee plus interest.\nA separate action was initiated by the Apartment Owners and Managers Committee of the State College Area Chamber of Commerce, et al., appellants in No. 157 January Term, 1978, against the District Attorney of Centre County, Charles Brown, appellee. It seems that the illegal parking of cars on private property was a common occurrence at State College, especially during football games. To combat this problem, the Apartment Owners and Managers Committee persuaded Emanuel Natalie to form a towing service to remove the illegally parked vehicles. It was the practice of Natalie\u2019s to release the vehicles to their owners only after payment of the towing fee. In January of 1974, the District Attorney publicly announced at a meeting of the committee that the holding of the towed vehicles pending payment of the towing fee constituted theft under Chapter 39 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3901-3931 (1973) and that his office would prosecute the holder of such vehicles for theft. Consequently, Emanuel Natalie discontinued his towing service which prompted the committee to file a Petition for Declaratory Relief requesting a judicial interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Vehicle Code and the Crimes Code. This action was consolidated for trial with Gnas\u2019 action in assumpsit.\nThe lower court dismissed the petition for declaratory relief because it \u201cdecline[d] to render an advisory opinion as to a nonexistent case.\u201d That court granted the relief requested by Gnas and directed Natalie\u2019s to refund the towing fee because \u201cwe do not find that it [the Vehicle Code] goes so far as to permit a possessory lien; and, therefore, we find that neither the property owner nor the towing service has a right to retain possession of a towed vehicle until the towing charge is paid.\u201d\nThe cases were consolidated for appeal to the Superior Court which affirmed both judgments. That court agreed that the petition for declaratory judgment should be dismissed for want of a true controversy. As to the Gnas complaint, the Superior Court found no common law lien nor express or implied statutory lien existed so as to justify Natalie\u2019s refusal to return Gnas\u2019 car until the towing fee was paid.\nWe disagree with the analysis and conclusion of the Superior Court in No. 158. As aptly put by Judge William F. Cercone in his concurring and dissenting opinion, both the majority of the Superior Court and the trial court have indulged in an \u201cunnecessary search for the elusive lien.\u201d The issue in this case was not whether the property owner or the towing service has a lien on \u2014 and the right to retain possession of \u2014 a towed vehicle until the towing fee has been paid, but rather, whether the owner of the towed vehicle has the right to recover his already paid fee from the towing service in an assumpsit action. The posture of this case renders the \u201csearch\u201d for a lien justification irrelevant.\nThe Vehicle Code, 75 P.S. \u00a7 1201.1, squarely placed the financial burden for removal of illegally parked vehicles on the owners of such vehicles. The owner of the private property on which the vehicle is parked was authorized to hire another person (Natalie\u2019s) to remove the vehicle \u201cat the reasonable expense of the owner thereof\u201d (Gnas). Mr. Gnas cannot be permitted to thwart the clear intentions of the legislature by prevailing in an action to recover those reasonable expenses of towing.\nTo permit recovery of the towing fee by Gnas would, in practical effect, render the property owner\u2019s right to remove illegally parked vehicles from his property a nullity. Where there is a right, there must be a meaningful remedy. Were we to affirm the Superior Court, the property owner would be forced to pay the towing service in advance for the removal of vehicles and then initiate legal action against the vehicle\u2019s owner for those expenses. It is extremely unlikely that many property owners would endure the time and expense of litigation to recover the amount of the towing fee and the right given the property owners by the Vehicle Code would atrophy. We need not address the question of the possible existence of a lien upon a towed vehicle as the true issue here is merely the right of the owner of such vehicle to recover, in an assumpsit action, the expenses of towing from the tower where the statute has expressly placed the financial burden for those expenses on the vehicle owner. The lower court ignored the statutory allocation of this financial burden in ordering Natalie\u2019s to refund the towing fee to Gnas. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court at No. 158 January Term, 1978.\nWe agree that the petition for declaratory relief was properly dismissed in No. 157. As the lower court and the Superior Court have held, any controversy in this action was too remote and speculative to be cognizable in a judicial proceeding. Furthermore, the case is moot, given a recent amendment to the Vehicle Code. 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3353(c) has been amended, by Act 95 of November 10, 1979, effective immediately, to read:\nProperty owner may remove vehicle. \u2014 The owner or other person in charge or possession of any property on which a vehicle is parked or left unattended in violation of the provisions of subsection (b) may remove or have removed the vehicle at the reasonable expense of the owner of the vehicle. Such person who removes a vehicle left parked or unattended in violation of the provisions of subsection (b) shall have a lien against the owner of the vehicle, in the amount of the reasonable value of the costs of removing the vehicle. Any city, borough, incorporated town or township may, by ordinance, provide for rates to be charged for removal of vehicles and for municipal regulation of authorized towing services, (amendment underlined).\nAs this amendment establishes a lien on the towed vehicle, the tower is authorized to retain possession until the lien is satisfied. Hence, the tower cannot be prosecuted for theft of such vehicle.\nFor the foregoing reasons, Order of the Superior Court at No. 977 October Term, 1976 (No. 157 January Term 1978 in this Court) affirming the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County\u2019s dismissal of Petition for Declaratory Judgment is affirmed; Order of the Superior Court at No. 978 October Term 1976 (No. 158 January Term 1978 in this Court) affirming the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County is reversed and the case is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County for entry of judgment in favor of appellant.\nEAGEN, C. J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nNIX, J., filed a Dissenting Opinion in which ROBERTS, J., joined.\nPenn State\u2019s opponent that afternoon was West Virginia University and the final score was Penn State 62 \u2014 West Virginia 14.\n. This section was repealed in 1976, but was reenacted in substantially the same language as 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3353(b) and (c) (1977).\n. The charge was, specifically, $20.00 for the towing service, $5.00 for storage and $.30 tax.",

        "text": "NIX, Justice,\ndissenting.\nThe majority rhetorically questions the \u201cunnecessary search for the elusive lien\u201d and in so doing reflects its failure to grasp the single issue in this case. The Motor Vehicle Code provides the owner of land on which a vehicle is illegally parked with the right to have the vehicle removed and assesses the reasonable expenses for such removal against the owner of the vehicle. Even if we accept that Natalie\u2019s Towing Service was acting as agent for the owners of the land in question and therefore entitled to the rights given to the owners of land under the Motor Vehicle Code, the question still remains as to the authority of Natalie\u2019s to withhold possession of the vehicle until the cost of removal had been paid. It is the very absence of that \u201celusive lien\u201d, which would have conferred the right to retain property for payment of the claim, that caused the majority of the Superior Court to properly conclude that Natalie\u2019s refusal to return the vehicle owner\u2019s car until the towing fee was paid was without legal support.\nToday\u2019s majority, while implicitly conceding that no such lien exists under either the common or statutory law, attempts to change the focus to whether the vehicle owner was obligated to pay the reasonable cost of removal. This simply is not the issue that has been raised in the lawsuit. The question is not the obligation to pay but the right of the creditor to compel satisfaction by retaining possession. The majority\u2019s reasoning would appear to condone a creditor who placed a gun to the head of the debtor to secure payment as long as the debt was justly owed.\nThe issue was correctly analyzed and answered by the Superior Court and there was absolutely no reason for this Court to grant review. Thus a proper disposition would be an order indicating that the allowance of the appeal was improvidently granted. At the very least the order of the Superior Court should be affirmed.\nROBERTS, J., joins in this opinion.\n.
