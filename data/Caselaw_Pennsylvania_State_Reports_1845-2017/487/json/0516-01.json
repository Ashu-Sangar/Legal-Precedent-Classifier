        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellants, the Hospital Association of Pennsylvania and twenty-one Pennsylvania hospitals, contend that state regulations governing \u201cgeneral and special hospitals,\u201d 28 Pa.Code \u00a7\u00a7 101.1 et seq., were promulgated without statutory authority by appellees, the Secretary and the Department of Health. We agree with appellees and the Commonwealth Court that ample basis for the challenged regulations is provided by article IX of the Public Welfare Code. Accordingly, we affirm.\nI\nIn 1972, appellees determined that the department\u2019s \u201cRules and Regulations for Hospitals,\u201d last revised in 1966, should again be revised. In full compliance with publication and notice requirements, appellees published a set of proposed rules and regulations designed to replace the 1966 rules. 2 Pa.Bull. 1129 (1972). Between 1972 and 1977, appellees evaluated extensive public opinion on the proposed rules, including comment from the Hospital Association of Pennsylvania, and incorporated many suggestions into a revised draft. Again by proper notice, appellees published a revised set of rules and regulations. 7 Pa.Bull. 939 (1977). After further public comment, appellees modified the proposed rules and, in December, 1977, adopted them as modified. 7 Pa.Bull. 3631 (1977).\nThe challenged regulations span twenty-six chapters, ranging from such concerns as \u201cGovernance and Management\u201d to \u201cConstruction Standards.\u201d Within each chapter there are a series of specific regulations. For example, under the heading \u201cGovernance and Management,\u201d there appear regulations setting objectives for hospital by-laws, 28 Pa.Code \u00a7 103.3, establishing functions to be performed by a \u201cgoverning body,\u201d id. at \u00a7 103.4, and directing formation of various \u201cgoverning body committees.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 103.6. Also included are regulations establishing a \u201cPatient\u2019s Bill of Rights,\u201d id. at \u00a7\u00a7 103.21-103.24, managerial and administrative responsibilities, id. at \u00a7\u00a7 103.31-103.39, and standards for fiscal control. Id. at \u00a7\u00a7 103.41-103.46. In all, appellees promulgated over 500 specific regulations.\nBefore the effective date of the regulations, appellants filed a petition for review in the Commonwealth Court, alleging that appellees lacked statutory authority to promulgate the challenged rules and regulations. On appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the Commonwealth Court sustained the regulations and denied appellants relief. This appeal followed.\nII\nSection 902 of the Public Welfare Code expressly provides that the department shall have \u201csupervision\u201d over a number of facilities, including, under subsection (8), \u201c[a]ll institutions for adults within this Commonwealth.\u201d Appellants concede, as they must, that \u201cgeneral and special hospitals\u201d \u201care institutions for adults.\u201d They dispute, however, the scope of appellees\u2019 power of \u201csupervision.\u201d Appellants claim they possess \u201cmanagerial prerogatives\u201d which may not be regulated by appellees.\nThe Public Welfare Code does not define the department\u2019s \u201csupervisory powers\u201d under section 902. Nevertheless, our review of the Code must recognize that \u201c[substantive rule-making is a widely used administrative practice, and its use should be upheld whenever the statutory delegation can reasonably be construed to authorize it.\u201d Bernard Schwartz, Administrative Law \u00a7 56 at p. 151 (1976). As Dean Freedman points out, \u201c[t]he existence of a body of standards tends to encourage greater deliberations, self-consciousness, and consistency in the exercise of administrative discretions and thereby reduces the likelihood that an agency will act arbitrarily.\u201d James 0. Freedman, Crisis and Legitimacy: The Administrative Process and American Government 245 (1978). We are satisfied that, reasonably construed, the Public Welfare Code demonstrates that the Legislature fully intended to permit the department (A) to supervise hospitals\u2019 managerial practices and (B) to do so through promulgation of rules and regulations.\nA\nNowhere in article IX of the Code. is \u201cmanagerial prerogative\u201d reserved. Compare Public Employe Relations Act, Act of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, \u00a7 702, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.702 (Supp.1979) (\u201c[p]ublic employers shall not be required to bargain over matters of inherent managerial policy\u201d). Rather, hospital administration is expressly within the purview of existing departmental regulatory obligations. Surely it cannot seriously be disputed that proper, uniform managerial practices promote the quality and efficiency of the delivery of health care services to individual consumers requiring health care. It is precisely this goal which the Legislature requires the department to achieve. Section 921(c) of the Code, fully applicable to hospitals, expressly directs the department to set \u201cstandards for the safe and adequate care of individuals,\u201d making \u201cadequate and proper provision[] for . (x) humane care.\u201d\nThat managerial practices of hospitals are within the legislatively-defined competency of the department under section 921 is demonstrated by an analogous provision of article IX. Section 911 of the Code expressly contemplates the department\u2019s review of the managerial practices of \u201csupervised institutions.\u201d Under section 911(a)(2), the Legislature places \u201call and every matter and thing\u201d relating to the \u201cusefulness, administration, and management\u201d of \u201csupervised institutions,\u201d and \u201cto the welfare of the inmates thereof . . . ,\u201d within the department\u2019s mandatory obligation of \u201cinquir[y] and examin[ation.]\u201d Indeed, \u201csupervised institutions,\u201d by definition, expressly includes \u201call hospitals, almshouses, or poor houses, maintained by any county, city, borough, township or poor district of this Commonwealth.\u201d We are convinced, therefore, that the Legislature has given the tribunal with experience and expertise over managerial practices of \u201csupervised institutions\u201d similar authority to supervise the managerial practices of hospitals subject to departmental standards under section 921.\nB\nWe are also satisfied that section 902 of the Code authorizes the department to supervise managerial practices of hospitals through promulgation of \u201crules and regulations.\u201d No provision of article IX expressly confers authority upon the department to establish \u201crules and regulations\u201d governing hospitals. Rather, under section 921(c), the department is required to establish \u201cstandards.\u201d Nonetheless, in discussing the appropriate means of enforcing these mandatory \u201cstandards,\u201d the Legislature clearly contemplates departmental \u201crules and regulations\u201d affecting hospitals. Section 921(e) provides:\n\u201cWhenever the department shall upon inspection, investigation or complaint find any violation in any institution of rules or regulations adopted by the department, or any failure to establish, provide or maintain standards and facilities required by this act or by the department, it shall give immediate written notice thereof, to the officer or officers charged by law with or in any way having or exercising the control, government or management of such institution, to correct the said objectionable condition in the manner and within the time specified by the department; whereupon, it shall be the duty of such officer or officers to comply with the direction of the department. If such officer or officers fail to comply with such direction, the department may request the Department of Justice to institute appropriate legal proceedings to enforce compliance therewith, and the department may withhold any State money available for such institution until such officer or officers comply with such direction.\u201d (emphasis added)\nSection 921(e) could contemplate \u201crules and regulations adopted by the department\u201d only if some other provision of the Code grants the department authority. It must be remembered that \u201c[ejvery statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). To \u201cgive effect\u201d both to the department\u2019s supervisory power under section 902 and the language \u201crules and regulations\u201d found in section 921(e), it must be concluded that the department is empowered, under its power of \u201csupervision,\u201d to formulate \u201crules and regulations.\u201d\nIll\nFor all the above reasons, none of the regulations appellants have challenged, including those affecting governance, establishing a \u201cPatient\u2019s Bill of Rights,\u201d and setting appropriate considerations for admissions,' can realistically be viewed as beyond the reach of departmental authority conferred under section 902. Accordingly, we hold that the Legislature has authorized the department to promulgate its rules and regulations concerning hospitals. We therefore affirm the decree of the Commonwealth Court denying appellants injunctive relief.\nDecree affirmed. Each party pays own costs.\nFLAHERTY, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which LARSEN, J., joins.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\n.

The Commonwealth Court granted the preliminary injunction, but later dissolved it upon granting appellees summary judgment.\n. This Court granted appellants a stay pending appeal. In view of our disposition, this stay, of course, is vacated.\n. Section 902 provides:\n\u201cSupervisory powers\nThe department shall have supervision over:\n(1) All State institutions;\n(2) All supervised institutions;\n(3) All children\u2019s institutions within this Commonwealth;\n(4) All maternity homes and hospitals within this Commonwealth;\n(5) Any labor or system of labor carried on in the penal, correctional or reformatory institutions of the State;\n(6) Any system of reparation provided by the Commonwealth for relief from conditions caused by mine-caves, fire, flood, or other casualty, and constituting a menace to public safety and welfare;\n(7) All boarding homes for children which have been licensed by the State;\n(8) All institutions for adults within this Commonwealth.\u201d\nThe \u201cdepartment\u201d refers to the Department of Public Welfare. See Public Welfare Code of 1967, \u00a7 102 (definitions). By \u201cReorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973,\u201d P.L. 457, 71 P.S. \u00a7 755-2 (Supp.1979), the Legislature transferred to the Department of Health the \u201cfunctions, powers and duties of the Department of Public Welfare with regard to the supervision and licensing of general and special hospitals, as set forth in Articles 9 and 10 of [\u2018The Public Welfare Code.\u2019]\u201d\n. See \u201cAppendix \u2018B\u2019 to Brief for Appellants\u201d at \u201cB-33.\u201d Section 901 of the Public Welfare Code of 1967 defines an \u201cinstitution for adults\u201d as follows:\n\u201c \u2018Institution for Adults\u2019 means any incorporated or unincorporated public or private organization, society or association including any agency of a county, county institution district or municipality which provides for food, shelter and some service to adults, or which provides rehabilitation, training, guidance or counselling to the blind or visually handicapped, or to the physically or mentally handicapped, including but limited to the following: homes for the aged and infirm, nursing homes, convalescent homes, placement agencies for adults, general and special hospitals and institutions for mentally ill and defective adults, rehabilitation centers having living-in arrangements, workshops and facilities for the rehabilitation of the visually, mentally or physically handicapped, and all organizations for the prevention of blindness.\u201d\nSee also supra note 6 (quoting \u201cReorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973\u201d).\n. See Public Welfare Code, \u00a7 921(b) (\u201chospitals\u201d expressly enumerated as \u201cinstitutions\u201d subject to departmental standards).\n. Section 911(a)(2) requires the department:\n\u201cTo visit and inspect, at least once in each year, all state and supervised institutions; to inquire and examine into their methods of instruction, discipline, detention, care or treatment, the care, treatment, government or management of their inmates or those committed thereto, or being detained, treated or residing therein, the official conduct of their inspectors, trustees, managers, directors or other officer or officers charged with their management by law or otherwise, or having the management, care, custody or control thereof, the buildings, grounds, premises, and equipment thereof, or connected therewith, and all and every matter and thing relating to their usefulness, administration, and management, and to the welfare of the inmates thereof, or those committed thereto or being detained, treated or residing therein.\u201d\n. One other consideration, overlooked by appellants, confirms our conclusion that appellees possess authority under sections 911 and 921 to regulate hospitals\u2019 managerial practices. Were appellants to prevail in their attack upon the challenged regulations, at least portions of appellees\u2019 \u201cRules and Regulations for Hospitals\u201d promulgated in 1966, including those relating to hospital governance and the like, would be vulnerable to similar criticism. The Legislature, however, in codifying the above provisions in the Public Welfare Code of 1967, made no effort to disturb appellees\u2019 1966 regulations. It is established that administrative interpretations, not disturbed by the Legislature, are appropriate guides to legislative intent. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(8). We think it a fair corollary that the Legislature\u2019s failure in 1967 in any respect to disturb appellees\u2019 exercise of rule-making authority in 1966 evinces legislative recognition of appellees\u2019 regulatory authority over \u201cmanagerial prerogative.\u201d\n. We do not pass upon the reasonableness of any particular regulation. We hold only that appellees possess statutory authority to promulgate the challenged regulations. Cf. Girard School District v. Pittenger, 481 Pa. 91, 392 A.2d 261 (1978) (upholding regulations of State Board of Education, but not reaching reasonableness of any particular regulation).",

        "text": "FLAHERTY, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI cannot sit idly by while the majority of my colleagues give an unwarranted license to a governmental agency to enact social legislation in the form of regulation without a semblance of authority to be found in the enabling legislation. A governmental regulation to be valid must gain its life from a clearly defined delegation of statutory origin. The obvious reason for this principle has its foundation in the nature of our concept of government. The law by which the people of our society are governed emanates from them, through their elected representatives in the legislative branch of government. The executive branch cannot make law, while the judiciary has the duty to determine whether any restrictions on human freedom are valid, and that includes the duty to determine whether regulations promulgated by an agency of the executive branch of government fall within the limits of authority delegated to that agency by legislation. When regulations go beyond the purpose of the enabling statute, or bear no rational relationship to the purpose of that legislation, they are of no force and effect and must be set aside.\nThe Public Welfare Code, \u00a7 921(c) provides:\nThe department shall establish standards for the safe and adequate care of individuals, not inconsistent with the laws of this Commonwealth and the rules and regulations of the various departments of the Commonwealth, for all such institutions within this Commonwealth, which standards shall make adequate and proper provisions for (i) fire protection, (ii) water supply and sewage disposal, (iii) sanitation, (iv) lighting and heating, (v) ventilation, (vi) safety, (vii) equipment, (viii) bed space, (ix) keeping of records of identification of residents in the institution and their next of kin, of medical care provided and all pertinent admission and discharge data, and (x) humane care.\nIt is not difficult to glean the clear meaning of this language. \u201cThe department shall establish standards for the safe and adequate care of individuals . . . which standards shall make adequate and proper provisions for . .\u201d The plain language provides for no other construction than a requirement for minimum standards in the enumerated areas. In \u00a7 902 of the Code there is a provision for the supervision over institutions for adults, and \u00a7 921(c) sets forth the subjects for that supervision. The majority opinion draws upon \u00a7\u00a7 902 and 911(a)(2) of the Code in an attempt to justify regulation of hospital management methods on the theory that the department must have been intended by the legislature to apply its management abilities, acquired in examining \u201csupervised institutions\u201d, to preempt and control hospital management generally under \u00a7 921(c). Such a far-reaching construction strains to grant this agency a power not expressly or impliedly delegated to it. In Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. St. Joe Minerals Corporation, 476 Pa. 302, 310, 382 A.2d 731, 735-736 (1978), this court repeated a longstanding principle:\nIn delimiting the scope of an administrative agency\u2019s power, we do not write on a blank slate, and the controlling principles are firmly established:\n\u201cThe principle guiding to decision is this: The power and authority to be exercised by administrative commissions must be conferred by legislative language clear and unmistakable. A doubtful power does not exist. Such tribunals are extrajudicial. They should act within the strict and exact limits defined.\u201d Green v. Milk Control Comm\u2019n, 340 Pa. 1, 3, 16 A.2d 9 (1940).\nThe regulations here challenged have no bearing on the statutory purpose of supervision of standards of care set forth in \u00a7 921(c), but rather represent a manifesto for a complete take over by government of management prerogatives in the operation of hospitals. Put another way, a socialization of private hospitals!\nWe have never held that the power to regulate is the power to manage, per se; quite to the contrary. In North Pennsylvania Power Company v. Public Utility Commission, 333 Pa. 265, 267-268, 5 A.2d 133, 134-135 (1939), where this Court held that the P.U.C. lacked power to prevent a certain utility merger, we said:\nThe Public Utility Commission is not a super board of directors for the public utility companies of the State and it has no right of management of them. Its sole power is to see that in the matter of rates, service and facilities, their treatment of the public is fair. Speaking through the present Chief Justice, we said: \u201cIt was not intended by the Legislature that the commission should be a board of managers to conduct and control the affairs of public service companies; but it was meant that, where certain of their powers and obligations had intimate relation to the public through. fairness, accommodation, or convenience, the commission should have an inquisitorial and corrective authority to regulate and control the utility in the field specifically brought- within the commission\u2019s jurisdiction. * * * The company manages its own affairs to the fullest extent consistent with the protection of the public\u2019s interest, and. only as to such matters is the commission authorized to intervene, and then only for the special purposes mentioned in the act.\u201d Coplay Cement Mfg. Co. v. Public Ser. Comm., 271 Pa. 58, 61, 114 A. 649, 16 A.L.R. 1214. \u201cIt must never be forgotten that, while the state may regulate with a view to enforcing reasonable rates and charges, it is not the owner of the property of public utility companies, and is not clothed with the general power of management incident of ownership.\u201d Southwestern Bell Tel. v. Public Ser. Comm., 262 U.S. 276, 289, 43 S.Ct. 544, 546, 67 L.Ed. 981, 31 A.L.R. 807. (emphasis added)\nNorth Pennsylvania Power Company was overruled in York v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, 449 Pa. 136, 295 A.2d 825 (1972) by a holding that the P.U.C. had specific statutory authority to review mergers. However, the North Pennsylvania Power view of noninterference in management was not disturbed. Thus, unless clear statutory authority is found for an agency to control management matters, it should not be implied.\nA web of more than five hundred \u201cregulations\u201d has been promulgated by appellees\u2019 rules which include controls on hospital organization, patients\u2019 dealings with administrators, admissions standards, fiscal controls, medical and social services to be provided, and management methods to be used in meeting care standards. Far from simply assuring supervision of minimum quality standards of health care, the obvious legislative purpose, the rules put the department in a self-appointed position as creator and manager of a socialized integrated health care system, and constitute an enactment or sweeping \u201csocial legislation\u201d in the guise of an executive regulation, completely bypassing and usurping the functions of the General Assembly. The executive branch of government must not be permitted to adopt such schemes without clear legislative action, as such systems are to be adopted by the will of the people, expressed through legislators \u2014 not through executive regulators. For this reason, scrutiny of the department\u2019s power is an important obligation of this Court.\nAn understanding of the great hazard created by the holding of the majority becomes evident when considering the scope and detail of these regulations. Hospitals are deprived of their right as private institutions to structure and govern their own organizations by rules which describe ownership, boards, bylaws contents (including a requirement of a Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights), duties of those who govern the institution (including a duty to devote resources to emotional and spiritual care for patients), the manner in which committees shall be run, and requirements for financial disclosure to the governing body. These far-reaching restrictions on private freedom in conducting business deserve close scrutiny for statutory authority \u2014 authority which is here totally lacking.\nIn addition, the rules require job descriptions, educational programs, rate schedules, insurance programs, and written purchasing policies.\n11, 12 and 13. See notes 11, 12 and 13 on p. 532.\nA most disturbing set of regulations controls a hospital\u2019s ability to determine which persons shall be admitted for care by limiting reasons for refusing admission.\nBy restricting the right of choice, the regulations force hospitals to assume responsibilities and potential liabilities far beyond those traditionally accorded them. Certainly, to allow such a novel change, not by statute, but by executive regulation which exceed the bounds of clear authority, is to set a most dangerous precedent.\nThe regulations also govern admission to medical staffs, medical staff committee memberships and duties, conduct of medical staff meetings, and continuing education requirements. Review is required of utilization of not only hospital facilities but even out-of-hospital services.\nGovernmental agencies must not be allowed to go unchecked in their natural tendency to continually create rules which stretch their authority, while invading more and more areas traditionally proper for private freedom of action.\nThe majority, it would appear, adopts the view that government can best run our hospitals. There are those who would disagree. In any event, a legislative enactment, not a \u201cregulation\u201d, should be necessary where there is a usurpation of heretofore private managerial prerogatives.\nI, therefore dissent.\nLARSEN, J., joins in the dissent.\n. Act of June 13, 1967, P.L. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 901 et seq., as amended, 62 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 901 et seq.
