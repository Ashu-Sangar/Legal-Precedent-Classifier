The prayer for mandamus relief was properly denied by the Commonwealth Court as there was no clear legal right to the certification requested, nor was there an absence of an adequate remedy at law. We adopt the opinion of the Commonwealth Court per the Honorable Roy Wilkinson, Jr., in the instant case. See also, Unger v. Hampton Township, 437 Pa. 399, 263 A.2d 385 (1970).\nThe Order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.",
