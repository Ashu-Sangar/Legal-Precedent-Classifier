        "text": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nThe court being equally divided, the Decree is affirmed.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nFLAHERTY, J., files an Opinion in Support of Affirmance in which O\u2019BRIEN and NIX, JJ., join.\nROBERTS, J., files an Opinion in Support of Reversal in which EAGEN, C. J., and LARSEN, J., join.\nLARSEN, J., files an additional Opinion in Support of Reversal.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF AFFIRMANCE\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from dismissal of a Petition for Citation by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, on August 8, 1977. The trial judge dismissed the petition on the ground that it was not typewritten or printed and thus, did not conform to Philadelphia Orphans\u2019 Court Rule 34.1 (hereinafter Rule 34.1). We affirm.\nThe relevant facts are as follows. Upon the demise of Joseph T. Lachmuth, appellant, Ethel M. Bryant, was granted Letters of Administration, C.T.A. by the Register of Wills of Philadelphia. Appellant subsequently filed a Petition for Citation, which is the subject of this appeal. As stated in appellant\u2019s brief, \u201ca Petition for Citation was prepared by typing on paper. This was edited and revised and the final product produced by xerox process, executed and filed.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Brief p. 6). The trial judge afforded appellant the opportunity to correct the error by advising her that the \u201coriginal\u201d Petition must be filed as opposed to a \u201ccopy\u201d. Appellant states that she was unable to comply with the judge\u2019s request because her \u201coriginal\u201d was in fact the xerox copy which she had executed and filed. The trial judge thereupon dismissed the petition sua sponte for its failure to conform to Rule 34.1.\nRule 34.1 provides, in relevant part, as follows:\nForm. Additional Requirements.\n(a) Typing. Endorsement; Every pleading shall be typewritten, double-spaced, or printed and shall be endorsed with the name of counsel appearing in court.\n* * * * * *\nAppellant maintains that the Petition was in fact \u201ctypewritten or printed\u201d as required by Rule 34.1 and that the trial judge ordered dismissal of the petition because he has \u201can eccentric and peculiar dislike\u201d for xerox copies.\nWhether the trial judge has an eccentric and peculiar dislike for xerox copies is of no concern here, for we applaud his insistence upon receiving the original petition. There is no reason why appellant was unable to submit the original rather than a xerox copy of her petition. Such a requirement in no way burdens appellant. Indeed, appellant states in her brief that an original was prepared \u201cby typing on paper\u201d but fails to explain why this document, rather than a xerox copy, was not filed. Rule 34.1, in specifying a \u201ctypewritten or printed\u201d copy must be read to require the original petition as opposed to a copy thereof. To allow a party to dispense with the formality of presenting the court with the original pleading is an insult to the dignity of the court itself. By holding as we do today, we are making an effort to preserve that dignity.\nO\u2019BRIEN and NIX, JJ., join in this opinion.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF REVERSAL\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant\u2019s petition was dismissed by the Philadelphia Orphans\u2019 Court on the astonishingly hypertechnical ground that a \u201ccopy\u201d was filed instead of the \u201coriginal.\u201d Equally astonishing, there is not a majority of this Court to reverse so hypertechnical a disposition. It is not clear from Philadelphia Orphans\u2019 Court Rule 34.1 whether an \u201coriginal\u201d is required, or what constitutes an \u201coriginal.\u201d In any case, this disposition is unnecessarily harsh and inconsistent with the Pennsylvania Orphans\u2019 Court Rules of Construction.\nPennsylvania Orphans\u2019 Court Rule 1 provides that local orphans\u2019 court rules regulating practice and procedure:\n\u201cshall not be inconsistent with any rule adopted by the Supreme Court of this Commonwealth or any Act of Assembly regulating the practice and procedure in the Orphans\u2019 Courts of this Commonwealth.\u201d\nPennsylvania Orphans\u2019 Court Rule 2.1 provides that the rules adopted by the orphans\u2019 court:\n\u201cshall be liberally construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action or proceeding to which they are applicable. The court at every stage of any action or proceeding may disregard any error or defect of procedure which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties in interest.\u201d\nIt must be obvious that the construction of Rule 34.1 adopted by the Opinion in Support of Affirmance is inconsistent with the directive of Pennsylvania Rule 2.1 to construe rules liberally. The submission of an executed xerox copy clearly did not \u201caffect the substantial rights of the parties in interest\u201d and the \u201cjust, speedy and inexpensive determination\u201d of the action would have been prompted by acceptance of appellant\u2019s petition. I would therefore vacate the order of the orphans\u2019 court and allow appellant to proceed with her petition.\nEAGEN, C. J., joins this opinion.\nLARSEN, J., joins this opinion and files a separate opinion in support of reversal.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF REVERSAL\nLARSEN, Justice.\nI join in Mr. Justice Roberts\u2019 Opinion in Support of Reversal. The Opinion in Support of Affirmance is the ultimate in form over substance, promulgated for the sole purpose of judicial ego-aggrandizement. Judicially created ego-titillation reflects poorly on the judiciary.\n. Jurisdiction of this appeal is vested in this Court by the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, Art. II, \u00a7 202(3), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(3), (current version at 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 722(3)).\n. We were not benefitted by argument of counsel in this case; nor do we have the benefit of a brief by appellee. Thus, our only point of reference is appellant\u2019s brief.\n. Appellant cites Commonwealth v. Olitsky, 184 Pa.Super. 144, 133 A.2d 238 (1957) to support her position. This case, however, is inapposite to the issue at hand. Olitsky deals with the best evidence rule and the admissibility of carbon copies and other types of duplicate originals as evidence. We are not here concerned with the admissibility of evidence.",
