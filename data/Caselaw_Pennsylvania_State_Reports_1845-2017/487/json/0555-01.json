Post-verdict motions were denied and this appeal followed.\nAppellant contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his murder of the first degree conviction. We have made an independent study of the record and have found that there was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s murder of the first degree conviction.\nAppellant also contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his possessing instruments of crime conviction. This issue was not raised in post-verdict motions and, therefore, it was waived. Commonwealth v. Blair, 460 Pa. 31, 331 A.2d 213 (1975).\nJudgments of sentence affirmed.",
