        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nThis is an appeal by the natural mother from the final decree entered in the Court of Common Pleas of McKean County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, ordering the involuntary termination of her parental rights in her minor child, H.E.W. Following entry of the decree nisi, appellant filed an exception, which was denied. The court entered a final decree terminating the parental rights of appellant and this appeal followed.\nThe facts are as follows. Appellant, Sandra Barber Williams, married Larry Shafer Williams on April 3, 1968. A child, H.E.W., was born to the couple on October 6, 1968. In October of 1973, while residing in Rochester, New York, appellant and her husband entered into a separation agreement, under the terms of which appellant was to retain custody of H.E.W. However, on November 3, 1973, at the request of appellant, the father, Larry Williams, took custody of the child. On April 13, 1974, Larry Williams died. Appellee Claudia Thoma is the sister of Larry Williams, and upon the death of her brother, and with the consent of appellant, the Thomas returned with H.E.W. to their home in Bradford, Pennsylvania, and retained custody of her there.\nOn October 31, 1974, the Thomas filed a petition for involuntary termination of parental rights in the Court of Common Pleas, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, of McKean County. The petition set out as grounds in support that appellant, since April 13, 1974 (the date of Larry Williams\u2019 death) \u201chas evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing her parental claim to [the] child and has refused and failed to perform her parental duties.\u201d A decree was entered by the trial court scheduling a hearing on the petition for November 26, 1974. On November 4, 1974, appellant, still residing in New York, was served by mail with a copy of the petition and decree.\nOn November 11, 1974, appellant went to Bradford, Pennsylvania, removed H.E.W. from school, and returned with her to New York. On November 26, 1974, the hearing on the Thomas\u2019 petition was held and a decree entered terminating appellant\u2019s parental rights and decreeing that she return the child to Mr. and Mrs. Thoma. Appellant neither appeared at the hearing nor was she represented by counsel. On January 14, 1975, the Thomas went to New York, removed H.E.W. from school, and returned with her to Bradford, Pennsylvania.\nOn January 16, 1975, Mr. and Mrs. Thoma filed a petition for adoption of H.E.W., and the court entered a decree scheduling the adoption hearing for January 21, 1975.\nOn February 4, 1975, appellant filed a \u201cpetition to open and vacate judgment,\u201d and on March 12, 1976, following a hearing, the court entered a decree which \u201copened and vacated\u201d its November 26, 1974, decree and which directed that appellant be given an opportunity to present testimony to establish why her parental rights should not be terminated. On July 22, 1976, a new hearing was held on the Thomas\u2019 petition at which appellant appeared, was represented, and testified. On May 26, 1977, the court entered a decree terminating appellant\u2019s parental rights in H.E.W. In its opinion in support of its decree the Orphans\u2019 Court noted that on the facts of the case it \u201cwould not hold that there had been an abandonment and would return the child to the mother,\u201d but held that appellant\u2019s \u201cpetition to open and vacate\u201d was in the nature of an appeal, was untimely filed, and hence was without effect as a challenge to the propriety of the Nov\u00e9mber 26, 1974 decree.\nAppellant now advances two arguments: first, that the decree which \u201copened and vacated\u201d the original decree rendered that first decree a nullity and deprived the Orphans' Court of power to reinstate it; second, that the ruling that appellant\u2019s \u201cpetition to open and vacate\u201d was untimely filed represented a clear abuse of discretion. Appellee, on the other hand, argues these issues have not been properly preserved for appellate review.\nCertainly there is support in the record of the instant case for a conclusion that appellant has waived her claims of error. On advice of her New York counsel, appellant failed to appear at the original November 26, 1974, hearing. Fol-\nlowing the entry of the decree pursuant to that hearing, and again apparently upon counsel\u2019s recommendation, appellant permitted the time for the filing of exceptions and the taking of an appeal to expire without doing either. Subsequently, by her new Pennsylvania counsel, she filed a \u201cpetition to open and vacate,\u201d despite the fact that these are contradictory remedies urging distinct defects in the proceedings. See In re Estate of McCauley, 478 Pa. 83, 385 A.2d 1324 (1978). Finally, upon entry of the second (May 26, 1977) decree, appellant entered merely a general exception asserting neither of the claims of error which she advances here. In this procedural setting, we could find appellant has waived those claims.\nIt is of course true that our scope of review in involuntary termination of parental rights cases is narrowly circumscribed: was the decree supported by competent evidence. See, e. g., In re: William L., 477 Pa. 322, 383 A.2d 1228 (1978). It is also true that \u201cthis Court has frequently acknowledged the severity of the emotional impact which attends a court decree terminating against the wishes of a natural father or mother, his or her parental rights in a child.\u201d In re Howard, 468 Pa. 71, 75, 76, 360 A.2d 184, 186 (1976). \u201cBefore parental rights may be involuntarily terminated, the proponent of the termination must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the demanding requirements of \u00a7 311 [of the Act] are present.\u201d Id.\nCentral to our role, then, as a reviewing court, is a finding by the court of first instance that the \u201cdemanding requirements\u201d of the act have been met. It is this finding which we, within narrow circumscription, review.\nThe Act provides, in pertinent part, that:\n\u201cThe rights of a parent in regard to a child may be terminated after a petition filed . . . and a hearing held . . . , on the ground that:\n\u201c(1) The parent by conduct continuing for a period of at least six months either has evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim to a child, or has refused or failed to perform parental duties . . . \u201d.\nThe only finding of fact made in the instant case is that made, properly, by the Orphans\u2019 Court. That court held that on the facts it \u201cwould not hold that there had been an abandonment and would return the child to the mother.\u201d Indeed, our review of the record convinces us that a contrary finding would have been unsupported by the evidence. Notwithstanding the court\u2019s finding of fact, as a result of procedural errors by appellant a decree was nevertheless entered terminating her parental rights.\nBoth our rules, Pa.R.A.P. 105(a), and the Rules of Civil Procedure, Pa.R.C.P. 126, provide for the liberal construction and application of rules. Rule 105 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure authorizes the waiver and modification of rules \u201cto secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every matter to which they are applicable.\u201d Pa.R.A.P. 105(a). Although it may be that we should not blithely undertake to waive our rules, it is difficult to imagine a case where \u201cthe just . . . determination of [the] matter\u201d more urgently begs for such waiver.\nThe only factual determination made, or which could have been made, on the merits of this case is one which holds appellant should not be deprived of her rights to her child. To nevertheless decree otherwise is anomalous. We refuse to undertake, in this unusual case, to permit injustice to be done in the name of form.\nThe decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court is vacated. The case is remanded to the Orphans\u2019 Court to proceed ab initio on appellees\u2019 petition to terminate parental rights. The parties there, if they so choose, may proceed in conformity with Rules 1518-1519, Pa.R.C.P.\nEach party to pay own costs.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nROBERTS, J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. There is nothing in the record before us to indicate whether the adoption hearing so ordered was ever held.\n. It is of course true that a party may seek alternative remedies, as in filing a petition to open or vacate.\n. Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, No. 208, art. Ill, \u00a7 311, 1 P.S. \u00a7 311 (Supp.1979).",

        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice,\ndissenting.\nOn November 26, 1974, the Court of Common Pleas of McKean County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division ordered the involuntary termination of the parental rights of appellant Sandra B. Williams over H.E.W. Although appellant was notified of the proceedings and the resulting decree, she failed to appear at the hearing, and did not file timely exceptions or a timely appeal. The majority holds that this final decree of termination may now be opened by appellant. I must dissent.\nIt is well established that a natural parent may not open a final decree of termination unless the natural parent\u2019s failure to oppose termination resulted from excusable neglect. In re Adoption of R. H., 485 Pa. 157, 401 A.2d 341 (1979); see Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 115 (Tentative Draft No. 6, February 10, 1979). This requirement is especially important when, as here, prospective parents have already petitioned to adopt. In re Adoption of R. H., supra. Such a requirement is not based, as might be inferred from the majority opinion, upon blind compliance with procedural rules. Rather,\n\u201c[prospective parents who have . . . initiated petitions to adopt, after natural parents have failed to appeal decrees of termination, are fully justified in relying upon the finality of the d\u00e9crees. Upon entry of a final decree of termination, the prospective parent \u2018shall stand in loco parentis to the child and in such capacity shall have the authority, inter alia, to consent to marriage, to enlistment in the armed forces and to major medical, psychiatric and surgical treatment, and to exercise such other authority concerning the child as a natural parent could exercise.\u2019 Adoption Act of 1970, \u00a7 321.\u201d\nIn re Adoption of R. H., 485 Pa. at 161-62, 401 A.2d at 344; see Chambers Appeal, 452 Pa. 149, 154, 305 A.2d 360, 363 (1973) (\u201c[I]t would be cruel and unfair to subject the prospective adopting parents to the risk of a change of mind by the natural parents. . . . with resulting heartbreaks to several persons and possible harm to the child.\u2019 \u201d) (quotation omitted).\nAppellant alleges that she failed to oppose the petition for involuntary termination at the appropriate time because both she and her attorney believed that Pennsylvania courts lacked jurisdiction over her while she and H.E.W. were in New York. Such allegations are obviously an impermissible justification for her failure to appear at the termination proceeding. To permit appellant to open a final decree of termination on this basis would severely undermine the notion of final decrees in an area where \u201cfinality\u201d is of such fundamental importance. Accordingly, I would affirm the final decree of the orphans\u2019 court reinstating its previous decree of final termination.\nThe orphans\u2019 court found that H.E.W. was in New York only because appellant came to Pennsylvania and \u201cforcibly took custody of the youngster while on her way home from school\u201d in violation of the orphans\u2019 court custody order.",
