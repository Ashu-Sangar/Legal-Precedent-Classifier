        "text": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nThis is an appeal of appellant Aida E. Feliciano Tirado\u2019s criminal contempt conviction.\nThis conviction arose as follows: On June 13, 1977, a jury was sworn in the trial of Julio Ortiz Tirado, appellant\u2019s husband, who was charged with recklessly endangering another person, aggravated assault, and simple assault in connection with the beating of their 2/2-year old child. After the Commonwealth presented its opening argument, the jury was recessed and the court met with the prosecutor and counsel for appellant\u2019s husband. At this meeting, the court allowed the Commonwealth to summon appellant (a Commonwealth witness) in order to \u201cinquire ... of her [appellant\u2019s] intentions with respect to testifying and competency\u201d. Appellant was sworn and testified as follows (in pertinent part):\nBY MR. WELZ [PROSECUTOR]\nQ . [Y]ou were served with a subpoena to appear in court in connection with this case; is that correct?\nBY MRS. TIRADO [APPELLANT] A Yes.\nQ And did you consult with me prior to selecting the jury this afternoon?\nA Yes.\nQ Did you indicate to me that you were not willing to testify in this case?\nA Yes.\nQ Now, did you give a statement to Officer Leon Krammes of the Bureau of Reading Police?\nA I don\u2019t remember.\nQ Reading Bureau of Police; do you remember giving a statement with regard to this incident at all?\nA This incident?\nQ Yes.\nA Yes.\nQ Do you remember discussing this matter with the police?\nA I discussed it, but I don\u2019t remember it, exactly the words I said in that.\nQ Okay. Were you present at this time when Mr. Tirado entered the house and assaulted the young boy?\nA I don\u2019t remember.\nBY THE COURT:\nQ Mrs. Tirado, the law says that under normal circumstances, or usually, a husband and wife do not have to testify against one another.\nA Yes, I understand that.\nQ But in cases where violence is done or threatened to be done to the person of either of them, or of their children, or children in their custody, they are competent, and can be called to testify. I would tell you that as I understand the nature of the questions to be asked of you, that you would be competent to testify, and that if you refused to testify, you would be considered in contempt of court, and would be so held in contempt, and in the exercise of my judgment, I could have you imprisoned for a term of not longer than six months. Do you understand that?\nA Yes, I understand.\nQ Now, knowing this, would you be willing to testify?\nA I exactly don\u2019t remember what happened. One reason was, I was drinking, and I don\u2019t exactly remember.\nQ Well, do you remember anything about the incident involving your child, Julio Mirado, age approximately two and a half years? You know the child we are referring to?\nA Yes.\nQ And this incident occurred on or about January 7th of this year. Do you remember the time? Do you remember anything about the incident?\nA I don\u2019t know. The only thing I remember was, this was Christmas for Puerto Ricans and I was drinking.\nQ Were you completely intoxicated?\nA I was drinking since early noon with my husband, then he went to see his parents.\nQ To see his parents, is that it?\nA Yes.\nQ Do you remember when he came back to your house?\nA No, I was sleeping when he came in the house.\nQ Did you see anything of this\u2014\nA I was in the bathroom. I woke up dozey and I went into the bathroom.\nQ Did you see him there with the child?\nA I went into the kitchen. I didn\u2019t see anything. Q You didn\u2019t see anything.\nA No.\nQ What about the \u2014 will you show her the statement? Is it a signed statement by her?\nMR. WELZ [PROSECUTOR] Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Show it to her.\nBY THE COURT:\nQ Do you remember giving this statement and signing it?\nA He slapped me?\nQ I don\u2019t know. Just read it.\nA I don\u2019t remember. I was drunk.\nQ Is that your signature to it?\nA Yes.\nQ But you don\u2019t remember telling these things to the officer?\nA I was so drunk, I don\u2019t remember. The only thing I remember was when I called him at his mother\u2019s place. Q Was that before or after this incident?\nA After I was home.\nQ Do you remember anything about this matter at all?\nA No. I don\u2019t, no.\nQ Do you remember signing this paper here?\nA It\u2019s my signature, but I don\u2019t remember signing it.\nQ But it is your signature?\nA Yes, it is.\nQ How long have you been married?\nA February 28th.\nQ That was after the time of this alleged incident?\nA Yes.\nQ You are living with your husband now?\nA Yes.\nQ How are you getting along together?\nA Fine. [Emphasis provided]\nAfter this examination, the court told appellant that \u201cthe Commonwealth believes that you have not told the truth when you told me that you did not remember anything of what went on . concerning the case here in court\u201d and that if the Commonwealth proves this, \u201cthen you would be in contempt of court\u201d. An attorney was provided for appellant and a contempt proceeding was scheduled for the next day.\nAt the start of said contempt proceeding, appellant was examined and she reiterated the testimony that she gave on the previous day:\nTHE COURT: .... Mrs. Tirado, did you understand yesterday, and do you still understand that I would like you to testify as to the matters contained in this statement that you signed and that you read yesterday? I believe it is Exhibit 1. Do you understand I want you to testify about that?\nTHE WITNESS [APPELLANT]: Well, I don\u2019t remember what I \u2014 what\u2019s\u2014I read what\u2019s in it, but I don\u2019t remember what\u2014\nTHE COURT: I understand, but you understand that I wanted you to testify about that?\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, I understand.\nTHE COURT: And you say you don\u2019t remember?\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\nTHE COURT: All right.\n\u2021 \u2021 4c \u2021 * \u2021\n[APPELLANT\u2019S DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Will you be willing to testify concerning the statement?\nTHE WITNESS: I am willing to testify, but \u2014 as to what I remember, but not to what\u2019s in there, because I actually don\u2019t remember any of it.\nTHE COURT: All right. [Emphasis provided]\nThe next witness at the contempt proceeding was Reading Police Officer Norman E. Focht, who testified that shortly after the child\u2019s beating, appellant gave him a signed statement. In this statement, appellant said that she observed her husband slap their child, hit the child\u2019s head on the inside of the bathtub, and \u201cturn . . . the water on [in the bathtub] and hold the . . . [child\u2019s] head under the water.\u201d (This is the signed statement referred to during appellant\u2019s examinations, supra.) Officer Focht testified that when appellant gave him the aforementioned statement, she was not under the influence of intoxicating beverages.\nOfficer Focht\u2019s testimony was corroborated by Reading Police Officer Leon C. Krammes, Jr., who testified that he was present when appellant gave the aforementioned statement to Officer Focht and that, at the time of the statement, appellant was not under the influence of intoxicating beverages. Further, Reading Police Detective James Hullinger testified that within four days of the beating, appellant told him (during an interview) \u201cessentially the same story . as . was given [by appellant] to the original investigating officers [Focht and Krammes]\u201d regarding the child\u2019s beating.\nAdditionally, Assistant District Attorney Stephen G. Welz (the attorney assigned to prosecute appellant\u2019s husband) testified at the contempt proceeding that prior to the trial of appellant\u2019s husband, appellant told him (Welz) that her husband \u201chit\u201d the child. Welz also testified that appellant told him (Welz) that she was not willing to testify at her husband\u2019s trial and that she wanted the charges against her husband dropped.\nAt the conclusion of the contempt proceeding, the court found appellant to be in contempt of court and sentenced her to a four-month imprisonment, a $100 fine, and the costs of prosecution. The Commonwealth then informed the court that it had \u201cno other testimony\u201d to present in the case of appellant\u2019s husband; counsel for appellant\u2019s husband moved for dismissal of the charges proferred against his client and the court dismissed said charges \u201cfor want of evidence.\u201d\nAppellant then appealed her contempt conviction to this Court.\nAppellant\u2019s first contention is that there was insufficient evidence to support her contempt conviction. The Act of June 16, 1836, P.L. 784, \u00a7 23, 17 P.S. \u00a7 2041 (1962) provided:\nThe power of the several courts of this commonwealth to issue attachments and to inflict summary punishments for contempts of court shall be restricted to the following cases, to-wit:\nI. To the official misconduct of the officers of such courts respectively;\nII. To disobedience or neglect by officers, parties, jurors or witnesses of or to the lawful process of the court;\nIII. To the misbehavior of any person in the presence of the court, thereby obstructing the administration of justice. [Emphasis provided]\nIn the past, this Court has held that a witness\u2019 refusal to testify is grounds for contempt. Commonwealth v. Stickler, 481 Pa. 579, 393 A.2d 313 (1978); Commonwealth v. Crawford, 466 Pa. 269, 273 n.7, 352 A.2d 52, 54 n.7 (1976); In re Martorano, 464 Pa. 66, 346 A.2d 22 (1975). In the instant case, appellant\u2019s testimony was so evasive that it, in fact, amounted to a refusal to testify. Even after the court informed appellant that her testimony (or lack thereof) was contemptuous, she persisted in answering the propounded questions with the reply that she did not \u201cremember\u201d.\nIn fact, the evidence brought forth at the contempt proceeding contradicts appellant\u2019s testimony. Appellant\u2019s testimony that she did not \u201cremember\u201d the incident was contradicted by two witnesses, both of whom testified that prior to trial, appellant stated that she saw her husband beat the child. Appellant\u2019s testimony that she did not remember giving the aforementioned signed statement to police because she was intoxicated was contradicted by the two police officers who elicited the statement, both of whom testified that she was not intoxicated when the statement was given. Furthermore, at the conference (attended by the judge, the prosecutor, and counsel for appellant\u2019s husband) held during the trial of appellant\u2019s husband, appellant admitted that prior to the selection of the jury for said trial, she told the prosecutor that she was not willing to testify at the trial.\nClearly, appellant\u2019s evasiveness as a witness \u2014 which resulted ultimately in the dismissal of the charges against her husband \u2014 warranted the exercise of the court\u2019s power to punish for contempt.\nAppellant claims that her testimony (or lack thereof) did not \u201cthwart the Commonwealth\u2019s case\u201d since the Commonwealth could have \u201ceasily . . . qualified\u201d appellant\u2019s signed statement as evidence against appellant\u2019s husband. This argument is without merit. There is no requirement that in order for a witness to be convicted of criminal contempt, he must completely \u201cthwart\u201d a case. Assuming for the sake of argument that there was other evidence that the Commonwealth could have presented against appellant\u2019s husband, there is no question that appellant\u2019s refusal to testify would have still constituted contempt.\nAdditionally, appellant argues that \u201c[although the lower court may have suspected . . . [appellant\u2019s] testimony to be perjurous, the Commonwealth never proved this to be so, and if it did, arguendo, perjury is an insufficient basis for a contempt finding.\u201d This claim is meritless \u2014 appellant\u2019s contempt conviction was not based on a finding that she committed perjury. As the lower court stated in its opinion, appellant \u201cargues that perjury was the basis of the contempt. Actually, refusal to testify is the basis.\u201d [Emphasis in original]\nAppellant\u2019s final contention is that the lower court \u201cviolated due process\u201d on the grounds that appellant was \u201cmade to testify without being represented by counsel\u201d. As support for this proposition, appellant cites this Court\u2019s opinion in Commonwealth v. Crawford, 466 Pa. 269, 352 A.2d 52 (1976). In Crawford, this Court reversed a witness\u2019 contempt conviction on the grounds that he was not represented by counsel during the summary contempt proceeding. The instant case is distinguishable from Crawford in that appellant was represented by counsel throughout the contempt proceeding.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nEAGEN, C. J., concurs in the result.\nROBERTS, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. This statute was reenacted effective June 27, 1978. See 42 Pa.C. S.A. 4131 (1979 Pamphlet).\n. Appellant also argues that she \u201cwas never called to testify before a jury or in any proceeding other than her own contempt hearing . . [and that this] precludes any finding of contemptuous conduct.\u201d This claim is spurious since, in fact, appellant was summoned to testify at the conference (attended by the judge, the prosecutor, and counsel for appellant\u2019s husband) held during the trial of appellant\u2019s husband.",

        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice,\ndissenting.\nAppellant Aida E. Feliciano Tirado was convicted of criminal contempt and sentenced to four months in prison, as well as ordered to pay a $100 fine and costs of prosecution. Appellant now challenges judgment of sentence on direct appeal.\nThe record demonstrates that the court imposed sentence without due consideration for this Commonwealth\u2019s statutory sentencing guidelines. See Sentencing Code, Act of December 30, 1974, P.L. 1052, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq., as amended, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1301 et seq. (Supp. 1979-80). The sentencing court did not comply with section 1325 which requires consideration of \u201cthe history, character, and condition of the defendant . . .\u201d before imposing \u201ctotal confinement.\u201d Nor did the court follow Section 1322\u2019s direction to \u201caccord weight in favor of an order of probation . . . \u201d to the twelve grounds enumerated in that section. Rather, the court restricted its sentencing consideration exclusively to the nature and circumstances of the crime:\n\u201cWith respect to the sentence imposed, it may be noted that the appellant was the only substantial Commonwealth witness and that as a result of her refusal to testify the serious charges against the defendant were required to be dismissed for want of evidence (N.T. 33).\u201d\nFrom this record, it must be concluded that the court failed to consider the statutory factors set forth in the \u201ctotal confinement\u201d and \u201cprobation\u201d sections of the Sentencing Code. This failure necessitates vacation of judgment of sentence and remand for resentencing in conformity with the Sentencing Code. See Commonwealth v. Martin, 466 Pa. 118, 351 A.2d 650 (1976) (sentencing court acted improperly in automatically imposing sentence based solely on the crime); see generally Commonwealth v. Kostka, 475 Pa. 85, 379 A.2d 884 (1977).",

I must disagree because I do not believe that there was a refusal to testify in this case. To the contrary, appellant was more than willing to testify as to her present recollection. The crux of the dispute in this case is that the Commonwealth and the trial court were satisfied that appellant was lying as to the extent of her present recollection.\nThe evidence produced at the contempt hearing clearly supported a finding that appellant was lying when she testified that she did not have a present recollection of the events described in her initial statement to the \u2022 police. While this may have been legally sufficient to prove perjury, there is some question whether a finding of perjury justifies a summary conviction for contempt. See e. g. Commonwealth v. Harris, 409 Pa. 163, 185 A.2d 586 (1962). This question was ignored by the majority. I dissent.",
