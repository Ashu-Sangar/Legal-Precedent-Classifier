        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nThis appeal is from an order of the Commonwealth Court sustaining preliminary objections of appellee, The State Employes\u2019 Retirement Board of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and dismissing a complaint in mandamus filed by appellant, Louis Packler.\nAppellant was a member of the Pennsylvania State Police from 1936 until his retirement in 1973. Prior to 1936, appellant had served four years with the Pennsylvania National Guard. In computing appellant\u2019s years of service for retirement purposes, the Retirement Board did not include appellant\u2019s four years of service with the Pennsylvania National Guard. Appellant filed a complaint in Commonwealth Court seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the Retirement Board to include those four years in calculating his years of service. Appellant based his claim on \u00a7 204 of the State Employes\u2019 Retirement Code of 1959, which provides:\n\u201c(1) In computing the length of service of a contributor for retirement purposes, a year of service shall mean a period of twelve (12) months during which a contributor is a State employe and for which he receives an annual salary or other compensation. .\n\u201c(2) Any person who became a member of the Pennsylvania Motor Police subsequent to January 1, 1938, or a member of the Pennsylvania State Police subsequent to June 1, 1943, and who shall have been at the time theretofore in the employ of the Commonwealth shall receive credit for any such service prior to January 1, 1938, or prior to June 1, 1943, as the case may be . .\u201d 71 P.S. \u00a7 1725-204.\nThe Retirement Board filed preliminary objections, including, inter alia, a demurrer to appellant\u2019s complaint. Following an answer by appellant to the preliminary objections, the Commonwealth Court sustained the Retirement Board\u2019s demurrer, holding that since appellant had joined the State Police prior to January 1, 1938, \u00a7 204(2) was inapplicable. Packler v. St. Employes\u2019 Ret. Bd., 15 Pa.Cmwlth. 143, 325 A.2d 335 (1974). On appeal to this court, we vacated the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order, holding that while that court\u2019s decision under \u00a7 204(2) was correct, it was improper to sustain the Retirement Board\u2019s demurrer without considering appellant\u2019s rights under \u00a7 204(1) and any other applicable sections of the Retirement Code. Packler v. State Emp. Retirement Bd., 470 Pa. 368, 368 A.2d 673 (1977). On remand, the Commonwealth Court again sustained the board\u2019s preliminary objections and dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint, finding an action in mandamus will not lie where appellant had failed to utilize or exhaust his administrative remedies. Packler v. State Employes\u2019 Ret. Bd., 33 Pa. Cmwlth. 452, 382 A.2d 158 (1978). This appeal followed.\nIn Valley F. Racing Ass'n v. St. H. Racing Comm., 449 Pa. 292, 295, 297 A.2d 823, 824 (1972), we stated:\n\u201cIt is axiomatic that mandamus is an extraordinary writ which lies to compel the performance of a ministerial act or a mandatory duty where there is a clearly legal right in the plaintiff, a corresponding duty in the defendant, and a want of any other appropriate and adequate remedy.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nAt the time appellant filed his complaint in mandamus, the Administrative Agency Law specifically provided that actions of the Retirement Board were subject to the provisions of the act. While appellant claims he attempted to invoke agency procedures, the record is barren of any indication he made such an attempt. Since appellant had failed to show he exhausted all available remedies before filing his complaint in mandamus, the complaint was properly dismissed.\nOrder affirmed.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. Act of June 1, 1959, P.L. 392, as amended, 71 P.S. \u00a7 1725-101, et seq.\n. Act of June 4, 1945, P.L. 1388, as amended, 71 P.S. \u00a7 1710.1, et seq., repealed 1978.",
