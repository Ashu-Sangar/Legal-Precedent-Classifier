The supervising court of such a grand jury has the initial authority to consider such a petition, see Section 6(c) of the Investigating Grand Jury Act, Act of November 22, 1978, P.L. 1148, 19 P.S. \u00a7 270 (Supp.1979-80); such petitions, presenting any challenge, should initially be presented to that court for consideration. We therefore transfer the petition to the supervising court.\nAccordingly, that portion of our order of November 26, 1979, directed to the members of the grand jury, individually and collectively, and those in charge thereof or assisting in any way in the conduct of any proceedings before the jury, is vacated.\nLARSEN, J., filed a dissenting statement in which FLAH-ERTY, J., joins.",

To transfer this matter as the majority wishes only prolongs these uncertainties. I would, therefore, decide all these issues now.\nFLAHERTY, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.",
