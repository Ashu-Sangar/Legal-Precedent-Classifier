        "text": "OPINION\nNIX, Justice.\nAppellant, Robert Robinson, was charged with murder, voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter, and carrying a concealed weapon arising out of the stabbing death of Ronald Townes in a Philadelphia bar in 1971. Following a trial before a court sitting without a jury on February 23, 1973, appellant was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Motions for a new trial and an arrest of judgment were filed by appellant and these motions were denied on December 17, 1973. Appellant was thereupon sentenced to serve a three to twelve year term of imprisonment.\nAppellant failed to take a direct appeal of his conviction. Subsequently, he filed a pro se Post Conviction Hearing Act petition on June 20, 1977. Counsel was appointed for appellant who then filed an amended PCHA petition on October 14, 1977. The PCHA court denied this petition on July 26, 1978 and appellant now seeks review of this adverse ruling.\nAppellant argues that he is entitled to a direct appeal nunc pro tunc because of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in properly perfecting the appeal and that trial counsel was also ineffective for failing to call a crucial witness at trial. Addressing first the assertion that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to perfect an appeal, it must be emphasized that this is not a claim of a denial of Douglas rights. See Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963); Commonwealth v. Wilson, 430 Pa. 1, 241 A.2d 760 (1968). The testimony clearly established that appellant was fully advised, on the record, of his right of appeal at sentencing. There is no claim that he did not understand these rights or that he at any point requested trial counsel to file an appeal. Moreover, although appellant testified during the PCHA hearing, his testimony was confined to the second issue raised in this appeal. At no point has appellant asserted that he expressed any desire to trial counsel to appeal his conviction and sentence, nor did he suggest any difficulty in communicating with counsel during the period in which an appeal would have been filed.\nThe legislature has mandated that, \u201cThere is a rebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal a ruling . . . is a knowing and understanding\u201d waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to appeal. 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-4(c). The courts of this Commonwealth have steadfastly adhered to this mandate. See e. g., Commonwealth v. LaSane, 479 Pa. 629, 633, 389 A.2d 48, 49 (1978); Commonwealth v. Jones, 477 Pa. 266, 269-70, 383 A.2d 926, 927-28 (1978); Commonwealth v. Lowers, 481 Pa. 534, 537-38, 393 A.2d 33, 35 (1978); Commonwealth v. Nero, 250 Pa.Super. 17, 22, 378 A.2d 430, 433 (1977); Commonwealth v. Eagle, 248 Pa.Super. 267, 375 A.2d 90 (1977); Commonwealth v. Phillips, 248 Pa.Super. 400, 375 A.2d 158 (1977). In this case no attempt has been made to overcome the presumption.\nThus the question must be framed as to whether trial counsel is ineffective for not perfecting an appeal where his client has waived the right of appeal? To state the question is to answer it. Appellant\u2019s sister, Mrs. Saunders, testified that she and other members of the family of appellant engaged trial counsel for appellant. She stated that trial counsel had promised the family that he would file an appeal on her brother\u2019s behalf. Even if we gave credence to her statements, which the hearing court did not, we fail to see how that testimony constitutes ineffective assistance in counsel\u2019s representation of his client, appellant. Once the client has knowingly and voluntarily waived an appeal, counsel\u2019s failure to file an appeal does not constitute ineffective assistance to the client even though his failure may be a breach of a promise to a third party.\nThe second allegation of ineffectiveness relates to trial counsel\u2019s failure to call Richard Purnell, appellant\u2019s brother-in-law, as a witness for the defense during the trial of the case. The PCHA hearing court found and the record supports a finding that, \u201cneither Mr. Purnell nor defendant\u2019s sister, who testified at the evidentiary hearing before us, nor the defendant himself, . . ., ever stated or intimated that defendant\u2019s trial counsel had been advised that there was an exculpatory eyewitness to the incident.\u201d See Commonwealth v. Abney, 465 Pa. 304, 350 A.2d 407 (1976); Commonwealth v. Owens, 454 Pa. 268, 312 A.2d 378 (1973).\n[H]ad appellant clearly established that he had communicated to his attorney the existence of the two witnesses and his attorney, without investigation, had failed to call them as witnesses, then such conduct, if not explained, would be a relevant circumstance in determining whether appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel. However, the record fails to establish that appellant\u2019s attorney was made aware of the possible alibi witnesses. Commonwealth v. Owens, supra, 454 Pa. at 272, 312 A.2d at 381.\nAppellant argues that the statement given by him to the police, which was furnished to counsel and introduced at trial, should have placed trial counsel on notice of Mr. Purnell\u2019s potential as a witness for the defense. Appellant relies upon that portion of the statement which indicates, \u201cI was talking to my brother-in-law, Richard Purnell. . Ronald Townes [the deceased] walked up to me and . . .\u201d However, as the learned court below found, this reference in no way suggests that the witness, Purnell, would necessarily be favorable to appellant\u2019s position.\nDuring the course of a trial, counsel must make many decisions where this stewardship is called into question, the normal procedure is to evaluate his explanation for the path chosen. Where, as here, counsel is not available to explain his choice of alternatives, we must look to the record to find any reasonable basis for the course of action taken by counsel. We will- not assume that counsel acted without a reasonable basis, rather the record must support such a conclusion.\nIn this case, there is no basis for concluding that trial counsel either knew or had reason to know that Mr. Purnell\u2019s testimony would be favorable to the defense. \u201cAssuming appellant\u2019s counsel knew of the witnesses, failure to call possible . . . witnesses is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d Commonwealth v. Owens, supra, 454 Pa. at 274, 312 A.2d at 381-82. See also Commonwealth v. Twiggs, 460 Pa. 105, 110, 331 A.2d 440, 443 (1975) (counsel may decide as a matter of trial strategy not to call a witness); Commonwealth v. Lochman,- Pa.Super. -, 402 A.2d 513 (1979) (failure to call a witness whose testimony would be merely cumulative does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel).\nIn this case, the trial court acting as the finder of fact believed the appellant\u2019s version which cast the deceased in the role of the original aggressor and that appellant did not take out his knife until challenged by the deceased. The court\u2019s reason for rejecting the claim of self defense was the absence of a reasonable basis for a fear of serious bodily harm in view of the deceased\u2019s highly intoxicated state. Mr. Purnell\u2019s testimony at the PCHA hearing as to his recollection of the incident shed no light upon the issue of the victim\u2019s state of sobriety or the reasonableness of appellant\u2019s fear of serious bodily harm. His testimony would only have corroborated those portions of appellant\u2019s testimony which the trial court did accept. Moreover, the persuasiveness of Mr. Purnell\u2019s testimony would have been at best questionable. In addition to the obvious interest that could have been inferred from Mr. Purnell\u2019s relationship to appellant, Mr. Purnell was at the time of the trial personally involved with criminal charges which may have reflected unfavorably upon his credibility.\nFaced with this record, it has not been established that the failure to call Mr. Purnell as a witness for the defense at trial evidenced counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. Appellant has failed to demonstrate that counsel\u2019s actions were without a reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests.\nIt is by now axiomatic that the test for evaluating a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is whether the record supports a conclusion that the particular course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interest. ... In making this assessment we are not to employ a hindsight evaluation to determine whether other alternatives may have been more reasonable, . . . but whether there was a reasonable basis for the course of action actually selected. . if a reasonable basis for counsel\u2019s trial strategy decision exists, that decision is imputed to the client. (Citations omitted).\nCommonwealth v. Musi, 486 Pa. 102, 404 A.2d 378, 380 (1979).\nAccordingly, we affirm the order of the P.C.H.A. court denying appellant\u2019s prayer for collateral relief from the judgment of sentence.\nEAGEN, C. J., dissents and notes that he is of the view that trial counsel was ineffective for not calling Mr. Purnell as a witness for the defense.\n. The Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq.; as amended, 19 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1180-1 et seq. (Supp. 1979-80).\n. Ronald Brockington, Esq., trial counsel, died prior to the P.C.H.A. hearing and was therefore unavailable as a witness in those proceedings.\n. Appellant has raised objections to certain evidentiary rulings as to the admissibility of portions of this evidence. In view of our disposi- \u2022 tion, we will not decide these questions.",
