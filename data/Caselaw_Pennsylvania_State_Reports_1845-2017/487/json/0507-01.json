        "text": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nThe Court being equally divided, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of York County is affirmed.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nNIX, J., filed an Opinion in Support of Affirmance in which LARSEN and FLAHERTY, JJ., joined.\nO\u2019BRIEN, J., filed an Opinion in Support of Remand in which EAGEN, C. J., and ROBERTS, J., joined.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF AFFIRMANCE\nNIX, Justice.\nThe result advocated by the Opinion in Support of Remand would strike a major blow to the efficient and orderly administration of criminal justice in this Commonwealth. Their view would force the Commonwealth to engage in endless retrials at considerable expense, simply because they misapply precedent and ignore the real impact of their decision. We cannot agree.\nJose Sanabria was convicted by a jury of second degree murder in the death of Elizabeth Bilger, an elderly York County woman, who was beaten to death with a tire iron during the course of the robbery of her home. This Court found sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction. Commonwealth v. Sanabria, 478 Pa. 22, 385 A.2d 1292 (1978). This Court also rejected Sanabria\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in permitting Michael Myers, a co-defendant, to invoke the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. In so holding, we stated:\nMichael Myers, a co-defendant of appellant, pled guilty to murder generally for his involvement in the slaying of Elizabeth Bilger. No degree of guilt hearing had yet been conducted and, therefore, judgment of sentence had not been imposed upon Myers. Appellant subpoenaed Myers and sought the testimony of Myers to support his claim that he had no prior knowledge of the homicide. An in camera hearing was held at which time Myers indicated that he would invoke the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection against self-incrimination. The Trial Court sustained this right. Appellant\u2019s argument is based on a theory that once Myers pled guilty, even though not sentenced, he waived his Fifth Amendment protection. We do not agree with appellant\u2019s contention.\nId., 478 Pa. at 28-29, 385 A.2d 1295.\nToday the Opinion in Support of Remand suggests that because Myers has been sentenced for his participation in the murder of Ms. Bilger and because he now wants to help his friend, Sanabria, by testifying in his behalf, that Sanabria is entitled to a new trial. We disagree and do not believ\u00e9 that Myers\u2019 testimony is included as unavailable evidence under section 3(c)(13) of the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-3(c) (Supp.1979-80).\nMyers had the opportunity to testify in behalf of Sanabria during Sanabria\u2019s trial. Instead, he deliberately and expressly chose not to testify at that trial and invoked his fifth amendment privilege. By allowing a convicted criminal to have a retrial where his original trial was without blemish, simply to admit the testimony of a co-felon, who also was convicted of the same crime and who invoked his right not to testify as a witness at the time of the original trial, the Court condemns the Commonwealth to endless retrials and prevents a conviction from ever being final. Myers had the opportunity to testify for Sanabria at Sanabria\u2019s trial. That should be enough. What does a criminal convicted of and sentenced for murder of the first degree have to lose by claiming that one or all of his co-defendants were not culpable? What is to stop sentenced co-defendants engaging in a \u201cround robin\u201d whereby each in turn states that he is the sole guilty party and the others were not involved? This situation is so fraught with abuse that it threatens to undermine our entire criminal justice process. The Opinion in Support of Remand ignores this real danger by glibly stating that it \u201ccan see no persuasive justification\u201d for not allowing a retrial on the basis of Myers\u2019 change of heart. This total disdain for the practical effects of such an ill-conceived doctrine is without justification.\nLARSEN and FLAHERTY, JJ., join in this opinion.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF REMAND\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellant, Jose Sanabria, was on November 1, 1974, convicted by a jury of murder of the second degree. Post-verdict motions were denied and on May 12, 1975, judgment sentencing appellant to life imprisonment was imposed. Direct appeal was taken to this court and we affirmed. Commonwealth v. Sanabria, 478 Pa. 22, 385 A.2d 1292 (1978).\nOn April 27,1978, appellant filed a pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus and to proceed in forma pauperis, which the court below accepted as a petition under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act. Appellant advanced one argument in his petition: that he was entitled to discharge or new trial as a result of the Commonwealth\u2019s suppression of exculpatory evidence. Appellant\u2019s court-appointed counsel filed a memorandum of law which, in effect, amended appellant\u2019s pleading to advance a claim of after-discovered evidence. The court below denied appellant\u2019s petition without a hearing. This appeal followed.\nAppellant\u2019s claim of error centers on allegedly exculpatory testimony of a co-defendant which was unavailable at the time of his trial. Consequently appellant seeks relief under that section of the Post Conviction Hearing Act which provides:\n\u201cTo be eligible for relief under this act, a person must initiate a proceeding by filing a petition under section 5 and must prove the following:\n\u2666 ;\u00a3 * * * *\n\u201c(c) That his conviction or sentence resulted from one or more of the following reasons:\n******\n\u201c(13) The unavailability at the time of trial of exculpatory evidence that has subsequently become available and that would have affected the outcome of the trial if it had been introduced.\u201d 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-3(c)(13).\nThe instant prayer for relief arises as follows: Appellant was charged with participation, together with two others, Michael Myers and Fred McCleary, in the robbery murder of Elizabeth Bilger. Evidence adduced at trial showed that appellant provided the automobile employed in the commission of the instant crime, that he drove Myers and McCleary to and from the scene of the killing, that the tire iron was removed by Myers from appellant\u2019s automobile and allegedly used to kill Ms. Bilger, that appellant fled to Florida on the day following the crime, and that in Florida appellant voluntarily confessed to his participation in the Bilger murder. On appellant\u2019s direct appeal we held the above-recited evidence was sufficient in law to support the conviction.\nAt trial the Commonwealth proposed to call co-defendant McCleary as a prosecution witness. An in camera colloquy was conducted and McCleary elected to exercise his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to testify. The Commonwealth rested. Immediately thereafter the defense proposed to call co-defendant Myers to testify on behalf of appellant. Defense counsel made an offer of proof as to Myers\u2019 testimony, indicating Myers would testify appellant had no knowledge when he drove his two co-actors to the Bilger home that they intended to commit homicide or any other crime.\nA colloquy was conducted out of the hearing of the jury, Myers\u2019 constitutional rights were explained to him, and Myers indicated he would testify on appellant\u2019s behalf. The trial court, however, in response to argument by both parties, declined to restrict cross-examination of Myers to only those events directly involving appellant; the court indicated it would permit cross-examination, subject to the rules regulating the scope of cross-examination, concerning all the events of the night of the crime. In the face of that ruling by the trial court Myers elected not to testify.\nIn due course appellant was convicted, his appeal was taken to this court and we affirmed.\nHowever, on June 15, 1975, seven and one-half months after appellant\u2019s trial and two weeks after notice of appellant\u2019s direct appeal was docketed in this court, Myers, having been sentenced for his participation in the instant crime, wrote a letter to the district attorney of York County in which he stated he was now willing to testify on appellant\u2019s behalf and that his testimony would be in consonance with the offer of proof made at trial. The record indicates appellant was not informed of the existence of the letter until March 27, 1978, four days after the filing of our opinion affirming the judgment of sentence. It is Myers\u2019 letter which forms the basis of appellant\u2019s claim that there now exists exculpatory evidence which was unavailable at time of trial.\nThe court below, in denying appellant\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief, made three distinct findings: First the court concluded that the letter, not having been written until over seven months after appellant\u2019s trial, did not constitute evidence suppressed by the prosecution. Second, the court held the letter was not itself evidence, but merely reflected Myers\u2019 intent that if called at a second trial he would testify favorably to appellant. Third, the court ruled that Myers\u2019 proposed testimony was not after-discovered evidence within the contemplation of \u00a7 3(c)(13) of the Post Conviction Hearing Act. The first two of the court\u2019s findings being obviously correct, it is to the third which I now turn.\nRecently the Superior Court, presented with the issue raised herein, reached a conclusion contrary to that reached by the hearing court instantly. In Commonwealth v. Mer vin, 263 Pa. Super.-, 398 A.2d 687 (1979), that court held \u201ctestimony from [a witness], who refused to testify at . trial, is the type of evidence unav\u00e1ilable at the time of trial and subsequently available, which is comprehended by the Act ... \u00a7 1180-3(c)(13).\u201d Id at 689. Neither authority nor analysis was presented in support of the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion. We have not heretofore addressed this precise issue.\nWe have, however, for other purposes, determined that a witness\u2019s invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights renders him unavailable. For example, in Lepley v. Lycoming Cty. Ct. of Com. Pl., 481 Pa. 565, 393 A.2d 306 (1978), we held a witness who asserts his Fifth Amendment privilege is unavailable so that his prior recorded testimony may be admitted at trial.\nIn Commonwealth v. Rodgers, 472 Pa. 435, 372 A.2d 771 (1977) and Commonwealth v. Colon, 461 Pa. 577, 337 A.2d 554 (1975), we held a witness's invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege rendered him unavailable for purposes of the hearsay rule. The commentators are of the same mind. See, McCormick\u2019s Handbook of the Law of Evidence, \u00a7 280 (2nd ed. E. Cleary 1971); 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1409 (Chadbourn rev. 1974); 2 Jones on Evidence \u00a7 9.23 (6th. ed. S. Gard 1972). See also, annotation, 45 A.L.R.2d 1354 and cases cited therein. Finally, the Federal Rules of Evidence provide:\n\u201c. . . \u2018unavailability as a witness\u2019 includes situations in which the declarant\u2014\n\u201c(1) is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of his statement; . . .\u201d Fed.R.Ev. 804(a)(1).\nI can see no persuasive justification for holding on the one hand that a witness who claims his Fifth Amendment privilege is unavailable so that his prior recorded testimony or out-of-court declaration may be admitted into evidence, and on the other that the witness is not unavailable for purposes of the Post Conviction Hearing Act.\nAlthough I would hold a witness who invokes his Fifth Amendment right is unavailable for purposes of the Post Conviction Hearing Act, more than mere unavailability of the witness at trial is required to warrant a new trial. It is well settled that \u201c[i]n order to justify the grant of a new trial on the basis of after-discovered evidence, the evidence must have been discovered after the trial and must be such that it could not have been obtained at the trial by reasonable diligence, must not be cumulative or merely impeach credibility, and must be such as would likely compel a different result.\u201d Commonwealth v. Cooney, 444 Pa. 416, 282 A.2d 29 (1971).\nInstantly we are presented with no evidence to weigh. We are, rather, confronted with what the court below correctly categorized as a statement of intent to provide evidence, in the form of Myers\u2019 letter. It is for the post-conviction hearing court to assay the alleged exculpatory evidence and determine if it satisfies the well-settled test for the granting of a new trial on the basis of after-discovered evidence. Commonwealth v. Conley, 232 Pa.Super. 432, 335 A.2d 721 (1975), appeal after remand, 243 Pa.Super. 295, 365 A.2d 858 (1976).\nAccordingly, I would remand the case to the court below for a hearing on appellant\u2019s claim of after-discovered evidence and disposition of such claim as that court deems appropriate.\nEAGEN, C. J., and ROBERTS, J., join in this Opinion.\n. Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-1 et seq. (1978-1980 Supp.).\n. Both Rodgers and Colon were decided by plurality opinion. But neither the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Nix in Rodgers, nor the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Pomeroy in Colon, expressed disagreement with the principle that a witness who properly invokes his Fifth Amendment rights is unavailable for purposes of the hearsay rule.\n. The Commonwealth, indeed, yields to appellant on this point and concedes Myers was unavailable at time of trial.",
