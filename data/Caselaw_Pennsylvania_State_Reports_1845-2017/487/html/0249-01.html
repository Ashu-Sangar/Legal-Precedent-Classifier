The pension fund is to be maintained by charges against member police officers, annual appropriations by the municipal subdivision and payments made by the State Treasurer of monies received from taxes paid upon premiums by foreign casualty insurance companies. The Act permits provision of pension benefits for widows and minor children of police officers under certain circumstances.

This statement was supported by an opinion from the Attorney General’s office in a letter to the Auditor General. The Auditor General recommended that the $5,000 be refunded to the Insured Police Pension Fund. The Borough repaid $5,000 into the fund.</p>

He requested the Borough to purchase a $5,000 paid-up life insurance policy on his life as part of his pension benefits. Appellant’s request was refused on the basis of the Auditor General’s opinion that the purchase of such a policy with monies from the police pension fund was not authorized by the Act. Appellant brought suit in mandamus against the Borough. The trial court entered judgment for appellant and ordered the Borough to purchase the requested insurance policy with monies “from the police pension fund.” The Commonwealth Court reversed holding that the purchase of a paid-up life insurance policy with police pension fund monies was unauthorized under the Act, and that the obligation to purchase the insurance policy in accordance with Ordinance No. 949, as <em>amended, </em>was obviated because Ordinance No. 1183 effectively repealed Ordinance No. 949.</p>

It consists of twelve articles covering, <em>inter alia </em>: definitions, designation of administrative authority to operate the pension plan, eligibility requirements, calculation of retirement and disability benefits, designation of beneficiaries, funding of the <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>pension plan, creation of an irrevocable trust to which the assets of any existing police pension fund are to be transferred and miscellaneous provisions. The plan enacted under Ordinance No. 1183 does not provide for any death benefits in the form of paid-up insurance policies on the lives of retiring police officers. Appellant argues this omission in coverage indicates that the Ordinance No. 1183 pension plan does not cover “the entire subject matter” of the Ordinance No. 949 pension plan and, therefore, Ordinance No. 949 is not implicitly repealed. We cannot agree. Appellant seeks to preserve the amending resolution of January 4, 1965, notwithstanding the Borough Council’s intent, expressed in the preambles to Ordinance No. 1183, to “restate in its entirety” the pension plan enacted under Ordinance No. 949.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> We are not persuaded that Ordinance No. 1183 has not “covered the entire subject matter” of police pension plans.
