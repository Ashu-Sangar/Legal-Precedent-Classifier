Appellant contends and appellee concedes that neither appellant nor his attorney was given notice of the Commonwealth’s petition to extend time for trial; it is also undisputed that there was no hearing on the petition. Both notice and a hearing are clearly required by rule 1100(c). A further problem is that the Commonwealth’s petition was of the boiler-plate variety, alleging due diligence and averring that defendant “has not yet been apprehended.” <em>See Commonwealth v. Ray, </em><a href="/pa-super/240/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="240 Pa.

However, the docket shows that two weeks <em>before </em>the filing and grant of extension, appellant was arrested on the bench warrant which had been issued on August 9th. The docket also shows that the judge who granted the extension was not the same judge who incarcerated appellant on August 14th, and was not aware of his apprehension. The procedural deficiencies surrounding the grant of the extension were obviously of arguable merit, thus, the question as to whether there was a reasonable basis for failing to pursue these claims must be considered. <em>Commonwealth v.

Here, however, there was serious question as to the propriety of the extension order other than the procedural problems. The only basis offered for the grant of the extension was the appellant’s fugitive status, which was later ascertained to be erroneous. While appellant was in a fugitive status, the Commonwealth was unquestionably entitled to an extension and that extension could legitimately extend for a reasonable time beyond his apprehension. The question arises in this case because of his apprehension prior to the extension request and that neither the Commonwealth nor the court was aware of that fact. If with the exercise of due diligence the Commonwealth should have been aware of appellant’s availability for trial at the time of rule 1100(c) request, then the grant of the relief for the reason given would have been clearly erroneous and counsel’s client would be entitled to a discharge. In view of the remedy that was possibly available, we can perceive of no interest of the client’s that should have deterred counsel pursuing an attack on the validity of the grant when his client was brought to trial beyond the period prescribed by the rule. While this disposes of the question as to counsel’s ineffectiveness favorably to appellant, it does not settle the issue as to what is the appropriate remedy to be provided in this case. A finding that appellant’s counsel was ineffective for not pursuing a contention of arguable merit is not synonymous with a conclusion that the contention would, in fact, have prevailed if it had been timely pursued. On the record before us, we can only conclude that an argument that the Commonwealth had not demonstrated the due diligence, which is a prerequisite for an extension, was of arguable merit. We cannot, however, determine whether there were administrative complexities that might explain the Commonwealth’s misinformation as not being the result of the failure to exercise due diligence. Such a decision can only be made after an evidentiary hearing wherein the <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>pertinent facts are developed. Thus, we are constrained to remand the matter to the trial court for a hearing.</p>
    <p id="b88-5" data-blocks='[["BL_88.5",88,[273,443,1152,703]]]'>Moreover, we are satisfied that this result is not providing the Commonwealth with “a second bite of the apple” as charged by two members of the Court. To conclude that the Commonwealth’s unawareness of appellant’s apprehension resulted from its lack of due diligence ignores the realistic complexities of a justice system operating in a populous county. While appellant is entitled to the remedy of discharge if the prosecution has failed to comply with the mandates of rule 1100, nonetheless, the people of the Commonwealth are also entitled to expect that the determination of non-compliance will not be made in the cavalier manner urged by those who would allow appellant’s discharge on the present record.</p>
    <p id="b88-6" data-blocks='[["BL_88.6",88,[269,1184,1153,699]]]'>Accordingly, we would remand the cause to the trial court with the instruction that 1100(c) hearing be held, at which time, the parties will be given an opportunity to create a record on the question of the Commonwealth’s due diligence. If the trial court determines that the grant of an extension was proper, then the appellant may seek review of that determination in the Superior Court. If the trial court finds that trial could have been commenced within the proscribed period of the rule with the exercise of due diligence, the appellant must be discharged, subject, of course, to any appellate review that is available to the Commonwealth. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The record shows that appellant timely raises other issues for this Court’s review: (1) that original counsel were ineffective for failing to claim that pre-arrest delay violated appellant’s due process rights, (2) that prejudicial remarks by the district attorney during his closing jury address require retrial and (3) that admission at trial of certain hearsay evidence requires retrial. Because I believe appellant is entitled to discharge on his Rule 1100 claim, I express no view on these issues.</p>
