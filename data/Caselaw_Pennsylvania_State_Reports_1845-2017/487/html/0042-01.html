See Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, art. III, § 311, 1 P.S. § 311 (Supp.1978). V.A.C.S. filed this appeal.</p>

The trial court rejected this version and stated that “at no time,” during the relevant period, did Y.A.C.S. “perform a single parental duty . . . or in any fashion indicate by any act on her part a desire or intent to do so.”</p>
