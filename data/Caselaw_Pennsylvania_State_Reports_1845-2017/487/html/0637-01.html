Following entry of the decree nisi, appellant filed an exception, which was denied. The court entered a final decree terminating the parental rights of appellant and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b703-5" data-blocks='[["BL_703.5",703,[206,656,1152,727]]]'>The facts are as follows. Appellant, Sandra Barber Williams, married Larry Shafer Williams on April 3, 1968. A child, H.E.W., was born to the couple on October 6, 1968. In October of 1973, while residing in Rochester, New York, appellant and her husband entered into a separation agreement, under the terms of which appellant was to retain custody of H.E.W. However, on November 3, 1973, at the request of appellant, the father, Larry Williams, took custody of the child. On April 13, 1974, Larry Williams died. Appellee Claudia Thoma is the sister of Larry Williams, and upon the death of her brother, and with the consent of appellant, the Thomas returned with H.E.W. to their home in Bradford, Pennsylvania, and retained custody of her there.</p>
    <p id="b703-6" data-blocks='[["BL_703.6",703,[205,1412,1152,621]]]'>On October 31, 1974, the Thomas filed a petition for involuntary termination of parental rights in the Court of Common Pleas, Orphans’ Court Division, of McKean County. The petition set out as grounds in support that appellant, since April 13, 1974 (the date of Larry Williams’ death) “has evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing her parental claim to [the] child and has refused and failed to perform her parental duties.” A decree was entered by the trial court scheduling a hearing on the petition for November 26, 1974. On November 4, 1974, appellant, still residing in New York, was served by mail with a copy of the petition and decree.</p>

On November 26, 1974, the hearing on the Thomas’ petition was held and a decree entered terminating appellant’s parental rights and decreeing that she return the child to Mr. and Mrs. Thoma. Appellant neither <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>appeared at the hearing nor was she represented by counsel. On January 14, 1975, the Thomas went to New York, removed H.E.W. from school, and returned with her to Bradford, Pennsylvania.</p>

    <p id="b704-6" data-blocks='[["BL_704.6",704,[269,701,1152,888]]]'>On February 4, 1975, appellant filed a “petition to open and vacate judgment,” and on March 12, 1976, following a hearing, the court entered a decree which “opened and vacated” its November 26, 1974, decree and which directed that appellant be given an opportunity to present testimony to establish why her parental rights should not be terminated. On July 22, 1976, a new hearing was held on the Thomas’ petition at which appellant appeared, was represented, and testified. On May 26, 1977, the court entered a decree terminating appellant’s parental rights in H.E.W. In its opinion in support of its decree the Orphans’ Court noted that on the facts of the case it <em>“would not hold that there had been an abandonment and would return the child to the mother,” </em>but held that appellant’s “petition to open and vacate” was in the nature of an appeal, was untimely filed, and hence was without effect as a challenge to the propriety of the Novémber 26, 1974 decree.</p>
    <p id="b704-7" data-blocks='[["BL_704.7",704,[269,1609,1150,414]]]'>Appellant now advances two arguments: first, that the decree which “opened and vacated” the original decree rendered that first decree a nullity and deprived the Orphans' Court of power to reinstate it; second, that the ruling that appellant’s “petition to open and vacate” was untimely filed represented a clear abuse of discretion. Appellee, on the other hand, argues these issues have not been properly preserved for appellate review.</p>

Subsequently, by her new Pennsylvania counsel, she filed a “petition to open and vacate,” despite the fact that these are contradictory remedies urging distinct defects in the proceedings. See <em>In re Estate of McCauley, </em><a href="/pa/478/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="478 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1740524" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0083-01">478 Pa. 83</a>, <a href="/pa/478/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="478 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1740524" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0083-01">385 A.2d 1324</a> (1978).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Finally, upon entry of the second (May 26, 1977) decree, appellant entered merely a general exception asserting neither of the claims of error which she advances here.

That court held that on the facts it “would not hold that there had been an abandonment and would return the child to the mother.” Indeed, our review of the record convinces us that a contrary finding would have been unsupported by the evidence.
