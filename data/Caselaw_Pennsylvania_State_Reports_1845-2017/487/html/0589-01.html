By memorandum dated March 6, 1979, President Judge Iannarelli of the Philadelphia Traffic Court, informed all employees that they would be removed from their positions unless they “cease and desist all partisan political activity.” The action of President Judge Iannarelli was based upon memoranda during the month of March 1977, from Judge Barbieri, the Court Administrator of Pennsylvania, directing the employees of the Philadelphia Traffic Court to remain free from all political activity.</p>

I believe that the petition raises important questions that should have been addressed and that the Court’s action calls into question the state of the law in this area.</p>
    <p id="b655-5" data-blocks='[["BL_655.6",655,[234,1132,1149,525]]]'>This is the first attempt to seek a writ of prohibition to restrain the exercise of the <em>administrative </em>power of a judicial tribunal. Traditionally, writs of prohibition have been employed to correct abuses of courts’ <em>judicial </em>power. See <em>Carpentertown Coal and Coke Co. v. Laird, </em><a href="/pa/360/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="360 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="475080" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0094-01">360 Pa. 94</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.2d%20426" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="61 A.2d 426">61 A.2d 426</a> (1948). In this new day where administration has become a significant part of the Court’s responsibility, it is important to determine whether or not writs of prohibition will be permitted to be employed as vehicles to curb alleged abuses in the exercise of the administrative power.</p>

Today’s result does not permanently avoid the resolution of these complex and difficult issues. As demonstrated by the frequency of cases in this Court concerning the rights of Traffic Court employees to run for public office, see <em>In re Novalski, <a href="/pa/478/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="478 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="1740614" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0243-01">supra;</a> Ottaviano v.

    <p id="b656-5" data-blocks='[["BL_656.5",656,[261,759,1149,743]]]'>The Court’s action puts the petitioners in an unjustifiably harsh position. The dismissal of their petition leaves them only two options: one, either they forfeit the right arguably conferred upon them by statute to seek political office, or two, they must risk dismissal from employment if they continue in their pursuit of political office. If the latter option is chosen and President Judge Iannarelli carries out his intention to terminate petitioners’ employment, petitioners will have no recourse other than to sue for back pay and reinstatement and raise these same issues in their support. It is absurd to force these petitioners to be discharged and to bring a subsequent lawsuit when this Court could today definitively dispose of the questions raised rather than entering an ambiguous order which provides no guidance.</p>
