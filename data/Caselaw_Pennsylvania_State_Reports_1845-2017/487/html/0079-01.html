W. B. and S. W. B. with respect to their son, J. A. B. (hereinafter: “J.”). The case arose from a petition filed on August 16, 1977, by the Somerset County Child Welfare Agency requesting termination of parental rights pursuant to section 311 of the Adoption Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In September and October of 1973, the B. family experienced serious problems. Specifically, the parents became unable to cope with J.’s hyperactivity and destructive behavior. J., who was four years old at the time, would regularly awaken at 5:00 a. m., go downstairs, open the refrigerator, break all the eggs, and smash tomatoes on the floor. Further, although he was fully toilet trained, J. would defecate on the floor and wipe the walls with excrement. The parents sought help from the Cambria County Child Welfare Agency in procuring medication to control J.’s hyperactivity. However, this approach to the problem was abandoned since one type of pill prescribed by the City Clinic made J. more active and the second type over-tranquilized him. Because the parents recognized that J. had special and greater needs than their five other children, they tried to spend as much time as possible with him alone. One parent would remain at home with the five children while the other parent took J. on shopping trips and errands. The father asserted that, as a result, J. received more love and attention than any other child in the family.</p>

They were referred to the Somerset County Child Welfare Agency. At about the same time, the Somerset County agency received a report that the children were unsupervised and playing around the railroad tracks near their home.</p>

The agency discussed the family’s problems with the parents who agreed to place J. in a foster home. The parents then signed a Parent Placement Agreement on October 4, 1973. Both parents testified that they took this action hoping a foster family would be able to help J. and teach him right from wrong. They also understood that the placement would be temporary. The agency director, who assisted in arranging the placement, testified that the parents were frustrated and unable to cope with J.’s disruptive behavior. She further testified that, while the parents felt badly about J.’s departure, they were not angry with the agency, but were relieved by the prospect that J. might receive the help he needed. At that time, the parents were given a card bearing the agency’s name, address and telephone number. Shortly thereafter, the agency returned with a petition and removed the five other children from the home without the parents’ consent. The director testified that, at this time, the parents became very angry and upset.</p>

At that time, the agency agreed to return the three older children. The parents next requested the return of the youngest child. In that case, the agency arranged for the parents to visit with the child at the agency office. The youngest child was ultimately returned to the B. home in November 1974, after a year of foster care. In the summer of 1976, the parents <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>requested the return of the fifth child. After consulting with the court, the agency arranged three parental visits with this child, and he was returned after approximately three years of foster care. During this three-year period, the parents made repeated requests for the return of J. They were advised to consider getting back one child at a time and no visits were arranged pursuant to these requests.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The two caseworkers made numerous visits to the B.s’ home, initially to advise the parents on upgrading the home and later, when the living conditions had improved, to counsel the parents prior to the homecoming of each child. Further, the B.s received counselling from the agency on dealing with the problems of each child after his return home. At no time did the parents receive counselling with respect to J., who remained in foster care, even though, ostensibly, he was a primary cause of the family’s problems.</p>

The B.s also requested that J. be returned to them. The director testified that the B.s were told to call the agency to arrange for a visit. The B.s failed to do so. The director admitted on cross-examination that the agency never seriously considered voluntarily returning J. to this family and that she would not have recommended J. be returned.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

On those occasions, he observed that the home and children appeared clean and that the children were never outside unsupervised. Further, he did not observe anything in the home to indicate that J. could not be adequately raised there. The B.s told him on numerous occasions that they wanted the two children, who remained in foster care, to be returned. He stated, in response to these requests, that he “probably indicated to them we would expect them to visit with the children and things like that.” However, he could not recall any requests for visits by the parents.</p>

He stated that at that time “I advised her to seek legal counsel and she indicated she would.” He explained that the agency’s decision was based on “the fact that [J.] had been singled out as a problem child and also the fact that he had been separated from them for such a long period of time, such return would probably not be in his best interests.” He stated that the decision was not based on anything he had observed, but, rather, was based on “the situation before [J.] was removed.” Other than legal redress, he suggested no course of action, such as counselling, <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>visits or other types of contact which the B.s might have pursued at that time to effect J.’s return. In his opinion, any request for a visit made after November 1976 would not have improved their chances for J.’s return. However, he could not recall whether the parents were “actively discouraged” with respect to the return of J. prior to November 1976.

    <p id="b150-4" data-blocks='[["BL_150.5",150,[268,734,1151,677]]]'>The parents both testified that they were discouraged from contacting J. because the agency’s attitude was different toward J. than toward the other children. Each time a caseworker visited the home, the parents asked about J. and stated that they wanted him back. The caseworker would respond that J. was doing well. He would then advise them not to worry about J. but, instead, to take care of the other children. The parents claimed they were assured that they would be notified when they could see J. They testified further that the caseworkers never mentioned J. unless they first inquired about him and that the caseworkers seemed unwilling to discuss him, always changing the subject to the other children.</p>

The only reason offered for refusing her requests was that the agency was not yet ready to return J.

She also denied the caseworker’s assertion that he advised her to get legal <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>assistance in November 1976, since the agency had decided not to return him voluntarily.</p>

A final decree terminating those rights was entered on February 6, 1978. In the opinion in support of that decree, the trial court concluded the parents failed to perform their parental duties toward J. for a period of at least six months and, thus, met the requirements for termination of their parental rights as to him under both § 311(1) and § 311(2) of the Adoption Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The court’s conclusion was based upon the following findings of fact: (1) the parents had not directly communicated with J. since October 1974; (2) the parents’ course of conduct with respect to J. differed from their conduct toward their five other children; and, (3) the parents did not seriously and genuinely pursue their interests in J.’s welfare and his return.</p>

They maintain the record demonstrates that their attitude and conduct with respect to J. was the same as toward their other children. They argue that the agency took a leadership role with respect to the return of all the children, except J., and counselled the parents to consider one child at a time assuring them that visitation with J. would come at a later time. Thus, the parents claim they were encouraged to wait for the agency to arrange visitation with J. in preparation for his return, as it had done with respect to the other children. Therefore, they argue, any failure to perform parental duties was due to the attitude of the Somerset County Child Welfare Agency which actively discouraged any contact between the parents and this child.</p>

    <p id="b152-6" data-blocks='[["BL_152.6",152,[274,1145,1150,368]]]'>Two of the court’s significant conclusions and bases for granting termination were that the parents’ attitude and course of conduct toward J. differed from their attitude and course of conduct toward their other five children, and that they did not seriously pursue their interests in his welfare and return. These conclusions were based upon and drawn from the following findings:</p>
    <blockquote id="b152-7" data-blocks='[["BL_152.7",152,[314,1533,1110,312]]]'>“From the very beginning the record shows that respondents expressed concern that J.A.B. was a source of trouble whom they could not control.

      <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>Similarly, a different attitude and course of conduct toward J. cannot be inferred from the fact that the parents asked for and received visitation prior to the eventual return of their other five children. The agency admitted that the parents repeatedly asked for J.’s return, but asserted that the parents failed to follow the agency’s suggested procedure for arranging an appointment. Specifically, the director maintained the parents were told to telephone for an appointment to visit with J., which they failed to do. However, the record contains no evidence of visits arranged by telephone with the other children which would support a finding that the parents pursued a different course of conduct toward J. The only evidence of visits between the parents and the five other children were those arranged by the agency after it had made a decision to return the children pursuant to the parents’ requests. Those visits were for the admitted purpose of preparing the children for their return home. Thus, contrary to the court’s view, the record indicates that the parents pursued exactly the same course of conduct toward J. as toward their other children, i. e., requesting a child’s return and relying on the agency to initiate visits when it was ready to return the child.</p>

While the trial court found that the parents had only one visit with J., which took place at the agency office in December 1973, we note that the-director testified to another office visit on March 25, 1974, when the parents visited with J. and one of his brothers. As to the December 1973 visit, the record does not indicate how it was arranged. Clearly, however, the visit was not made preparatory to J.’s return since it took place shortly after he was placed in foster care and long before two of the other children were returned. Neither the purpose nor the circumstances of the March 1974 visit is indicated in the record. One additional contact between J. and his parents occurred by chance in October 1974, at a used car lot.</p>
