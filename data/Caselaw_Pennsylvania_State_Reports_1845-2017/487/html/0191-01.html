McCloud was tried without a jury and found guilty of murder of the third degree, possession of a prohibited offensive weapon, and possession of an instrument of crime. McCloud was sentenced to two to ten years on the murder conviction and two to five years on the weapons conviction. The sentences were made concurrent. McCloud filed post-verdict motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial nunc pro tunc. In these motions, she raised, <em>inter alia, </em>the following points:</p>

    <p id="b257-6" data-blocks='[["BL_257.8",257,[225,887,1149,580]]]'>On November 9, 1977, Tony Mace and John McCloud, brother of the appellant, became involved in an altercation near appellant’s residence at 1925 Rowan Street, Philadelphia. Michael Griffin was watching the encounter while sitting in an automobile parked nearby. Michael’s sister, Willie Mae Cupitt, emerged from her nearby residence to tell him to come home. A crowd gathered and hostile words ensued between McCloud’s mother and Willie Mae Cupitt’s mother. Suddenly, McCloud emerged from her residence armed with a butcher knife and stabbed Willie Mae Cupitt. The wound resulted in death later the same day.</p>
    <p id="b257-7" data-blocks='[["BL_257.9",257,[226,1495,1149,582]],["BL_258.1",258,[271,312,1148,96]]]'>Officers of the Philadelphia Police Department arrived at the scene shortly after the stabbing. One attended the deceased. The other officer, Charles Holmes, was informed by someone in the crowd that McCloud was responsible and that she lived at “the house with the white door.” As Officer Holmes approached 1925 Rowan Street, McCloud, who was standing in the doorway, stated “I’m the one they’re talking about. I stabbed her.” McCloud made these statements without any prior questioning by Officer Holmes. Officer Holmes testified McCloud was alert and calm during the period in which she was in his presence. <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>Officer Holmes placed McCloud under arrest, and she was transported to the Northwest Detective Division.</p>

She indicated she understood and waived these rights. She then gave an inculpatory statement. She was preliminarily arraigned on charges of aggravated assault, weapons offenses, and related charges at 7:42 p. m. on November 9, 1977. Detective Ainsley stated McCloud appeared quiet and normal when she gave her statement.</p>
    <p id="b258-6" data-blocks='[["BL_258.6",258,[272,963,1148,520]]]'>After the police were informed of the deceased’s demise, McCloud was transferred to the Police Administration Building where she was informed of the death. She was again advised of her rights by Detective James Richardson. She again waived her rights and gave a second inculpatory statement. A formal complaint was filed on November 10, 1977. McCloud was charged therein with murder generally, possession of an instrument of crime, and possession of a prohibited offensive weapon. She was preliminarily arraigned on these charges at 2:18 a. m. the same day.</p>
    <p id="b258-7" data-blocks='[["BL_258.7",258,[272,1502,1149,519]]]'>McCloud filed a pretrial motion to suppress her statements. In support of the motion, she stated she could not effectively waive her rights to remain silent and to the assistance of counsel because she suffered from an “illness of the mind.” She waived legal argument on the merits of the motion. The motion was denied. The suppression court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that McCloud knowingly and voluntarily waived her rights to remain silent and to the assistance of counsel after being properly warned of these rights by officers prior to any interrogation.</p>

We will not reach the merits of these claims because McCloud has not properly preserved them for review. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of sentence.</p>

Trial commenced on May 8, 1978. McCloud has waived this issue by not complying with Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100(f) which requires an application to dismiss charges based on violations of Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100 be filed pretrial.
