Dingus, in his minor children, B.M.D. and R.L.D.</p>
    <p id="b452-8" data-blocks='[["BL_452.9",452,[266,976,1149,421]]]'>On November 9, 1977, appellee, Cumberland County Children’s Services, filed a petition to involuntarily terminate the parental rights of appellant in his two minor children. Both children were born out of wedlock to appellant and Dorothy Mae Kiner. Appellee obtained custody of the children in 1974 when the natural mother voluntarily relinquished her parental rights. At the time, appellant was incarcerated in Virginia.</p>

Following two continuances, granted because of appellant’s inability to attend the scheduled hearing, a hearing on the termination petition was held on March 15, 1978. Though represented by counsel, appellant did not attend the hearing. On April 4, 1978, the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County, Orphans’ Court Division, entered final decrees terminating the parental rights of appellant in his minor children. This direct appeal followed.</p>
