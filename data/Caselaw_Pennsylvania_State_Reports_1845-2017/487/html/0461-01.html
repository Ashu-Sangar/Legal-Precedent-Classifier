Reihart, Inc. submitted a revised plan for subdividing its 177 acre tract of land to the Carroll Township Planning Commission. The Commission, pursuant to the powers granted by the Legislature in the Municipalities Planning Code, Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, §§ 101 et seq., 53 P.S. §§ 10101 et seq., tentatively approved the plan, but withheld final approval pending appellant’s compliance with thirteen conditions. Most pertinent to this litigation was the condition that appellant dedicate portions of its tract along existing roads to Carroll Township so that the Township could increase the width of these roads if necessary. Appellant had the option of fulfilling the condition, or challenging it by procedures specified in the Municipalities Planning Code. Appellant chose not to challenge the condition, and instead dedicated the land to the Township. The Planning Commission then approved appellant’s subdivision plan.</p>

This approach virtually guarantees that the crucial question presented in this, and similar cases, will be ignored. This question is whether there was a <em>de facto </em>taking of appellant’s property through the device of imposing conditions precedent to subdivision approval. This case should be remanded to the lower court for a determination of this paramount question in light of the facts peculiar to it. If I had sufficient votes for a majority opinion, it would read as follows:</p>

On August 8, 1974, the Commission conditionally approved this revised plan. Thirteen conditions, however, were imposed upon appellant before final approval would be granted. One of these conditions required appellant to dedicate portions of the 177-acre tract to the Township for rights-of-way along Ore Bank Road. The purpose of this required condition of dedication was to increase the width of the road from its present 17 feet to a projected 50 feet if this were necessary in the future.

On the other hand, eminent domain is a power to take property for the public use and for which compensation is necessary. <em>White’s Appeal, supra. </em>While the distinction between the police power and power of eminent domain is one of long-standing ancestry, nonetheless the problem of testing the limits of a condition imposing a required dedication constitutes a matter of first impression for this Court. Accordingly, a test is required for ascertaining whether the condition imposed has its locus in the police power or whether it derives from the power of eminent domain instead.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

    <p id="b534-4" data-blocks='[["BL_534.5",534,[275,884,1150,753]]]'>Appellant suggests that such a test has been articulated in <em>McKain v. Toledo City Plan Commission, </em><a href="/ohio-app-2d/26/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="26 Ohio App. 2d 171" data-case-ids="6705199" data-case-paths="/ohio-app-2d/26/0171-01">26 Ohio App.2d 171</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=270%20N.E.2d%20370" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="270 N.E.2d 370">270 N.E.2d 370</a> (1971); he urges this Court to adopt it as a useful means for testing the limits of a given dedication requirement imposed by a municipality upon a subdivider. In <em>McKain, </em>plaintiffs were seeking to subdivide three lots totaling .59 acres. Subdivision approval was conditioned upon plaintiffs’ dedication of a thirty-foot wide strip along a dual highway which abutted 3.71 acres of plaintiffs’ land. The strip was to make possible a widening of the highway from its present forty-foot width to a finished width of seventy feet. Just as in the instant case, so too in <em>McKain, </em>the court sought a way to test the limits of a condition which imposed a required dedication. That court stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="Av6" data-blocks='[["BL_534.6",534,[317,1658,1108,427]],["BL_535.1",535,[252,311,1108,587]]]'>A municipality may require in subdivision regulations that a developer provide streets that are necessitated by the activity within the subdivision and such developer may be required to assume any costs which are specifically and uniquely attributed to his activities which would otherwise be cast upon the public, but this does not authorize a municipality to require a developer to dedicate a strip of land to the municipality without payment in order to <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>widen a main thoroughfare 700 feet distant from and totally unrelated to the proposed subdivision. (Citations omitted). If the subdivision requirement is within the statutory grant of power to the municipality and if the burden cast upon the subdivider is specifically and uniquely attributable to his activity, then, the requirement is permissible; if not, it is forbidden and amounts to a confiscation of private property in contravention of constitutional prohibitions, rather than a reasonable regulation under the police power. (Citations omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 176-77, <a href="/citations/?q=270%20N.E.2d%20370" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="270 N.E.2d 370">270 N.E.2d at 374</a>.</blockquote>
    <p id="b535-4" data-blocks='[["BL_535.5",535,[212,922,1149,206]]]'>Applying this “specifically and uniquely attributable test” will reveal whether an imposed condition seeks to accommodate needs created only by the subdivision itself or instead satisfies needs of the general public.</p>
    <p id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.6",535,[212,1153,1151,746]]]'>While other jurisdictions confronted by this issue have formulated similar tests,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> the “specifically and uniquely attributable test” offers the fullest and most empirically satisfying test for striking a balance between the interests of the larger community and the rights of property owners upon whom is cast an appropriate burden when the activity of subdivision has generated the need. Such a test, I think, will place a reasonable restriction upon the discretion of planning boards in what has been a very ambiguous area of decision making. Also, this test will facilitate planning both by landowners and developers as well. And finally, the specifically and uniquely attributable test will assist courts in assessing the validity of conditions which are imposed as conditions precedent to subdivision approval.</p>

The remainder of the tract, which the Township required appellant to subdivide also, was divided into ten ten-acre lots to be used for agricultural purposes and residue land. Guided by the test articulated above, the lower court must determine whether the burden imposed upon appellant is specifically and uniquely attributable to the activity of the subdivision. If it is, then appellant should receive no compensation since the imposed condition is a proper exercise of the police power. If it is not, then appellant is entitled to just compensation for a taking which has deprived him of the beneficial use and enjoyment of his property.</p>
