On May 26, 1978, the learned Chancellor sustained the objections and dismissed the complaint. The instant appeal to this Court from the May 26,1978 order was taken pursuant to former Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, section 202(4); Act 1970, July 31, P.L. 673, No. 223, art.

When she notified her company that she was physically able to return to work, she was refused employment. She contends that her treatment was contrary to situations where male employees, serving in the same or a similar capacity, returned after a protracted illness. It was admitted by appellant that before instituting the instant complaint, she had filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC). The action before the PHRC was terminated after an investigation at appellant’s request in deference to <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>a proceeding before the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> also initiated by appellant.</p>

    <blockquote id="b204-5" data-blocks='[["BL_204.6",204,[312,647,1107,416]]]'>. , but as to acts declared unlawful by section five of this act the procedure herein provided shall, when invoked, be exclusive and the final determination therein shall exclude any other action, civil or criminal, based on the same grievance of the complainant concerned.

Although attempting to fashion a special remedy to meet this illusive and deceptive evil, the General Assembly did not withdraw the other remedies that might be available depending upon the nature of the injury sustained. The legislature recognizing that the effectiveness of the procedure it had created would be enhanced by the exclusivity of the provisions of the Act, and the undesirability of allowing the person aggrieved to commence several different actions for relief, <em>Daly v. School Dist. of Darby Tp., </em><a href="/pa/434/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="434 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="1922668" data-case-paths="/pa/434/0286-01">434 Pa. 286</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=252%20A.2d%20638" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="252 A.2d 638">252 A.2d 638</a> (1969), provided an election for the complaining person to opt for relief under the provisions <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>of PHRA or the right to seek redress by other remedies that might be available. Thus, PHRA provides that when the statutory procedure is invoked, it is exclusive. <em>Com. Penna. Human Relations Commission v.

Likewise, where the complaining party initially seeks relief without resorting to the provisions of the PHRA, he or she is barred from subsequently doing so. <em>See Daly </em>v. <em>School Dist. of Darby Tp., supra.</em>

    <p id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[232,736,1152,1008]]]'>Appellant acknowledges the general principle of the exclusivity of the PHRA remedy but argues that the present case falls within the limited exceptions provided for under the act. Specifically, appellant argues that section 12(c) should be construed to permit recourse to the courts of common pleas under the facts of this case. Prior to 1974, a complainant invoking the procedure of this act was barred from seeking any other remedy for redress of the asserted grievance. And this rule was without exception. By the 1974 amendment to section 12, a narrow exception was carved in the rule of exclusivity. Section 12(c) provides that the rights of a complainant invoking the procedures under the PHRA shall not be foreclosed from resort to the courts, “if within (1) year after filing of a complaint with the Commission, the Commission dismisses the complaint or has not entered into a conciliation agreement to which the complainant is a party, . . . ” Here appellant’s file with the PHRC was closed at her request, therefore neither of the conditions provided by section 12(c) have been met.</p>
    <p id="b205-7" data-blocks='[["BL_205.6",205,[236,1767,1149,310]],["BL_206.1",206,[257,306,1150,768]]]'>Appellant urges that since the role of the agency was carried out, albeit not by the designated agency but by the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, we should recognize substantial compliance with the statutory scheme and allow the court of common pleas to take jurisdiction under the circumstances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> To support this position, appellant cites <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>the language of section 12(a) to the effect, “[t]he provisions of this act shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof . . . .” In response we note that this language appeared in the section before there was an exception to the rule of exclusivity. A liberal construction for the accomplishment of the purposes of the act is not synonymous with a relaxation of the rule of exclusivity for the benefit of a complainant. It is clear from the legislation that the General Assembly was of the view that the procedures provided by the act represented the most effective approach to the problem of discrimination. Thus, the language relied upon by appellant cannot properly be construed as authorizing a broad reading of the exception to the rule of exclusivity.</p>
    <p id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[257,1111,1150,824]]]'>The learned Chancellor wisely perceived appellant’s position as an invitation to the courts to “extend legislative social policy” under the “guise of judicial interpretation.” If the General Assembly wished to permit the substitution of agencies in its legislative scheme, it could easily have provided for that result. It declined to do so and it is beyond our powers to ignore that judgment absent some showing of a constitutional infringement. Obviously, the rule of exclusivity was of high priority in the legislative scheme; as first promulgated, the act provided for no exception to the rule, after a number of years of experience the General Assembly was willing only to provide two carefully defined situations. This history provides no basis for a judicial finding of an implicit legislative intent to extend the expressly unambiguous perimeters of the terms of the 12(c) exceptions.</p>
