The witnesses testified at trial that on this date, shortly after 1:00 a. m., that Darell, age seventeen, began to argue with his mother, Mrs. Charles McGuire. When Darell began cursing his mother, appellant, Darell’s father, came downstairs and told him not to talk to his mother in that manner. Darell then hit appellant, causing his head to go through a glass table. Mrs. McGuire instructed her daughter to call the police, told Darell to leave the house and locked the door. However, Darell kicked the door, in and re-entered the house. Again, Mrs. McGuire told Darell to leave the house and once again Darell regained entry. This time, he entered by climbing through a window which he broke with a door mat.</p>

Darell hit Mrs. McGuire, threw her down on the bed, and hit appellant with the lamp. Darell then ran upstairs to the fourth level bedroom where Mrs. McGuire had fled and tried to force open the door which Mrs. McGuire was holding closed from within.

First, whether the testimony provided a basis for finding a malicious killing beyond a reasonable doubt.

The weakness of this contention is that the Commonwealth did not offer any evidence, from any source, which would have proved the element of malice beyond a reasonable doubt. The Commonwealth relies upon portions of a statement given to the police by the appellant at the time of his arrest. It is argued that this statement proves that appellant’s act was not compelled by a fear for personal safety or for the safety of the other members of his household.

This testimony indicated that immediately before the shooting, in response to threats upon her life and the life of her children, Mrs. McGuire fled to a bedroom on the fourth level where she and her daughters were attempting to barricade the door against Darell’s forcible entry. It was contended that the fatal shot was fired by the appellant, who was standing on the third level, to prevent Darell from gaining entrance and grievously assaulting the occupants of the fourth level bedroom. We would agree that if this was the only evidence upon which the judgment was to be rendered, a compelling argument could be made for the discharge of the accused as a matter of law. <em>See e. g.

Since the victim’s attack was directed to occupants of the third level and not the fourth level, the entry of the bullet in the back of the victim gains significance.

It is well established that a fact finder may infer malice from the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the body. E. g., <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b286-6" data-blocks='[["BL_286.7",286,[278,565,1150,528]]]'>A review of the record indicates that immediately prior to his death, the victim conducted a reign of destruction and terror throughout his house, assaulted appellant (his father) and his mother, and threatened to kill all of the individuals who were in the house. When, during his siege of the house, the victim tried to force open the door to the room on the fourth level of the house where some members of his family were located, appellant fired the fatal shot at the victim in order to protect his family from the victim. Clearly, appellant’s slaying of the victim constituted justifiable homicide.</p>
    <p id="b286-7" data-blocks='[["BL_286.8",286,[278,1118,1153,1112]]]'>Notwithstanding the victim’s violent and threatening conduct, the Majority concludes that appellant’s slaying of the victim could constitute voluntary manslaughter. The <em>only </em>evidence which the Majority cites to support such a finding is a statement given by appellant to the police wherein (according to the Majority) “appellant stated, that his wife was in the bedroom on the third level when the shooting occurred. . . . [T]hat statement made no mention as to whether anyone else, other than the victim, was on the fourth level at the time, or that Darell [the victim] was attempting to force his way into a room on that level.” The Majority attaches unwarranted significance to this statement — in fact, the statement adds nothing to the Commonwealth’s case. Even if appellant’s wife was in the third level bedroom (and not on the fourth level) when the shooting occurred, the fact remains that other members of appellant’s family were under attack on the fourth level at the time of the shooting. The Commonwealth’s evidence minimally establishes that there were family members under attack by the victim on the fourth floor — appellant’s statement is not contra to this.</p>
    <p id="b286-9" data-blocks='[["BL_286.9",286,[280,2264,1145,98]]]'>Thus, appellant’s slaying of the victim was justifiable; appellant should be discharged.</p>
