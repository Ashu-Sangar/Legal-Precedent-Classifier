Hamill is the widow of decedent, James Lyon Hamill II, and the life income beneficiary of a testamentary trust decedent created. Appellant primarily contends that appellee Industrial Valley Bank and Trust Company (IVB), executor of decedent’s estate and trustee, acted improperly in its management of the trust and the administration of the estate. Appellant seeks the removal and surcharge of IVB because appellant is dissatisfied with the amount of income produced by the trust. Appellant also contends that IVB, as executor, failed to fund the trust promptly, and, as trustee, failed to place the trust assets in investments providing a greater return. The Court of Com<a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>mon Pleas of Chester County, Orphans’ Court Division held that, on the basis of the evidence presented, appellant failed to demonstrate her entitlement to the relief requested.

Proceeds from the sale of the real estate ($225,000) were similarly invested. Thus at all times the assets of the decedent’s estate were producing income. These liquid investments were selected by IVB in anticipation of the payment of estate obligations which included, inter alia, anticipated federal income tax liability <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>resulting from decedent’s apparent failure to have filed returns or pay federal income taxes since 1943.</p>

The letters also sought to have IVB follow appellant’s advice on investment policy for the trust assets. In these letters appellant contended that the testamentary trust should be funded immediately and trust assets should be invested only in high interest, income producing long-term U.S. Treasury notes or high quality industrial bonds. Shortly thereafter IVB partially funded the trust by investing $180,000 in an “Income” fund and $120,000 in a “Stock” fund operated by IVB as a fiduciary of trust funds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> IVB retained the remaining estate assets in the previously described short term investments.

Thereafter IVB filed the account for audit. Appellant responded with twenty objections to the account and the orphans’ court scheduled an audit hearing, which was held on December 23,1976. On April 14, 1977, the orphans’ court decided both matters, denying appellant’s petition to remove and surcharge IVB and confirming the executor’s first and partial account. Appellant filed twenty exceptions to the confirmation of the account which were denied by the court.

    <p id="b666-4" data-blocks='[["BL_666.5",666,[270,481,1150,1122]]]'>The record reveals that IVB initially wrote the Internal Revenue Service to inquire about the possibility that decedent reported his income without keeping a personal record of his tax returns. After receiving confirmation that the IRS was unable to locate any recent returns for decedent, IVB began to prepare tax returns for the most recent years preceding decedent’s death. Those returns were based upon estimates of decedent’s income. On the basis of this record, the orphans’ court concluded that while IVB could “have moved more expeditiously in filing these tentative returns which it has now belatedly filed, it does not appear that even if it had done so, the ultimate problem would have yet been resolved or that there was any other or additional move which it could have made toward that end.” Because the executor was unable to ascertain the decedent’s income tax liability over the years, the orphans’ court held that IVB’s retention of some estate assets in liquid, short-term investments was necessary and proper to meet the anticipated tax liability. We agree with the orphans’ court that the decision to maintain liquidity to meet this potential tax claim against the estate was not an abuse of discretion by IVB.</p>
    <p id="b666-5" data-blocks='[["BL_666.6",666,[271,1637,1148,527]]]'>Appellant suggests without any support in the record that the potential, tax liability was not as extensive as IVB believed. It was appellant’s view that the IRS could not impose liability for failure to pay income taxes beyond the six or seven year period during which, appellant asserts, the IRS keeps taxpayer records. It merits note that appellant’s view is contrary to the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations, dealing with the tolling of the statute of limitations when a taxpayer fails to file a return. See I.R.C. § 6501(c)(3); Treas.Reg. § 301.6501(c)-l(c) (1967).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

A small percentage of the fund (4.8%) consisted of “Loans and Real Estate Mortgages,” “Preferred Stock,” “Convertible Preferred Stock,” “Common Stock” and “Cash.” The yield on this portion of the fund was just above 6%. Overall the “Income” fund yielded a 7.9% return on assets of approximately ten million dollars.</p>

This fund yielded income of 2.7% on assets totalling approximately six and one-half million dollars. IVB’s decision to invest the Hamill trust assets in these funds produced slightly more than a 6% return for the income beneficiary.</p>

Appellant, however, has presented no evidence to support this claim of impropriety. Because appellant has failed to show that this appointment of IVB as guardian has prejudiced her in any way, we decline to disturb the testator’s explicit direction that IVB act in both capacities.</p>
