    <p id="b120-12" data-blocks='[["BL_120.13",120,[266,1872,1149,484]]]'>The claim allowed was based on a debt evidenced by a bond which had been executed in 1961 in conjunction with a mortgage recorded on property of the decedent. Although in 1969 the claimant signed a marginal entry of satisfaction on the recorded mortgage, the trial court concluded that that entry was not intended to satisfy the underlying debt which had not been paid, and allowed the claim. Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish the claim against the estate. We do not agree.</p>

      <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>Appellee’s claim arose by reason of a bond and mortgage executed by the decedent on February 24, 1961 in the office of appellee’s attorney who had prepared the documents. No evidence was presented that any payment was ever made by the decedent to his brother, appellee. In 1969, appellee visited his attorney and told him that since he was not receiving payments on the mortgage he wanted to have the mortgage satisfied on the record so that he would not have to pay personal property taxes. The attorney prepared an instrument stating that the debt had been paid in full and the mortgage satisfied. Appellee refused to sign that instrument but later went to the Courthouse personally and signed a notation on the record that the mortgage was satisfied. The bond on which the claim was based and which had been in the possession of appellee’s attorney was introduced into evidence.</p>

They were substantially but not exactly the words prescribed by Act of Assembly, but neither the debt nor the bond are mentioned. ‘I, Andrew Fleming, do hereby acknowledge to have received satisfaction in full of this mortgage.’ These words, signed and sealed by the mortgagee, were all-sufficient to put the mortgage out of existence, and sufficient, too, to satisfy the debt, if so intended. <em>Prima facie </em>they would indeed import extinguishment of the debt as well as the mortgage, and the burden of showing they were not so intended was on the creditor; but when he submitted evidence on that point, proper for the consideration of the jury, it was for <em>them </em>to decide whether the words had been satisfactorily explained, as intended only to wipe off the mortgage. The error consisted in setting up a conclusive presumption of law, on grounds fitted only for a presumption of fact.” (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>
