Instead, he deliberately and expressly chose not to testify at that trial and invoked his fifth amendment privilege. By allowing a convicted criminal to have a retrial where his original trial was without blemish, simply to admit the testimony of a co-felon, who also was convicted of the same crime and who invoked his right not to testify as a witness at the time of the original trial, the Court condemns the Commonwealth to endless retrials and prevents a conviction from ever being final. Myers had the opportunity to testify for Sanabria at Sanabria’s trial. That should be enough. What does a criminal convicted of and sentenced for murder of the first degree have to lose by claiming that one or all of his co-defendants were not culpable? What is to stop sentenced co-defendants engaging in a “round robin” whereby each in turn states that he is the sole guilty party and the others were not involved? This situation is so fraught with abuse that it threatens to undermine our entire criminal justice process. The Opinion <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>in Support of Remand ignores this real danger by glibly stating that it “can see no persuasive justification” for not allowing a retrial on the basis of Myers’ change of heart.

Evidence adduced at trial showed that appellant provided the automobile employed in the commission of the instant crime, that he drove Myers and McCleary to and from the scene of the killing, that the tire iron was removed by Myers from appellant’s automobile and allegedly used to kill Ms. Bilger, that appellant fled to Florida on the day following the crime, and that in Florida appellant voluntarily confessed to his participation in the Bilger murder.

The record indicates appellant was not informed of the existence of the letter until March 27, 1978, four days after the filing of our opinion affirming the judgment of sentence.

Second, the court held the letter was not itself evidence, but merely reflected Myers’ intent that if called at a second trial he would testify favorably to appellant. Third, the court ruled that Myers’ proposed testimony was not after-discovered evidence within the contemplation of § 3(c)(13) of the Post Conviction Hearing Act.
