Noting that the option was not exercised by the designated optionee and that there was not compliance with other significant terms of the option, the court ruled that the ultimate sale of the real property was not pursuant to the option. The option was granted to the Concord Excavating Co., Inc. or its nominee. Under the stipulated facts, Concord did not assign its rights under the option to a nominee. No “Standard Agreement of Sale” was entered into as provided under the option. To the contrary, it is stipulated that Mr. or Mrs. Zizza telephoned the deceased’s personal representative and advised that if there were no objections, they would purchase the property. There was no written exercise of the option.

It is a fiction, therefore, invented to sustain and carry out the intention of the testator or settlor, never to defect it. Its application requires constant watchfulness to guard against the tendency to become a formal rule de jure without regard to its real purpose and necessity. It should never be overlooked that there is no real conversion. The property remains all the time in fact realty or personalty as it was, but for the purpose of the will, so far as it may be necessary, and only so far, it is treated in contemplation of law as if it had been converted. Few testators have any knowledge of the doctrine, or any actual intent to change the nature of their property, except when and to the extent that may be required to carry out the special purpose of the will. The presumption, therefore, no matter what the form of words used, is always against conversion; and even where it is required it must be kept within the limits of actual necessity. <em>Yerkes v.

She was indeed the primary object of the testator’s bounty, and not the grandchildren of the testator. The will clearly reflects an intention first to provide for Ms. Chase during her lifetime and only upon her death to pass whatever remained to his grandchildren. We, therefore, do not accept the court’s conclusion of an overriding intention to fund the residuary trust. To the contrary, a finding that the certificate of deposit passed directly to Ms. Chase under the bequeath made in paragraph three is more in keeping with the testator’s primary concern to adequately provide for appellant during her lifetime. The case cited by appellee concerning the definition of “cash” is not apposite in the present situation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In that case the Court was confronted with a bequest <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>solely of “cash.” Here the testator’s bequest to Ms. Chase was for all of his bonds, stocks, and cash, thereby intending her to receive all of his commercial paper. All of these financial documents — stocks, bonds, and the present certificate of deposit — represent liquid assets that are readily convertible into cash. It should be noted that most certificates of deposit can be redeemed prematurely within a certain time after the holder’s death without penalty, thereby enhancing their liquidity. To accurately define the meaning of the third paragraph of the will, we must employ the equitable maxim of <em>noscitur ex sociis, qui non cognoscitur, ex se. </em>That is, we must examine the bequest provided in the third paragraph as a whole and not be misled by interpretations of individual words. In so doing, the inescapable conclusion is that the testator intended Ms. Chase to receive the certificate of deposit along with his other financial paper.</p>

The Orphans’ Court was of the view that the only means of funding for the residuary trust was through the certificate of deposit. This overlooks both the rental income derived from the 303 Smithbridge Road property as well as the decedent’s attempt to sell that property. The First and Final Account of the Executors shows that the rental income was more than adequate to pay for the county and school taxes on the property, utilities, and insurance coverage. In addition, decedent provided for funding the residuary for the benefit of his children and grandchildren by directing in his will that the 303 Smithbridge Road property be sold after Ms. Chase’s death.

Both appellee and the lower court relied solely upon <em>Boyle’s Estate, </em>44 D. &amp; C. 316 (1942) as support for the contention that the certificate of deposit was not included in the gift to Ms. Chase. In that case the Court was presented with the question whether the testator’s gift of “all my cash, if any,” to his son encompassed his three savings accounts in separate banks. The Philadelphia County Orphans’ Court held that the savings accounts were not included in the gift and limited the bequest only to cash actually in the decedent’s possession at the time of his death. Even assuming <em>arguendo, </em>that the certificate of deposit presently before this Court is equivalent to the savings accounts dealt with in <em>Boyle’s Estate, </em>the gift to Ms. Chase of all of testator’s “bonds, shares of stock, and cash” is <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>substantially broader than the narrow gift of “cash” in <em>Boyle’s Estate. </em>We note that Pennsylvania long ago recognized that a certificate of deposit is subject to the same rules as are bonds, <em>see Commonwealth v.
