The majority concludes that the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County correctly heard and granted appellees’ petition for guardianship of the person of their granddaughter, R. L. L. The majority does so even though: (1) another court of this Commonwealth, the Court of Common Pleas of Cameron County, had already assumed jurisdiction in the matter and, after full hearing, entered an order that appellant, the child’s natural mother, is entitled to custody, (2) the Superior Court affirmed this order, and (3) appellees have failed to demonstrate why they could not present their claim in Cameron County. In my view, sound judicial discretion required the Washington County Orphans’ Court here to defer to the Court of Common Pleas of Cameron County and to dismiss appellees’ petition.</p>
