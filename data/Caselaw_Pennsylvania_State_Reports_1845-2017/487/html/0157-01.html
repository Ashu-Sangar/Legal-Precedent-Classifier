(Equibank) on June 3, 1975. On May 5, 1977, Equibank filed its first and final account. Appellant, Bob Garvin Agency, Inc. (Garvin), filed a timely objection to the account based on a claim the estate owed it the sum of $12,900.00 commission for procuring a purchaser for certain real property of the estate. Garvin and Equibank presented the case to the Orphans’ Court of Beaver County on written stipulations and briefs at an audit hearing on August 9, 1977, and, on January 9, 1978, the court entered an adjudication and decree nisi overruling Garvin’s objection and ordering distribution. Garvin filed exceptions to this adjudication which were overruled. From the final decree of the court, this appeal followed.</p>

The letter specifically stated “[w]e cannot for obvious reasons give you an exclusive” and solicited offers “so that we can discuss same with the heirs.” Asking prices of $129,000.00 for the 596-98 Third Avenue property and $39,000.00 for the 538 Third Avenue property were set forth, for a total of $168,000.00.</p>

The agreement contained two special clauses, which made the agreement contingent upon the ability of Kathary to obtain mortgage financing and to obtain a commitment from the lessee of one of the properties to extend its lease at an increased rent. The mortgage contingency further provided that, should Kathary be unable to obtain financing by a certain date, the agreement would be null and void and the handmoney returned.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Equibank informed Garvin by letter the offer was not acceptable to the heirs and suggested if Kathary was interested in making an offer closer to the asking prices, Garvin should forward new agreements to be submitted to the heirs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
