The statutory basis for ejectment in force at the time this case arose declared in sweeping language that the writ “shall issue in all cases where lands, tenements or hereditaments are claimed . . .” Act of April 13, 1807, P.L. 296, § 1, 12 P.S. § 1514.

      <p id="b326-8" data-blocks='[["BL_326.7",326,[297,1358,1119,850]]]'>Because the writ of ejectment was not a real property action, but originally was an action in trespass, it was not subject to the hypertechnical pleading rides which surrounded the common law real actions. This in part was responsible for the growth and popularity of ejectment. See generally Holdsworth, 7 History of English Law 4-10 (1926). Fee claimants seeking to take advantage of this simple means of determining title to realty, soon developed methods for using the writ. By a series of paper leases and fictitious claims they were able to frame their dispute to fit within the original pattern of the ousted tenant’s cause of action. As Blackstone characterized it, the method “entirely depends upon a string of legal fictions; no actual lease is made, no actual entry by the plaintiff, no actual ouster by the defendant; but all are merely ideal, for the sole purpose of trying the title.” 3 Blackstone, Commentaries * 203. By the seventeenth century this procedure had become so common that the English courts instituted reforms calculated to allow these claims without such contrivances. This was the beginning of the writ of ejectment as it exists today. It is ironic indeed that courts, in their willingness to determine title to property, have knowingly accepted wholly fictitious claims of lease, entry and ouster, but have been unwilling to provide a remedy to actual lessees, such as the Soffers, who do not make these fictitious claims.</p>

This result was based on the Court’s construction of certain provisions of our recording act, still in effect today, Act of May 28, 1715, 1 Sm.L. 94, § 5, 21 P.S. § 471 (1955 and Supp.1979). We note that the Soffers’ complaint alleges a lease for more than twenty-one years and proper recording. This would vest the Soffers with an estate for years and not an interesse termini. But whatever this distinction may mean in other contexts, we expressly refuse to make the availability of ejectment turn on such niceties. There is little to explain even the original usefulness of the common law distinction between an estate for years and an interesse termini; it has been rejected by text-writers who have called it “difficult to comprehend,” Tiffany, 1 The Law of Real Property 132 (3d ed. 1939), and it has been abolished by statute in England, Law of Property Act of 1925 § 149(1). We refuse to use the concept now to create an artificial barrier to the remedy of ejectment.</p>
