    <p id="b566-6" data-blocks='[["BL_566.6",566,[278,454,1153,632]]]'>In March of 1968, Howard Olsen was convicted by a jury in Berks County of assault and battery, assault with intent to ravish, indecent assault, kidnapping for extortion, and five separate counts of conspiracy. A motion in arrest of judgment of the convictions of kidnapping and two conspiracy charges was later sustained. Olsen was sentenced, on the convictions not arrested, to imprisonment in a state institution for a total term of six years and eight months to fifteen years, these sentences to run consecutively to a sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment imposed earlier in a federal court following conviction of charges arising from the same incident. No appeal was then entered.</p>
    <p id="b566-7" data-blocks='[["BL_566.7",566,[280,1106,1150,574]]]'>In October 1975, Olsen instituted an action seeking post-conviction relief. After a counseled evidentiary hearing, Olsen was granted permission by the trial court to file an appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>limited to the issue of the legality of the sentences. All other relief was denied. Olsen then filed two appeals in the Superior Court challenging the legality of the sentences, as well as the order of the trial court denying post-conviction relief. The appeals were consolidated and a divided Superior Court affirmed. <em>Commonwealth v. Olsen, </em><a href="/pa-super/247/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="247 Pa. Super. 513" data-case-ids="831271" data-case-paths="/pa-super/247/0513-01">247 Pa. Super. 513</a>, <a href="/pa-super/247/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="247 Pa.

    <p id="b566-8" data-blocks='[["BL_566.8",566,[280,1709,1149,258]]]'>Olsen maintains that his waiver of the assistance of counsel at trial and his failure to file “post-verdict motions” were not “voluntary, knowing and intelligent.” We conclude an intelligent evaluation of these complaints is impossible from the present record.</p>
    <p id="b566-9" data-blocks='[["BL_566.9",566,[279,1995,1150,366]],["BL_567.1",567,[207,312,1151,636]]]'>It appears that Olsen represented himself at trial, but was given the opportunity of counsel and advice by a public defender at the direction of the court. The transcribed notes of the trial do not disclose the circumstances under which Olsen was permitted and proceeded to represent himself and, hence, it is impossible to determine if Olsen waived his right to counsel effectively. In its opinion <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>denying post-conviction relief, the hearing court judge, who was also the trial judge, stated “that the defendant [Olsen] came into the courtroom for trial prepared to represent himself and insisted on doing so, although advised by the trial judge that he had a right to have counsel appointed for him if he so desired.” This statement is not, without more, adequate to establish an effective waiver of the constitutional right to trial counsel. However, whether this issue has been preserved for review depends upon whether or not Olsen withdrew his post-verdict motion for a new trial knowingly and understandingly. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Via, </em><a href="/pa/455/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="455 Pa. 373" data-case-ids="582141" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0373-01">455 Pa. 373</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=316%20A.2d%20895" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="316 A.2d 895">316 A.2d 895</a> (1974).</p>
    <p id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[209,982,1151,580]]]'>As noted before, Olsen represented himself at trial. Post trial he appeared in court with the public defender as his counsel. Counsel made an oral motion to arrest certain of the convictions. The motion was sustained. Then in answer to questions by his counsel, Olsen told the court that, after discussions with his counsel, he “did not want to proceed with the motions for a new trial,” and “I have no desire to file a motion for a new trial.” Unfortunately, however, the record does not show whether or not Olsen was made aware of the effect his withdrawal of the motion for a new trial would have on appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Under this earlier rule, the defendant need not have been explicitly advised on the record in a colloquy; however, the record must show somewhere that the defendant was aware of the appellate consequences of a <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>waiver before he could be said to have made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to file post-verdict motions. See <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b568-5" data-blocks='[["BL_568.5",568,[261,531,1152,353]]]'>Olsen also complains the trial court did not state of record the reasons for ordering that his state court sentences run consecutively to the sentence imposed in the federal court on charges arising out of the same incident. It is urged that our rulings in <em>Commonwealth v. Riggins </em>[hereinafter: <em>Riggins </em>], <a href="/pa/474/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="474 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="1732146" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0115-01">474 Pa. 115</a>, <a href="/pa/474/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="474 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="1732146" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0115-01">377 A.2d 140</a> (1977), mandate a resentencing.</p>
    <p id="b568-6" data-blocks='[["BL_568.6",568,[261,901,1151,709]]]'>The sentencing requirement in <em>Riggins </em>was announced on August 17, 1977. Olsen was sentenced in March 1968. He did not file a timely appeal from the sentences, but was subsequently given permission to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>We must consider, therefore, whether Olsen is entitled to have <em>Riggins </em>applied to judgments of sentence imposed some nine years before <em>Riggins </em>was decided. We conclude not. In <em>Commonwealth v. Faison, </em><a href="/pa/437/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="437 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="1927806" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0432-01">437 Pa. 432</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=264%20A.2d%20394" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="264 A.2d 394">264 A.2d 394</a> (1970), this Court considered whether Faison could raise on direct appeal, the appeal having been filed <em>nunc pro tunc </em>as a result of post-conviction proceedings, issues based on constitutional rights enunciated subsequent to the imposition of Faison’s original judgment of sentence. The Court held that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b568-7" data-blocks='[["BL_568.7",568,[303,1631,1109,302]]]'>“an appellant may press on a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appeal an issue premised on a constitutional right which was enunciated subsequent to his original judgment of sentence, provided that this right has been given such retroactive effect that it would have been available to appellant had an appeal been timely filed.”</blockquote>

      <em>Commonwealth v.

Although the instant matter does not involve the application of subsequently announced <em>constitutional </em>rights, the reasoning in <em>Commonwealth v. Faison, </em>supra, is nevertheless applicable. The sentencing court should not be expected to anticipate the application of a sentencing requirement announced nine years after judgments of sentence had been imposed.</p>
