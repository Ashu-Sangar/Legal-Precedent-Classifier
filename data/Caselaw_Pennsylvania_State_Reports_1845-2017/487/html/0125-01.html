The court dismissed the petition on the ground that appellants failed to establish a case for termination of the parental rights of appellee, G.R.Y., the natural mother. Although the court found that appellee failed to maintain contact with <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>D.J.Y. for a period of six months, it also found that appellee’s failure was attributable to appellants’ deliberate actions designed to thwart appellee’s attempts to contact her son. We conclude that the orphans’ court findings are supported by the evidence and affirm the decree.</p>
    <p id="b192-5" data-blocks='[["BL_192.5",192,[285,588,1150,406]]]'>D.J.Y. was born on March 29, 1970 to appellee and her husband. For the first few months of D.J.Y.’s life, the family lived in the home of appellants. Appellee’s marital relationship with her husband deteriorated and she left the home. D.J.Y. remained in appellants’ care. Between 1971 and 1974, DJ.Y.’s parents attempted to reconcile and re-establish a family household. During this time, D.J.Y. continued to reside with appellants.</p>
    <p id="b192-6" data-blocks='[["BL_192.6",192,[285,1012,1148,353]]]'>On September 2, 1977, appellants filed a petition for the adoption of D.J.Y. At the hearing on the petition, appellants testified that appellee had failed to perform her parental duties from 1974 to 1977. They claimed that appellee, during that period, never contacted, met or supported D.J.Y., and thus appellee’s parental rights should terminate pursuant to section 311(1) of the Adoption Act of 1970.</p>

According to appellee, the grandfather forced her to leave the home in 1971 and would not permit her to take D.J.Y. Between 1971 to 1973, appellee saw D.J.Y. sporadically, always at appellants’ home. When appellee and her husband reunited in 1973, she sought to have D.J.Y. live with them. Her husband, however, told her that they did not have room for D.J.Y. in their one room apartment, and could not afford to keep him. Further, her husband told her that appellants had “custody” of D.J.Y. and would care for the child until they, the parents, were able to improve their financial situation and find more spacious living quarters. During that time appellee visited her son at appellants’ home, but was unable to enjoy a mother-son visitation with D.J.Y. because the grandfather’s “rules” prohibited her from interacting with the boy. On a few occasions, D.J.Y. was permitted to visit with appellee at her home. These visits, how<a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>ever, never lasted overnight, as the grandfather would not permit it. Appellee stated that because she had been informed that appellants had “custody,” and because she thought her husband still planned to bring D.J.Y. back when financially able, she never contested the visitation arrangements. She also testified that, based on threats, she feared that appellants would call the police to have her arrested if she attempted to establish a more extensive relationship with her son.</p>

When appellee asked her husband about the return of D.J.Y., he always responded that they would regain custody of D.J.Y. when they were better situated. Appellee then began to suspect that her husband had no intention of regaining custody of D.J.Y. Their relationship deteriorated, and appellee again left her husband in November, 1974. Appellee then offered to allow her husband to visit the couple’s other son who was in appellee’s custody, if he would arrange for her to visit D.J.Y. Although appellee carried out her part of the bargain, her husband arranged only one visit with D.J.Y. for her.</p>

Her testimony indicated that gifts she sent to D.J.Y. were not passed along to him by appellants and that her attempts to see D.J.Y. on the street in front of appellants’ home met with great resistance. At one point appellants told appellee not to walk on their side of the street, or they would call the police. Appellee indicated that she last sent D.J.Y. a birthday gift in the early part of 1976. Her other contacts with D.J.Y. were reduced to attempts to see him on the playground at school or sometimes on the street.</p>

We agree with the orphans’ court determination that on this <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>record appellee’s failure to pursue legal actions does not compel a conclusion that her conduct in attempting to maintain parental contact with her son was unreasonable. As this Court stated in <em>Adoption of S.H., </em>where a parent makes reasonable attempts to overcome obstacles created by the party seeking to terminate parental rights, “a mere showing that the [parent] could conceivably have pursued legal action more promptly cannot justify termination of [parental] rights.” <em>Adoption of S.H., </em><a href="/pa/476/0608-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="476 Pa. 608" data-case-ids="1736905" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0608-01">476 Pa. 608</a>, 616, <a href="/pa/476/0608-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="476 Pa. 608" data-case-ids="1736905" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0608-01">383 A.2d 529</a>, 533 (1978); see also <em>Adoption of McAhren, </em><a href="/pa/460/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="460 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="482851" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0063-01">460 Pa. 63</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="460 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="482851" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0063-01">331 A.2d 419</a> (1975).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

A decree terminating the rights of the natural parents must be entered prior to the consideration of the child’s best interests with respect to who might become the adoptive parent(s).
