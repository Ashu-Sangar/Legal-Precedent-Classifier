It is thus argued that the only proper plaintiff would be a husband who requested <em>in rem </em>enforcement of support payments and not one who merely objected to the <em>in rem </em>enforcement of such claims at the wife’s behest. This argument cannot be squared with the meaning of Pennsylvania’s Equal Rights Amendment. Here, the husband is claiming that the challenged statute burdens or disadvantages him because of his sex. The Equal Rights Amendment reaches enactments which impose different burdens as well as different benefits upon individuals based on the fact that they may be a man or woman. <em>Henderson v.

Thus, when the term “jurisdiction” was used in these decisions, the Court was referring to whether jurisdiction was vested in a court of equity as opposed to the court of quarter sessions. Since the 1968 amendment, subject matter jurisdiction over support matters is unquestionably vested in the court of common pleas and disputes as to the appropriate division no longer raise jurisdictional issues. <em>Posner v.
