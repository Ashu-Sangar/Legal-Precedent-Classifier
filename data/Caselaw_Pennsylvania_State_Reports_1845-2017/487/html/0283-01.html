Appellant contends that the verified primary expense return filed by Judge Wekselman proves that Judge Wekselman has violated various provisions of the Election Code. From this contention, he argues that an audit of the Judge’s campaign finances is unnecessary and that Judge Wekselman should, therefore, be immediately removed from his office pursuant to § 1851 of the Election Code. Brunwasser maintains that, unless he is allowed to pursue this independent action to enforce § 1851, that section “will still remain the law but be impossible to enforce. Candidates will then be advised that the Election Code is toothless and being human may be tempted to ignore it.” Appellant’s Brief at 22. Brunwasser acknowledges that, after the § 1611 audit, the Election Code devolves upon the various district attorneys the duty to enforce the Code through criminal prosecutions where the circumstances warrant such action, § 1611(c), 25 P.S. § 3231(c), and imposes upon the state attorney general the responsibility to institute in appropriate cases quo warranto proceedings against these candidates or elected officials, § 1612, 25 P.S. § 3232. Ignoring these provisions, Brunwasser insists that the entire enforcement mechanism created by the Election Code is ineffective unless he is allowed to pursue the instant mandamus action. We disagree.</p>

The enunciation of matters of public policy is fundamentally within the power of the legislature. See, <em>Knecht v. Saint Mary’s Hospital, </em><a href="/pa/392/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="392 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="8844984" data-case-paths="/pa/392/0075-01">392 Pa. 75</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=140%20A.2d%2030" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="140 A.2d 30">140 A.2d 30</a> (1958). While the courts may in a proper case, in the absence of a legislative pronouncement, determine what is against public policy, as stated in <em>Mamlin </em>v. <em>Genoe, </em><a href="/pa/340/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="340 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1203320" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0320-01">340 Pa. 320</a>, 321, at 325, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.2d%20407" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="17 A.2d 407">17 A.2d 407</a>, at 409 (1941): “It is only when a given policy is so obviously for or against the public health, safety, morals or welfare that there is a virtual unanimity of opinion in regard to it, that a court may constitute itself the voice of the community in so declaring.” See also, <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

This is not such a case. More importantly, the legislature has spoken and provided the remedy for resolving such matters and specifically designated the tribunal for such determination. If it intended to give jurisdictional power to a court of equity, such could easily have been expressed. As stated recently by this Court in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Fox </em>v. <em>Swing, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/409/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="409 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1883212" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0241-01">409 Pa. at 246</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=186%20A.2d%2024" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="186 A.2d 24">186 A.2d at 27</a>, “It is not for us to legislate or by interpretation to add to legislation matters which the legislature saw fit not to include.”</blockquote>

In addition to the procedural facts concerning the instant action, it is important also to recognize that appellant Brunwasser and Judge Wekselman have frequently clashed. This running battle culminated in an order by Judge Wekselman finding Brunwasser in contempt for failing to file tax returns or pay his taxes. Brunwasser was a guest of the Allegheny County Jail for five and one-half days until we stayed Judge Wekselman’s contempt order pending the resolution of Brunwasser’s appeal to the Commonwealth Court. That court has recently affirmed Judge Wekselman’s orders. <em>City of Pittsburgh v. Brunwasser, </em>40 Pa.Cmwlth. 197, <a href="/citations/?q=396%20A.2d%20907" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="396 A.2d 907">396 A.2d 907</a> (1979). Appellant concedes that there is a large measure of antagonism between he and Judge Wekselman and the vindictive nature of the instant lawsuit is readily apparent.

The statutory requirement of a petition signed by five electors is one method by which the legislature sought to avoid spite suits instituted by defeated candidates and their supporters.

Although §§ 1611 and 1612 use the word “shall” in relation to seeking criminal prosecution and quo warranto respectively, this should not be interpreted as depriving the local district attorney or the attorney general of their traditional and inherent prosecutorial discretion.

There it is stated if an audit uncovers violation of the Election Code, the court “shall certify its decision to the appropriate prosecutorial officer and it shall thereupon be the duty of such officer to institute criminal proceedings as he or she shall deem necessary.” 25 P.S. § 3256(b).</p>

Nor do we accept Brunwasser’s absurd claim that only through his mandamus action can the citizens of Allegheny County be protected from judges and other elected officials who are lawbreakers in their own right. If an audit of Judge Wekselman’s campaign finances had uncovered violations of a degree to warrant criminal prosecution or an action for quo warranto and the district attorney or the attorney general failed to act, a mandamus action could then be brought to compel these officers to perform their official responsibilities. However, Brunwasser elected to ignore the established procedure and attempted to assert his judgment in place of that of the duly elected officials in the first instance.</p>
