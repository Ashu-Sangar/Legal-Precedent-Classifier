The officers of the Board informed appellant that the Board would lease a substantial portion of the warehouse if it were constructed to meet the Board’s needs. Shortly thereafter, on September 8, 1972, the appellant granted the Pennsylvania Department of Property and Supplies (now the Department of General Services) a ninety-day option to lease warehouse space for the use of the Board. The option incorporated the terms and specifications that the Board’s officers had given appellant and, subsequent to its execution, appellant altered its plans and completed construction of the building in conformance with those specifications.</p>

Appellant, however, alleges that the acts and statements of officers of the Liquor Control Board nevertheless led it to believe that the Board could and would enter into the lease. Appellant argues that since it detrimentally relied on these acts and statements, they are actionable under the doctrine of estoppel set forth in § 90 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. This argument ignores the fact that the Liquor Control Board, and thus its officers, are by statute without power to enter into such leases and expressly prohibited from doing the same.

Although the Board declined to award appellant lost profits on its proposed lease agreement with the Liquor Control Board, see Administrative Code of 1929, Act of April 9, 1929, P.L. 177, § 2402(d), as amended, 71 P.S. § 632(d) (1962), it could and did reasonably conclude that in fairness the Commonwealth should pay appellant monies appellant expended to prepare the premises for the Liquor Control Board.
