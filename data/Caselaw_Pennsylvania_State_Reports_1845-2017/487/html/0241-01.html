We, however, find the jurisdictional defect to be even more fundamental.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In the instant case, there exists no order from the Court of Common Pleas declaring a statute of the Commonwealth invalid as repugnant to the Constitution as is required for jurisdiction under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 722(7). Judge Papadakos did not by his Order of August 29 declare the Pennsylvania foreign attachment procedures unconstitutional. The foreign attachment provisions had been ruled unconstitutional some years earlier by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in <em>Jonnet, <a href="/f2d/530/1123-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="530 F.2d 1123" data-case-ids="621453" data-case-paths="/f2d/530/1123-01">supra,</a> </em>and subsequently by this Court in <em>Schreiber, <a href="/pa/473/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="473 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="1730289" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0614-01">supra.</a> </em>Thus, the Court of Common Pleas merely applied the existing law to the facts of the case before it. In ordering the bond dissolved and cancelled, Judge Papadakos effectively applied the rule of <em>Jonnet </em>and <em>Schreiber </em>retrospectively. Such action is certainly not the same as actually declaring the Pennsylvania foreign attachment provisions to be repugnant to the constitution.</p>

In addition to disputing the issue on the merits, FMI filed a Motion to Dismiss Appeal, decision on which was deferred by Order of this Court pending oral argument. FMI’S motion was grounded upon the following contentions: (1) that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the Order from which the appeal is taken is interlocutory in nature and (2) that the question appellant seeks to have reviewed is moot. Having determined that we do not have appellate jurisdiction over this matter, we do not consider either of these points.</p>
