Although a number of issues have been raised for our consideration, we need only discuss two. First, whether appellant is entitled to a reversal of this conviction and further prosecution barred for the failure of the Commonwealth to bring him to trial within 180 days from his arrest pursuant to Rule 1100. Second, whether he is entitled to a new trial because he was not given the opportunity, in violation of former Criminal Procedure Rule 203, to challenge the array of the grand jury that indicted him. For the reasons set forth below, we believe that the latter remedy is appropriate and grant a new trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The following chronology is required to fully understand the question raised. On December 28, 3974, appellant and two other men robbed and severely beat the owner of a sporting goods store. On January 10, 1975, appellant was arrested in New Jersey on unrelated charges. On February 9, the victim died as a result of the beating and on February 11, a criminal complaint was filed charging appellant with murder. Bucks County officials on February 13 forwarded a copy of the complaint and arrest warrant to and lodged a detainer on appellant with New Jersey officials where appellant was then incarcerated for offenses against that jurisdiction. On February 21, appellant wrote to the Bucks County District Attorney disclosing his location in a New Jersey jail, requested a speedy trial, and waived extradition to Pennsylvania.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> On April 2, Stokes, a co-participant, agreed to testify against appellant, but on April 5 he changed his mind. When the bill of indictment charging appellant with murder was presented to the grand jury on April 18, Stokes invoked his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination and the grand jury dismissed the indictment for lack of evidence. The Bucks County authorities notified the New Jersey officials that the arrest warrant and the detainer lodged against appellant were withdrawn and the papers that had been forwarded by Bucks County were returned on April 23. August 11 represented the 180th day from the filing of the complaint.</p>

The District Attorney then had Douglas returned to Pennsylvania on October 21 and on November 19, Douglas plead guilty to the robbery of the victim and agreed to testify against appellant. That same day, November 19, the District Attorney obtained leave of court to re-submit appellant’s indictment to a new grand jury. Two days later, November 21, appellant was returned to Pennsylvania from a New Jersey jail. On December 5, Douglas testified before the second grand jury which then approved the murder indictment against appellant. That same day appellant was arraigned. Trial began on January 26, 1976.</p>

The prosecution’s case against appellant at that point depended almost entirely upon the testimony of Stokes, who refused to testify. Prior to Douglas’ expression of willingness to cooperate, the Commonwealth had no reason to believe that they could ever successfully prosecute appellant after Stokes had refused to testify.

These cases only establish that Rule 1100 requires a viable complaint to start its time periods running and that speedy trial considerations do not enter into the case until an effective complaint has been filed. The complaint in this case was unquestionably viable, in fact no subsequent complaint was ever issued. The prosecution faltered here because its anticipated evidence did not materialize. The 66 days expended between the filing of the complaint and the failure of the grand jury to indict are required to be counted in the Rule 1100 computation, and the counting resumed with the indictment by the second grand jury, leaving the Commonwealth a total of 114 days remaining in which to bring the appellant to trial.

In the present case no other charges lodged against the appellant survived the refusal of the grand jury to indict. Accordingly, Rule 131(b) and <em>Earp </em>are irrelevant to the instant discussion.</p>

The public is concerned with the effective prosecution of criminal cases, both to restrain those guilty of crime and to deter those contemplating it”). To accept the appellant’s position would be tantamount to a judicial creation of a limitation on a murder prosecution where the legislature has specifically declined to impose such a restraint. We do not believe that the mandate of Rule 1100 or the dictates of the speedy trial guarantee require such a result.</p>
