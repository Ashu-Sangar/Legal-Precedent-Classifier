Appellant reasons that if issues were not too frivolous to have been grounds for pre-trial motions, they should be treated as being just as meritorious in the post-trial stage, and that counsel fails as a zealous advocate by not pursuing all such issues on appeal. We disagree. After adversary hearings on pre-trial motions, issues raised therein may lose their appearance of arguable merit. Furthermore, the mere filing of motions does not guarantee that issues raised therein have a reasonable possibility of being found meritorious. Were appellant’s reasoning to be accepted, the decision to appeal would become a perfunctory process requiring counsel, for their own protection, to file appeals whenever defendants have “nothing to lose” because of the possibility, however unreasonably remote, of unexpected appellate results. Counsel’s discretion to avoid raising issues devoid of arguable merit preserves the court system for hearing legitimate issues as expeditiously as possible.</p>

It is asserted that trial counsel, hoping to prevent hardship from delay, and believing an appeal would not likely be successful, advised against appealing without suggesting possible grounds for appeal and without explaining the need to file post-trial motions. However, counsel testified to having <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>conferred with appellant on the day of the conviction and to having explained in considerable detail appellate options available. The conference was evidenced by a letter written later that day which appellant admitted to having received from counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> This admission weighs strongly against the credibility of the assertion that appellate rights were not explained.</p>
    <p id="b603-5" data-blocks='[["BL_603.6",603,[203,685,1150,581]],["BL_604.1",604,[275,310,1150,938]]]'>After the conviction, according to trial counsel, appellant never expressed interest in a timely appeal. Indeed, at sentencing, appellant said he wanted rehabilitation and didn’t care whether he received it in a state hospital or in a penal institution. The court below found further doubt cast upon appellant’s credibility because, on direct examination, appellant claimed that counsel never discussed a strategy for the sentencing hearing but on cross-examination an admission was obtained that such a discussion possibly did occur. Appellant denied receiving a letter from counsel promising a visit to explain sentencing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Counsel did not specifically <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>recall keeping this appointment but testified that he made numerous visits to confer with appellant and believed all commitments were kept. Appellant’s final assertion with regard to the knowing and voluntary waiver of appeal issue is that the record indicates he held a misapprehension that appeal and treatment were mutually exclusive options. However, our review of the record does not confirm such a misunderstanding, and, in view of the heretofore discussed advice given appellant with respect to appellate options, we find that the assertion of such a misapprehension lacks basis for credibility. The record confirms that appellant’s main concern was with prompt treatment, but not that appellant believed taking an appeal would foreclose treatment. Finally, the record of the March 1, 1974 sentencing hearing contains a dialogue which indicates that appellant had previously been advised of post-trial options and the effect of failure to exercise those options.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

      <p id="b602-7" data-blocks='[["BL_602.7",602,[297,1074,1118,474]]]'>The first statements were made shortly after the crime, when having abandoned his victim in a remote area, appellant drove to a hospital under his own free will and made spontaneous statements to a physician about the crime in an effort to locate and save the victim. While these statements were being made, appellant was administered a mild tranquilizer which the physician testified at the suppression hearing would not have a disorienting effect and, in fact, may have promoted an organized comprehension by appellant of his situation. After examining the suppression hearing testimony, we find no arguable merit to contentions that appellant was unaware of the nature of his statements or was critically impaired in his ability to refrain from making the same.</p>

Appellant moved to suppress these on the ground that he was not advised of his rights before making these statements. Our review of the record supports the finding of the court below that there would not be arguable merit to an assertion that the statements resulted from custodial interrogation. The statements were voluntary, spontaneous utterances intended to assist police in searching for the victim and were not elicited through questioning.</p>

Although these statements may have been subject to suppression by authority of a case decided almost two years after appellant’s trial, <em>Michigan v.
