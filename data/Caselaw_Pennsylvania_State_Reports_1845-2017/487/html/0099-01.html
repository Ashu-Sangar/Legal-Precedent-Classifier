S. This later decree reverses an earlier decree dated July 17, 1978 which upheld the parental rights of appellants in Y. S. We agree with the Orphans’ Court decree and therefore, affirm.</p>

In the early part of 1976, the appellants, the natural parents of Y. S., who lived in Ohio, separated because of marital difficulties. Y. S. continued to live with her mother who was employed. Then, in April of 1976, Y. S. was sent to live with her paternal grandparents in Cleveland, Ohio as Y. S.’s mother was encountering too many difficulties in working and trying to care for Y. S. The paternal grandparents had the natural parents sign a voluntary custody agreement for Y. S. The paternal grandparents then delivered Y. S. to appellees, Mr. and Mrs. H. on April 16,1976, who resided in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. The transfer to the appellees initially was not for the purpose of adoption. From April 16, 1976 until the latter part of July, 1976, Y. S. resided primarily with appellees. There were ten occasions when Y. S. was returned to the paternal grandparents in Cleveland. On each visit, Y. S. stayed with her grandparents for only a “few <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>days”. Each time Y. S. was returned to appellees. In July of 1976, the appellees informed the grandparents that these arrangements could no longer persist, and that appellees must either be allowed to adopt Y. S. or they would return her to the grandparents.</p>

There, appellants signed a voluntary written consent to Y. S.’s adoption. Later in August, 1976, appellants contacted counsel in Ohio who informed appellees’ counsel that appellants were withdrawing their consent, and wanted Y. S. returned to them. When appellees were informed of appellants’ change of attitude, they refused to return Y. S.</p>

S. was in appellees’ custody and care, she was returned for several visits requested by her paternal grandparents. The excuse that was given was that appellants wanted to see their child, but there is nothing in the record to indicate that appellants visited Y. S. while she was at-her paternal grandparents’ house in Cleveland. Appellees then would drive Y. S. back from Pennsylvania to the paternal grandparents’ house in Cleveland. These visits were only for a few days, and then Y. S. would be returned to appellees. Once the voluntary adoption petition was signed by appellants on August 3, 1976, the requests for the return of Y. S. stopped completely. During the entire period from the end of July, 1976 to July 12, 1977 and afterwards, appellants had no contact with their daughter. The appellants did not telephone Y. S., send her birthday or Christmas cards, and did not visit her. No financial support was given to Y. S. by appellants during that period. Appellants also did not inquire about Y. S.’s well-being.

S. during the period from August 3, 1976 to July 12, 1977 was on the advice of counsel. In the <em>Matter of Adoption of David C., </em><a href="/pa/479/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="479 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1742103" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0001-01">479 Pa. at 11</a>, <a href="/pa/479/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="479 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1742103" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0001-01">387 A.2d 804</a>, <em>the Court suggests that attorney’s advice is not sufficient justification for refusal or failure to visit a </em>child, <em>and we here on this record, so hold. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>
    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[266,674,1155,710]]]'>The reliance on the language in the <em>Matter of Adoption of David C., supra, </em>is completely misplaced.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> In that case, the Court merely stated that the fact that an attorney, whose relationship with the appellant therein was not defined, had advised the father that he would probably not be awarded custody or the right to extended visitation privileges did not preclude the father from attempting to remain in communication with the child. In the <em>Matter of the Adoption of David C., supra, </em>there was not a specific direction not to attempt to communicate with the child as was the case here. To infer from the parent’s compliance with counsel’s advice an abandonment or neglect is not only logically unsound, but it also dangerously undermines the relationship between client and counsel.</p>
    <p id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.6",170,[266,1411,1148,144]]]'>I do agree that the record established other conduct which would justify the termination of parental rights. I, therefore, concur in the result.</p>

      <p id="b170-7" data-blocks='[["BL_170.7",170,[270,1593,799,32]]]'>. The portion of the opinion in question states:</p>
      <blockquote id="b170-8" data-blocks='[["BL_170.8",170,[333,1635,1085,621]]]'>For the first seven and one-half years of David’s life, appellee totally neglected his son. When his two letters to David’s mother concerning visitation rights, sent in December, 1968, and May, 1969, went unanswered, appellee made no other affirmative efforts and instituted no legal proceedings to obtain visitation or custody rights. <em>He testified that he did not visit because an attorney he once consulted advised him that a court probably would not award appellee custody or allow the child to visit appellee in appellee’s home because of the child’s tender years. </em>Even if the attorney was right as to custody and extended visits with the child in appellee’s home, the advice given in no way justifies appellee’s refusal or failure to visit with David in Harrisburg. Writing two letters in nine years hardly constitutes the sort of effort that a parent who wants to maintain a place of importance in a child’s life would make in order to ensure his ability to see the child and protect his parental rights.</blockquote>
