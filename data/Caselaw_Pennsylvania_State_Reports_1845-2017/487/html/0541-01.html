Following a trial before a court sitting without a jury on February 23, 1973, appellant was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Motions for a new trial and an arrest of judgment were filed by appellant and these motions were denied on December 17, 1973. Appellant was thereupon sentenced to serve a three to twelve year term of imprisonment.</p>

Subsequently, he filed a pro se Post Conviction Hearing Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> petition on June 20, 1977. Counsel was appointed for appellant who then filed an amended PCHA petition on October 14, 1977.

Addressing first the assertion that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to perfect an appeal, it must be emphasized that this is not a claim of a denial of <em>Douglas </em>rights. <em>See Douglas v.

There is no claim that he did not understand these rights or that he at any point requested trial counsel to file an appeal. Moreover, although appellant testified during the PCHA hearing, his testimony was confined to the second issue raised in this appeal.

To state the question is to answer it. Appellant’s sister, Mrs. Saunders, testified that she and other members of the family of appellant engaged trial counsel for appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> She stated that trial counsel had promised the family that he would file an appeal on her brother’s behalf.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Even if we gave credence to her <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>statements, which the hearing court did not, we fail to see how that testimony constitutes ineffective assistance in counsel’s representation of his client, appellant.
