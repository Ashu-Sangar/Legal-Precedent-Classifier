Tippins, delivered sixteen savings account passbooks to her son, George W. Tippins. Fourteen of these accounts were in the name of the decedent “in trust for” others, and the remaining two accounts were joint accounts with right of survivor-ship in the name of decedent and her son. The decedent, who supported herself with a substantial dividend income, was 79 years of age at the time she transferred possession of the savings passbooks and had decided that she required the <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>type of care which she would receive in a nursing home. As decedent gave the passbooks to her son, she stated that she had no need for the funds, and that her son should take charge of the accounts and see to it that the money was paid to the named beneficiaries at such time as they displayed a need for it.</p>

He was told to supply a power of attorney. He complied with this request, and the banks sent him signature cards which he completed and returned to them. From that time forward, the bank statements and correspondence pertaining to the accounts were mailed to the son at his office. However, unbeknownst to the son, these steps had not effected a change in the names or form of the accounts, but had merely added his name to them as his mother’s attorney in fact.</p>

Consequently, no distributions had been made to the beneficiaries during decedent’s lifetime, and the funds on deposit in the accounts as of February 9, 1970 (the date of the transfer of the passbooks), along with the accrued interest thereon, were intact as of the date of decedent’s death.</p>

The efforts made by decedent’s son to transfer the joint accounts into his name only were, because of a misunderstanding with the bank, ineffectual and the accounts remained joint accounts governed by the original agreement between decedent, her son, and the bank. That agreement provides in pertinent part that decedent and her son were to hold as “joint tenants with right of survivor-ship” and that the bank was “directed to act pursuant to any one or more of the joint tenants’ signatures ... in any manner in connection with [these] accounts]”. Thus, decedent’s right to withdraw the funds was not extinguished and she was not divested of “all dominion over the property”. The delivery was, therefore, incomplete, and the decedent’s interest in the joint accounts passed not by gift but by right of survivorship. As such, it is taxable under § 241 of the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act.</p>

The chancellor considered these circumstances and found them to be unpersuasive (e. g. decedent’s son explained his reasons for not making distributions and, as we said in <em>Sayre’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/443/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="443 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="1937068" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0548-01">443 Pa. 548</a>, 552, <a href="/citations/?q=279%20A.2d%2051" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="279 A.2d 51">279 A.2d 51</a>, 53 (1971), the decedent’s failure to treat the transactions properly on her federal tax returns “could be the result of her misunderstanding of the Federal tax laws”). The Commonwealth’s argument thus goes only to the credibility and weight to be assigned to this testimony and, as such, it misconstrues this Court’s responsibility on appeal — “[t]he test is not whether we, the appellate court, would have reached the same result had we been acting as the hearing judge who saw and heard the witness, ‘ “but rather whether a judicial mind, on due consideration of the evidence as a whole, could reasonably have reached the conclusion of the chancellor” ’.” <em>Masciantonio Will, </em><a href="/pa/392/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="392 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="8845544" data-case-paths="/pa/392/0362-01">392 Pa. 362</a>, 367, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20A.2d%20362" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="141 A.2d 362">141 A.2d 362</a>, 365 (1958).</p>
