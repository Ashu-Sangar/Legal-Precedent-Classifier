There, the natural children asserted that a prior determination of this Court involving the same trust and excluding the adopted claimants made the adopteds’ subsequent claim res judicata. Although the adopted children’s right to future distributions was denied in that case on other grounds, a majority of this Court refused to hold the new claim barred by res judicata.

In <em>DeRoy </em>income from a testamentary trust was to be paid to the testator’s son for the son’s life. On the son’s death the trust principal was to be distributed to the son’s children or their issue. In default of children or issue the son’s wife was to take a life estate. On the wife’s death the trust corpus was to revert to the testator’s estate. In 1933 the son died without natural children, but left an adopted child. The orphans’ court appointed a guardian ad litem for the child and held a hearing at which the principal question was the adopted child’s right to the trust. Based on the then current law the court refused to distribute the trust to the adopted child and instead awarded the son’s wife a life estate. Forty-five years later, on the occasion of the wife’s death, the adopted child again sought to take the property. The orphans’ court, like the orphans’ court in the present case, refused to allow the adopted child to participate on the ground that the prior adjudication barred the <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>child’s claim. This Court reversed. The opinion announcing the judgment of this Court in <em>DeRoy </em>relied upon the principle we have already recited that a ruling of law by the orphans’ court in the distribution of a portion of an estate is not binding upon a subsequent adjudication relating to another portion of the estate. <a href="/pa/481/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="481 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="1747319" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0403-01">481 Pa. at 409-410</a>, <a href="/pa/481/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="481 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="1747319" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0403-01">392 A.2d at 1358</a>.</p>

This argument is completely meritless. Of course, if the language of testator’s will disclosed testator’s intention with reasonable certainty that intention would be controlling. <em>Estate of Sykes, </em><a href="/pa/477/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="477 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="1738246" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0254-01">477 Pa. 254</a>, <a href="/pa/477/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="477 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="1738246" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0254-01">383 A.2d 920</a> (1978); <em>Estate of Flinn, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/479/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="479 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="1742096" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0312-01">479 Pa. at 318-21</a>, <a href="/pa/479/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="479 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="1742096" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0312-01">388 A.2d at 675-76</a> (1978). The relevant portions of the will, however, simply úse the words “children” and “issue.” There is nothing in these words to indicate any clear intention one way or the other with regard to adopted children. See <em>Tafel, </em><a href="/pa/449/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="449 Pa. 442" data-case-ids="1945600" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0442-01">449 Pa. at 451</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20797" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="296 A.2d 797">296 A.2d at 802</a>. Nor does the will, when read in its entirety, give any indication that the testator intended to exclude adopted children. The presumption in favor of adopted children therefore applies.</p>
