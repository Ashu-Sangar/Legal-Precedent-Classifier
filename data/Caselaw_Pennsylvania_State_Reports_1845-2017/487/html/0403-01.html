    <p id="b469-6" data-blocks='[["BL_469.5",469,[216,614,1151,722]]]'>On January 26, 1970 appellant Betty Lou Turner filed an action in divorce against appellee Charles A. Turner. On February 6, 1974, while the divorce action was still pending, appellant was injured in an automobile accident while she was a passenger in a car operated by appellee. A decree of divorce was granted on April 29, 1974. On September 23, 1975 appellant filed an action in trespass against appellee for negligent infliction of injuries she sustained in the automobile accident. At a pretrial conference, the parties agreed to submit to the court the issue of the applicability of the doctrine of interspousal immunity. The Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County granted summary judgment for appellee based on this doctrine. The Superior Court affirmed, and this Court granted allowance of appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

This assumption, based on a view that marital status at the time of injury controls, is erroneous. The oft-quoted statement of the doctrine is that “a spouse may neither sue nor recover on a tort claim from the other spouse while the parties are married.” <em>Policino v.

Rather, it is the existence of the marital relationship at the time of suit which is determinative. The Act, for example, has been held to bar a husband or wife from suing on torts occurring prior to the marriage. <em>DiGirolamo v. Apanavage, </em>supra; <em>Meisel v.
