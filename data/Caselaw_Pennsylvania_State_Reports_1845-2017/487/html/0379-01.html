At the time of her death, only one child of testator, Beatrice Sewell Brown, was still living.

Appellant contends <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>that the trustees should be surcharged for making these exclusive payments from the time of <em>Tafel </em>until termination of the trusts.

    <p id="b448-6" data-blocks='[["BL_448.5",448,[302,591,1151,778]]]'>The trustees’ argument is that they had no “actual knowledge” of appellant’s status and, in their view, cannot be surcharged for failing to recognize appellant’s status as an income beneficiary. This view is based on an analogy to the duty owed by a fiduciary to beneficiaries upon the filing of an account. Under the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, a trustee “shall give written notice of the filing of his account” to unpaid claimants who give written notice of a claim and “to every other person known to the accountant to have an interest in the estate as beneficiary, heir, or next of kin.” See 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 3503 &amp; 7183(1). The trustees read the statutory language “known” to mean that, unless a fiduciary is certain of a beneficiary’s interest, there is no duty to inform or otherwise make provision for the beneficiary.</p>

They conclude that, because they acted in accordance with this decree, they may not be surcharged. This contention, too, must be rejected. The trustees’ premise, that fiduciaries may not be surcharged where they properly rely upon an adjudication of court directing payment of funds in their trust, is of course a sound one. “The beneficiary may be barred by a decree of a proper court from holding the trustee liable for a breach of trust.” Restatement (Second) of Trusts, supra at § 220. Accord, III Scott on Trusts § 220, p. 1765 (1967).

Here, however, the trustees failed to do so. Instead, they acted at their own peril and paid trust income exclusively to Beatrice Sewell Brown.
