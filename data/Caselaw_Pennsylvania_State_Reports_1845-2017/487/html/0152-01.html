Appellant could- be eligible to adopt if she offered the orphans’ court either full consents of both parents or proper decrees of termination of parental rights. But here appellant has only a section 503 qualified consent of the natural father. Since appellant is not the spouse of the natural father, a section 503 consent is not sufficient to meet the eligibility requirements for an adopting parent.</p>
    <p id="b220-5" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[259,1081,1150,747]]]'>It is the legislative judgment and mandate that a section 503 qualified consent be available only to the spouse of a natural parent. Given the state’s traditional authority and longstanding interest in the family, it must be obvious that section 503 is a proper reflection of the legislative judgment and public policy of the Commonwealth concerning the intra-family aspects of Pennsylvania’s comprehensive adoption act. It is appropriate and entirely reasonable for the Legislature to provide, as section 503 does, a special type of consent available only where there is a husband-wife relationship. So too it is not unreasonable to require non-spouses to comply with the unqualified parental consent provisions. Manifestly, our courts are without authority to ignore or alter the consent provisions of the Adoption Act.</p>
