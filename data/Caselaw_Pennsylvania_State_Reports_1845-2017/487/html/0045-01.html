Ferriman applied for admission to the Pennsylvania Bar on motion under Pa.B.A.R. 204. The Pennsylvania Board of Law Examiners denied the application because Mr. Ferriman did not satisfy Rule 204’s requirement of graduation from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association. The record discloses that petitioner attended an unaccredited law school in Ohio from <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>January 1946 to June 1949. The law school was not accredited by the A.B.A. until 1957. Petitioner has appealed to this Court requesting admission to the Bar without examination, although he did not graduate from an A.B.A. accredited law school as required by Rule 204. Consistent with Pennsylvania’s sound legal educational requirements embodied in Rule 204, and this Court’s adherence to Rule 204 without deviation or exception, this appeal is properly denied.</p>

This Court once again blindly adheres to a rule which denies an attorney admission to the Pennsylvania Bar because that attorney did not graduate from an ABA accredited law school. The inequities of such an unconstitutional rule continue not only to deprive citizens the opportunity to practice in Pennsylvania but also deprive Pennsylvania consumers of competent legal services.

Appellant was also admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court, the United States Courts of Appeals for the Third Circuit and before <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Although petitioner can practice in the federal courts in Pennsylvania, he cannot practice before the state courts in Pennsylvania because he graduated from a law school not “accredited” by the American Bar Association.</p>
