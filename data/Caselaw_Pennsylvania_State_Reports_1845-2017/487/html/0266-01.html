On the summons, plaintiff was identified as “Estate of Gabriel C. Gasbarini, a/k/a Gabriel C. Gasbarine”. Mr. Rubin failed to respond to the Medical Center’s rule to file a complaint, and a judgment of <em>non pros </em>was subsequently entered.</p>

A complaint was filed on November 15, 1974. Following the filing of the complaint, appellees filed preliminary objections alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the “estate” was not a proper party. Despite the fact that notice of the preliminary objections was sent to Rubin’s office, he never responded. On November 27, 1974, Rubin was suspended from the practice of law by this court.</p>

At this time (early 1975), appellant learned that Rubin had been suspended from the practice of law in November, 1974. On May 19, 1975, Rubin was disbarred pursuant to an order of this court.</p>

Present counsel then filed a petition to reinstate the complaint and to amend the caption of the complaint to add appellant’s name as personal representative of the estate.
