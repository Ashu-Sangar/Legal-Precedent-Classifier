She was sentenced on April 22, 1976, to the State Correctional Facility at Muncy for a term of one and one-half to five years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> An appeal from the judgment of sentence was filed in the Superior Court which affirmed by a per curiam order and without opinion.

    <p id="b635-5" data-blocks='[["BL_635.5",635,[222,610,1150,632]]]'>The record reveals that Mitchell had no prior criminal record, was the mother of two very young children, and was attending school at the time. In passing sentence, the sentencing judge stated he had “carefully considered all the matters involved and [liad] examined the pre-sentence reports and we will follow the recommendations of the probation office.” “The matters involved” were not spelled out and the pre-sentence reports were not made part of the record. The record also fails to disclose “the recommendations of the probation office.” The trial court did not give any reasons for the sentence in its memorandum opinion filed after this appeal.</p>

The Commonwealth contends that Mitchell’s sentence was imposed months before our opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Riggins, </em><a href="/pa/474/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="474 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="1732146" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0115-01">supra,</a> was filed and, hence, that the holding in <em>Riggins </em>is of no moment here.

The present appeal (a direct appeal from the judgment of sentence) was still in the process of litigation when <em>Riggins </em>was decided. Fairness demands that Mitchell be accorded the same consideration given Kostka.</p>
