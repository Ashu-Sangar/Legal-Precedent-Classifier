    <p id="b476-6" data-blocks='[["BL_476.7",476,[271,679,1151,468]]]'>Appellant’s conviction resulted from the homicide of Carl Ernst on October 10, 1972. At that time, appellant was the paramour of Donna Ernst, the victim’s wife. Appellant usually visited the Ernst residence- on nights when the victim was not at home. On the night of the slaying, the victim’s usual bowling night, the victim arrived home earlier than expected. A fight broke out between the victim and appellant and appellant stabbed the victim. The victim died as a result of the stab wounds.</p>
    <p id="b476-7" data-blocks='[["BL_476.8",476,[273,1172,1149,199]]]'>Appellant first argues that his conviction for murder of the first degree was violative of the double jeopardy clause of both the United States Constitution and the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b476-8" data-blocks='[["BL_476.9",476,[274,1396,1151,576]]]'>On February 4, 1974, appellant entered a plea of guilty to murder of the second degree, pursuant to a negotiated plea bargain with a recommended sentence of four to fourteen years. Following a hearing, the trial court accepted the plea and sentenced appellant pursuant to the negotiated plea. On December 16, 1974, appellant filed a petition pursuant to the Post-Conviction Hearing Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the plea was not voluntary. On May 16, 1975, the post-conviction court entered an order allowing appellant to withdraw his plea of guilty and vacating the judgment of sentence.</p>

This court was presented with the same issue, on facts procedurally similar in <em>Commonwealth v. Klobuchir, </em><a href="/pa/486/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="486 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1757593" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0241-01">486 Pa. 241</a>, <a href="/pa/486/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="486 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1757593" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0241-01">405 A.2d 881</a> (1979). This court was equally divided in <em>Klobuchir. </em>We believe the opinion in support of affirmance (by Justice Nix, joined by Justice O’Brien and Justice Larsen) presents the proper analysis and result, and we, therefore, rely upon that opinion. The opinion in support of affirmance in <em>Klobuchir </em>found no violation of double jeopardy under either the United States or Pennsylvania Constitutions, reasoning that in a negotiated guilty plea to murder of the third degree, the defendant was never placed in jeopardy for murder of the first degree. While the trial court could find that the offense in question rose to murder of the first degree, the court could not impose sentence on such a finding because the defendant would then be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty. Pa.R.Crim.P. 319(b)(3). In such circumstances, the court has the power only to reject the proposed plea agreement. Believing the opinion in support of affirmance in <em>Klobuchir </em>to be persuasive, we find no violation of the double jeopardy clause of either the United States or Pennsylvania Constitutions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b478-7" data-blocks='[["BL_478.8",478,[284,1578,1152,763]]]'>On the night of the killing, Donna Ernst, the victim’s wife, was present in the house when the homicide occurred. When the police arrived at the Ernst home, Mrs. Ernst told police that her husband must have found an intruder in the house and that he must have been stabbed in the ensuing struggle. During their investigation, however, the police were informed that appellant was usually at the Ernst home on the victim’s bowling night. Mrs. Ernst originally denied that appellant was present. A search of the Ernst residence convinced police that Mrs. Ernst was lying, and she finally told police that appellant had stabbed the victim. As Mrs. Ernst had lied to police, who then knew (or at least strongly suspected) that she and the victim were having an affair, the police secured a material witness warrant for Mrs. Ernst.</p>

But is justice rendered, or effective law enforcement furthered, when an accused is forced to serve an invalid sentence imposed on an unlawful conviction?
