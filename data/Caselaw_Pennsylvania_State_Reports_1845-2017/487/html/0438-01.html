Taxpayers’ litigation seems designed to enable a large body of the citizenry to challenge governmental action which would otherwise go unchallenged in the courts because of the standing requirement. Such litigation allows the courts, within the framework of traditional notions of ‘standing,’ to add to the controls over public officials inherent in the elective process the judicial scrutiny of the statutory and constitutional validity of their acts.”</blockquote>

One of the two guidelines discussed was whether the type of interest asserted was among the policies or interests protected by the legal or constitutional rule relied on by the person claiming standing. <em>Wm. Penn, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/464/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="464 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1710363" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0168-01">464 Pa. at 198</a>, <a href="/pa/464/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="464 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1710363" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0168-01">346 A.2d at 284</a>.

We note that 19 P.S. § 268 allows the Attorney General to appeal to the Supreme Court from a failure to grant an application of the Attorney General, but does not grant a similar right to appeal to anyone from an order granting such an application.
