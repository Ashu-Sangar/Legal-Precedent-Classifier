Obviously, Groff’s statement to Detective Capello, given approximately three and one-half hours after the alleged incident, does not qualify under the first, second and fourth of the above exceptions. Her statement, as related by Detective Capello at trial, did not describe or refer to present physical, mental or emotional states, nor did it convey a “present sense impression” since such a statement must, by definition, be contemporaneous with the event to which it refers.
