Appellant’s petition to terminate appellee’s parental rights was based on abandonment for the six month statutory period, incapacity to parent, abuse, and neglect. Adoption Act of 1970, P.L. 620, 1 P.S. § 311 (Supp.1978). The record contains the following progression of statements by judge and counsel and significant testimony. In the excerpts from the record appearing hereafter, counsel for the parties were: Mr. Mattei for the appellant agency, Mr. Mroz for the appellee parent, and Mr. Pagano for J.F.</p>
      <p id="b183-6" data-blocks='[["BL_183.6",183,[253,756,1117,662]]]'>Appellant’s first witness, Elissa Wright, a social case worker assigned by Children and Youth Services of Delaware County to work with the F. family, testified as follows: J.F. was born in February of 1976, remained in the hospital after birth for three weeks under observation, stayed with appellee for three weeks after discharge from the hospital, was sent to live with appellee’s father for six months, and then returned to stay with appellee. In January of 1977, Miss Wright, by a visit to appellee’s home, established her first contact with appellee. During that visit, appellee stated she was interested in having J.F. placed for adoption because she was having trouble coping with being pregnant again and taking care of J.F. along with several of her other children. Appellee placed J.F. in appellant’s custody, saying she wanted him back eventually. Other children of appellee were under foster care at that time, too. In January of 1977, J.F. was then adjudicated a dependent child and in March of 1977 he was placed in a foster home by the appellant agency.</p>
      <p id="b183-8" data-blocks='[["BL_183.7",183,[253,1423,1118,974]],["BL_184.2",184,[300,493,1116,181]]]'>During the period of foster care, appellee kept twelve out of seventeen scheduled visits with J.F. After six months of foster care, appellant returned this child to appellee’s home in September of 1977. J.F. was not thereafter as active as he had been while in foster care and appellee complained about J.F.’s behavior and small and weak physical condition: appellant recommended that the child be taken to a doctor but appellee did not promptly comply. After J.F. was returned to appellee in September of 1977, the appellant agency maintained scheduled visits to check up on the child, help appellee find different housing, and set up homemaker services. Appellee’s paramour (who was not the father of J.F.) objected to these visits and early in October of 1977 said he would kill Miss Wright if she ever returned. Later in October, in response to a report of suspected child abuse, Miss Wright, went to appellee’s house to check on J.F.’s condition but was prevented from seeing him for a period of one and a half hours while appellee’s paramour made phone calls because appellee wanted to confer with her attorney. Then, when Miss Wright saw J.F., she observed bruises on numerous areas of his body and, accompanied by appellee, took J.F. to a hospital. Consequently, for two weeks until November 8, 1977, the child was hospitalized for treatment. During this hospitalization, a hearing on suspected child abuse was held and J.F. was adjudicated dependent. Shortly after Miss Wright testified that the child abuse hearing had been held, the judge <em>repeatedly </em>asked appellant’s counsel whether appellant wanted to have J.F. taken away from J.F.’s mother by a termination proceed<a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>ing, and after affirmative replies were given, the judge said he wanted to hear testimony about appellee’s living conditions at present.

Miss Wright did not see bruises being inflicted upon J.F., but was told by appellee that the paramour had struck J.F. and the other children too hard. Miss Wright was also told by appellee that the child had fallen out of a crib. Appellee visited J.F. three times while he was in the hospital. Approximately five days after the November 23, 1977 child abuse hearing that was held while J.F. was in the hospital, appellee, along with her other children and paramour, moved to Virginia.</p>

After foster care ended and J.F. returned to live with appellee, J.F. lost weight and seemed weak. While J.F. was in the hospital in late October and early November of 1977, following the suspected abuse incident, Dr. Lehmicke examined J.F. and noted <em>severe lacerations, abrasions and contusions all over J.F.’s body. </em>Dr. Lehmicke gave his opinion that such severe injuries could not have been caused by falling from a crib.
