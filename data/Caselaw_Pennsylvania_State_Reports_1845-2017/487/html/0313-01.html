The evidence established that Mrs. Halaski was employed by the Hilton Hotel in Pittsburgh for over sixteen years. On <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>October 15, 1973, while serving as a pantry girl, appellant was standing on a chair pouring orange juice when the chair slipped, causing her to fall to the floor. As a result, she sustained an injury to her back and received total disability compensation from October 16, 1973 to January 24, 1975. On February 10, 1975, the employer filed a termination petition alleging that Mrs. Halaski recovered from the injury and was able to return to work as of January 24, 1975. The referee entered a decision on September 16, 1975, ruling that all disability from the October 15, 1973 incident terminated as of April 18, 1975.</p>

On March 8,1976 while performing her duties in the kitchen of the hotel, she was struck by a food truck pushed by a fellow employee and was knocked to the floor. She testified that on this occasion she heard a snapping sound in her back. Because of the pain she was forced to leave work early and went to the hospital the day of the incident for treatment. After Mrs. .Halaski remained home for two weeks, she was advised by her doctor to áttempt to return to work. She was able to work for only one week before the pain caused her to return for further medical attention. Since that time the appellant has not returned to work.</p>

The same referee who decided the reinstatement claim denied benefits under this claim because, “claimant failed to produce credible testimony that she sustained a compensable injury on March 8, 1976.” The orders of the referee were affirmed by the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board and the Commonwealth Court.

Dr. Sherman’s qualifications as a physician in occupational medicine and rehabilitation were stipulated to by the parties. The Doctor testified that he first examined Ms. Halaski on August 12, 1976 and thereafter began a course of treatment. Dr. Sherman’s examination uncovered a chronic compression fracture in the area of the 12th vertebra which was confirmed by x-rays made after the March 8, 1976 incident. In response to the inquiry as to which of the two injuries caused the compression fracture, the Doctor responded:</p>
