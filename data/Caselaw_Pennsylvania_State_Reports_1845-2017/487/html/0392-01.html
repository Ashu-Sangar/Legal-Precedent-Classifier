Appellant Debra Ferrara’s testimony indicates that although she received the aforementioned notice, her sole reason for failing to appear on the scheduled dates was that she was “scared”. Additionally, even if appellant Vincent Ferrara’s claim that appellant did not receive the aforementioned notices was to be believed (the lower court found his testimony to be incredible), the reason that appellants did not receive this notice was because they did not fulfill a condition of the bail agreements (namely, notifying the appropriate authorities of address changes). Clearly, there was sufficient evidence to support the lower court’s finding that appellants acted in “disobedience or neglect” of “the lawful process of the court” and therefore, their contempt convictions must be affirmed.</p>

    <p id="b464-5" data-blocks='[["BL_464.5",464,[266,572,1152,930]]]'>Appellants’ contention is without merit. Black’s Law Dictionary (1968) defines “open court” as one “which has been formally convened and declared open for the transactions of its proper judicial business”. Appellants’ failure to appear on the scheduled dates for arraignment and for trial were acts committed in “open court” (that is, in a court “convened and declared open for the transaction of its proper judicial business”) and therefore, their contemptuous conduct can be punished by imprisonment. In the past, this Court has held that a witness who appears in court but who refuses to testify can be held in contempt and can be imprisoned for said contemptuous conduct. <em>Commonwealth v. Strickler, </em><a href="/pa/481/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="481 Pa. 579" data-case-ids="1747302" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0579-01">481 Pa. 579</a>, 589-90, <a href="/pa/481/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="481 Pa. 579" data-case-ids="1747302" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0579-01">393 A.2d 313</a>, 318 (1978); clearly, the conduct of appellants (in not even appearing in court) is no less contemptuous than the conduct of a witness who appears but refuses to testify and is deserving of no lesser punishment.</p>

The trial court sentenced appellant Vincent Ferrara to four months imprisonment and appellant Debra Ferrara to two months imprisonment for criminal contempt. Yet in doing so it failed to comply with the mandatory requirements set forth in the Sentencing Code.
