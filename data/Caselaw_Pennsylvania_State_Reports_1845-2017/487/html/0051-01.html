Prior to 1936, <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>appellant had served four years with the Pennsylvania National Guard. In computing appellant’s years of service for retirement purposes, the Retirement Board did not include appellant’s four years of service with the Pennsylvania National Guard. Appellant filed a complaint in Commonwealth Court seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the Retirement Board to include those four years in calculating his years of service. Appellant based his claim on § 204 of the State Employes’ Retirement Code of 1959,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b117-4" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[269,864,1108,265]]]'>“(1) In computing the length of service of a contributor for retirement purposes, a year of service shall mean a period of twelve (12) months during which a contributor is a State employe and for which he receives an annual salary or other compensation. .</blockquote>

Following an answer by appellant to the preliminary objections, the Commonwealth Court sustained the Retirement Board’s demurrer, holding that since appellant had joined the State Police prior to January 1, 1938, § 204(2) was inapplicable. <em>Packler v. St. Employes’ Ret. Bd., </em>15 Pa.Cmwlth. 143, <a href="/citations/?q=325%20A.2d%20335" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="325 A.2d 335">325 A.2d 335</a> (1974). On appeal to this court, we vacated the Commonwealth Court’s order, holding that while that court’s decision under § 204(2) was correct, it was improper to sustain the Retirement Board’s demurrer without considering appellant’s rights under § 204(1) and any other applica<a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>ble sections of the Retirement Code. <em>Packler v.

On remand, the Commonwealth Court again sustained the board’s preliminary objections and dismissed appellant’s complaint, finding an action in mandamus will not lie where appellant had failed to utilize or exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>Packler v.
