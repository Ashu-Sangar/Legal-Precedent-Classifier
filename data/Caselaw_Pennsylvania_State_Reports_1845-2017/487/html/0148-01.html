The estate’s one-third interest in B&amp;C Playlands, Inc. was valued at $2,576.33. No objection to the inventory was interposed. On September 24, 1976, appellee sold the estate’s interest in the corporation to decedent’s brother-in-law, a surviving owner, for this amount.

For example, in 1974 there seemed to be an abundance of cash available and in that year Jack S. Cooperman received $26,000.00 as his salary from the business. In 1975 Jack received $12,500 as his salary and there was a dearth of cash. In 1975 the business was unable to pay its bills and finished the year with $14,591.00 of unpaid bills. It is intimated by counsel for the objectors that Jack S. Cooperman directed cash receipts of the business into his own pockets and that these monies do not show in the accounting records which were kept and supervised by Warren S. Bloch, the certified public accountant, who testified at the audit hearing. For the year 1975, at the end of which Jack was killed, the Objector’s Exhibit B shows that the business had a net loss from operations of $23,703.00 which reduced its net worth to $6,729.00. The business owned real property in downtown Pittsburgh on Liberty Avenue, of uncertain value. In addition, the real property was heavily mortgaged in the aggregate amount of $186,-471.00. At the end of 1975 the business owed other obligations amounting to $49,522.00.</blockquote>
