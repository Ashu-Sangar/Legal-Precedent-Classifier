It is crystal clear therefore, that where the beneficial grantors and the beneficial grantees are one and the same, a deed to a trustee may be recorded without the affixation of Pennsylvania Realty Transfer Tax stamps, and a deed is only taxable on the proportionate change in ownership which it actually effects. Put another way, only the interest passing to persons other than the actual grantors is subject to the tax in question. In this case, the stockholders had surrendered their stock to the corporation and the corporation had been dissolved prior to the execution of the deed to the Trustees. The actual transfer effected by the deed was from the stockholders, jointly, and according to the number of shares of stock they held, to the Trustees for the stockholders, jointly, and “according to the number of shares of stock which they (had held)”. There was no proportionate change in beneficial interest. On July 18, 1974, “the stockholders and directors of the corporation adopted resolutions for the dissolution of the corporation and liquidation”, and on the same day entered into an agreement, “to effect complete liquidation and distribution of all of the assets of [the corporation] and to effect voluntary dissolution of [the corporation]”. The stock certificates were then surrendered “pursuant to the agreement”, which related back to July 18, 1974. On June 5, 1975, the certificate of election to dissolve was filed with the Corporation Bureau of the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>

      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>. The court below stated in its opinion, “If the stockholders had received title to the property directly from the Corporation, as per § 1104 C of the Business Corporation Law, Act of May 5, 1933, P.L. 364, <em>as amended, </em>15 P.S. § 2104 C, this Court would agree that the <em>Passell </em>case controls and that <em>no tax would be due.” </em>According to this reasoning, it would have been necessary for the corporation to make and record a deed to the stockholders as part of the liquidation proceeding, and it would not have been a taxable document, then, if, on the same day, the stockholders had made and recorded a second deed from themselves to the Trustees, it could have been recorded without being subject to the transfer tax. The learned court below, clearly recognized the <em>substance </em>of the transaction in this case was not taxable, but reasoned that the deed was taxable because of the <em>form </em>used.
