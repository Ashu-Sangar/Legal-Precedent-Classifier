    <blockquote id="b92-6" data-blocks='[["BL_92.6",92,[306,1120,1112,792]]]'>. The danger of any such unnecessary . restriction of liberty diminishes significantly when a citizen is brought swiftly before a neutral judicial authority, there to be informed of the charges and provided with an immediate and reasonable opportunity to <em>regain his liberty </em>by the posting of a reasonable bail. Thus, the delay between arrest and arraignment must be closely examined. The only delay permissible is that reasonably required for the administrative processing of the accused citizen. <em>Commonwealth v.

Williams, supra, </em>we reaffirmed that pre-arraignment delay would be deemed unnecessary unless required to administratively process an accused. In reach<a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>ing that conclusion, we rejected the argument that a delay should be deemed necessary because the police needed the time to corroborate the defendant’s statement and to apprehend the co-felons. While we relaxed the requirement that pre-arraignment delay can only be occasioned by administrative needs where there may have existed some doubt as to the probable cause to arrest or to charge the suspect, the instant record does not present such a case. <em>See e. g. Commonwealth v. Blagman, </em><a href="/pa/458/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="458 Pa. 431" data-case-ids="479767" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0431-01">458 Pa. 431</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=326%20A.2d%20296" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="326 A.2d 296">326 A.2d 296</a> (1974).

    <p id="b93-5" data-blocks='[["BL_93.5",93,[219,968,1151,732]]]'>The conclusion that the delay was unnecessary, even though it amounted only to approximately four hours, is compelled under these facts where at 3:15 p. m. all processing had been completed and that at 6:15, when the statement was being reduced to writing, the district justice was present and no reason existed why appellant could not have been arraigned at that point rather than being interrogated. The fact that the arraignment was delayed an additional two hours and thirty-five minutes must weight heavily in determining whether the delay is to be classified as unnecessary. The fact that an arraignment does not preclude the possibility of further interrogation eliminates any justification for failing to arraign appellant before the police recorded his statement.</p>

In addition to lending support to appellant’s attack on the voluntariness of the statement (which issue we need not reach), this purported justification fails to explain why the district magistrate was called to witness the taking of the statement. Appellee is, it would seem, hopelessly impaled upon the horns of a dilemma. If appellant was too befuddled by drink to be arraigned, his condition would also prevent him from giving a voluntary, knowing and intelligent statement. If appellant had reached the degree of <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>sobriety where he could have knowingly and voluntarily given an incriminatory statement, he would also have been competent to be arraigned by the magistrate at 6:15 p. m. instead of being deposed. The clear purpose of <em>Futch </em>and its progeny was to prevent police from postponing arraignment solely to obtain a confession from an accused. <em>See Commonwealth v.
