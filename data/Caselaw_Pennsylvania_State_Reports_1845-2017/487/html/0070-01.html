At issue here is whether decedent, Wayne E.

The Commonwealth filed an appraisement which asserted Rankin’s contributions to the plan and accrued interest were subject to tax. The executrix appealed this appraisement to the trial court, and the auditing judge, after hearing, dismissed the appeal. Exceptions to this adjudication were dismissed by an equally-divided court en banc, and this direct appeal followed pursuant to Section 202(3) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. II, 17 P.S. § 211.202(3) (Supp. 1979-80), since superseded by Section 722(3) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 722(3).</p>

Thus, this case is quite unlike <em>Ravdin Estate, </em>supra, in which the decedent had no right to withdraw his contributions from a retirement plan while he lived even if he resigned from the partnership that sponsored the plan. In <em>Ravdin, </em>the Court noted that the decedent there could obtain the fund only upon disability or his attainment of (and retirement at) age fifty-nine and one half, “neither of which events were subject to his control.” <em>Ravdin Estate, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/484/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="484 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="1753784" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0562-01">484 Pa. at 571</a>, <a href="/pa/484/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="484 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="1753784" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0562-01">400 A.2d at 596</a>. In the case at bar, in contrast, the decedent’s right to receive his contributions took effect upon his own volitional act of resignation. Hence, what the Court said in the similar factual context of <em>Dorsey Estate, </em>supra, is applicable here: “[Ijn view of the depositor’s right to withdraw in his lifetime the total amount of the fund credited to him ... he had substantial ownership of his entire share of the fund and accordingly [it was] <em>his own property </em>to the extent that it represented contributions from his salary . . . .” <em>Dorsey Estate, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/366/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="366 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="8846000" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0557-01">366 Pa. at 561-62</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20A.2d%20259" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="79 A.2d 259">79 A.2d at 261</a>.

I note in passing that no analogy is to be drawn between the 72 P.S. §§ 2485-101 <em>et seq. </em>treatment of proceeds from retirement plans and its exemption for life insurance benefits. 72 P.S. § 2485-316, the subject of this appeal, shows clearly that different treatment is to be accorded the two when it states that “proceeds of life insurance otherwise exempt under 72 P.S. § 2485-303 shall not be subject to inheritance tax because they are being paid under a pension, stock-bonus, profit-sharing or retirement annuity plan.” 72 P.S. § 2485-303 is equally categorical in its provision, allowing exemption of insurance proceeds in all cases except where insurance is payable to the decedent’s estate:</p>
      <blockquote id="b143-13" data-blocks='[["BL_143.7",143,[317,1935,1084,232]]]'>“All proceeds of insurance on the life of the decedent, unless payable to the estate of the decedent, are exempt from inheritance tax. Proceeds payable to an inter vivos or testamentary trustee or other beneficiary designated in the decedent’s will or in an inter vivos instrument of transfer are exempt from inheritance tax within the meaning of this section.”</blockquote>
      <p id="b143-14" data-blocks='[["BL_143.8",143,[283,2171,1118,192]]]'>Thus, one’s right to borrow a part of the paid-up value of an insurance policy, or to use the policy as collateral, would not defeat the exemption even though these powers might well constitute a “substantial present economic benefit.” Cf. <em>Dorsey Estate, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/366/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="366 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="8846000" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0557-01">366 Pa. at 562</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20A.2d%20259" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="79 A.2d 259">79 A.2d at 261</a>.</p>
