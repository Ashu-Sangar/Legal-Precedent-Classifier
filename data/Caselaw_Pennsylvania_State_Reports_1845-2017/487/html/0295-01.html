    <p id="b362-6" data-blocks='[["BL_362.7",362,[270,803,1150,790]]]'>Carl J. Kurkowski died intestate on November 22, 1973, survived by his wife, the administratrix, and two minor sons from a prior marriage, Carl W. and Wayne Kurkowski. At the time of his death, decedent was president and sole shareholder of Monroe Cycle Center, Inc. which was in the business of selling and servicing motorcycles. The business was valued in the estate inventory by administratrix at $43,797.88. Decedent also owned a home valued at $75,-000.00, subject to a mortgage, in addition to furniture, fixtures, and tools. Further, the decedent’s life was insured for approximately $90,000.00 of which approximately $75,-000.00 was paid to Monroe Cycle Center, Inc. as beneficiary. The administration of the estate was undertaken by Ellen Kurkowski Simon in January 1974 upon the posting of a $500.00 bond.</p>

Prior to his death, she had served as a corporation’s vice-president and had worked part-time in the business. Shortly after her election, the two other members of the Board of Directors, including the attorney for the estate, resigned. Thereafter, the administratrix ignored corporate procedures and formalities. The administratrix paid herself a salary in excess of $33,000.00 during the twenty-month period she continued to operate the business. One of decedent’s sons worked part-time in the business as a mechanic and received compensation of $1,148.86. Administratrix utilized a car titled in the corporate name for her personal use and subsequently traded it in on a new car which she titled <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>in her own name without any accounting to the corporation for the value of the car. She paid the decedent’s funeral bill from the corporate assets and subsequently included the bill in her final account as an expense of the estate without having repaid the corporation the cost of the funeral.</p>
    <p id="b363-4" data-blocks='[["BL_363.5",363,[241,600,1150,576]]]'>The business operated at a continuing loss for the entire twenty-month period. During this period, administratrix made no attempt to sell the business or its assets. She testified she intended to operate it indefinitely. The record indicates some attempts to sell were made after administratrix closed the business. However, when these efforts were not successful, administratrix made no provision for disposition or liquidation of the corporate assets or for payment of the corporate debts. At the time administratrix closed the doors of the business, the corporate accounts reflected over $120,000.00 in assets.</p>

This fund was exhausted after the payment of administrative expenses and priority claims including $5,783.25 to the estate for reimbursement of rents advanced. In the interim, the house was sold and administratrix posted an additional bond.</p>

Objections to the accounting were sustained in part and the court entered a decree directing administratrix to perform certain administrative tasks and surcharging her $119,000.00 for having continued to operate the solely owned corporation, which was the principal asset of the estate, without court approval as required by the Pennsylvania Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 3314 (1975). The amount of the surcharge was determined by the value of the capital stock of the corporation at the time of decedent’s death — viz. $43,000.00 — and the $76,000.00 paid into the corporation from insurance proceeds which <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>resulted in total assets in the corporation of $119,000.00 at the time of death.

      <p id="b364-14" data-blocks='[["BL_364.14",364,[270,1899,1150,230]]]'>. Administratrix maintains that “business” as used in section 3314 refers to unincorporated associations. This narrow meaning is derived by construing section 3314 together with section 3315 which provides for incorporation of the estate’s business. Administratrix argues that, for the sake of consistency, “business” must not refer to corporation in either statutory provision.</p>
      <p id="b364-15" data-blocks='[["BL_364.15",364,[304,2135,1117,229]],["BL_365.2",365,[291,2227,1116,113]]]'>The argument ignores the fact that section 3314 refers to “any business” which, by its terms, may or may not be incorporated, while section 3315 refers to “the business” which impliedly must not already be incorporated. While we need not so rule to decide this case, an interpretation contrary to administratrix’s is suggested by the different language and by other authorities.
