Appellant is the son of the testator, Lester Rider. Testator and appellant operated a dairy farm in partnership. Appellant claims sole ownership of the dairy herd and of farm machinery and equipment preceded by an “R” on the estate inventory.</p>

Testator willed his household goods and a life estate in his farm to his wife, Mazie Rider, and the residue to his sons, Paul Rider and appellant. Testator appointed his sons co-executors. Paul Rider and appellant renounced this right, and the Williamsport National Bank was appointed administrator c. t. a. on June 13, 1974. The estate of testator was inventoried and appraised in the presence of appellant. Appellant told the appraisers which items of property he owned, individually, and which items were owned by the partnership or by testator. The appraised value of the farm machinery and equipment was $45,005.00 and that of the cattle was $23,-470.00.</p>

All income from farm operations was treated as partnership income. Each partner claimed fifty percent of the partnership’s profits.</p>

Appellant testified he added his cattle to testator’s and, thereafter, conducted a dairy farm in partnership with testator. Appellant does not dispute that income from the dairy farm was distributed on a partnership basis (which includes income produced through use of the disputed property); that he never objected to receiving only fifty percent of the profits from sales of cattle even though he now claims sole ownership of the cattle; that he claimed only fifty percent of such profits as income on his individual federal tax returns; that the disputed farm equipment and machinery was depreciated on a partnership basis and not listed on individual federal tax returns; that partnership funds were used to purchase feed for the cattle; and, finally, that both partners worked on the farm. Thus, the record reveals appellant and testator treated the disputed property as partnership property. Partnership funds and labor were used to maintain the cattle which were used in the dairy farm business. The dairy herd consisted of cattle contributed by both testator and appellant. This evidence is suffi<a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>cient to establish an interest in the disputed property in favor of testator.
