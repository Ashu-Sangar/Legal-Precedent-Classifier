Nevertheless, our review of the Code must recognize that “[substantive rule-making is a widely used administrative practice, and its use should be upheld whenever the statutory delegation can reasonably be construed to authorize it.” Bernard Schwartz, Administrative Law § 56 at p. 151 (1976). As Dean Freedman points out, “[t]he existence of a body of standards tends to encourage greater deliberations, self-consciousness, and consistency in the exercise of administrative discretions and thereby reduces the likelihood that an agency will act arbitrarily.” James 0. Freedman, Crisis and Legitimacy: The Administrative Process and American Government 245 (1978). We are satisfied that, reasonably construed, the Public Welfare Code demonstrates that the Legislature fully intended to permit the department (A) to supervise hospitals’ managerial practices and (B) to do so through promulgation of rules and regulations.</p>

Rather, hospital administration is expressly within the pur<a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>view of existing departmental regulatory obligations. Surely it cannot seriously be disputed that proper, uniform managerial practices promote the quality and efficiency of the delivery of health care services to individual consumers requiring health care. It is precisely this goal which the Legislature requires the department to achieve. Section 921(c) of the Code, fully applicable to hospitals,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> expressly directs the department to set “standards for the safe and adequate care of individuals,” making “adequate and proper provision[] for .

Section 911 of the Code expressly contemplates the department’s review of the managerial practices of “supervised institutions.” Under section 911(a)(2), the Legislature places “all and every matter and thing” relating to the “usefulness, administration, and management” of “supervised institutions,” and “to the welfare of the inmates thereof . . . ,” within the department’s mandatory obligation of “inquir[y] and examin[ation.]”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Indeed, “supervised institutions,” by definition, expressly includes “all hospitals, almshouses, or poor houses, maintained by any county, city, borough, township or poor district of this Commonwealth.” We are convinced, therefore, that the Legislature <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>has given the tribunal with experience and expertise over managerial practices of “supervised institutions” similar authority to supervise the managerial practices of hospitals subject to departmental standards under section 921.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

One other consideration, overlooked by appellants, confirms our conclusion that appellees possess authority under sections 911 and 921 to regulate hospitals’ managerial practices. Were appellants to prevail in their attack upon the challenged regulations, at least portions of appellees’ “Rules and Regulations for Hospitals” promulgated in 1966, including those relating to hospital governance and the like, would be vulnerable to similar criticism. The Legislature, however, in codifying the above provisions in the Public Welfare Code of 1967, made no effort to disturb appellees’ 1966 regulations. It is established that administrative interpretations, not disturbed by the Legislature, are appropriate guides to legislative intent. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(8). We think it a fair corollary that the Legislature’s failure in 1967 in any respect to disturb appellees’ exercise of rule-making authority in 1966 evinces legislative recognition of appellees’ regulatory authority over “managerial prerogative.”</p>

A governmental regulation to be valid must gain its life from a clearly defined delegation of statutory origin. The obvious reason for this principle has its foundation in the nature of our concept of government. The law by which the people of our society are governed emanates from them, through their elected representatives in the legislative branch of government. The executive branch cannot make law, while the judiciary has the duty to determine whether any restrictions on human freedom are valid, and that includes the duty to determine whether regulations promulgated by an agency of the executive branch of government fall within the limits of authority delegated to that agency by legislation. When regulations go beyond the purpose of the enabling statute, or bear no rational relationship to the purpose of that legislation, they are of no force and effect and must be set aside.</p>
