George in his divorce action. Appellant’s counterclaim sought a decree of divorce from bed and board as provided in Section 11, Act of May 2, 1929, P.L. 1237, 23 P.S. § 11 (1955). The Court of Common Pleas dismissed the counterclaim on the grounds that Section 11 is unconstitutional under the Equal Rights Amendment, Pa.Const. art. I, § 28 [hereinafter cited as E.R.A.], because the statute allows <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>wives but not husbands to obtain such divorces when marital misconduct occurs. Appeal was taken to Superior Court which certified to this Court the question of the constitutionality of Section 11.</p>
    <p id="b199-4" data-blocks='[["BL_199.5",199,[241,534,1149,206]]]'>Appellant’s first contention is that the E.R.A. is inapplicable to the rights and duties of a man or woman after they become married because interests of children of the marriage may be affected. The E.R.A. provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="AXI" data-blocks='[["BL_199.6",199,[284,754,1106,98]]]'>“Prohibition against denial or abridgement of equality of rights because of sex</blockquote>

    <p id="b199-6" data-blocks='[["BL_199.8",199,[243,1041,1148,411]]]'>A plain reading of this provision reveals no exception in the area of domestic relations. Nor has this Court in the past refused to apply the E.R.A. to questions of the rights and duties of husbands and wives, even where the interests of children may be affected. In <em>Henderson </em>a statute allowing wives but not husbands to obtain alimony pendente lite, counsel fees, and expenses in divorce actions was held unconstitutional. There we stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b199-7" data-blocks='[["BL_199.9",199,[286,1476,1108,366]]]'>Thus, as it is appropriate for the law where necessary to force the man to provide for the needs of a dependent wife, it must also provide a remedy for the man where circumstances justify an entry of support against the wife. In short, the right of support depends not upon the sex of the petitioner but rather upon need in view of the relative financial circumstances of the parties.</blockquote>
