Cost then joined as third party defendants: Dickerson Structural Concrete Corporation (appellant’s employer); Nadco Construction, Inc. (the general contractor); and Tassos Katselas (the architect). Katselas later joined R. M. Gensert Associates (structural engineers) as additional defendants. The original defendant and third party defendants are appellees here.</p>

Customary methods or conduct do not furnish a test which is conclusive or controlling on the question of negligence, or fix a standard by which negligence is to be gaged. The standard of due care is such care as a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances of the <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>particular case, and conformity to customary or usual conduct or methods cannot amount to more than a circumstance to be considered together with other circumstances of the case in determining whether due care has been exercised: .</blockquote>

    <p id="b376-9" data-blocks='[["BL_376.8",376,[256,1056,1151,843]]]'>The present case involves an inherently dangerous condition. Appellant’s failure to introduce evidence of industry custom cannot itself constitute grounds for a nonsuit. As previously noted, the evidence presented, when viewed with the applicable standard, establishes that: the appellee knew that to secure the lintel in place, mortar would have to be placed between it and the supporting brick and the void sealed; that at least one of the lintels was left in an unstable condition; that Dickerson employees were coming onto the construction site the following day; and it was likely that Dickerson employees would walk on the wall in order to complete their work. Nothing complex is involved in the present case. One does not need evidence of industry custom and practice to determine that a properly affixed warning, giving notice of the lintel’s unstable condition would have affected the outcome.</p>
