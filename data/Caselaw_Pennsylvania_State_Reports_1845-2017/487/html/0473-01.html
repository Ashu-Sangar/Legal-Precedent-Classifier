On redirect, appellant’s counsel inquired into what occurred during the visits and the text of the conversations mentioned on cross-examination. Counsel for the estate objected, citing the Dead Man’s Act. Appellant’s counsel argued that the estate had waived this objection by inquiring into these matters on cross-examination and called the chancellor’s attention to this Court’s holdings in <em>Clad’s Estate, supra; Goehring’s Estate, supra; </em>

This is incorrect. Appellant did not, on direct examination, testify to “any matter occurring before the death” of his father. In fact, the portion of appellant’s direct examination which the estate found to be objectionable under the Dead Man’s Act (see <em>supra) </em>was a statement made by the estate’s own representative after the decedent’s death. The estate was certainly in as good a position as the decedent would have been to refute this testimony, and it did not, therefore, violate the Dead Man’s Act.

Consequently, the estate’s cross-examination of appellant constituted a waiver of the Dead Man’s Act and made him a competent witness as to all relevant and material matter. <em>Clad’s Estate, supra; Gerlach’s Estate, supra. </em>The chancellor, therefore, erred in preventing appellant from testifying on redirect examination as to matters which occurred during his father’s lifetime.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Appellant objected again, and the chancellor did not admit the documents into evidence but, as with the testimony, made them a part of the record and delayed ruling on their admissibility until the adjudication.

Appellee argues that the chancellor’s statement (quoted in full supra) to the effect that the cross-examination would be taken <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>subject to appellee’s Dead Man’s Act objection authorized the inquiries on cross-examination, and that no waiver of the Dead Man’s Act could, therefore, occur. While we realize that the chancellor’s failure to promptly rule on appellee’s objection was not conducive to the orderly presentation of evidence and may have created unnecessary confusion, the chancellor’s statement does not have the meaning, nor could it have the effect, appellee seeks to attribute to it. The first part of that statement, which deals with what will occur if appellee’s objection is found to be improper, quite plainly states that the cross-examination will be taken “as is” and not given any special consideration on account of appellee having wrongly interposed an objection.</p>

The court en banc, in dismissing appellant’s exceptions to the adjudication, agreed that the admission of this testimony was error, but found it to be harmless. That court reasoned that Mr. Sidkoff s testimony to the effect that <em>appellant did not mention a contract claim </em>to him was cumulative to the testimony of an attorney for the estate, Mr. Rubin, who testified that Mr. <em>Sidkoff did not present a contract claim.</em>

      <p id="b545-6" data-blocks='[["BL_545.7",545,[248,1928,1119,423]]]'>As discussed above, this approach fails to take into consideration the purpose of the attorney-client privilege. Furthermore, the testimony of the two witnesses is not necessarily cumulative. The record discloses that Mr. Sidkoff represented appellant for a very short period of time and that his contacts with counsel for the estate were limited to two or three telephone conversations, none of which exceeded five minutes. Under such circumstances, the inferences raised by the mere fact that Mr. Sidkoff did not present a contract claim are not identical, either in substance or weight, to the inferences raised by Mr. Sidkoffs testimony to the effect that appellant never mentioned the contract in the entire course of their conferences.</p>

      <blockquote id="b546-8" data-blocks='[["BL_546.8",546,[337,1973,1084,387]]]'>In a society as complicated in structure as ours and governed by laws as complex and detailed as those imposed upon us, expert legal advice is essential. To the furnishing of such advice the fullest freedom and honesty of communication of pertinent facts is a prerequisite. To induce clients to make such communications, the privilege to prevent their later disclosure is said by courts and commentators to be a necessity. The social good derived from the proper performance of the functions of lawyers acting for their clients is believed to outweigh the harm that may come from the suppression of the evidence in specific cases.</blockquote>
