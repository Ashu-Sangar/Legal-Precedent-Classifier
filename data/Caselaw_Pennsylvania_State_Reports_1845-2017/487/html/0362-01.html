In the instant case, appellant’s testimony was so evasive that it, in fact, amounted to a refusal to testify.

Appellant’s testimony that she did not “remember” the incident was contradicted by two witnesses, both of whom testified that prior to trial, appellant stated that she saw her husband beat the child.

Furthermore, at the conference (attended by the judge, the prosecutor, and counsel for appellant’s husband) held during the trial of appellant’s husband, appellant <em>admitted </em>that prior to the selection of the jury for said trial, she told the prosecutor that she was not willing to testify at the trial.</p>

This argument is without merit. There is no requirement that in order for a witness to be convicted of criminal contempt, he must <em>completely </em>“thwart” a case. Assuming for the sake of argument that there was other evidence that the Commonwealth could have presented against appellant’s husband, there is no question that appellant’s refusal to testify would have still constituted contempt.</p>
