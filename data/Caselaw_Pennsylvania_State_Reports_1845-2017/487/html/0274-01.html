First, we are asked to decide whether a trial court order partially decertifying a class is, for the decertified party, a final judgment. We hold that the order was final with respect to the decertified appellant. Because he brought no appeal within 30 days of the trial court’s order, appellant’s challenge to the partial decertification is not properly before this Court. The second issue is whether the Superior Court properly vacated judgments in favor of four class members solely on the ground that appellant, the named class representative, had been decertified. We hold that the Superior Court erred in vacating the judgments. Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the order which reversed the trial court judgments in favor of four class members and we direct reinstatement of the judgments in favor of those parties.</p>

The trial court explained its reinstatement of the class action: “The acceptance and cashing of the post-complaint $5,000 check by the individual class representative does not make the claims of the other members of the class which plaintiff purports to represent moot, and consequently, it is our considered judgment that, in the circumstances of this case where many members of the class would be prejudiced by the bar of the statute of limitations if this class action was bumped to the status of an ordinary suit in assumpsit, this case should continue as a class action.”</p>

Rather, appealable orders are those which deny a party the right to continue the litigation. An order merely modifying the relative status of class members would be interlocutory. For example, an order denying a representative plaintiffs right to represent the class, but permitting that party to continue as an unnamed class member, is not an immediately appealable order.

The Superior Court expressed concern that the five unsuccessful members of the class would challenge the adequacy of appellant’s representation, thereby subjecting State Farm to the burden of relitigating these claims while being bound by the decision in favor of the four successful plaintiffs. We believe that the Superior Court’s concern is misplaced. The five unsuccessful individuals, notified of the judgments, have failed to appeal from the final judgment. Any claim they had regarding an objection to the continued representation by appellant following decertification was lost by their failure to appeal. Thus, we need not express an opinion as to the propriety of appellant’s notification of the unnamed class members which suggested that appellant was still a member of the class following decertification.</p>
