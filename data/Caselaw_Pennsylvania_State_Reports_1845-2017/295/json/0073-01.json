Horn & Hardart Baking Co., 261 Pa. 329; Matis v. Schaeffer, 270 Pa. 141.\nActing under the authority of sections 420 and 422 of the Act of June 26, 1919, P. L. 642, 662, 664, the referee asked advice from and took the testimony of an expert called by the referee himself (see Seitzinger v. Fort Pitt Brewing Co., 294 Pa. 253, on the right to do this). The testimony of this expert would be a weak staff for either side to rely on, but the decision of the referee does not appear to have been based on it, and there was ample other evidence to sustain the award in claimant\u2019s favor. That award, having been sustained by both the board and the court below, will not be disturbed by us.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
