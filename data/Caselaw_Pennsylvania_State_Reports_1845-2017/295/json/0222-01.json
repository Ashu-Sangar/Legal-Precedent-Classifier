        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nPlaintiff, the two defendants and five other people, calling themselves a syndicate, were the equitable owners of a tract of land, the legal title to which was in a trustee for them. The Bellerose Realty Company\u2014 a corporation in which defendants were largely interested, but plaintiff not at all \u2014 desired to purchase the property, and entered into an agreement so' to do. It was dated July 20, 1925, and provided for certain cash payments at specified intervals, the balance of the purchase price to be secured by a note of the vendee and an accompanying mortgage on the property, respectively \u201cdue one year from date of closing (60 days from this date) [with interest]......all interest, taxes, etc., to be equalized as of date of closing (sixty days from this date).\u201d All the other members of the syndicate consented to the conveyance, but plaintiff refused to do so; whereupon, possibly to avoid contention over the title, owing to the fact that defendants were directly or indirectly interested on both sides of the transaction, they entered into the agreement with plaintiff upon which this suit is brought.\nIt is dated July 31, 1925. After reciting the facts regarding the ownership, the proposed conveyance of the property, plaintiff\u2019s interest therein and defendant Levey\u2019s claim to be paid a commission out of the proceeds of sale, it provides that plaintiff agrees to the conveyance and payment, and that \u201cwithin sixty days from the date hereof [defendants] will repay or cause to be repaid to [plaintiff his investment in the syndicate, and will] pay or cause to be paid to [him] his proportionate share or part of any and all profits to be made by the aforesaid syndicate by reason of the aforesaid conveyance to the Bellerose Realty Company, within six months from the date hereof. That [plaintiff and defendants] agree that the [sales] agreement shall be deemed and considered a part hereof, with the same force and effect as if the same were copied herein at length. Provided there shall be no liability whatsoever hereunder if the sale to the Bellerose Realty Company does not go through and there is no closing under said agreement of sale.\u201d\nThe vendee made the preliminary payments, gave the note and mortgage provided for, and received a deed for the property. Out of the payments actually made, plaintiff received the full amount paid by him to the syndicate, but he was paid nothing on account of the \u201cprofits to be m>ade\u201d by the sale, and defendants denied liability therefor. After the expiration of the six months stipulated for final payment by defendants, he brought this action, though the balance represented by the note and mortgage debt had not yet been paid, nor had anything been realized thereon by the syndicate. Construing the agreement to mean that defendants were not to be liable until the syndicate received the balance of the purchase price in money, the trial judge entered a nonsuit, which the court in banc refused to take off; whereupon plaintiff prosecuted this appeal.\nThere are five assignments of error, four of which complain of a refusal to receive certain testimony offered by plaintiff. These we need not consider, since we are of opinion that, by a proper construction of the agreement itself, plaintiff was entitled to recover. We do not disagree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the word \u201cprofits\u201d ordinarily means \u201cthe net gains from an investment or the prosecution of some business.\u201d Our question is, however, does that word, in the agreement in suit, mean profits actually realized, or those which are provided for in the agreement of sale, whether or not the balance of the purchase price has been paid at the time defendants agree to pay or cause to be paid to plaintiff his share of those profits.\nIt will be noticed that the words \u201cdate of closing\u201d are twice used in the sales agreement, and, in each instance, they mean the date when the deed to the Bellerose Realty Company is to be made, and not the time of payment of the note and mortgage to be then given. There being nothing elsewhere to affect that meaning, they must, when repeated in the proviso to the agreement in suit, be similarly construed: Lippincott v. Stevenson, 273 Pa. 464. Consequently when that proviso says there shall be \u201cno liability whatsoever hereunder if the sale to the Bellerose Realty Company does not go through and there is no closing under said agreement of sale,\u201d it does not relieve defendants, since, under the meaning attributable to those words by the agreement itself, the sale did go through and there was a closing under the agreement of sale. So far as any conclusions can be drawn from that proviso, therefore, it tells against and not for defendants, for it implies that full liability will arise, at the times specified, if the sale does go through, and there is a \u201cclosing under the agreement of sale.\u201d\nSo, too, it will be observed that there is no provision, in the agreement in suit, that plaintiff is to depend for recovery upon his share of profits being actually received by the syndicate. Defendants expressly covenant \u201cto pay or cause to be paid to [plaintiff] his proportionate share of any and all profits to be made by the aforesaid syndicate by reason of the aforesaid conveyance to the Bellerose Realty Company, within six months of the date hereof.\u201d The profits referred to are those \u201cto be made,\u201d not those actually made; and there is no qualification of the duty \u201cto pay or cause to be paid...... within six months of the date\u201d of the agreement. Profits which are represented by a purchase-money mortgage to be paid in six months, may well be said to be \u201cprofits to be made \u201d Apparently, plaintiff was not willing to take any of the risks of the sale, while defendants, who with their coowners were to pay down money of at least $250,000 and to get all the profits realized by a resale, felt they would risk but little by assuming full liability, so far as concerned plaintiff, for the nonpayment of the balance of the purchase price.\nTo construe the provisions of the contract as to profits, otherwise than as we have done, would be to render them meaningless, for, without any such agreement, plaintiff would have been entitled, as a member of the syndicate, to his share of the profits when actually realized.\nThe judgment of the court below is reversed, the non-suit is taken off, and a procedendo is awarded.",

Eichberg, 41 Pa. Superior Ct. 435; Baldwin v. Magen, 279 Pa. 302; Welch v. Miller, 210 Pa. 204.\nJanuary 7, 1929:\n\u201cProfits\u201d is a relative term, equivocal, and susceptible of more than one meaning: Baeder Adamson Co. v. Tunnell, 285 Pa. 356; Foehrenback v.

McClure, 37 Pa. 402; Nusbaum v. Ins. Co., 276 Pa. 526; Lacy v. Green, 84 Pa. 514; Wilson v.
