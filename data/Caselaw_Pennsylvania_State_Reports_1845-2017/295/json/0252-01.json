Egan, 281 Pa. 251; Halderman\u2019s Petition, 276 Pa. 1), but where such an order is beyond the power or jurisdiction of the tribunal entering it, the one thereby detained may be released on habeas corpus: Com. ex rel. v. Heston, 292 Pa. 63; Com. ex rel. v. Morgan, 278 Pa. 395. In addition to the Supreme Court, however, there are several courts of higher jurisdiction than the one that made the order in this case, all of which are empowered to issue writs of habeas corpus; for example, the judges of the Superior Court, of the Courts of Common Pleas, and of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia County, may issue such writs. In Com. v. Curry, 285 Pa. 289, 291, this court recently said: \u201cWhile we have original jurisdiction in such matters, ordinarily applications for habeas corpus should go to other courts, having like jurisdiction, thus affording the Supreme Court time to perform its primary duty of reviewing the decisions of subordinate tribunals.\u201d We shall therefore enter the following order:\nAnd now, January 21, 1929, petition dismissed, without prejudice to the right to apply to another court, for the reason that the Supreme Court does not issue writs of habeas corpus when other courts are available for the purpose.",
