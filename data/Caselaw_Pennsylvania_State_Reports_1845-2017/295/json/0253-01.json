        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThis is an appeal from an order of the court below quashing a writ of alternative mandamus, allowed on the prayer of George F. Barber, in a proceeding to regain the offices of vice-president and treasurer of defendant company, from which positions he alleges he was unlawfully removed by the board of directors of that corporation.\nPlaintiff, in the petition for the mandamus, after a lengthy recital of facts concerning the original incorporation and subsequent reorganization of defendant company, his long-continued connection therewith, and alleged material financial sacrifices made by him to serve it, averred he had last been elected to the offices now in question on \u201cthe second Tuesday of February, 1928, for the succeeding year ending the second Tuesday of February, 1929,\u201d at a fixed annual salary and with the right, under given conditions, to certain extra compensation; that, in October, 1928, after notice to him, the board of directors of defendant corporation passed the following resolution: \u201cResolved, that it is the opinion of this board that it is for the best interests of the company that the resignation of George F. Barber as vice-president and treasurer of the company be, and it is hereby forthwith requested, provided however, that said George F. Barber shall be paid a sum equivalent to his salary from the present date up until the date of the next annual meeting; and resolved further, that said George F. Barber shall be relieved of his duties as such vice-president and treasurer immediately\u201d; that, although plaintiff has been willing to perform the duties of his offices and has applied for leave to do so, all of his demands in that respect \u201chave been either ignored or refused.\u201d He prayed that defendant corporation and its directors and officers, naming them, should be ordered \u201cforthwith to restore him to his positions as vice-president and treasurer ......[and] to assign [him] to the proper duties incident to the said offices; [further,] to allow him to receive the pay and emoluments incident to said offices.\u201d\nThe action of the court below was proper because, in the first place, there is nothing in the by-laws of defendant corporation or in the facts averred in his petition to take the case out of the general rule that \u201cofficers selected by the directors may be removed by them without any cause being assigned,\u201d quoted in the opinion of the court below, which adds that \u201cthis is true of [officers] of a corporation chartered under the Act of 1874 [and] the amending statute of May 14, 1891, P. L. 61,\u201d and cites Savidge on Pa. Corporations, vol. 1, p. 644, section 805; Brindley v. Walker, 221 Pa. 287, 292-3; Spahn v. Bielefeld & Spahn Co., 256 Pa. 543, 547.\nNext, as noted in the opinion of the court below, it is evident that \u201csomething less than\u201d an actual ouster from office was intended by the resolution in relation to plaintiff passed by defendant corporation; this is made additionally plain by the fact that plaintiff\u2019s salary was not stopped and by the admission of his counsel, at the bar of this court, that the offices in question have not been filled by defendant corporation pending the expiration of plaintiff\u2019s current term.\nUnder the above circumstances, mandamus is not the proper remedy, which, in itself, would be a sufficient reason for quashing the writ.' As recently said by us in Independent Brewing Co. v. Colonial Trust Co., 273 Pa. 12, 16-17, \u201cThe writ of mandamus issues only in case of necessity; where there is doubt of its necessity or propriety, it will not go.\u201d Here, if defendant company has broken its contract with plaintiff, he has an adequate remedy at law, entirely aside from mandamus, and therefore no necessity exists for the use of that extraordinary writ.\nTrue, in Spahn v. Bielefeld, supra, where, as here, an officer of a private corporation, claiming to have been improperly ousted from his office, proceeded by mandamus, and where, as here, the writ was quashed, we said that, if a contest over an office did not go to the relator\u2019s original title but concerned only the legality of an alleged ouster, mandamus, not quo warranto, was the proper remedy; but we were then speaking generally and merely meant to say that, in a case where one or the other of these remedies might apply, as between the two, mandamus would be the proper one, and did not mean to intimate.that either was the appropriate remedy to be used by an officer claiming to have been improperly removed by a private corporation, to have the rights accruing to him upon such removal adjudged.\nThe order appealed from is affirmed.",
