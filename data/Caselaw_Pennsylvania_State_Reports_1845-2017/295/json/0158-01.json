        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Frazek,\nPlaintiff, a local expressman, using a horse and covered wagon in his occupation, was injured when driving his team across defendant\u2019s double track railway on Frankford Avenue, in the City of Philadelphia. While the wagon was on the southbound track the left rear wheel was struck by defendants\u2019 car and plaintiff thrown from his seat in the vehicle to the ground, sustaining severe injuries. This action was brought to recover damages for the injury sustained. The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff, which the trial court set aside and entered judgment for defendant, holding plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. Plaintiff appealed.\nIn plaintiff\u2019s statement it is claimed the street car motorman failed to respect the rights of appellant in crossing the railway tracks; that he neglected to give warning of his approach; operated the car in a reckless and dangerous'manner, at excessive speed, and that he negligently collided with plaintiff\u2019s wagon.\nNot one of these allegations is supported by the evidence, even by that of plaintiff himself. As shown by his testimony, he had driven from a freight station over a driveway which intersected Frankford Avenue at right angles, and upon reaching the avenue, stopped his horse about three feet from the nearest track, the one over which the southbound car, which struck his vehicle, was operated. Cars did not stop at this point; the nearest regular stop on his right being Sellers Street, 400 feet distant; the nearest stop on his left, at Unity Street, about 150 feet distant. Upon stopping near the track, plaintiff waited until a trolley car and two motor vehicles passed, then, according to his testimony, he says, \u201cI looked up the southbound track and could see as far as Sellers Street, about 400 feet, and I couldn\u2019t see any trolley. Then I looked on the northbound track and there was one below Unity Street, which is about 150 feet, and it stopped at Unity Street.\u201d Having made these observations, as testified, he started his horse, reached the tracks and was almost immediately struck by the car coming from the north; or to use his own words: \u201cI started the passage right straight across, and just as I got nearly all the way across, the horse\u2019s feet were on the northbound track, I heard a noise and it struck me on the left-hand wheel, cutting a piece out of the iron hub on a v-shape and breaking the clips on my. single trees. I was knocked out on the top of my head between the horse and the wagon.\u201d He was rendered insensible and could remember no more of the details of the accident. None of the witnesses called by plaintiff could coroborate his statements. They were at the time in near-by buildings, heard a loud grinding of car brakes, rushed out too late to see the collision, and helped carry the injured man from the place where he was thrown. There was no evidence by plaintiff\u2019s witnesses that he had looked to see whether cars were approaching, or that the motorman had not given warning with his gong, or that the car was moving at an excessive speed; and in fact, nowhere in the testimony is there an intimation of negligence on the part of defendant.\nThe motorman, whose testimony was not contradicted, testified: \u201cWhen I came down Frankford Avenue, going on down, there was a wagon coming out or came around there at that crossing at the railroad, the Reading Railroad, and I had about twenty feet to stop in, and I kept ringing my gong all the way down, the minute I saw the horse\u2019s head...... I done all kinds of things to stop. I put the sand on and the brakes on, and I jacked her, and everything else and tried to stop, but I had too short a distance to stop in...... I had no view and there was no hope for me, and this man drove out perfectly in front of me.\u201d The motorman\u2019s testimony that he gave warnings and made efforts to stop his car was fully corroborated, not only by the conductor of the car, but also by four passengers who were in the car at the time of the collision. They were aroused by the clanging of the bell and the loud grinding of the brakes; they looked out the windows and first saw plaintiff\u2019s team about twenty feet away. One of them testified: \u201cThe motorman rung his bell and put on the brakes, and pretty nearly threw everybody out of their seats.\u201d Another said: \u201cI heard the conductor sound the gong and immediately he put the brake on, and just about that instant the crash happened.\u201d Another witness standing at Unity Street, 150 feet distant, waiting for a car, testified he saw the plaintiff\u2019s team start to move upon the tracks when the car was distant \u201csixty feet or a little more.\u201d The testimony is convincing that the speed of the trolley at the time of the accident was not more than twelve or fifteen miles an hour, and this evidence is strengthened by the fact that the motorman brought the car to a stop three feet beyond the place of the accident. No testimony was in fact given contradicting the evidence adduced for defendant, and viewing the entire record in every aspect favorable to plaintiff, the conclusion is overwhelming that no negligence is attributable to defendant company. The locality was familiar to plaintiff ; he had driven his teams over the same crossing for thirty years; he knew the situation of defendant\u2019s tracks on Frankford Avenue; he knew that the driveway from the freight station led directly over them. Yet with all' this familiarity with the location, the only precaution he took towards safety was to look up and down the tracks and then drive upon them. He had an unobstructed view of more than 400 feet in the direction from which the southbound car was coming; yet, as he says, he saw no car in all that distance. There was, however, one coming towards him from that direction, as an unsurmountable physical fact proves. He testified that his team moved a distance of only eighteen feet when it was struck. If then there had actually been no car in sight when be looked, tbe car wbicb struck bis wagon would bave traveled a distance of 400 feet during tbe few seconds required for bis team to travel eighteen feet. A simple mathematical calculation will show that for tbe street car to bave covered a distance of 400 feet in so brief a time, it would of necessity bave moved at a speed far beyond fifteen miles an hour.\nIt is therefore clearly evident that tbe car was close at band and in sight at tbe time plaintiff started to cross tbe tracks, and, if be bad looked in tbe direction it was coming, it must bave been a heedless, quick glance, wbicb all evidence in tbe case shows was not an adequate precautional act of the duty required by tbe situation : Warner v. Ry. Co., 141 Pa. 615, 620.\nIn tbe light of tbe complete failure on tbe part of plaintiff to establish negligence by defendant company, tbe verdict cannot be permitted to stand and tbe court below properly entered judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto.\nJudgment affirmed.",
