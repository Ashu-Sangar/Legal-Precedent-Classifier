The defendant was engaged in performing certain repairs to the steamship Bald Hill, at Philadelphia, including, inter alia, the painting of the engine room and repairs to its floor. The said vessel had prior thereto steamed to Philadelphia for necessary repairs, and at the time of the alleged accident was tied up to Pier 98 South in the Delaware River. The claimant, in the course of his aforesaid employment by the defendant, was painting angle Rons in the engine room of the vessel. Sparks from an acetylene torch, being used by a fellow employee working near claimant, entered the claimant’s eyes and caused the injuries resulting in the alleged disability of the claimant.” It will be noticed that there is nothing here to show that the scope of Span’s general employment contemplated maidtime work or that his injury resulted from a tortious act on the part of his employer or any one else.</p>

Claimant’s husband, a boilermaker, was killed while repairing a scow in navigable waters, through the negligence of the Dredge &amp; Dock Co., his employer. His widow recovered damages in a district court, judgment was entered in her favor, and the employer appealed to the United States Supreme Court. In affirming, the Supreme Court said that Kierejewski was killed “while performing maritime service to a completed vessel afloat ......upon navigable waters, as the result of a tort there committed”; and that “the rules of the maritime law, supplemented by the local death statute, applied and fixed the legal rights and liabilities of the parties.” Thus, the local law was allowed application to the extent indicated.</p>

The court below, apparently viewing the facts as presenting a land case, refused relief on the ground that it had no jurisdiction. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that “repairs to a vessel while in ordinary dry dock were not made on land”; that claimant’s injury was sustained through a tort “committed and effective on navigable waters,” and therefore admiralty had jurisdiction. So far as the report of the case shows, there was no question of the work which Gonsalves was doing at the time of his injury bearing direct relation to <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>navigation, or, as here, of the maritime law being-affected by a local Workmen’s Compensation Act.</p>

A judgment in favor of the injured man was reversed because the jury had been instructed that, in deciding whether the employer was negligent, it might consider the provisions of a local statute regulating the construction of scaffolds. The Supreme Court said (p. 457) : “The alleged tort was maritime, suffered by one doing repair work on board a completed vessel [in navigable waters]. The matter was not of mere local concern......but had direct relation to navigation and commerce...... The rights and liabilities of the parties arose out of and depended upon the general maritime law and could not be enlarged or impaired by the state statute.”</p>

Imbrovek, <a href="/us/234/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="234 U.S. 52" data-case-ids="675069" data-case-paths="/us/234/0052-01">234 U.

The Boat Superior, 1 Gilpin’s Reports 514, 516); but the mere fact that, at the moment of his injury, one was engaged in performing services which might properly be classed as “maritime in character” is not the final test as to exclusiveness of maritime jurisdiction to adjudge rights growing out of the situation: Sultan Ry., etc., Co. v.

(2) Under the circumstances of the particular case, would “the regulation of the rights, obligations and consequent liabilities of the parties, as between themselves, by a local rule,......necessarily work material prejudice to any characteristic feature of the general maritime law or interfere with [its] proper harmony or uniformity”?

We think, from this Rohde Case and subsequent opinions mentioning it, the view may be fairly deduced that, in a case like the present, where neither the injured person’s general employment nor his particular activities at the time of the accident bear any direct relation to navigation or commerce, a state workmen’s compensation law may apply.</p>

In deciding that the local act could apply, the United States Supreme Court said, “It is settled by our decisions that where the employment, <em>although maritime in character, </em>pertains to local matters, <em>having only an incidental relation to navigation and- commerce, </em>the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties, as between themselves, may be regulated by local rules which do not work material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law or interfere with its uniformity.” The above italics are ours. The original contracts of land employment and the incidental going upon navigable waters in the Sultan Case and in the one now before us seem analogous. As of the loggers in the former, so it may be said of the present plaintiff: that the labor of a maritime character at which he was engaged at the time of his injury had “only incidental relation to navigation and commerce,” and since his contract of general employment is not shown to be other than a land contract, the mere incident that its performance carried plaintiff temporarily on navigable waters, was not sufficient to cause that employment, and the rights and liabilities which pertain to it, to be so deprived of their essentially local character that admiralty would take jurisdiction to the exclusion of a helpful state law.</p>

Industrial Commission (the last of the recent eases above mentioned), claimant, originally employed to do both land and sea work, was injured while endeavoring to push a stranded boat into a navigable river; an award under a state compensation act was sustained by the United States Supreme Court, Mr. Justice McReynolds saying, inter alia, “When injured, certainly he [the claimant] was not engaged in any work so directly connected with navigation and commerce that to permit the rights of the parties to be <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>controlled by the local law would interfere with the essential uniformity of the general maritime law.

(2) Were his activities of such a nature that the application of a particular local law, as between the parties, would work material prejudice to some characteristic feature of the general maritime law or interfere with its proper harmony or uniformity?

So far as the record shows, he had no general maritime employment; he happened to be sent by his employer (a third party engaged by the shipowner) to do some painting in the engine room of a vessel laid up for repairs in navigable waters, and was injured while thus engaged, not by any act on the part of either the shipowner or its employees, nor because of any motion of the boat or other matter peculiar to navigation or commerce, but by pure accident, contributed to by one who, like himself, was working for the contractor engaged by the shipowner. This contractor, third-party employer, and the plaintiff had agreed generally between themselves that, in case of injury to the latter during the course of his employment, he would be entitled to compensation according to a schedule in the state compensation act. Here, as much as in the Rohde Case, we think it can be said, “the parties, plaintiff and defendant, contracted with reference to the state statute” and “the application of the local <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>law” to “their rights and liabilities” “cannot materially affect any rules of the sea whose uniformity is essential.” Furthermore, if a state statute providing for recovery in cases of death due to a maritime tort, — a recovery which was not permitted in admiralty, — can be allowed application to a stevedore case, as not interfering with the proper harmony and uniformity of the maritime law (Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, <a href="/us/257/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="257 U.S. 233" data-case-ids="3678835" data-case-paths="/us/257/0233-01">supra),</a> surely a state statute, — giving rise to an implied agreement for compensation to a mechanic (whose general employment, so far as the record shows, was not maritime) accidentally injured during the course of his work, which, at the time of the injury, happened to be on a boat in navigable waters, — can be permitted application to the facts in this case, without undue interference with the uniformity of the federal law: see Great Lakes D. &amp; D. Co. v. Kierejewski, <a href="/us/261/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="261 U.S. 479" data-case-ids="6143029" data-case-paths="/us/261/0479-01">supra.</a> As we view it, there is nothing in the situation here presented which will cause material prejudice to any characteristic feature of the general maritime law or interfere with its proper harmony or uniformity if the rights of the parties, between themselves, are adjudged according to the local statute; therefore, we hold that the Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act was properly applied.</p>

Moreover, in each of those cases the injuries resulted from a maritime tort, — that is, a wrongful act committed on the high seas or on navigable waters: Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, <a href="/us/234/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="234 U.S. 52" data-case-ids="675069" data-case-paths="/us/234/0052-01">234 U. S. 52</a>, 59, 60. While the jurisdiction of the federal courts “comprehends all maritime contracts, torts and injuries” (see Campbell v. Hackfeld, 125 Federal Reporter 696, 697, 700, citing and quoting from Judge Story, in De Lovio v. Boit, <a href="/f-cas/7/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="2 Gall. 398" data-case-ids="6119147" data-case-paths="/f-cas/7/0418-01">2 Gall. 398</a>, 474, Fed. Cas. No. 3, 776), yet in all the federal cases where admiralty relief was <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>afforded to physically injured persons who were not members of the crew of, or constantly attached to, the ship on which they were hurt, the injuries were attributable to a maritime tort, — a fact emphasized in each instance: see, for example, Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, <a href="/us/234/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="234 U.S. 52" data-case-ids="675069" data-case-paths="/us/234/0052-01">234 U. S. 52</a>, 58 et seq.; Great Lakes v.

Under these circumstances, since plaintiff cannot in any proper sense be classed as a seaman, entitled in admiralty to a measure of relief for accidental injuries (see The Osceola, <a href="/us/189/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="189 U.S. 158" data-case-ids="443544" data-case-paths="/us/189/0158-01">189 U.

    <p id="b65-3" data-blocks='[["BL_65.4",65,[114,1222,1164,969]]]'>We may add, in conclusion, that, since the opinion of the Superior Court in this case, — accompanying the final judgment appealed from, — was written, the Supreme Court of the United States, in Northern Coal. &amp; Dock Co. v.

When, as here, however, the labor in question is not shown to bear any <em>direct </em>relation to navigation or commerce, a different situation is presented; and that is the key to the solution of this case. The judgment is affirmed.</p>
