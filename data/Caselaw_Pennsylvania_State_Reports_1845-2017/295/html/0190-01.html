    <p id="b219-3" data-blocks='[["BL_219.7",219,[145,451,1155,1457]]]'>Defendant, an Italian, with two others, was engaged in illegal liquor traffic in Washington County. On the evening of February 7, 1927, he and his partners were making deliveries of two cans of whiskey by automobile. They carried their weapons with them as usual. After delivering one can, they proceeded on their journey, stopping in front of a company store, near the railroad, where the second can was removed from the car. Defendant, with Roy Wenrich, one of his partners, left the car to make delivery of the can. They proceeded a short distance up the railroad tracks, Wenrich being a few feet ahead of defendant, when they were observed by officers Fox and Knapp, who started in pursuit. On reaching defendant, who was carrying the liquor, Knapp undertook to arrest him. He commanded Luccitti to halt; the latter dropped the can and immediately shot the officer, killing him instantly. Fox, meanwhile, passed Knapp and Luccitti, endeavoring to overtake Wenrich further up the track. As Fox approached, Wenrich shot him twice, slightly wounding him; Fox then turned and started down the track, Wenrich fleeing from the scene. Fox, in returning, passed defendant, who shot him twice in the back, one bullet going through the lung, the other cutting the spinal cord. He died in a few days, but was able to describe his assailant as a “short Italian bootlegger from West Brownsville,” Luccitti being an Italian, his partners Americans.</p>

He was arrested in Elizabeth, N. J., ten months after these killings, in an unsuccessful fight with a dozen officers, two of whom he wounded. He was returned to Washington County, and while in jail attempted to escape, to commit suicide, and to fabricate his evidence. Defendant admitted he was at the scene of the murder, but denied his participation <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>in the shooting, placing the responsibility on Wenrich. The jury disbelieved his story, found him guilty of murder of the first degree and fixed death as the penalty. All the ingredients of that degree are present. This appeal raises trial errors, and an abuse of discretion in not ordering a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b220-4" data-blocks='[["BL_220.4",220,[312,663,1151,1500]]]'>During the session of court at which this defendant was to be tried, another prisoner, Matakovich, convicted of first degree murder in an entirely different homicide, was called to the bar for sentence, his punishment having been fixed by the jury at death. Counsel for this prisoner, in addressing a plea for mercy to the court, said, “Can this case be compared with the case which your honor tried here just a few weeks ago in this county? Needless to mention the name of the case. But......is not this defendant entitled to more leniency and to more mercy than that defendant, and still at the same time, the jury sitting in this very — ” At this point counsel was stopped by the court and admonished that the jury presently impanelled to try another homicide case (Luccitti’s) were present, and, if such statements were persisted in, they might disqualify the panel. Counsel made no further reference to the subject. Defendant, in his motion for a new trial, urged that the remarks were highly prejudicial to him, as the court and every one present knew that Wenrich, defendant’s partner, had just been found guilty of murder, and sentenced to life imprisonment, and that the remarks of counsel were intended to show that this offense, with which Luccitti was connected, was much more aggravated than that for which Matakovich was then to be sentenced to death. The court below refused to grant the new trial, and this, it is now urged, was an abuse of discretion.</p>

Sucb circumstances as narrated are the inevitable result of our practice where jurors mingle with spectators and witnesses in tbe court room. Sucb incidents cannot be considered harmful unless tbe statements tend prejudically to influence tbe mind, creating sucb a condition of bias that tbe accused can not get a fair trial with that jury. Of this, tbe court below, in tbe exercise of judicial discretion, is the sole judge, and, further, where it appears that tbe prisoner bad an opportunity to develop the juror’s prejudice in an examination on voir dire and failed to use it, or where tbe answers show that in fact no prejudice existed, an appellate court will not consider tbe question of abuse of discretion on appeal. Here tbe usual questions sought to elicit from tbe jurors their state of mind toward tbe defendant, and were sufficiently comprehensive to include tbe colloquy between court and counsel.</p>

There was no offer to show an oral threat to kill, nor the admonition to defendant, “Don’t kill him.” No objection was made to this evidence, and it cannot be considered as covered by that made to the original offer. Where an offer is made, either at side bar (as this was), or in open court, and the objection thereto is overruled, the evidence which follows should conform to the offer. If testimony varies in material parts, it is necessary to make a further objection to the evidence, or later move to strike it out. If this is not done, the error, if it is such, will not be considered on appeal.</p>

To hell with the officers.” And again, “The same policeman will only stop me once.” At another time, “That’s the reason I carry that gun. If any officer stops me, I will shoot him.” Under these circumstances, even had there been a specific objection to the evidence, it would have been error to exclude it.</p>

They have strong probative value in establishing a defendant’s guilt. It did not appear defendant had been connected with any other killing; the officers, in their interrogation, might safely rely on the fact that the Washington County murder was the only one committed by defendant; no other killing was in defendant’s mind, as is evident from the answer, which described a weapon similar to that used the night of the murder. Defendant started to fire the moment the officers apprehended him. It is fair to assume he knew what the officers wanted and what they meant when he was asked the question. The complaint is without merit, as is also the objection to the evidence of the defendant’s going under an assumed name and growing a mustache.</p>

The photographs were offered to show a change in appearance. The witness said he knew defendant and the photographs were a correct likeness of him; further, that he had been living under the name of Midia in New York. The witness, though he had not taken the pictures, was competent to testify that the photographs were a correct likeness of defendant before and after the murder. “Photographs are not of themselves substantive evidence and are not evidence per se.

On examination of the record, there is nothing to indicate that the pictures came from the rogue’s gallery, and the lower court states in its opinion that there were absolutely no markings on the pictures of any kind which would show their use. But, granted that the pictures <em>were </em>of such a character, it ivould not necessarily mean that defendant was wanted for another crime. The fact that photographs are from the rogue’s gallery should ordinarily be kept from the jury, but, under the circumstances of this case, the fact that they were admitted could have done the defendant no harm.</p>
