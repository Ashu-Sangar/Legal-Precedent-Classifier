The entire line was 2,800 feet in length, of which three-fourths was placed within a tunnel, and this portion was subjected to greater vertical pressure as a result of the superincumbent earth, and therefore required greater protection. For this purpose it was agreed that “the coal company Avill leave in place and unmined a strip of coal twenty-five feet in width under the entire course defined above for the said pipe line where tunneled for the support of the pipe line.” There was, however, retained by the coal company the right to mine “successfully and conveniently” all of the coal on its land, except the 25 foot block beneath the tunnel, specially reserved, and, even as to the retained section, it Avas permitted to make cross cuts, not more than 18 feet in width, and not less than 100 feet apart. This limitation was made necessary because the line therein would be subjected to increased strain.</p>

The latter had expressly reserved in the agreement before us the right to take out all of the coal on its land, except as it was limited in its operations on the 25 foot strip under the land tunneled, but, even as to this portion, it retained the restricted power to undermine.

Negotiations between the parties concerned, as to the extent of the proposed mining, were entered into, and continued for several years, without reaching a definite plan of procedure, and were finally abandoned. This injunction was then asked to restrain the defendant from further maintaining and operating its pipe line on" the right of way without properly supporting it, so as to remove the danger of breakage, and the consequent flooding of the property of the grantor, which it was averred would follow, in the absence of such action, if coal was taken out nearer to the 25 foot strip, as permitted by the agreement, and expressly stipulated for, since the water company had therein contracted not to hinder the coal company in its operations, and, in case any part of the land occupied by the pipe line was weakened, to correct the defect at its own cost, so that no damage would result, and for this purpose was given the power to enter and place additional supports. It was expressly agreed that all places which might become insecure should be replaced, maintained and kept equally good and substantial at its expense, so that no loss or damage should occur to the coal company by reason of its granting a right of way.

Of this I cannot doubt. After the construction of the road the plaintiff cannot build up his dam, for this would submerge the road five or six feet, and make it impassable.

A corporation obtaining a concession to enter on condition of refraining from a particular injury, in its nature irreparable, and which cannot be readily estimated in damages, forfeits its license when it violates this condition, and should be restrained until it does equity. It comes under that head of equity power which extends to the prevention or restraint of the commission or continuance of acts contrary to law, and prejudicial to the interests of the community, or the rights of individuals.”</p>

The agreement does not expressly provide for the placing of additional supports by the water company, when necessary, on this part of the line, but, as we read the contract, its liability is not limited as contended for by appellee. The attendant circumstances indicate a reason for furnishing greater and more ample protection in the three-fourths first mentioned, where the pipe was underground, because of the pressure resulting from the overlying earth. As to the balance, covering the land where the pipe was on the surface, the parties must have contemplated that even a less width would be required to furnish ample support.</p>

The water company has expressly contracted that it would not hinder the coal company in operating its mines, and removing such coal as it saw fit, except under the tunneled portion, and, in case any part of the right of way became weakened, it would do what was necessary to prevent any loss or damage. Upon the performance of this condition, the grantor has the right to insist.
