    <p id="b378-4" data-blocks='[["BL_378.6",378,[280,388,1155,960]]]'>On the hearing of a petition for an issue devisavit vel non, contestants produced three of decedent’s attending physicians. They said she was suffering from paresis, and was not competent to make a will. On cross-examination they testified that, in their opinion, paresis can result only from syphilis; but did not say whether or not, in her case, it was inherited, or arose because of her personal actions, and if so, whether they were proper or improper. Assuming that the disclosure of the fact stated would tend to blacken her character, the trial judge ultimately excluded their testimony from consideration, his reason for so doing being the Act of June 7, 1907, P. L. 462. Logically, he also excluded the opinion evidence of other doctors, whose conclusions, in whole or in part, were based on that of the attending physicians. Prom his refusal of the issue prayed for, this appeal was taken. The exclusion of the evidence referred to was error.</p>
    <p id="b378-5" data-blocks='[["BL_378.7",378,[277,1369,1153,258]]]'>The title and enacting section of the statute are: “An act to prevent physicians and surgeons from testifying, in civil cases, to communications made to them by their patients, except in civil cases brought by their patients for damages on account of personal injuries.</p>

Hence, in Reid v. Reid, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20Pa.%20C.%20601" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="50 Pa. C. 601">50 Pa. C.

We have also steadily held to the requirement of a <em>clear </em>expression, in contradistinction to one which can only be reached by a process of reasoning: Provident Life &amp; Trust Co. v. Hammond, <a href="/pa/230/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="230 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="8846324" data-case-paths="/pa/230/0407-01">230 Pa. 407</a>; Investor’s Realty Co. v.

It folloAVS that, however broad a construction would otherwise be given to the word “information” in the body of the act, its constitutional scope cannot be extended beyond “communications,” and this limitation must be still further restricted by the words “made <em>to </em>them [the physicians and surgeons] <em>by </em>their patients.” Those two prepositions wreck any possible argument which can be made to support the ruling below. Possibly without them, however, the same conclusion would be reached.</p>

If we assume all these cases to have been properly decided, however, they are not even persuasive here, since in none of them was there the necessity of clear expression required by our Constitution, and only in the last did the fatal prepositions “to” and “by” appear, and there, neither in the obiter dictum, nor elsewhere, was their effect considered.</p>

There the deceased, in his application for insurance, had ansAvered “No,” to questions inquiring whether or not he had ever had convulsions or any other illness than, as stated by him, epilepsy not being among them. When his attending physician Avas called as a witness, he Avas excused from answering Avhether or not decedent had had epilepsy or convulsions pi*ior to the making of the application, because he had “indicated to the court [below] that the specific disease of which [insured] was suffering [was a loathsome one] of which epilepsy and convulsions were only symptoms.” We reversed the ruling, and held that the Act of 1907 did not excuse the doctor from answering the question.</p>

In proper cases we take that course, but this is not one of them. We have here the testimony of 24 witnesses, covering 667 pages of the record.
