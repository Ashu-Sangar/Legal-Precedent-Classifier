As affecting the compensation for injury to these rights the characters of both plaintiff and spouse are in issue. Good character is presumed to exist in plaintiff and spouse, and evidence need not be offered to show it unless it is attacked. Slight insinuation is all that is necessary, however, to permit plaintiff to show it: Clark v.

In Pennsylvania, in an action for seduction, where the damages recoverable are much the same, we early held that neither actual character nor particular acts could be inquired into, and that the assault on character must be made through reputation. “A person may have a very good reputation......notwithstanding acts of indiscretion” : Hoffman v. Kemerer, <a href="/pa/44/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="44 Pa. 452" data-case-ids="484280" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0452-01">44 Pa. 452</a>; Miller v.

However, our later cases have adopted a more liberal view, and, in an opinion by President Judge Kick, without elaborating his reasons, it was held that particular acts as well as reputation may be used as evidence in mitigation of damages in an action for criminal conversation: Ehrhart v.

A character may be imposed or acquired through the conduct of a business or engagement in certain pursuits. Thus we have held that the fact of adultery may be presumed from one’s frequenting a bawdyhouse. The offer was to show lack of reputation of the proprietor-plaintiff and his wife, and a particular act of immorality. The offer, of course, Avas not available as a defense; the fact that plaintiff is of a general dissolute character will not be a bar to the action: Silvernali v. Westerman, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Kulp%207" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="2 Kulp 7">2 Kulp 7</a>. While the keeper of a baAvdyhouse would not have much of a reputation, that fact Avould not excuse defendant from all liability for debauching his wife. But the offer Avas competent to lessen recovery for loss of his Avife’s companionship and injury to his social position (Norton v. Warner, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Conn.%20172" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="9 Conn. 172">supra);</a> it is quite similar to acts of unchastity or infidelity in its bearing on mental suffering. A man Avho conducts a place for prostitution should not be so keenly hui*t if his Avife happens to be <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>enmeshed in his own business: He certainly offers her every facility for it. But in fixing the punishment defendant is to receive, it should be tempered very much by the actual character of plaintiff and his spouse, and the fact that their marital rights are regarded by them as being of little or no value.</p>
    <p id="b239-3" data-blocks='[["BL_239.4",239,[132,670,1153,532]]]'>The danger from collateral issues in admitting particular acts as evidence is to be expected for the reason the action contemplates such testimony in relief of damages; and as for plaintiff being surprised at the character of the evidence, it was perhaps no greater than defendant’s surprise when served with the summons from one openly engaged in the business of unchastity, — running a bawdyhouse; but as the action is predicated on infidelity and character, the evidence offered, if true, should have been anticipated.</p>
    <p id="b239-4" data-blocks='[["BL_239.5",239,[127,1215,1156,804]]]'>The second part of the offer, that is, to show the reputation of persons who visited the house, is not good. The reputation of the house as a bawdyhouse is the point to be established; it should stand out in the neighborhood as such, without the necessity of establishing it by the reputation of persons Avho visited the house as being of ill repute for chastity, gambling, etc. It would be carrying the doctrine of unoffending collateral issues too far to permit the reputation of frequenters to be offered. The offer was not to sIioav that the spouse consorted with persons of unchaste repute (30 C. J. section 1064, pages 1164, 1165; Smith v. Hockenberry, <a href="/mich/146/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="146 Mich. 7" data-case-ids="1496108" data-case-paths="/mich/146/0007-01">146 Mich. 7</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20N.W.%2023" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="109 N.W. 23">109 N.
