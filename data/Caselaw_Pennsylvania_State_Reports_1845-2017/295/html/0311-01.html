L. 639, as amended by the Act of May 10, 1921, P. L. 435. The act defines sedition as follows: “The word ‘sedition,’ as used in this act, shall mean: Any writing, publication, printing, cut, cartoon, utterance, or conduct, either individually or in connection or combination with any other person or persons, the intent of which is: (a) To make or cause to be made any outbreak or demonstration of violence against this State or against the United States, (b) To encourage any person or persons to take any measures or engage in any conduct with a view of overthrowing or destroying or attempting to overthrow or destroy, by any force or show or threat of force, the Government of this State or of the United States, (c) To incite or encourage any person or persons to commit any overt act with a view to bringing the Government of this State or of the United States into hatred or contempt, (d) To incite any person or persons to do or attempt to do personal injury or harm to any officer of this State or of the United States, or to damage or destroy any public property or the property of any public official because of his official position. It shall also include: (e) The actual damage to, or destruction of, any public property, or the property of any public official, perpetrated because the owner or occupant is in official position, (f) Any writing, publication, printing, cut, cartoon, or utterance which advocates or teaches the duty, necessity, or propriety of engaging in crime, violence, or any form of terrorism, as a means of accomplishing political reform or change in government, (g) The sale, gift, or distribution of any prints, publications, books, papers, documents, or written matter in any form, which advocates, furthers, or teaches sedition as hereinbefore defined. (h) Organizing or helping to organize or becoming a member of an assembly, society, or group, where any of the policies or purposes thereof are seditious as <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>hereinbefore defined.” Our immediate discussion will deal with all the foregoing paragraphs, with the exception of paragraph (c); no charge was laid thereunder, and it will not be considered.</p>

The party is affiliated with the “Third International” of Moscow, which is a world-wide revolutionary organization, and it is admitted that a literal interpretation of Communism, as taught by Marx, Lenin, and their school, includes a <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, to he consummated by force. The real issue is thus stated: “Is it sedition to belong to an organization that teaches and advocates this extreme doctrine of Communism?” “As to the other [these] defendants there was some evidence that they took part in the various activities of the party; that Muselin, Zima and Resetar [defendants here] taught and spoke at the meetings, advocating the violent overthrow of government”; and that they solicited persons to join the organization which taught the principles of the overthrow of government by force, as found by the Superior Court.</p>

That effort to separate was met Avith successful armed resistance. The established government is the government of all the people; any change in its form should come from the majority, and the Constitution points the way to effect such a change. Whether, under extreme circumstances, a condition may arise justifying other procedure of a more violent nature (Wells v. Bain, <a href="/pa/75/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="75 Pa. 39" data-case-ids="1036740" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0039-01">75 Pa. 39</a>), we will not decide or discuss; however, section 20 would seem to furnish means to secure satisfactory redress. The legislature, under the <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>police power, to preserve the State’s republican form of government, to suppress insurrection and to maintain the safety, peace and order of its citizens, may enact laws to suppress acts or attempts to commit acts of violence toward the government; it may prohibit the teaching or advocacy of a revolution or force as a means of redressing supposed injuries, or effecting a change in government.

It is true that section 7 is a part of the Bill of Rights, but overshadowing these rights is the authority of the government to preserve its existence under the police power. Article XVI of the Constitution says “the police power shall never be abridged.” This relates to all phases of its exercise. The police power is the greatest and most powerful attribute of government; on it the very existence of the state depends: 6 R. C. L. 183; District of Columbia v.

The act makes sedition a felony, and names situations that warrant a conviction of <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>it. The burden of the act is an effort to preserve the State, and it should be so interpreted. The act protects the life of the State from direct assault by force or intimidation, or from an indirect assault through the machinations, of an individual or a group which teach, advocate or encourage others to attack with force with intent to destroy, or to terrorize its officials through fear of harm, injury or destruction, with like purpose. This is accomplished by punishing those individuals who would by force overthrow it. Intent to destroy or overthrow the government is made an essential element of the crime; and such intent or purpose is shown by the normal result of committed acts, or may be inferred, therefrom — an end that an ordinarily prudent person would naturally expect from the act. In some of the offenses the legislature had determined the doing of the act involved a danger to the State, as teaching, or sale of writings, etc. The statute has no relation to acts of persons, criminal or civil, which may be termed offenses or wrongs against persons as persons or property as property, and which cause incidental harm to the structure of the State. To advise or suggest to one to commit crimes such as trespass or, as suggested, violation of the Volstead Act, or others of higher degree, is not an engagement in crime or violence as a means of accomplishing a change in the form of government; such violations are not within the Sedition Act. The act does not emasculate political discussions. Government officers, the conduct of public officials and the laws themselves, may be criticized without fear of punishment, unless the statements should be maliciously false, and then punishment is meted out in the terms of injury to an individual. Remedies for the relief of supposed wrongs or the redress of grievances may be suggested and urged without fear of punishment, as provided by article I, section 20, of our Constitution. Books treating historically of past revolutions, of the doctrines of the various forms of government, books and essays on sociology and <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>economics, wbicli treat on the various influences in government and their possible elimination, or their supposed peril, the writings of reformers, — all these may be safely offered for sale or taught as they are now in our educational institutions. Freedom of thought, speech and the press is as extensive since the passage of the act as it was before. The Sedition Act does not attempt to interfere with these rights; it contemplates a higher and broader ground. The danger line in utterances is reached when one strikes at the very foundation of organized society by inciting rebellion in an attempt to destroy it.</p>

The liberty of speech and press guaranteed by our Constitution does not mean an abso<a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>lute liberty, without limitation; it is limited by its own terms. When one freely speaks or prints, he is responsible, through the processes provided by law, to the people or to the individual aggrieved, if that liberty is abused. The Constitution is not solely concerned with wrong or harm to the person, but is unrestricted in terms, and is sufficiently comprehensive to include the government, to whom one may be responsible for the abuse of the liberty of speech. The body that determines in the first instance what utterances of speech shall constitute abuse, is the legislature. They must be such as cause or tend to cause an uprising to injure or overthrow the government. The legislature also determines finally whether the time, place and circumstances are ripe for such limitation. Having a more frequent and direct contact with the people, the members composing that body are better able to observe and sense political or economic difficulties, to learn what situations present substantive evil, and whether the latter is likely to be inflamed by violent language or the use of the prohibited language. That the legislature, in the interest of public safety, as an exertion of the police power, may enact laws which will correct evils that threaten the government, is illustrated by the Sedition Act. Whether the regulation of speech or print goes beyond the “abuse of liberty” as contemplated by the Constitution, is for the courts. They may review the reasonableness of the enactments <em>; </em>and, viewed in the light of all considerations, the purposes of the Sedition Act do not violate any fundamental precept of our constitutional government.</p>
    <p id="b347-3" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[123,1972,1153,425]],["BL_348.1",348,[305,336,1153,2004]]]'>Appellants contend that the courts should define the speech or print that would constitute an abuse of liberty or freedom as mentioned in the Constitution; for illustration, when one is prosecuted criminally for acts such as contained in the Sedition Act, the courts alone should have power to declare whether these acts are an abuse of liberty of speech or print. ' However great the power lodged in courts, there is no reasonable inference from <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>section 7 that would confer such exclusive authority on the courts. Considering the character of the offenses enumerated in the act, the theory of our government forbids such extraordinary exclusive control. While the proscription was undoubtedly to protect all branches of government, it particularly safeguarded the legislative and executive branches, rather than the judicial. The judiciary is a constituent or coordinate part of government; it is not subordinate to other powers, nor does it depend for existence on the legislative will. Its powers come directly from the people, without intervening agency. From the very nature of its time-honored powers, it should be kept a separate, distinct and independent entity in government to perform those duties which have been immemorially under the common law imposed on it. The domain of the judiciary is in the field <em>of the </em>administration of justice under the law; it interprets, construes and applies the law. Its powers were possibly the first to be exercised by civilization. Within <em>the </em>compass of its duties it may ascertain and punish crimes against the State, and may, at times, in designated instances, operate as a check on other departments of government; but its strength and security come from a complete and absolute separation from political, administrative or ministerial functions. While in essence it may restrain attempts on the life of the State, and therefore under the common law may protect the State, the judiciary does not assume, nor should it be burdened with, those functions of government which are political, administrative or ministerial, nor does it intermeddle with the execution of these functions by the proper branches of government unless specifically required to do so by the Constitution. The legislative and executive branches should be, as they are, in a position actively to protect their delegated functions by the passage of an act like the one in question. It will be time for the judiciary to act when its own powers are assailed.</p>
