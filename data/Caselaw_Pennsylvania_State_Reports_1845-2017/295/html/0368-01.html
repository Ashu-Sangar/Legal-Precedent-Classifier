With fellow servants of the latter he was at work some distance from a boiler recently put in place by another independent contractor, Badenhausen, which at the time had not however been fully tested nor accepted by the purchaser. On the S Rturday preceding the accident the work on it was com<a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>pleted, and the two vents on the top clamped down so that trials conld be made as to its pressure capacity, and a preliminary test was then undertaken.. This work was done entirely by the manufacturer, the openings having been closed by his servants, and remaining in the same condition until the Monday following.</p>
    <p id="b396-4" data-blocks='[["BL_396.4",396,[285,699,1156,1236]]]'>The Sunbury Converting Works, owner of the plant, made application for boiler insurance to the London Guarantee &amp; Accident Company, one of the defendants in this proceeding. To determine whether a policy should be issued, the latter sent an agent, Simpkins, to pass upon the sufficiency of the completed boiler. Admittedly, he was an employee of the inspection department of the indemnity company, as shown by his business card offered in evidence, but it was denied that he “commanded, directed or controlled the test.” When he came upon the ground, the boiler was erected, and the openings on top had been closed. The only supervision exercised by him is shown by the following testimony: He “examined the bottom of the boiler, and got in between the boiler and then went on top,” where the coverings were in place, and there stood until the explosion occurred. Wynans, the foreman of Badenhausen, was in charge and gave the order to the workmen. He testified that the flange “was thoroughly tightened properly; that is, the bolts were made taut. Then I had the man [one of his employees] take and go round it three times before he tightened up entirely on it to be sure that all bolts were tightened down evenly.”</p>
    <p id="b396-5" data-blocks='[["BL_396.5",396,[286,1947,1154,479]],["BL_397.1",397,[128,367,1156,795]]]'>Simpkins, having gotten on top of the boiler, told the contractor’s employees to start the pump so that the hydrostatic test could be proceeded with, and this they did. The pressure required by the specifications was 311 pounds, but when it reached 255, the covering over the outlet on top broke, and was blown into the air. Anderson, working on an iron beam about eight feet from the boiler, and five feet higher, was thrown by the explosion from that position to the ground 30 or 40 feet below, and <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>death, resulted. The widow brought suit against Badenhausen, the manufacturer, and the insurance company jointly, contending the injury was caused by negligence in using a flange of insufficient thickness to cover the opening, from which the proper braces were missing, thus lessening its strength, and in failing to provide valves to remove trapped air within the boiler. The trial resulted in a nonsuit as to Badenhausen, one of the defendants, but as to the insurance company the evidence was submitted to the jury, and a verdict rendered for plaintiff on the theory that the test was made without the taking of adequate precautions by Simpkins to discover possible defects before permitting the application of pressure, for which lack of care his employer was liable.</p>

L. 352 (section 19), amended by the Acts of July 12, 1919, P. L. 924; June 14, 1923, P. L. 751, and April 9, 1925, P. L. 251. The investigation here made was undertaken merely to determine the question of acceptance in a plant not yet completed, and the acts referred to are not controlling in the present case, as the court below decided in finally entering judgment for the defendant n. o. v. It properly held the rule of liability laid down in Durkin v. Kingston Coal Co., <a href="/pa/171/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="171 Pa. 193" data-case-ids="985613" data-case-paths="/pa/171/0193-01">171 Pa. 193</a>, and D’Jorko v.

Nor is it material, as insisted by appellant, that the amending Act of April 9, 1925, supra, provides that a boiler inspector shall be treated as the employee of the one who hires him, since the declaration thus expressed is made only to indicate that but one annual permit fee shall be charged, though the insurance company has in service more than one inspector.

    <p id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[319,570,1157,1184]]]'>The court below in entering judgment for defendant correctly stated the questions here involved in these words: “The decision in this case rests on the failure of the plaintiff to prove a neglect of duty by the defendant, London Guarantee &amp; Accident Co., Ltd., or its employee, Simpkins.” The boiler had been erected by Badenhausen, and had not been accepted by the vendee. An application to insure had been made, and the defendant desired to know whether the specifications had been complied with by the manufacturer, and if the construction was of such character as to withstand the contemplated pressure before undertaking the risk. The duty of Simpkins was to find if the contractor had installed a machine which would withstand the resistance for which it was designed. When he arrived, the boiler was in the control of the manufacturer, and the openings had already been closed, with the alleged defective flange, and tightly fastened. The directions given by him were to the employees of Badenhausen to start the test, to learn whether the work contracted for was properly completed, so as to justify the making of an insurance contract, and nothing more.</p>

A witness was asked concerning a statement made by Simpkins fifteen minutes after the accident, indicating that he was making the test at the time of the accident. An objection was sustained by the court, presumably because the testimony desired to be brought out was a matter of opinion, or a narrative of what had previously occurred, and therefore not receivable as a part of the res gestae, though the record fails to disclose the actuating reason for excluding the testimony.
