Testimony was taken, the commission decide i that none of the claimants had been or would be dan - aged, and dismissed all their claims. They separately appealed to the court of common pleas, where the present appellant filed a petition, in each case, praying a dismissal of the appeal for want of jurisdiction in that court. These petitions were dismissed, whereupon thirteen appeals were duly taken to this court, in order to obtain preliminarily, by virtue of the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, a final decision regarding the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas. That is the single question raised on this record, and is the only one we decide.</p>

If that dual situation does not exist, there is then one of “other cases” regarding which the statute peremptorily declares the appeal <em>“shall </em>be to the said Superior Court.” Here, there was no award of damages, the property owners appealed to the wrong tribunal, and their appeals should have been quashed by it.</p>
