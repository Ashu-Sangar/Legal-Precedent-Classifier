Nissly, defendant in this proceeding, inherited from her uncle, in 1903, the sum of seven thousand dollars, and, in 1908, admittedly acquired from the estate of her father two farms in Lancaster County, which, until the time of the insolvency of her husband, had been superintended by him without formal accounting for the net proceeds. She demanded payment of sums due as a result of his management of the separate estate, and, on December 31, 1925, received from him a check for three thousand dollars in part payment. On the same day, as found by the chancellor, though the formal assignment is dated one week earlier, she purchased from him sixty shares of the capital stock of the Florin Water Company, having a market value of $2,700, and gave her check for this amount, which was deposited to the husband’s individual account. At the time of the payment to her for moneys due, and the acquiring of the shares mentioned,, Nissly knew that financial difficulties threatened, but of this fact, the court has found, the wife was ignorant.</p>

The schedules then filed showed the partnership to be indebted in sums largely in excess of. its assets, though the husband, also declared insolvent, claimed, in his individual report, to be financially sound. The trustee appointed in both eases converted part of the property, and paid certain dividends, but the amount so far received has been insufficient to satisfy the claims of creditors in full.</p>

No allegation is made that the payment of the $3,000 by the husband to her, previously noted, was on account of preexisting indebtedness, and within four months of the filing of the petition, and therefore preferential and voidable.</p>

As last changed, a preferential transfer was made voidable by the trustee if “the person receiving it, or to be benefited thereby, shall then have reasonable cause to believe that the enforcement of such judgment or transfer would effect a preference, thus dispensing with any necessity of proving the bankrupt intended to prefer, or that the creditor believed <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>this to be so, substituting the effect of what was done for the intention of doing it”: 7 C.

      <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>As noted, the trustee does not here ask to recover the amount turned over as a preference, and whether he may be able to furnish sufficient proof to secure the return of the $3,000 transferred by the bankrupt on December 31, 1925, for a preexisting indebtedness, is not the question before us, and need not be further considered. This application is based on section 67e of the Bankrupt Act as amended. “There is a marked distinction between a preferential payment or transfer and a fraudulent conveyance, and the element of actual fraud or fraudulent intent is not necessary in order to render a payment or transfer voidable as preferential” (17 C. J. 155) under section 60, though the contrary is true under the terms of the paragraph sought to be invoked. “A payment of money in settlement of an existing indebtedness is not a transfer of property within the meaning of (section 67), nor does it evidence an intent to hinder, delay or defraud other creditors, and, hence unless the payment is voidable as a preference, the trustee cannot recover the money so paid”: 7 C. J. 172. “The mere fact that a payment, or transfer is preferential does not establish that it was fraudulent” (7 C. J. 171) for every preference may hinder creditors, but is not necessarily fraudulent: Coder v. Arts, <a href="/us/213/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="213 U.S. 223" data-case-ids="8288682" data-case-paths="/us/213/0223-01">213 U. S. 223</a>.</p>

Care was taken in the various paragraphs mentioned to protect those who acted in good faith and gave a present valuable consideration for the property transferred, and in clause e, with which we are now concerned, we find the express exception by which is excluded from its operation those who have so dealt with the bankrupt. The stock here sought to be recovered was admittedly worth not more than $2,700, and that sum was paid by check, <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>duly cashed. The transaction cannot, therefore, be set aside as a fraudulent attempt to hinder creditors, in so far as the wife was concerned, for the giving of full value renders inapplicable the section on which the bill is founded. Whether the $3,000, paid by the husband on account of preexisting indebtedness, and a part of which was used by Mrs. Nissly when she bought the stock, is preferential, and can be recovered in an appropriate action, it is not necessary now to consider, for the present bill rests on no such claim.
