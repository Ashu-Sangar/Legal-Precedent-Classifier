    <p id="b303-6" data-blocks='[["BL_303.14",303,[104,1280,1159,1077]]]'>Max Hoff and wife, residents of Philadelphia, executed in that city, on May 21, 1926, their bond in the penal sum of $60,000, secured by a mortgage for $30,000, therein referred to, on land situated in the State of New Jersey. The obligees were likewise citizens of this State, and the entire transaction was consummated here. No place of payment of principal or interest was designated, but presumably this was where the contract was made. It authorized an attorney of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County to enter judgment in case of default. Upon the failure to comply with its terms, the bond was filed of record without any previous effort to foreclose the mortgage given to secure it. A rule to open was granted, and, after answer filed, in which it was asserted that the proceeding was void under the laws of New Jersey, since there had been no attempt to collect on the mortgage itself, a trial before a jury was had, which resulted in binding instructions for defendant. Judgment n. o. v. was subsequently entered for plaintiff, from which action this appeal was taken.</p>

      <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>The question presented for our consideration is a narrow one, and rests on the right to enforce the provisions of the bond without first exhausting the remedies under the mortgage given as security therefor. If the realty involved had been located within Pennsylvania, there would, of course, be no question of the right of plaintiffs to proceed as here attempted. The land is, however, in New Jersey, and by its Act of March 31, 1881, amending that of March 12, 1880, carried in terms into the compiled statutes of 1910, it is expressly directed that, where a bond and mortgage have been given for the same debt, the proceedings to collect shall first be by foreclosure, and suit on the bond be limited to a recovery of any deficiency remaining. Similar legislation is found in some other states. This statute makes necessary proceedings on the mortgage itself where a New Jersey contract is involved, before resorting to the bond (Holmes v. Seashore El. Ry. Co., <a href="/njl/57/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="57 N.J.L. 16" data-case-ids="299065" data-case-paths="/njl/57/0016-01">57 N. J.

The act was not created as a matter of public policy, but gave to the mortgagor a personal privilege, which he might waive by express stipulation or by conduct (Callan v.

This has been the conclusion reached in numerous jurisdictions where situations such as now confront us were presented. In Maxwell v. Ricks (U. S. C. C.

The action in the case referred to was brought in another federal district, and the question in-, volved here was carefully considered. To the same effect are Mantle v. Dabney, <a href="/wash/47/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="47 Wash. 394" data-case-ids="1295710" data-case-paths="/wash/47/0394-01">47 Wash. 394</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=92%20P.%20134" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="92 P. 134">92 Pac. 134</a>; McGue v.

If the agreement to confess judgment in this case be treated as a New Jersey contract, then the terms of the statute of that state would necessarily become part thereof, and the judgment here entered should then be stricken off. But the promise to pay, secured collaterally by the mortgage on land in that state, was executed and to be performed here, and can therefore be enforced as proposed. This conclusion was correctly reached by the court below.</p>
