His actual conduct of the business had ceased in |922 because of ill health, though from time to time he exercised some personal supervision. He was survived by a widow, Mary Bryant, whom he had married in 1877. By her <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>first marriage, slie had one child, Mrs. Lamb, and, with the daughter of the latter, Mrs. Du Sossoit, the four named resided together in the family home. The two brothers of the deceased, had long since been dead. One of them left to survive him a son, Howard, who for many years had been employed by his uncle at a small salary. He became estranged from the deceased, and entered into the service of a rival firm, and was engaged by it for some five years. In 1922 he returned to his former position at a salary of thirty dollars a week, and remained in the same capacity until his employer’s death. By the will, the estate was devised and bequeathed to the widow, her daughter and grandchild, with provision for a life estate in a $75,000 fund established for the benefit of the nephew, Howard.</p>
    <p id="b175-3" data-blocks='[["BL_175.4",175,[120,1171,1158,1238]],["BL_176.1",176,[275,353,1151,413]]]'>After the death of William Bryant and prior to his funeral, the stepdaughter, Mrs. Lamb, according to the plaintiff in this case, advised him of the trust fund created for his benefit. He expressed surprise, declaring that his uncle had told him he would never make a will. She stated in reply, if his story is to be believed, that if he would not try to break the testament, but aid in sustaining it, she, jointly with her mother and daughter, would make up the difference between “the $75,000 and what [he] would have gotten had there been no will.” It is claimed that a like statement was separately made by the widow, Mrs. Bryant, as well as Mrs. Du Sossoit, the other defendants in the proceeding. At that time, the plaintiff had no reason to believe that there was any ground of contest of the will either on account of lack of capacity or because of the exercise of undue influence, knowing only that his uncle had been in bad health, and had stated to him that it was not his purpose to make any written disposition of his estate. He so declared at the hearing before the trial court in the proceeding now under review, stating that he acquired no information which would lead him to believe there was any reason for contest until 1925, after the present difficulty had <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>arisen. Following the probate of the will, the children of the other deceased brother instituted a proceeding based on the alleged lack of testamentary capacity, but in this the plaintiff refused to join, and filed, under oath, an answer in the orphans’ court averring the full competency of William Bryant to dispose of his estate. That litigation was subsequently compromised and the suit withdrawn.</p>
    <p id="b176-4" data-blocks='[["BL_176.4",176,[270,786,1154,1441]]]'>Certain payments, gifts and loans were subsequently made to plaintiff by present defendants up to the time he called, as requested, at the office of the family attorney and executed the following paper: “Received, Philadelphia, January 15th, 1925, from Mary H. Bryant, widow of William Bryant, eleven thousand five hundred dollars which with thirteen thousand five hundred dollars heretofore paid by her to me makes in all the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars received from her and in consideration of which payments I hereby waive all right of appeal from the decree of the register of wills for the County of Philadelphia, admitting to probate the will of said William Bryant and the granting of letters testamentary thereon to the executors therein named, and I hereby ratify and confirm the same and agree to be bound thereby. And further, for the consideration aforesaid, I agree not to appeal from the said decree of probate, or in any way or manner contest the validity of said will.” Howard then made no claim of the existence of any other contract, or that he was to receive any sum other than that then paid to him. This paper clearly sets forth his covenant not to contest the will, or to appeal from its probate, or in any way complain of its validity. There was no allegation that it was executed by reason of fraud, accident or mistake, and it is not only the written but the best evidence of any contract in relation to the will which was entered into.</p>

His demand for further compensation was refused, and he then brought this action in 1925 against the widow, her child and grandchild, averring a contract by which the three defendants had jointly obligated themselves to pay him the larger sum mentioned in consideration of his refusal to join in litigation over the will. No averment was made that he had any ground for believing in its invalidity, and, as noted, he knew of no reason for such complaint in 1923, and later so swore in the orphans’ court proceeding instituted by other relatives.</p>
    <p id="b177-3" data-blocks='[["BL_177.4",177,[107,1052,1157,1345]],["BL_178.1",178,[285,341,1152,422]]]'>His present demand was based on the oral conversations, above referred to, and, in connection therewith, he offered the written paper, which has been quoted in full, as evidence of the fact that there was an agreement to compensate him. He also testified that one of the joint obligors had advised him to sign the document of 1925, though the consideration named therein was for a less amount than claimed, by representing to him that an additional sum would be subsequently paid. This promise was alleged by him to have been made by Mrs. Lamb, but it is not claimed that Mrs. Bryant and Mrs. Du Sossoit, the joint defendants, so agreed, or had knowledge of such an undertaking. He also declared that, upon the refusal of further demands for money, he then made investigation and discovered that evidence might have been secured to show lack of testamentary capacity on the part of the decedent, and thus have justified an attack upon the will. Two witnesses were called at the present trial to show the circumstances under which it was executed. One, a nurse, narrated facts from which it was sought to infer that William Bryant was mentally incompetent to execute the paper probated, but it is to be noticed that she was a witness thereto, and had previously sworn before the register that the decedent was of sound and disposing memory. A second attendant <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>also testified to facts indicating that the will was prepared and executed because of requests of the defendants, but it is not claimed that they did more than urge that a will be made, without indicating the actual disposition testator should make of his property. If any influence was used, it was limited to the suggestion- of the widow that the trust fund of the plaintiff be increased to the amount ultimately given.</p>
    <p id="b178-4" data-blocks='[["BL_178.4",178,[283,774,1153,1234]]]'>The receipt of January 15, 1925, above recited, given to the joint obligor, the widow, was signed and delivered by plaintiff without any claim of a right to further compensation. In it we find an express covenant, on the one side, not to contest the will or appeal from the probate, and, on the other side, to pay, in consideration, a definite sum of |25,000, which amount was duly turned over. The effort is now made to assert an additional understanding, based on an alleged promise of one only of the joint defendants, that more would be paid, as contemplated by the parties in 1923. It is averred that parol evidence to show this further agreement, supplemental to that contained in the paper which was offered in evidence by the plaintiff himself, is admissible, since that writing came only collaterally into the case, and was not the contract directly sued upon, as the earlier oral contract was the matter in issue.

His covenant was not to contest the will, and the covenant of the joint defendants was to pay a definite sum in consideration thereof. The obligation of plaintiff was later defined in the executed written receipt, and the contractual consideration there expressly set forth. Plaintiff agreed not to contest “in consideration” of the payment made. The understanding detailed is not to be set aside in the absence of fraud, accident or mistake, nor can its terms be modified because of a collateral promise alleged to have been made by only one of the three promissors, the suit being based on a joint contract. Clearly, such a supplemental understanding would not bind two of the defendants in the absence of ratification, and, therefore, the present joint action against all three must fall: Bush v. Stowell, <a href="/pa/71/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="71 Pa. 208" data-case-ids="1031217" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0208-01">71 Pa. 208</a>; Shifter v.

Bryant, the widow, the plaintiff agreed not to contest the will or appeal from its probate. This plainly released her from any liability on account of the parol agreement of 1923, whatever it was, and where one party to a joint contract is discharged, there can be no recovery as against the other in a suit on the joint contract: 1 Williston on Contracts, 628, 633; 7 C. J. 575. In view of the receipt of January 15, 1925, no attack could be made upon the validity of the will even though the other parties benefited as a result of the promise then made to Mrs. Bryant.</p>

Dig. Dec. 3995. The contention is made that a party may settle with one joint party without discharging the liability of the others, and attention is called to the Act of March 22, 1862, P. L. 167, which, by section 5, regulates the rights of joint debtors, as the earlier sections did of partners, and wherein it is provided by section 2 that one debtor can make composition or compromise with one, and “may take from the creditor or creditors with whom he may make the same, a note or memorandum in writing, exonerating him or them from all and every individual liability incurred by reason of such connection with such partnership, which note or memorandum may be given in evidence by such debtor or debtors in bar of such creditor’s right of recovery against them.” If the intention clearly appears to discharge one of the joint debtors only as to his share of the obligation, the others will not be relieved of payment of their proportion of the debt (Burke v. Noble, <a href="/pa/48/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="48 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="422157" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0168-01">48 Pa. 168</a>), but the present case shows not a satisfaction of a claim against one individual, Mrs. Bryant, but a covenant not to contest the will itself, or appeal from its probate.</p>

When plaintiff made his original promise to refrain from contesting the will, he had no reason for instituting such a proceeding. His only information as to testamentary incapacity, already referred to, was not obtained until after his final receipt to Mrs. Bryant. It is plain from his testimony that he had not brought a suit, nor were there <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>any grounds for litigation, which he claimed to have relinquished, as a consideration for a promise to pay, and therefore it was not enforceable: Kesler’s Est., <a href="/pa/143/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="143 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="978554" data-case-paths="/pa/143/0386-01">143 Pa. 386</a>; Patterson’s App., <a href="/pa/116/0008-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="116 Pa. 8" data-case-ids="554334" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0008-01">116 Pa. 8</a>.

As was said in Edwards v. Bough, 11 M. &amp; W. 641, 152 Eng. Reprint 963: “If no doubt existed as to the validity of the will, it was her legal duty not to have interposed. It could not be tolerated that anyone should enforce a promise to pay money, the sole consideration of which was an exemption from a threatened suit for Avliich there was not the least foundation. As Avell might a party be alloAved to recover upon a contract to pay so much money in consideration that the plaintiff would not slander the defendant, as that he would not make a false clamor in court against him. To make such consideration valid, there must be some legal right abandoned or postponed, or some obligation imposed by the contract beyond what the law, without it, enjoins as a duty.”</p>
