This is a method of distributing to the several states moneys collectible by the national government from their taxables, and the provision in question is not intended to either burden or benefit the taxpayer. Whenever a state does not see fit to take advantage of the situation thus created, the national government will collect the entire 100% of its assessed federal inheritance taxes.</p>

If the amount last mentioned constitutes the only claimable allowance against the assessed federal tax, then the national government will receive (along with its unrelinquished 20%) the difference of $47,000; but if the supplementary Act of 1927, with which we are here particularly concerned, is valid legislation, then this $47,000 also will be paid to the Commonwealth and allowed as a credit to the estate of decedent by the na<a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>tional government, against the latter’s claim for taxes.

The title in question indicates that the Act of 1927 is a “supplement” to a prior act, “providing for the imposition and collection of certain taxes upon the transfer of property passing from a decedent,” and that this supplement imposed “additional taxes equal to federal credits.” The title to the act is sufficient to put any one, having an interest in the subject-matter, on inquiry, and this is all that is necessary (Graeff v. Schlottman, <a href="/pa/287/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="287 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="1099666" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0342-01">287 Pa. 342</a>, 354), for the provisions are all germane: Com. v. Bell, <a href="/pa/288/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="288 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="1100811" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0029-01">288 Pa. 29</a>, 32-3. Moreover, it is not as clear to us as it appears to have been to the court below that the provision under discussion is altogether irrelevant to the title, when we consider that the Act of 1927 is a supplement to the Act of 1919, and that the latter provides not only for the “imposition” but for the “collection” of taxes assessed thereunder; yet so far as the present case is concerned that question was not properly up for decision, since, under the will here involved, after the debts of the estate are paid, the whole balance on hand goes to the five beneficiaries named therein. They are the only parties interested and all are of the same grade. Hence, here no question of tax apportionment or liability as between ordinary and residuary legatees or as to the act raising the inheritance taxes payable by the former and reducing those payable by the latter can arisé. Such being the case, the rule squarely applies that a court will not heed objections to the constitutionality of an act unless the complainant is harmed by the particular feature alleged to be in conflict with the Constitution.</p>

Again, it may be that, so far as classification is concerned, the Act of 1927 can be sustained on the broad ground that the graded classification of the federal act is not as a matter of fact read into our own act, in the manner suggested in the above quoted excerpt from the opinion of the court below; for it must be kept in mind that Pennsylvania has in no sense formally adopted the federal graded scheme of taxation. The only way in which the federal statute figures in connection with our act is that the application of the latter depends on the collateral fact of whether a particular estate about to be assessed a Pennsylvania transfer tax is subject to and has been assessed a federal tax (for theory cases, see Com. v. Alderman, <a href="/pa/275/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="275 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="1075628" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0483-01">275 Pa. 483</a>, 487, and cases there cited). If that view of the matter is taken, the sole classification here involved is the indirect one that, in considering the ap<a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>plicability or non applicability of our Act of 1927, all estates subject to Pennsylvania law fall, in a psychological sense, into three classes: (a) Estates subject to the ordinary Pennsylvania inheritance tax, but not large enough to be subject to the federal tax, (b) estates where the ordinary Pennsylvania inheritance tax is sufficiently large in itself to cover or exceed the 80% federal allowance, and (c) estates large enough to be subject to federal inheritance tax, but where the ordinary Pennsylvania tax is less than the 80% federal allowance. The Act of 1927 applies only to the last class; and, it may well be that the court below had good reason for saying, as it did, that our Constitution of 1873, and its alleged prohibition against classification for taxation graded according to amounts involved, never contemplated a situation such as that created by the particular feature of the federal act with which we are here dealing.</p>
    <p id="b616-4" data-blocks='[["BL_616.4",616,[265,1407,1155,967]]]'>It is unnecessary to continue the discussion along this line, however, for none of the points of attack against the Act of 1927, made by appellants are involved in this case, since, as before said, appellants are in no wise injured by any provision of that statute; indeed, so far as the main feature of this act is concerned, it is difficult to perceive how it can harm anyone taking estates or having an interest in estates taxed thereunder, because, in each instance, if the additional tax created by the act was not paid to the Commonwealth, the same amount would have to be paid to the national government, and when paid to the Commonwealth, the amount in question is allowed by the national government to the estate making the payment. As this court said in Gentile v. P. &amp; R. Ry. Co., supra, it is of no moment to complainant whether the amount to be paid goes to one person or another, so long as his liability is not prejudicially altered; the same principle applies here.</p>
    <p id="b616-5" data-blocks='[["BL_616.5",616,[260,2384,1151,101]],["BL_617.1",617,[140,329,1156,2062]],["BL_618.1",618,[334,430,1150,358]]]'>It has been suggested that, if the Act of 1927 should, in any subsequent case, be declared unconstitutional, <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>those in the position of the present appellants, having accepted an allowance from the national government on the basis of the validity of this statute, might subsequently be obliged to make full payment of such allowance to the national government, and in such event appellants would be harmed; but since, as previously said, it is inconceivable that anyone paying the tax set up by the Act of 1927 could be so injured thereby that he would be in a position to attack the constitutionality of the act, it is equally inconceivable that the act can be declared unconstitutional, so far as its main feature is concerned. Then, in addition, there is no more reason for assuming that, sometime in the future, the act now before us will or may be declared unconstitutional than for making such an assumption as to any other tax statute which has been or may be enacted. If, in some subsequent case, such an event should come to pass, the act would, nevertheless, be valid beyond attack so far as the present case is concerned: see Phila. v. Ridge Ave. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/142/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="142 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="976681" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0484-01">142 Pa. 484</a>, and the explanation of that case in an article on Res Judicata, volume XXXVIII, No. 3, Yale Law Journal, (January, 1929), pages 299, 301-2. In this connection, it may be noted that counsel on both sides stated at bar that, when the proper federal authorities were notified of the present controversy, they took the position that the national government had no interest. It must be assumed that this will continue to be the attitude of the national government, for there is no question here as to the constitutionality of federal law; all questions raised by either side concern the validity of the law of Pennsylvania, and, under the well established principles discussed in the last mentioned authority, whatever we decide to be our law controls this case for all time to come, without regard to what possibly may in the future be ruled in other tax cases. A change in the judicial view of the law by a subsequent decision could not amount to more than a change in the law by legislation, which, of course, would not retroactively <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>affect those whose rights had been previously adjudged. Such being the governing rule of law, it must be assumed that the national government, as well as all others, will abide by it; but as previously said there is no good reason for anticipating that a future attack on the general constitutionality of the present act will succeed.</p>
    <p id="b618-5" data-blocks='[["BL_618.4",618,[333,810,1151,854]]]'>In conclusion, we repeat that the court below, instead of attempting to solve constitutional points which were not properly before it, should have refused to consider those points, on the ground that appellants, not being harmed by anything contained in the Act of 1927, were not in a position to attack its constitutionality. Though counsel in this case filed a stipulation that we might “pass upon the constitutionality of the said act in its entirety without limit to the particular features thereof which may pecuniarily affect the appellants,” we have no power so to do. On the present record, the ruling of the court below that a certain part of the Act of 1927 was invalid, cannot be approved; as before said, that point will be passed on when raised by someone who has been harmed by application to him of the provision in question.</p>
