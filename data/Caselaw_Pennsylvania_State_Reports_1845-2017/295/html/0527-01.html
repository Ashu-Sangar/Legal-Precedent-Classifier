    <p id="b554-4" data-blocks='[["BL_554.5",554,[258,395,1157,1984]]]'>Plaintiff recovered a verdict in a suit on a mortgage; defendant asked fo.r a new trial, assigning five reasons; the court below granted the motion, stating in its opinion, “For present purposes, we need consider only the fifth reason,” which complained of binding instructions for plaintiff. Thus it may be seen that, while only one reason for granting a new trial is discussed by the court below, yet other reasons existed which might have dictated that course. When the case came on for argument, counsel for appellant was told, if the trial court would certify that the reason discussed in its opinion was the only one which moved it to make the order complained of on this appeal, we would hear argument; otherwise the case would fall within our usual rule that, on an appeal from the grant of a new trial, unless the record contains a definite judicial statement that the order in question “rests on a reason given,” which, to the exclusion of all else, controlled the decision, “we will not interfere with the court’s exercise of discretion”: Pawlowski v.
