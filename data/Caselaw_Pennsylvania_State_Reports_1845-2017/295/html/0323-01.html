    <p id="b352-6" data-blocks='[["BL_352.11",352,[276,1380,1151,910]]]'>The plaintiff instituted an action to recover $40,000 from the members of the city council and the mayor of Philadelphia, as individuals, on a cause of action as follows : In 1923, council appropriated $15,000 to the Philadelphia Civic Opera Company, a private corporation for musical entertainment. The mayor approved the ordinance, and the proper officers paid the money. An appropriation of $25,000 for like purpose was made for the year 1924, and paid in like manner. It is charged that the appropriation of this sum of $40,000 was an unlawful “abstraction” of monies from the public treasury. Plaintiff, in his statement, says he “does not proceed against the city controller or the city treasurer; .they are ministerial officers, having neither jurisdiction nor control over public funds.” This suit is brought by plaintiff as a taxpayer on behalf of himself and other taxpayers of the city.</p>

Our question is divorced from any of the problems which affect the conduct or acts of those subordinate to, or controlled by, the ordinances and laws of a municipality. We might point out, however, in passing, that this court has held that a municipal officer, in obeying an unconstitutional act, incurs no personal liability where property rights are damaged or destroyed: Dunn v.

It would be a strange proposition for any court to advance as a theory of government that the members of Congress and of the legislature are personally responsible for the result or effect of an unconstitutional law passed by them before those laws have been held invalid by the courts. It has been suggested, not without reason, that the State or the city, in its corporate capacity, should bear the loss that comes from the execution of acts before they have been declared unconstitutional. Pennsylvania has so decided as to property rights. See Dunn v. Mellon, <a href="/pa/147/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="147 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="829802" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0011-01">supra, p. 17</a>.</p>

There should be absolute freedom to act in legislative matters so that vigorous action may be taken when necessary, for the public welfare, without fear of being called on for vindication or explanation, leaving to the courts the function of determining whether such acts transgress the fundamental law. Nor, in the interest of freedom of action, may we hold, as is frequently done with subordinates, that these officers are presumed to know the Constitution, and, if they violate it by passing an act which is contrary to the Constitution, they do so at their peril. The peril that would follow such a course would affect society generally. If this were the rule, it would have taken rare courage on the part of the members and chief executive who enacted the first prohibition, anti-<a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>saloon or anti-liquor law. Noi* will it do to stand behind the “void ab initio” theory, or to say that what the legislature attempted accomplished nothing. Such argument begs the question. Subordinate officers, and those affected or aggrieved, have means to prevent the enforcement or carrying out of acts unlawful because of the Constitution or other reasons. As the highest court must determine constitutionality, no preliminary advice from it, for legislative bodies, is, or could be expected. To have the courts pass on the constitutionalty of proposed acts would speedily open the charge that the State is governed by judges rather than by duly elected legislators ordained by the Constitution as the governing power. Such interference with the freedom of the legislature does not fit into our scheme of constitutional government. Freedom of action in the inauguration of laws for public welfare is one of the attributes of a republic. Freedom in constitutional republics may only be restrained by the courts where the acts violate the fundamental law, and then only if the matter can be decided on no other ground, and, when constitutionality is the last resort, then only after a most searching study, — a practical impossibility in the course of a legislative session.</p>

The freedom of the members of the legislature from liability for their legislative acts is and should be similar to the freedom of judges from liability for their judicial acts. We have gone so far as to hold that judges are not liable even though they act corruptly and maliciously: Biddle, Liability of Officers Acting in a Judicial Capacity, 15 Am. L. Rev. 427, 492; note, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20L.R.A.%20138" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="14 L.R.A. 138">14 L. R.

They are exempted because, if they have hanging over them the fear of personal punishment in the shape of damages, they will not be able to enforce the laws impartially and fearlessly. Members of the legislature, for a like reason, would not be able to protect society as it should be protected, and enact laws for its welfare, if they were to be in constant fear of annoyance from suits whenever someone of our ten millions of population felt aggrieved at an unconstitutional or otherwise void Act of Assembly.</p>

A study of the cases stating the contrary rule, however, shows they do not seem to take into consideration the legislative function of the body in ques<a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>tion. Other cases, which apparently take the same ground, on examination prove to be easily distinguishable on their facts; either because an action has been brought, not against the council, but against a particular officer entrusted with the public funds (Blair v. Lantry, <a href="/neb/21/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="21 Neb. 247" data-case-ids="4407487" data-case-paths="/neb/21/0247-01">21 Neb. 247</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20N.W.%20790" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="31 N.W. 790">31 N. W. 790</a>) or because an express statutory right of action is granted to the town or taxpayers in case of such illegal appropriation (State v.

Stone, <a href="/cal/170/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="170 Cal. 480" data-case-ids="2036998" data-case-paths="/cal/170/0480-01">170 Cal. 480</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=150%20P.%20367" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="150 P. 367">150 Pac. 367</a>) or because the council in question has been expressly held to be not a purely legislative body: Burns v. Essling, <a href="/minn/163/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="163 Minn. 57" data-case-ids="150101" data-case-paths="/minn/163/0057-01">163 Minn. 57</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=203%20N.W.%20605" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="203 N.W. 605">203 N.

It was the implied limitation on this delegated power that stepped in to prevent this particular purpose. The general power to pass laws in aid of a municipality was there. If the members of city council make an error in judgment as to the extent of these powers in a given field, they are not any more to be held liable than would the members of the paramount body, — the members of the legislature, — to be held liable for a similar mistake in judgment, as for instance, the appropriation of money to sectarian institutions.</p>
