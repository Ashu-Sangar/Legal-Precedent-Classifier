    <p id="b371-4" data-blocks='[["BL_371.7",371,[131,715,1152,317]]]'>On January 15, 1927, the plaintiff, DeWitt Moseley, an employee of the Reading Company, defendant, was injured by the explosion of a can of oil. This suit, brought on account of damages thereby sustained, resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiff, and defendant has appealed.</p>

Snow had fallen on the day of the accident and it was the duty of plaintiff and another employee, named Burke, to clean the frogs of the switches at Logan Station, north of Philadelphia. This was done by pouring on oil, which, being set on fire, melted the snow and ice so that they could be shoveled or swept away. Oil for this purpose was placed in a three-gallon tin can and normally poured out through its spout, but the spout of the only can defendant furnished on this occasion was stopped up so the oil could not pass through it. The defendant’s foreman, admittedly a vice-principal, directed the plaintiff to use the defective can and pour the oil out through the bunghole, assuring him this could be done safely. On plaintiff still expressing fear and declining to do so, the foreman directed Burke to use the can and plaintiff to follow after and clean up with shovel and broom, which he did. When the spout was properly in use it had a lighted wick attached by which the poured-out oil was ignited; but on this occasion Burke used matches for this purpose. When they had been engaged at the work about two hours, cleaning up frogs at various switch points, the oil can suddenly exploded and was thrown violently back, striking plaintiff, who was working at another frog some fifteen feet distant, by which he <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>was knocked down and injured. Defendant offered no evidence and the question of its negligence was admittedly for the jury. It was also admitted that the case came under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act of Congress.</p>
    <p id="b372-4" data-blocks='[["BL_372.4",372,[256,595,1152,1348]]]'>Appellant contends, however, that, by knowingly working with and in close proximity to a fellow employee who was using a defective can, plaintiff assumed the risk. One answer to this contention is that plaintiff neither used the defective can himself nor worked at the point where it was used. Whether by working fifteen feet away he assumed a risk so obvious and immediate that it would have been shunned by a reasonably prudent man, was for the jury. Furthermore, it does not appear that the danger of explosion was obvious or imminent; in the absence of this the employees might rely on the superior judgment of the foreman: McGrath v. Atlantic Refining Co., <a href="/pa/264/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="264 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="1048579" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0341-01">264 Pa. 341</a>; Williams v.

That depended on the obvious and imminent character of the danger to which we have referred and was for the jury, especially as he was working fifteen feet from where the can was being used. There was no certainty that the can would explode or that one so far away would be hurt if it did. <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>This warranted the comment of the trial judge that, "I am rather of the opinion that he [plaintiff] did not assume the risk of general employment in connection with that can, because he did not use it, and he refused to use it; but he did, knowing that condition, work within 15 feet of it,” as he also said, "If he [plaintiff] was negligent, in that, knowing the danger, he assumed the risk, and his negligence was the predominate cause of the accident, then it would be a bar to his right of recovery.” This left the question to the jury.</p>

The evidence tended to show that the eye was normal before the accident, and it was stressed as the major injury resulting therefrom. The evidence was that plaintiff was burned and injured in the face and in and about the eye, while two special<a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>ists, one who had treated the injured optic and the other who had repeatedly examined it, expressed the professional opinion that the cataract resulted from the accident, and there was no opposing proof. The expert opinion was that the blow on the eye caused inflammation which blinded it. A cataract covers the sight with an opaque substance and may result from an injury or otherwise, as from infection. In the instant case there Avas ample proof of the injury, but none of any other producing cause. The circumstances corroborate the expert opinion; here, a normal eye receives a blow and a burn and in tAVO weeks, Avitkout other cause, the sight is gone. The lay mind naturally connects the injury with the result, which fortifies plaintiff’s contention. See Davis v.

Hence, there Avas no error in permitting Dr. Appleman to answer the hypothetical question so founded. Neither was there error in overruling defendant’s objection to the hypothetical question asked Dr. West, which objection Avas based on the ground that “all the facts are not shown.” The question seemed to fairly embrace the facts as the testimony on behalf of plaintiff tended to show them, and the objection failed to point out any fact improperly included or excluded therefrom. On cross-examination defendant’s counsel could have framed questions based on his view of the facts: Albert v. P. R. T.

The causal connection betAveen the injury and the cataract was for the jury and the expert evidence relating thereto could not have been stricken out.
