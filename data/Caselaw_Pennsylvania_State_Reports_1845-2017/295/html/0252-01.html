    <p id="b279-4" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[141,462,1152,1191]]]'>The writ of habeas corpus can never be used as a substitute for an appeal to test the corectness of the administration of the law in connection with a commitment (Com. ex rel. v. Egan, <a href="/pa/281/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="281 Pa. 251" data-case-ids="1087041" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0251-01">281 Pa. 251</a>; Halderman’s Petition, <a href="/pa/276/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="276 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1077704" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0001-01">276 Pa. 1</a>), but where such an order is beyond the power or jurisdiction of the tribunal entering it, the one thereby detained may be released on habeas corpus: Com. ex rel. v. Heston, <a href="/pa/292/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="292 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="1109682" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0063-01">292 Pa. 63</a>; Com. ex rel. v.

In addition to the Supreme Court, however, there are several courts of higher jurisdiction than the one that made the order in this case, all of which are empowered to issue writs of habeas corpus; for example, the judges of the Superior Court, of the Courts of Common Pleas, and of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia County, may issue such writs. In Com. v. Curry, <a href="/pa/285/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="285 Pa. 289" data-case-ids="1095078" data-case-paths="/pa/285/0289-01">285 Pa. 289</a>, 291, this court recently said: “While we have original jurisdiction in such matters, ordinarily applications for habeas corpus should go to other courts, having like jurisdiction, thus affording the Supreme Court time to perform its primary duty of reviewing the decisions of subordinate tribunals.” We shall therefore enter the following order:</p>
