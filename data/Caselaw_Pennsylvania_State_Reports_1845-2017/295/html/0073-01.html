L. 642, 662, 664, the referee asked advice from and took the testimony of an expert called by the referee himself (see Seitzinger v. Fort Pitt Brewing Co., <a href="/pa/294/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="294 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="1113446" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0253-01">294 Pa. 253</a>, on the right to do this). The testimony of this expert would be a weak staff for either side to rely on, but the decision of the referee does not appear to have been based on it, and there was ample other evidence to sustain the award in claimant’s favor. That award, having been sustained by both the board and the court below, will not be disturbed by us.</p>
