The form of action was assumpsit and the court entered judgment against defendant for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. It appeals, submitting for our consideration these questions: Can judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense be sustained where the affidavit of defense denies that the injuries were by defects upon defendant’s property and that the notice given by the city to appellant to come in and defend was timely; or where the city permitted the issuance of a mandamus on the day judgment was entered against it upon the verdict, and during the time within which an appeal might have been taken by the property owner? Could the court determine the questions before it by reference to the record in the suit against the city? and, Is assumpsit the proper form of action?</p>
    <p id="b213-3" data-blocks='[["BL_213.4",213,[126,1388,1152,1023]],["BL_214.1",214,[290,343,1150,422]]]'>The pleadings in the original suit fixed the place of the accident on a sidewalk along property admittedly owned by appellant. Our reading of the testimony in that case, when coupled with the photographs offered in evidence, leaves no doubt in our minds that the accident happened in front of appellant’s property. This conclusion disposes of appellant’s first proposition and of the one ancillary thereto which it argues, that the city supplied defects in the proof by an admission of a defect in the pavement. This is based upon the remark made by counsel trying the case for the city to the effect that there was no doubt about there being a break in the cement pavement. This was manifest from the photographs and the remark simply affirmed a self-evident fact in the ease and further did not amount to an admission of negligence. If appellant wished to control the manner of trial, it should have gone in and defended, not stood aloof. As to appellant’s contention that the burden is upon the city to establish in this action all of <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>the facts essential to the proof of liability which it is said were not required in accordance with the strict rules of evidence in view of the city’s admission, for which it relies upon Orth v. Consumers Gas Co., <a href="/pa/280/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="280 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1084446" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0118-01">280 Pa. 118</a>, it is sufficient to say that in that case no notice to come in and defend was given. Furthermore, the so-called admission was entirely proper and in the strategy of the city’s case very likely wisely made.</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.4",214,[283,777,1155,1452]]]'>Appellant argues that the notice given to it, five months after suit was commenced against the city, was not timely and did not afford it full and proper opportunity to ascertain the facts in relation to the accident and properly to prepare its defense. While it is true notice was not given until five months after the commencement of the suit, yet this was eight months prior to trial. Seven notices were given, the first on September 22, 1926. The statement of claim was not filed until October 13, 1926. Until then the city would not have full details of the case it had to meet. While it is proper that the municipality should give reasonably prompt notice to the property owner whom it seeks to hold liable for his primary neglect of duty, it could not be said that notice eight months in advance of trial and before statement filed was not in ample time. Appellant could be held liable to the city even without any notice given. The effect of not giving notice is to make the proof necessary to recover different from that required when notice has been given: Orth v. Consumers Gas Co., <a href="/pa/280/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="280 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1084446" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0118-01">280 Pa. 118</a>.
