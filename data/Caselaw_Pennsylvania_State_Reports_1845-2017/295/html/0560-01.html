By the terms of the agreement, the land was to be conveyed in fee simple, clear of encumbrances except a mortgage; taxes and interest payments due were to be prorated as of the date of closing the deal. Time was of the essence of the contract, and February 20, 1926,. was fixed as the day for settlement. “Paul D. Barns, an attorney of Miami, was to ex<a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>amine and pass upon the abstract of title,” to be furnished by defendant not later than January 1,1926. The sum of $50,000 of the purchase price of $258,000, to be paid as hand money, was, in accordance with an escrow agreement, deposited with the Pennsylvania Trust Company of Pittsburgh, to await fulfillment of the contract. In case of default on vendee’s part, this sum was to be treated as liquidated damages and forfeited to vendor.</p>
    <p id="b590-4" data-blocks='[["BL_590.4",590,[356,865,1150,585]]]'>Barns, by letter, reported to the trust company, as the escrow agreement required, and to defendant, as the contract specified, stating that there were liens and encumbrances affecting the marketability of the land as follows : outstanding taxes, interest, mechanics’ liens, optional agreements for the sale of the land, and a reservation in a deed in the chain of title giving to the trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund of Florida the right to enter on the lands for the purposes of making canals, cuts, sluices, dykes and other works needful for the drainage and reclamation of the said land.</p>

I. Simon, attorney......, no later than January 15, 1926, to afford an opportunity to......Simon to cure defects; if......Barns still is unable to accept such title, the matter in difference shall be referred to the arbitration of three competent lawyer arbitrators, one to be chosen by each of the parties hereto and they to choose a third.” It is contended that the court below found that Barns, in disproving the title, acted solely for plaintiff. The contract plainly provides otherwise. He was the person selected by the parties to act in designated matters, and it is quite common for a vendee’s counsel to be made the sole referee to pass on the title. His duties involved more than a mere examination of the abstract of title for technical defects as attorney for vendee. They were concerned with matters not necessarily associated with an opinion on the validity of the title. He was to determine whether these were liens and encumbrances affecting the marketability of the land, as distinct from the title. This involved the finding of a fact, the effect of matters appearing on the record as related to circumstances surrounding the land as such, resulting in an impairment of marketability, as will be shown when the reservation is discussed. He was to approve a bond if minor liens could be cured by a bond; this was not part of the ordinary duties of a lawyer passing title to land. If he still refused, within the limits of the authority conferred on Mm, to accept the conveyance, defendant having had an opportunity to cure the defects, arbitrators were to be then appointed. Barns’s duties, performed in good faith, were closely allied to those of a referee: Wilson <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>v.

But where the bill for cancellation involves money held in escrow by a third person, as here, then the rule applicable to the vendor is similar to that in an action for specific performance or for damages for breach of contract. The money was not in the vendor’s hands, and defendant company had no right to it until there was strict compliance with the agreement. It was merely a deposit toward the purchase price, to be forfeited in case of default. To profit by the forfeit, and enforce the contract, vendor must show not only that vendee had repudiated the contract but that it was able itself to give a good title, clear of encumbrances: Hampton v. Speckenagle, 9 S. &amp; R. 211, 222. Vendee proved the contract and the steps leading up to and including the report of the referee. The burden then shifted to defendant to show performance, and any attack on the referee’s decision was limited to proof that he had acted capriciously by disapproving a title which in fact was free from liens or encumbrances which affected the marketability of the land. Where no such liens exist, the referee, by capriciously reporting that they did, could not defeat the sale. But if the vendor <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>cannot establish a <em>good </em>title, the vendee is not bound to accept, nor is the vendor entitled to any part of the purchase money: Nicol v.

This position comes rather late, as it was not taken in the court below; in any case, we call attention to the rule in force in this State as to agreements to arbitrate disputes then presently existing, where arbitrators are not named, which states that where the agreement partakes of the nature of a contract, in which important rights are gained or lost, and the submission is one of the moving considerations, it can be revoked only by mutual consent: Pennsylvania cases cited in 5 C. J. 56. The authorities have not applied the rule to prospective controversies wherein arbitrators have not been named, but it is peculiarly applicable here. Where arbitration has to do with the very subject-matter of the contract on which the existence of the parties’ obliga<a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>tions depend, and has been in part executed, it is beyond the power of one of the parties to revoke; such action would, in this case, change the effect of the whole agreement, which was to give the vendor a right to review the referee’s findings.</p>

Notwithstanding the intimation that the parties <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>might waive them, there was nothing to warrant an assumption they ever were waived; nor was there anything to mislead. Prudence would have spurred immediate action. Instead, defendant asserted the title was clear and it was going to close the deal. Vendor proceeded on the theory that vigilance was all on the vendee’s side. When the parties met in Florida, some desultory talk was indulged in with regard to arbitration, but no forward step was taken by either side toward naming an arbitrator. Defendant, at the final settlement, did not come relying on performance under1 the contract. Though some objections were met by quitclaim deeds, there were outstanding liens unadjusted, and taxes unpaid. Then there was the reservation in the trustees of the state. Plaintiff had not excused performance of these requirements. No bond was offered or tendered. There was an offer to give a title insurance bond, but that was not a term of the contract. Plaintiff Avas not required to produce a statement of taxes and liens. Defendant was to deliver a deed in fee, clear of encumbrances. Such title Avas not tendered. Vendor was not misled; it sensed plaintiff might want to get out of his contract before counsel left for Florida.</p>
    <p id="b595-3" data-blocks='[["BL_595.4",595,[139,1590,1155,807]],["BL_596.1",596,[236,334,1154,1337]]]'>The land Avas to be in “fee simple,” and if there were “liens or encumbrances affecting the marketability of the lands,” the title was to be disapproved. In other words, Barns was to find in the abstract any defects that had a tendency to affect the sale of the land. The question was not merely AArhether they affected the title, though an encumbrance on the title Avould undoubtedly result in a failure to secure the land’s market value; the former must be ascertained by considering the extent of the lien (here the reservation) on the possibilities of selling the land advantageously. Would the lien have a tendency to impair the sales value of the land? The land company does not deny the reservation, but plants its right to recover on Richardson-Kellett Co. v. Kline, <a href="/fla/70/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="70 Fla. 23" data-case-ids="1050698" data-case-paths="/fla/70/0023-01">70 Fla. 23</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20So.%20203" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="69 So. 203">69 So. 203</a>, where it Avas held that rights <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>reserved as above were of a public nature and should not be considered as affecting a fee title. While this contention, viewed from the Florida decision, may be sound, the contract before us did not make that court or this court the judge, not of the marketability of the title as a fee, but of the marketability of the land as affected by those liens. That judge was Barns. The chief justice of Florida, speaking of this reservation, said: “Ordinarily the reservation of such a right over the land conveyed as the one reserved here to the board of trustees ......would be an encumbrance upon the title, but under the circumstances surrounding the land in question ......we do not think that it is such an encumbrance of which the appellee has any right to complain”; and such conclusion was no doubt correct in that case, but, as stated above, Judge Barns was to decide, after “an examination,” whether liens or encumbrances which he would not pass or approve affected the marketability of the land. Marketability of land has a wider significance than marketability of title. His report on the abstract, regardless of arbitration, made in good faith, as the record unquestionably shows, presented to defendant an insuperable barrier either against securing the hand money or keeping it if paid, and warranted an annulment of the contract.</p>
