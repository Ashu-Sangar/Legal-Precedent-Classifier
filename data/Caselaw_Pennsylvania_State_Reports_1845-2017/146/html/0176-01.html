Her legacy is a general pecuniary legacy. His real estate, which consisted of three pieces, was unconditionally and specifically devised to the respondents in this proceeding. Neither do we think, taking the whole will together, that there is the slightest intimation, on its face, that the testator intended this legacy to be paid out of the real estate. But it is contended that facts outside the will show that the testator intended to exempt the personal estate and that by implication the real estate is charged. We have been cited to a number of obiter dicta in support of this position.</p>

      <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>It is true that a court can in the case of many wills more satisfactorily construe them, if it is “ fully advised of the circumstances under which the will was made, as to the state of the testator’s property, family and the like; ” but, being advised of these facts does not empower the court to change the testator’s will, or to make a new will for him, in order to relieve a legatee from the hardship of losing her legacy in case of an insufficiency of the personal estate. These circumstances can only be resorted to in aid of a proper interpretation, where on the face of the will it might be doubtful. After all, the intention must be discoverable in the will. In the case of Okeson’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=59%20Pa.%20100" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="59 Pa. 100">59 Pa. 100</a>, Justice Shabswood says : “ It is certainly true that no particular language is necessary to create such a charge. The intention of the testator is to be carried out wherever it is discoverable from anything contained in the instrument. But there must be something from which it can be inferred.” In a case where the testator owned no personal estate, at the time he made his will, the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia, in holding that his real estate was not charged with the payment of general pecuniary legacies, said: “ While the intention to charge lands with the payment of legacies need not be declared in express terms, it. must be disclosed by the will itself, and cannot be inferred from the mere fact that at the time of its execution the testator owned no personal estate.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b204-6" data-blocks='[["BL_204.6",204,[293,1637,1161,551]]]'>In the case at bar, it is claimed that the inventory filed in the estate of the testator shows that his entire personal estate, all of which was bequeathed to his daughter Mary, amounted to only $789.85, while the money legacies bequeathed in his will amount to $3,203. The petitioner alleges that all the personal property which the testator had when he made his will, was what was afterwards included in the inventory, and that therefore it follows that the testator when he made his will intended to exempt bis personal estate from the payment of these general legacies. There is nothing on the face of the will to support this position.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b204-7" data-blocks='[["BL_204.7",204,[292,2197,1161,245]],["BL_205.1",205,[153,383,1164,601]]]'>The language: “ all the personal property that may be on the premises (where I reside) at the time of my decease, stock, household goods and every article of <em>property </em>that may be on the premises to me belonging,” does not indicate that the testator intended in this bequest to include all his personal estate. <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>On the contrary, it clearly indicates that when he made his will he had personal property elsewhere and of a different kind. He had another farm that, according to the answer, was let at a rental of two hundred dollars per year, and he may have had moneys owing him from those whom he then considered solvent debtors, and who afterwards became insolvent and whose indebtedness was not included in the inventory filed. The simple allegation of the petitioner, who was only eight or nine years of age when her grandfather made his will, unsupported by proof, is not sufficient to establish the fact that he had, outside of his real estate specifically devised, only an estate of $789.85, when his will was executed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[154,996,1164,708]]]'>Again; if we look at the terms of the will wherein the real estate is devised, we find that the three specific devises are in substantially the same language ; and if- any part of the testator’s real estate is charged with the payment of the general legacies, it is all charged. But, in the case of Nancy Robinson he coupled with the devise this language: “ Also, I bequeath to her and her heirs the sum of two hundred dollars in money to build a house on the same.” Why did he give her two hundred dollars in money to improve her real estate, if he intended it should be charged with its share of the general legacies before bequeathed ? Why did he give Mary Duvall, his daughter, the specific legacy of all the personal property on the real estate specifically devised to her, if he intended it to be charged with the general legacies ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b205-6" data-blocks='[["BL_205.6",205,[156,1712,1163,447]]]'>The fact that the testator, after giving certain sums of money to certain of his children, specifically and unconditionally devised his real estate to others of his children, and specifically bequeathed certain personal property to one of the devisees and gave another two hundred dollars to improve her real estate, leads to the inevitable conclusion that the testator when he made his will knew or thought that he had other personal property, moneys, or credits to meet the demands of his will outside the specific devises and legacies.</p>

But, independent of this, there is nothing in this will to indicate that the testator intended that the executor, Alexander Duvall, was to pay these general legacies if he accepted the real estate devised to him. His devise is not in the shape of a residue, nor is it blended with personal estate.

    <p id="b207-12" data-blocks='[["BL_207.13",207,[169,1911,1166,95]]]'>1. That the legacy is a charge on testator’s real estate devised to the appellees.</p>

      <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>In an opinion, reciting all the facts and fully considering the questions presented, the Orphans’ Court held that appellant’s legacy is not and never was a lien on the land; that Alexander Duvall neither expressly nor impliedly assumed payment of the lagacy; nor is he liable therefor by virtue of his office as executor, because no assets applicable to the payment thereof ever came into his hands; and hence this proceeding cannot be sustained. An examination of the record has satisfied us that the court was right in these conclusions.</p>
    <p id="b208-6" data-blocks='[["BL_208.6",208,[275,855,1169,1049]]]'>As a general rule, “ the personal estate is not only the primary, but prima facie the exclusive fund for the payment of legacies, and this conclusion cannot be repelled by showing that the testator had no personal estate when the will was executed, and must therefore have intended that the legacies should come out o£ the real estate.' • Where one dies without leaving sufficient personal estate for the payment of his bequests, they are adeemed wholly or pro tanto, unless there is something more than the mere gift of the bequest to denote an intention that it should be paid out of the land: ” Aldrich v. Cooper, 2 W. &amp; T. Lead. Cas. in Eq. 346. “ While the intention to charge lands with the payment of legacies need not be declared in express terms, it must be disclosed by the will itself, and cannot be inferred from the mere fact that, at the time of its execution, the testator owned no personal estate; non constat that he may not do so at a subsequent date: ” Haddock’s Est., 18 W. N. 243. The intention of the testator to create a charge on real .estate is to be carried out whenever it is discoverable from anything contained in his will, but there must be something on the face of the instrument from which it can be inferred: Okeson’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=59%20Pa.%20100" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="59 Pa. 100">59 Pa. 100</a>.</p>

On the contrary, the indications are all the other way. The bequest to appellant is a general pecuniary legacy, “ to be paid when she is twenty-one years of age.” Testator’s real estate, consisting of three pieces, is unconditionally and specifically devised to his son Alexander and two of his daughters, respectively. This case is clearly distinguishable from Clery’s App., <a href="/pa/35/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="35 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="990479" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0054-01">35 Pa. 54</a>. In that case the intention to charge the realty was shown, not only in the <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>strongly implied exoneration of the personalty, but in the fact that tbe legacies became payable only on the termination of the life-estate of the testator’s widow, to whom the personal property was bequeathed absolutely; and in the further fact that the testator specifically directed the “ overseers ” of his will to “see that all the above legacies are paid.”</p>
    <p id="b209-5" data-blocks='[["BL_209.5",209,[168,698,1165,503]]]'>The proposition that a devisee of land who acts as executor of the will, must either refuse to aecept’the unconditional devise, or render himself liable to pay pecuniary legacies, is wholly untenable. It does not appear that Alexander Duvall, either as executor of his father's will or in his individual capacity, did or omitted to do anything that should render him liable to payment of the legacy in question. The questions presented in this case are so fully considered and satisfactorily disposed of in the opinion of the Orphans’ Court that further comment is unnecessary.</p>
    <p id="b209-6" data-blocks='[["BL_209.6",209,[429,1209,900,94]]]'>Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant.</p>
