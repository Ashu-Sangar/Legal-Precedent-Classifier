      <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>The plaintiff’s claim in this action is based on instruments A, B and C, executed by and between Samuel B. Griffith and William H. Griffith, of the first part, and the Egbert Coal Co., Limited, and the same company under its new name of L. M. Ormsby &amp; Co., Limited, of the second part. The evidence shows that the second party owes a large amount under the stipulations of those instruments. The plaintiff does not seek a judgment against the second party as a limited partnership, but has brought this suit against the members of said association, to fasten liability for his claim upon them individually. The main questions for consideration are, first, whether the privileges and immunities of a limited partnership, as authorized by the act of June 2,1874, P. L. 271, and its supplements, were secured generally to the members of the Egbert Coal Co., Limited, now L. M. Ormsby &amp; Co., Limited, under and by virtue of their recorded statement; and if not, then, second, whether the articles of association of said company are sufficient to protect the members from individual liability for the claim in suit.</p>

They are a gift from the state on its own terms. An agreement between such an association and those dealing with it, that the liability of the former shall be limited to its capital stock, does not enter into the basis of protection from individual liability. The members get such protection by complying with the conditions prescribed. The state so protects them by virtue of her sovereign power. That is why a strict, or at least a substantial compliance with the conditions is necessary to obtain the benefits of the act: Lauder v.

Hence, when Samuel B. Griffith and William H. Griffith, two of the parties to said articles, made with defendants’ company the instrument on which plaintiff’s claim is based, they did so subject to their existing agreement that the liability of their grantees under those instruments, should be limited to the capital stock of the company. That being true, they could not hold the members individually liable for the rents or royalties accruing under those instruments, even though the latter made a fatal misstep in their attempt to form a limited partnership.
