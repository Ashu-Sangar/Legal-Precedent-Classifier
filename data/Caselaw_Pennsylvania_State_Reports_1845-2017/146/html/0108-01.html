It means, evidently, whether a witness offered is competent, or whether evidence offered is competent or relevant as tending to prove any fact material to the issue. A point of law is a question of law applicable to the facts as they may be found by the court, which the party may propose in the shape of a written point, and require an answer: ” Mr. Justice Shabswood, in Lower Augusta v.
