Out of the eight hundred dollars I was to get three hundred dollars, Mrs. Swan five hundred dollars, and, as Mr.Swan explained to me, the bank would-take this one thousand three hundred and fifty dollar mortgage as collateral security for the release of the sixteen acres. Q. That is, the release of their mortgage on the sixteen acres? A. Yes, sir. Then Mrs. Swan went to say how this wasn’t enough. I told Mrs. Swan, told her her husband had all at once changed his notion, said he wasn’t going to make the sale; that I wanted my three hundred dollars. Mrs. Swan seemed kind of miffed about it, and says, ‘Why I am perfectly willing to sell; I will see the tenant mj'-self; I will arrange that myself.’ I says, all right, Mrs Swan; all I want to see is I want this agreement carried out, and that I claim my three hundred dollars, and if I don’t get it I shall let the court decide ifi and X left. I saw Wesners. Told Wesners what had occurred; told them to go and see Mrs. Swan and see what they got to say. I saw Wesners afterwards again. They told me they had seen Mrs. Swan. And I kept on seeing them or they saw me, till finally things were settled up, and they had bought the land on the terms as I had made them, with the difference that they themselves raised the mortgage of one thousand two hundred dollars through Black &amp; Baird, and Swans only took a second mortgage of one hundred and fifty dollars for one year. Swans sold it on the same terms that I did. Then I asked my attorney to write to Mrs. Swan and ask for my money, and answer came back that Mrs. Swan refused to pay it.”</p>

The plaintiff testified fully as to the contract, and its ratification by Mrs. Swan, and gave corroborating testimony by the purchaser and others.
