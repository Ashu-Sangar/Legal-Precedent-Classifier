F. Hurst, an agent of the company having charge of its real estate at Rochester, Pennsylvania, stating that a notice of a sheriff’s sale was posted on said premises; and that the defendant had a full legal defence to the whole of the plaintiff’s claim, to wit: That L.

Again, by his letter of July 15, 1886, the plaintiff claimed wages down to 1884, only, and it is shown that N. F. Hurst had charge of the property after that. Plaintiff’s conduct and all the evidence shows that his employment was but temporary; and his delay in moving to have the judgment opened was not unreasonable, in all the circumstances of the case, and in any event the court below took it into consideration. And the defendant made no attempt to contradict the sheriff’s return. It simply showed that the service was not a personal one.</p>

Bank’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=124%20Pa.%20887" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="124 Pa. 887">124 Pa. 887</a>, where it was said, in speaking of the act of 1877: “ Prior to the act of 1877, as before observed, the opening of a judgment rested in the discretion of the court below, and no appeal was allowed to this court. It by no means follows, however, that the discretion formerly vested in the Common Pleas in regard to opening judgments, has been taken away by the act of 1877. Upon appeal to this court we only decide whether the discretion has been properly exercised.” To the same point are Earley’s App., <a href="/pa/90/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="90 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1065647" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0321-01">90 Pa. 321</a>; Wernet’s App., <a href="/pa/91/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="91 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="488363" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0319-01">91 Pa. 319</a>; Kneedler’s App., <a href="/pa/92/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="92 Pa. 428" data-case-ids="490965" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0428-01">92 Pa. 428</a>; Wise’s App., <a href="/pa/99/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="99 Pa. 193" data-case-ids="446052" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0193-01">99 Pa. 193</a>. It is true, these cases refer to the act of 1877, but they are equally applicable to the act of 1891. All of them conclusively show that an application to open a judgment, under either of the acts aforesaid, is an equitable proceeding addressed to the discretion of the court, and is to be disposed of in accordance with the principles of equity. “ The judge to whom the application is made acts as a chancellor, and upon appeal, this court will only see that his discretion has been properly exercised:” Jenkintown N. Bank’s Appeal, supra.</p>
    <p id="b515-5" data-blocks='[["BL_515.5",515,[190,1535,1181,808]]]'>An examination of this case fails to show that the discretion of the court below was improperly exercised. The judgment was taken by default against a defunct corporation, whose business was practically wound up and most of the incorporators dead. It is true, the sheriff returned a service upon “ James I. Bennett, president; ” but Mr. Bennett swears he was not the president, and that he had no knowledge of the suit or the service. The judgment was entered for ten years’ services of the plaintiff, a considerable portion of which was barred by the statute of limitations. It is true, there was considerable delay in making the application to open the judgment, but this is faii'ly accounted for. No terms were imposed by the court below, but that was a matter peculiarly in the discretion of the court, and it would require a very strong case, much stronger than this, to move us to interfere. We think the order made by the learned judge was fully justified by the facts, and it is accordingly</p>
