The tracks of the defendant company .separated the refinery plant into two portions. The plaintiff’s stills, pump-house, engines, etc., were between the tracks and the river. A number of oil tanks were on the opposite side of the tracks. One of these, tank No. 4, a wooden one-thousand-barrel tank, containing seven hundred barrels of Clarendon distillate, was situated a distance of thirty-six feet from the centre line of defendant’s switch track. Other tanks and appliances were near it.</p>

When the shifting was completed, the train pulled past the tank with full load and on an ascending grade. Shortly after, the tank <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>car was discovered to be on fire; the tar on the outside of the car was burning and dripping to the ground.

It could not have been withdrawn from the jury, nor are we able to see any error in the manner of its submission. The learned judge could not have ruled, as a question of law, that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in erecting his oil tank where he did. The sparks from the locomotive were not likely to set fire to the oil in the tank, nor did they do so in this case. The accident would not probably have occurred, had not the defendant company permitted a car, used for carrying tar, to stand on the track opposite to and near plaintiff’s oil tank. This car caught fire from the sparks of the engine, and was wholly or partly consumed. It was the fire from this car which ignited the oil, and caused the destruction of plaintiff’s works. The accident could have been -avoided by running the car a short distance away after it had taken fire. This was eminently a jury case.</p>
