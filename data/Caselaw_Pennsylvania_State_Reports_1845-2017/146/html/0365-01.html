He could use all the water of the spring for his own legitimate purposes, if so needed; or, he could make any improvements or arrangements about the spring, necessary for the convenient use of the water for his family or the stock on his farm. All the right the plaintiff had was in the waste or surplus water that flowed on to his land, after the defendant had been supplied. The defendant could dig into the bank, open up the spring at a higher level, and carry the stream to one side of the original outlet, if rea<a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>sonably necessary for his proper enjoyment of the water.

    <p class="summary" id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.5",392,[275,609,1169,900]]]'>This case is not, properly speaking, the diversion of a natural water-course, of a stream of considerable size, and some principles applicable there do not apply here. The spring, as appears from the evidence, was only about eight or ten feet from the line between the lands of plaintiff and defendant; came out in low ground, and had steep banks- on all sides, except toward the division fence; and from its peculiar situation could not admit of a trough, or other proper arrangement for the watering of defendant’s stock. He dug a lateral trench, striking the stream some nine feet higher up in the bank, and connected it in pipes fifty-seven feet, to get fall enough for a watering trough. From the evidence and master’s finding, this was necessary for the defendant’s proper enjoyment of the water. There is no evidence, or even allegation, that it was done through any other motive, or that he could have dug a trench or carried the water to any other point less injurious to the plaintiff. The defendant had therefore a right to do what he did.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b392-5" data-blocks='[["BL_392.6",392,[274,1527,1165,703]]]'>The plaintiff had carried the surplus water that entered his premises from the spring, in a surface ditch or wooden spout, sixty-eight feet,,to a watering trough adjoining his spring-house. He had a spring of his own, used in the spring-house and for family use, and this water was used mainly for his stock, as his own spring was too low to feed the trough. Occasionally, in dry seasons, when his spring got very low, this water'was used for other purposes. The point to which the defendant carried the water to his trough, was lower than the place where the stream had originally entered .the plaintiff’s premises. It was impossible, therefore, to carry back the surplus water to that place. But it could be carried by pipes, in a new direction, to plaintiff’s watering trough, a distance of eighty-seven feet, only nineteen feet farther than the former course.</p>

That, I think, was all the duty the defendant owed the plaintiff, under the circumstances of this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b393-6" data-blocks='[["BL_393.6",393,[152,500,1165,608]]]'>The plaintiff filed his bill to compel the defendant to let the water from the spring flow on to his premises at the original place. That would require the defendant to undo all he had done, and virtually deprive him of the use of his spring. The plaintiff had no right to make such a demand. The defendant says he offered to carry the surplus water to the division line, but plaintiff refused to have it so, and he had, therefore, to carry it away on his own premises. The plaintiff now offers to have the water carried to his trough by the new route, but insists that defendant shall pay the expense. The expense of this will be trifling, compared with the costs of the case, which are now the main matter in controversy.</p>

Both parties were more or less to blame in the controversy. The plaintiff was unreasonable in his demands, and the defendant hardly as neighborly and accommodating as he should have been: each was inclined to deny any rights to the other; each should therefore, pay one half the costs.</p>
