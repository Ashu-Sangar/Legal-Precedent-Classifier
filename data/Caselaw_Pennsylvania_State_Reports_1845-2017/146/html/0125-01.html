The action of Beale was, not to ask leave to withdraw his resignation, as set forth fin the third paragraph of the original bill, but an unequivocal and absolute withdrawal.] a They thereby voted to accept the said resignation. The said members, other than Beale, then voted in favor of a resolution abolishing the office of superintendent of manufacturing, and devolving the duties thereof upon the chairman, in addition to his other duties. They at the same time, November 22,1887, voted for B. F^ Jennings, John Davis, Robert Flenniken and J. G. Beale as managers, and B. F.

This business he carried on until the spring of 1886, when he commenced a general partnership in the same business with B. F. Jennings, adding to the business that of rolling steel into sheets. Said general partnership continued until October 27, 1886, when this limited partnership was formed. B. F. Jennings having been intimately associated with him in said general partnership prior to October 27,1886, had means of knowing what qualifications said Beale had for business. [On the twenty-seventh of October, 1886, said Beale was a skilful manufacturer of steel. In the discharge of his duties while he served as superintendent of manufacture for Jennings, Beale &amp; Co., Limited, he was careful, skilful, worked in good faith, and to the best of his ability.] 4.....</p>

[But the plaintiffs failed to prove such “ carelessness, negligence and unskilfulness ” on the part of Joseph G.

He, however, refrained from entering into any other business, and held himself ready to serve the firm whenever required, until its dissolution July 1, 1889. <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>If entitled to salary from November 22,1887, until July 1,1889, the amount at the last date is $4,914.29, with interest added from that date.</p>

It is a fact, as set forth in the third paragraph of the cross-bill, that the original plaintiffs attempted to remove the open-hearth furnace from Leechburgh to Allegheny City, and that Mr. Beale was put to cost and expense, namely five hundred dollars, in preventing such removal. The cost and expense in that behalf consisted of counsel fees, printing paper-books, traveling expenses, etc.: [See Jennings’ App., <a href="/monaghan/2/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Monag. 184" data-case-ids="258000" data-case-paths="/monaghan/2/0184-01">2 Mona. 184</a>.]</p>

Beale restrained from acting as superintendent. They say he should be restrained, first, because he had resigned, and had ratified the action of the stockholders in accepting his resignation. But they say he should be restrained, even if the resignation did not put him out of office, because his term of office was only one year from October 27, 1886, and he was not re-elected. And they say further, even if he were lawfully superintendent, he would have no right to control the mill against the will of the owners thereof, as exjiressed by the board of managers.</p>

The proffered resignation was not acted on by the stockholders before the twenty-fifth of October, and no action was had in relation to it until November 22, 1887. Then there was a meeting of the stockholders to take the matter into consideration. Before action was taken thereon, Mr. Beale withdrew it. After this, the stockholders voted to accept it. As it appears to me, there was no resignation before them when they took this action. <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>Hence I submit, that such action did not relieve Mr. Beale from office. The mere tendering of his resignation did not put him out. “At common law, as offices are.held at the will of both parties, if the resignation of an officer be not accepted, he remains in office:” Bouvier’s Law D.; Edwards v. United States, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.%20471" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="18 U.S. 471">18 Otto 471</a>; Steel v.

Take, for instance, § 2: “ All profits shall be divided, and losses borne by the members of said association pro rata; according to the number of shares held by each one.” A fair construction of this, evidently, is that said section shall control for the whole term of partnership. It appears to me that all these six ■sections are, alike, the law of the partnership for the full term of its existence. It appears that the parties themselves so regarded it, because at the end of the year, namely, October 27, 1887, no meeting was called, and no steps were taken towards •electing officers. In construing an agreement, the courts look particularly to the construction placed upon it by the parties: Gass’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=73%20Pa.%2046" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="73 Pa. 46">73 Pa. 46</a>.</p>

But the limited partnership act provides that “ there shall be, at least, one meeting of the members of the association in each year, at one of which there shall be elected. . . . , who shall hold their respective offices for one year and until their successors are duly installed : ” While such is the limitation as to the term of office by the said act of assembly, there appears to be no prohibition against the parties making a binding agreement among themselves providing for a longer term. I take it in this case, both agreements, the recorded and the one not recorded, have equal force on the parties thereto : Parsons on Part., 232.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b156-6" data-blocks='[["BL_156.6",156,[296,1021,1166,859]]]'>The partnership act provides for an annual election, but does not prohibit re-elections. A strict compliance with that law would prevent vacancies, and prevent indefinite drifting, which might be hurtful to the interests of the individual stockholders. But an agreement hy all the stockholders that certain members may have work as officers in the company at a stipulated price for more than one year, entirely conforms to the purpose of keeping the offices filled, and is not necessarily inconsistent with the act. Such agreement by all the other stockholders, might make a very strong inducement to a person to invest his money with them. It does not appear to me that this act makes void such agreement, even if it does direct that the stockholders shall hold an election each year. Measured by the act of assembly, the term of office is one year, but as between the parties themselves they are bound to keep tire person in office as long a time as they have agreed to : Story on Part., 336, § 204.</p>

They could regulate <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>the running of this figurative machine, but not disjoint it.

They gave him, moreover, the right to remain with and help manage the property his money was to help purchase. They did all this, with no deception on Mr. Beale’s part as to his qualifications, but, on the contrary, after an intimate business association with him of one of their number. With full knowledge of his qualifications, they gave him the right to serve as superintendent as fully as they conceded to him his shares of stock.</p>

F. Jennings, in addition to the work they originally gave him. They attempted to abolish the office of superintendent, and assign the duties to the chairman. Their reason for this, according to their proofs, was that they were dissatisfied with Mr. Beale as superintendent. They were also dissatisfied with Leechburgh as the location of their works. They believed that Allegheny City, as a location, would suit better. But this clause in their agreement did not give them the right to make that change. To thus vacate Beale’s office, would be like taking his stock without his consent, or like changing the character of the business.</p>
