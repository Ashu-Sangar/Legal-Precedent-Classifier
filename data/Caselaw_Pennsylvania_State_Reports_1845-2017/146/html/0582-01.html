The plaintiff complains that the learned judge below “ erred in the whole tone and tenor of his charge, which did not present the plaintiff’s case to the jury in that clear, fair, and impartial manner in which he was entitled to have it presented.” See first specification. In the second specification the charge is set out at length. A careful examination of it fails to satisfy us that the <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>plaintiff’s objection is well taken. The learned judge fairly-submitted to the jury the two important questions of fact above stated. It may be that he was of opinion that the plaintiff attempted to get the brass without paying for it, but he does not tell the jury so. On the contrary, he did not attempt to control them in this respect; and we have repeatedly said that an expression of opinion by the court, so long as the jury are left free to form a different conclusion, is not error.</p>
