The defendant, through his counsel, then announced that that would not be controverted in this case ; and therefore, you will take it as a fact that James Borham, on the second day of April, 1890, was a man of intemperate habits, known as such to the defendant Francis Davis.

You are to have regard to the opportunity the witness had for knowing the facts which he or she undertakes to state ; because, of witnesses equally desirous of telling the truth, equally capable of remembering what they did observe, see or hear, where one of the witnesses had a better opportunity of observing the facts than the other, the greater degree of credit should be given to the one who had the best opportunity of knowing. For instance, [when Mr. Taylor tells you that he went into the barroom of Francis Davis on that evening, and that he saw James Borham and saw that he was drunk, would you give to his statement greater credit than you would to the statement of others who observed him and stated that James Borham was not drunk ? Now, Mr. Davis tells you that Borham was sober while he was in his saloon. Mr. Jessup tells you that he appeared to be sober. Mr. Jones tells you he was sober, and Mr. Davis tells you he was sober while he was there and when he left there. Now, gentlemen of the jury, when did he -leave there? Did James Borham leave the bar-room of Francis Davis at half past seven o’clock, as Francis Davis tells you he did? Or did he leave the bar-room in the neighborhood of nine o’clock, as stated by Mrs. MqEldowney and Mrs. Putt ? Now, gentlemen of the jury, if Mrs. Putt and Mrs. McEldowney are telling you the truth, as to seeing James Borham coming out of the bar-room of Francis Davis on that evening, what was the hour when they saw him coming out ? Are they correct in stating to you that they had spent that evening in prayer <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>meeting ? Are they correct in telling you that they had gone from prayer meeting to their home, and when they got into their homes it was then nine o’clock or about that time ? If it was about nine o’clock when James Borham came out of the barroom of Francis Dayis, what was his condition when he came out of the bar-room ? You have heard the testimony of Mr. Tyler and Mr. Taylor, that they saw him at nine o’clock and fifteen minutes, according to the clock at Koehler’s, down along State street, and coming from the direction of the American House, but at a point which I understand to be west of the Shenango House. Now, if James Borham was seen by them at that time, what was his condition ? They tell you that he was in a state of deep intoxication; that they were attracted by his staggering, and that they watched him for several minutes until he got out of sight. Now, was the time which elapsed between the time when Mrs. Putt and Mrs. McEldowney saw James Borham coming out of the bar-room of Francis Davis, and the time when James Borham was seen by Mr. Tyler and Mr. Taylor, sufficient for him to have gotten into that state of. intoxication, if he was sober when he was at the saloon or barroom of Francis Davis ? There is no witness who has been called upon the part of the defendant, who- has testified to you that Borham was intoxicated while he was at the place of Francis Davis. The statement of the witnesses is that he was sober at that time; and we take it, therefore, that the theory of the defence is, that if he became intoxicated that evening, it was after he had gone out of that saloon. • Now; gentlemen, the question of time becomes essential; it becomes important, I should rather say. Because, if it be true that James Borham went into the saloon of Francis Davis early in the evening of the second of April, 1890, in some degree of intoxication as stated by his wife and as stated by Mrs. Putt, and came out o'f there at nine o’clock in the evening in a state of intoxication described b}*- Mr. Taylor and Mr. Tyler, that would be persuasive evidence that the statement, the allegation of the plaintiff, that James Borham got intoxicating liquor there, was true. You will not understand me as saying that it would be conclusive evidence of that fact. It is rather in the nature of corroborative evidenceyet it is a fact for you to consider.] 6</p>

If you are satisfied that the testimony of William Thomas is true, that James Borham got three glasses of beer at the house of Francis Davis on that afternoon, and that that beer entered into what induced intoxication in James Borham that night, and Chat that intoxication resulted in the death of James Borham, Francis Davis is liable for all the damages to which the plaintiff is entitled in this case, even though James Borham got no other intoxicating liquor there during the evening.</p>

If he got intoxicating liquor there at that time, and that intoxicating liquor entered into what induced the drunkenness which resulted in his death, if his death resulted from drunkenness, then Francis Davis is liable for the plaintiff’s damages.] 4 [If you are not so satisfied, then you are to say whether the evidence shows to you by its fair preponderance and weight, that James Borham got intoxicating liquor from Francis Davis or his bar-keeper in the later evening of the second of April, and that that entered into what induced the drunkenness resulting in his death, if his death did result from drunkenness.] 7 If you find any or all of these facts, then you will proceed to the further inquiries involved in this case.....</p>

That he did omit some passages which the defendant’s advocate would undoubtedly have made prominent, may be conceded. But it cannot be required that the judge shall rehearse every item of the evidence, or quote any branch of it entire each time that he refers to it. It is sufficient if he gives the outlines and general effect correctly, so as to convey the proper idea to the jurors of the points to which he is referring, and to recall to them the evidence, on their own recollection of which they must make up their verdict. The judge in the present case had, as already noted, gone over the whole testimony connectedly. He was not required to do so again, when he referred subsequently to detached parts of it in connection with certain points of the case. All that was necessary was that he should leave undisturbed the impartial general presentation the jury already had from him. We are unable to say that he did the appellant any injury in this respect, and it would be tedious and unprofitable to discuss the assignments on the subject separately.
