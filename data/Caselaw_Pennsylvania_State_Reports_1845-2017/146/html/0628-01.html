It is not true that affiant purchased the lease from plaintiff to Marshall &amp; Anderson, nor did the defendant enter into possession of the premises, Nos. 138 and 140 Federal street and Nos. 45 and 46 South Diamond street, ‘ under the terms and conditions of a cértain lease dated November 25, 1887, from Edward Groetzinger to Marshall &amp; Anderson.’ The defendant did not purchase said lease at sheriff’s sale, or in any other way, nor did he ever receive, accept, or assume any of the obligations of said lease.

M. Latimer, and levied upon twenty thousand dollars worth of goods, for the purpose of illegally collecting an alleged forfeiture of ten thousand dollars by Marshall &amp; Anderson, under the assignment as. made by Edward Groetzinger, plaintiff, to said Marshall &amp; Anderson. To avoid, if possible, the persecution, scandal and injury to the commercial standing of the defendant, he sent note marked exhibit C. Yet the said Edward Groetzinger, disregarding and refusing the offer of the amount of rent which was due and owing to Mr. Dean’s estate, continued maliciously, illegally and wrongfully, to issue landlord’s warrants against the defendant, including in said warrants the forfeiture of ten thousand dollars claimed by the plaintiff, Edward Groetzinger, against Marshall &amp; Anderson. By a decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the landlord’s <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>warrants, aforesaid, were all declared illegal and without right,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_2" id="ref_footnote_0_2">*</a> so that the defendant, Thos.

That the warrant was illegal was settled in Latimer v. Groetzinger, <a href="/pa/139/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="139 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="11250987" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0207-01">139 Pa. 207</a>. That case, however, has no further bearing upon this. The matters averred in the affidavit of defence cannot be set off in an action ex contractu, for the reason that they sound in tort and would form the subject of an action ex delicto. It is well settled that matters sounding in tort, arising out of a different transaction, cannot be given in evidence as a set-off: Gogel v. Jacoby, 5 S. &amp; R. 117; and in Ahl v. Rhoads, <a href="/pa/84/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="84 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="1053577" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0319-01">84 Pa. 319</a>, it was said by Justice Woodward: “The right of a defendant may be regarded as established, to set off against a plaintiff’s demand, any damages capable of liquidation and for which an independent action ex contractu could be maintained. This may be stated as the general result of the authorities, extending especially from Nickle v. Baldwin, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 290" data-case-ids="1856496" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0290-01">4 W. &amp; S. 290</a>, to Hunt v.

But, broad and liberal as the construction has been, it has never authorized the admission of proof of damages arising from a technical tort.” The law upon this subject is too well settled to require elaboration.</p>
