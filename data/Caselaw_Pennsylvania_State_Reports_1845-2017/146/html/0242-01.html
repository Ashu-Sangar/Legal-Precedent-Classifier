Michael Carle devised certain real estate to his two sons, Adam and Henry, their heirs and assigns forever, and in a subsequent clause of the will provided as follows : “ Because my son Henry is not yet married, that if he should die without leaving any lawful issue, that then his full share shall fall or go in equal share to my three children, Adam and Anna Mary and Susannah, to one of them as much as to the other.” Mr. Justice Sergeant, delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court on the question, what title did Henry Carle take in the real estate devised to him by his father, said:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b269-7" data-blocks='[["BL_269.7",269,[140,1670,1163,499]]]'>“ The principle has now become a settled rule of property, in relation to lands, that if a devise be made to one in fee, and if he die without issue, or on failure of issue, or for want of issue, or without leaving issue, then over to another in fee, the estate of the first taker is a fee-tail, which, if he have issue, passes to them ad infinitum by descent as tenants in tail. The estate vests in the first taker fully, and to all intents and purposes as a fee-tail; and any devise over after the failure of such, must of course be after an indefinite failure of issue, and bad as an executory devise.”</p>

There, have undoubtedly been cases in which we have held that, where language somewhat similar was used, ‘ the failure of issue ’ upon which the estate of the first taker was to determine, was a definite, and not an indefinite failure of issue; but in all these cases, some particular reasons, founded upon the language of the will indicating that the testator intended a definite failure of issue, controlled the decision. It was contended for the appellants that such a reason exists in the present case, in the fact that the limitation over is to the sister Mary, by name, and that, she being a living person at the death of the testator, a definite failure of issue, must have been intended, and that such a limitation was not too remote to sustain an executory devise. There arp cases in which such a fact is held important, in connection with other considerations. But, standing alone, it is clearly not sufficient, as has been held in many of the cases. Thus, in Eichelberger v. Barnitz, the limitation over was to the testator’s ‘ other three children, Adam and Anna Mary and Susannah.’ They were the testator’s own children, and were specifically named as second takers, which might be well urged against the failure of issue being regarded as indefinite, yet it was so held.”</p>

As a matter of fact he may have so intended, but such intention cannot be found, either expressed or implied, within the four corners of his will. In apt language he made the devise in favor of the plaintiff, and the other children of Dr. J. W. Alexander, depend upon an indefinite failure of issue, and created an estate-tail in his daughter, Elizabeth Alexander, which, by operation of our act of 1855, became a fee-simple estate in her, subject to her testamentary disposition. And, the daughter having devised the farm to others than the use plaintiff, she cannot recover in this action. The devise over to the children of Dr. J. W. Alexander is void.</p>
