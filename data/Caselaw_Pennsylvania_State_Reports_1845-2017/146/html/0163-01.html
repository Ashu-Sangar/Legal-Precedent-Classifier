Perdue, the original plaintiff, died in October, 1887. In 1876, he was an oil producer, doing business at Petrolia, Butler county. He was the owner, on October 10, 1876, of three <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>“ oil certificates,” for one thousand, barrels of crude petroleum each, the oil being stored with the United Pipe Lines, a corporation engaged in the business of storing and transporting oil.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_3" id="ref_footnote_0_3">*</a> The value of the oil was then about $3.45 per barrel. On the morning of October 10, 1876, he was approached by Joseph Wolcott, an oil broker, who had been sent to him for the purpose by H. L. Taylor, one of the defendants. Wolcott asked him to exchange his three certificates for like certificates on the Pennsylvania Transportation Company, another pipe-line company doing business in Butler county. Wolcott said to Perdue that he had a good responsible party who wanted to make such an exchange, and urged that it would probably be of some advantage to Perdue, as the pipeage was paid in the Transportation company. Perdue replied that he could accommodate Wolcott, provided the party was sound and responsible, when Wolcott said again that his party was all right and perfectly responsible, adding that he wanted to use the certificates right away, and if Perdue would deliver them to him he would bring the Transportation company’s certificates, signed by a responsible party, sometime during the day. Perdue then delivered to Wolcott the three certificates first mentioned. Before seeing Wolcott again, Perdue went to the office of the Transportation company and made inquiries which satisfied him that it was probably insolvent. He had previously known that that company was not regarded as very good, and this was his rea<a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>son for requiring that the person from whom he was to get the certificates should be good and' responsible.</p>

Wilson, its agent, and indorsed in blank, “ without recourse ” by E. G. Taylor, cashier.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_3" id="ref_footnote_0_3">*</a> Perdue looked at them and at once said he would not accept them, as they were. not signed according to contract, because the party signing them was not responsible, and also because of their being indorsed without recourse.

I said to Wolcott that I would not accept them at all in any way or manner, signed as they were. He then asked time to see his party and see whether he could not make them (the certificates) all right. He went away, leaving the certificates on the table or desk, and returned in about ten minutes and said that I had got them in my hands and that the company would not do anything, but said that H. L. Taylor was away or out, and when he returned he would see him personally.

L. Taylor &amp; Co. would do what was right; but as I have said, they did not see me as was promised by Wolcott. On the other hand, H. L. Taylor appeared to dodge me on the street, and acted as though he did not want to see me. About ten days after the tenth of October, 1876, I went to the office of H. L. Taylor &amp; Co., taking a witness with me, and tendered to H. L. Taylor, of said firm, defendants, the certificates Wolcott had left in my office, and demanded certificates as called for by the contract with said firm. In reply, Taylor said when he made a contract he lived to it, and he would make me live to mine. ' I told him I had never accepted the certificates in exchange at all, in any way or manner ; that he (Taylor) knew it was a fraud and not according to the contract.

A short time after October 10, 1876, (the exact date I cannot tell,) I had a conversation with Wolcott, the agent of H. L. Taylor &amp; Co., and I asked him what interest he had in the transaction, and he said that he had no interest in the matter except a brokerage fee; that H. L.

Also, in a conversation I had with Wolcott after the transaction on October 10, 1876, he admitted to me that I had objected to the certificates tendered and refused to accept them, as they were not according to the contract, and that I said E. G. Taylor was irresponsible, and further said that the whole transaction, so far "as the attempt to palm off on me said certificates so signed by E. G.

When he became thoroughly acquainted with the facts, he desired to change the form of action so that he might have broader ground, without at all changing the cause of action.

In an action for fraudulently inducing the plaintiff to purchase personal property by false and fraudulent representations, it must be shown that the representations were untrue, were known to be so by the defendant and were calculated to induce the plaintiff to act, and that he, believing them, was induced to act accordingly : Cox v.

There is no evidence that Wolcott represented that his principals had oil in the Pennsylvania Transportation Company’s line, but if such a representation can be implied, there is no sufficient evidence that it was untrue.

Moreover, Perdue was not deceived on that subject, as he knew or suspected insolvency on October 10, 1876. And the claim that the Transportation company’s certificates were to be guaranteed or warranted by the defendants, is not supported by Perdue’s testimony. He says simply that they were to be signed by a good and responsible party. When produced on <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>the trial, it appeared that they were signed by H. L.

Even, however, if the certificates, when delivered to Per-due, had not been signed as Wolcott agreed they should be, or if they had not been delivered at all, there would have been nothing more than a breach of contract, for which assumpsit, but not trespass, could be maintained. On the testimony, the delivery of the United Pipe Lines certificates to Wolcott for immediate use, was not a conditional sale, but the title was to pass at once. On failure to deliver .the consideration, the relation of the parties would be simply that of debtor and creditor, and the remedy would be upon the contract, not by an action for tort: Duffield v.

Moreover, the plaintiff has shown an acceptance of the Transportation company’s certificates. When produced at the trial they bore the indorsement of Perdue, showing that he had used them for some purpose. The drawing of a pen through his signature was doubtless done when it was found necessary to use them in evidence. Again, he specifically assigned these identical certificates to A. C. Gibson.</p>

Producers deposit the oil, as it is produced, in the tanks of a pipeline company, getting credit upon the company’s books for the number of barrels of oil so deposited. When the depositor wishes to sell his oil, he draws an order on the company, directing it to deliver to the purchaser the amount of oil specified therein. Such orders are often presented at the office of the company by the person in whose favor they are drawn, for acceptance merely, whereupon the agent of the company writes across the face an acceptance, and thereafter the company holds the oil for the purpose of filling the order when afterwards presented for that purpose. When so accepted, the order is called an “ acceptance ” or a “ certificate.” By § 3, act of May 15, 1874, P. L. 172, certificates, etc., for petroleum, issued by corporations, etc., engaged in the business of transporting or storing petroleum, were made transferable by indorsement either in blank or to order, such indorsement to be deemed a valid transfer of the property represented by the certificates.

The fact that Wolcott was the agent of the defendants in procuring the certificates from the plaintiff is one of these, and the liability of the defendants for the acts and declarations of their agent in the course of the transaction is a necessary legal inference. Another leading and very serious fact, entirely without question, is, that the defendants, by means of, and in consequence of, the acts and declarations of their authorized agent, obtained from the plaintiff certificates for three thousand barrels of oil of the actual cash value of over ten thousand dollars, for which they gave him nothing having any value, and, as he alleges and testifies, nothing which he ever agreed to accept. The certificates which the defendants offered to the plaintiff were absolutely and utterly worthless, and it is an inference which a jury would be perfectly at liberty <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>to draw, from all the facts of the transaction, that the defendants knew their worthless character when they tendered them to the plaintiff. Moreover, it was positively testified by the plaintiff, and must be assumed as verity, that the plaintiff only agreed to part with his good certificates upon condition that he should have the name and responsibility of parties who were perfectly good in a financial sense, in addition to the certificates he was to receive in exchange. It is equally true that the certificates which were offered to him had not a penny of value in themselves, and that no name and no responsibility to which he could have recourse was furnished to him in the manner in which the defendants undertook to perform their part of the contract. It is also positively testified by the plaintiff, and must be assumed as verity, that at the very moment when the certificates tendered by the defendants to the plaintiff were seen by the plaintiff, he peremptorily refused to receive them, and denounced the transaction as a fraud contrived to rob him of his certificates. It is also a perfectly established fact that, although his refusal to receive the certificates of the defendants was immediately communicated to the defendants, they utterly refused to return the plaintiff’s good certificates to Mm, or to give him any value for them, or to give him a particle of security, or to indemnify him in any way whatever. They evaded him, and gave him some vague promises which they never performed, but that was all; and the plaintiff’s loss of over ten thousand dollars, and the defendants’ acquisition of his property of that value, without their giving him any equivalent of any value at all, became an accomplished'fact, for which no redress has as yet been obtained.</p>

It is this: The plaintiff was induced to part with Ms certificates to the defendants, in advance of any delivery by them, and without anything to show for them except the verbal promise of the defendants by their agent to deliver the certificates of the Transportation company, with the name and responsibility of a party perfectly sound’ and good. The thing was done by the defendants’ agent, and therefore it was their act; but even the name of the principal was not disclosed at that stage of the transaction. It was, of <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>course, a very unwise act on the part of the plaintiff, but there was thereby added to the mere legal obligation of the defendants an obligation of honor which, we are glad to believe, the great majority of the business community would be keenly anxious to observe. The defendants had been intrusted with the possession of the plaintiff’s certificates. That possession was obtained in this way: The defendants’ agent represented to the plaintiff that his principals were anxious to use the certificates “ right away,” and if the plaintiff would deliver them to him, he would bring him the other certificates later on during the day. The plaintiff then delivered his certificates to the agent, and that was the last he ever saw of them. When he demanded them back, with an indignant protest, he was refused them. It may be possible that the pretext upon which the possession of the plaintiff’s certificates was obtained was real and consistent with honor, but it was pre-eminently the function of a jury to determine whether it was not a false and dishonorable pretence, and part of a scheme of fraud devised to cheat the plaintiff out of his valuable securities. Upon the facts as they now appear, it was the plain <em>duty of the </em>defendants, either to return the securities the moment they were demanded, or else, to give to the plaintiff some equivalent for them which he was entirely willing to receive.</p>

We are clearly of opinion that it was grave error to withdraw them from the consideration and decision of the jury. They raised in a very forcible and emphatic manner a question of fraud in fact, which the court had no right to decide but was bound to commit to the jury. It was not by any means a case in which the proof was only a scintilla. On the contrary, it is difficult to understand, upon the testimony as it now stands, and upon the prominent leading facts of the case, how it is possible to explain the transaction on behalf of the defendants, consistently with any regard for business integrity or common honesty. It cannot be believed that, if the defendants’ agent had offered to the plaintiff, at the time he proposed the exchange, the same certificates and in the same condition in which they were when he really did offer them, the plaintiff would even have considered the subject of an exchange, much less agreed to it. We are not informed of the reasons why the <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>first verdict for the plaintiff for nineteen thousand dollars was set aside. The only reason given by the court below for granting the compulsory nonsuit, was that it was not a question whether the transaction was wise or not on the part of the plaintiff, and that sympathy has nothing to do with enforcing a contract. This view is very far short of an adequate treatment of the case. The palpable facts, as we regard them, present a question, not of the enforcement of a contract, but of the procurement by the defendants from the plaintiff of his very valuable securities by means of a base fraud. If such a fraud was practiced, and the securities of the plaintiff were obtained by means thereof, the transaction was utterly void from the beginning, the plaintiff never lost his title to his certificates, and he is entitled to have them back, or their value with interest. It is not a matter of much consequence whether the remedy invoked is replevin, trover, trespass, or assumpsit; since the claim of the plaintiff is founded upon the proposition that he never lost his title to the property obtained from him by fraud, and any well-known remedy applicable to the recovery of personal chattels or their value, the right to which is in the plaintiff, and the possession of which is unlawfully in the defendant, is available to that end.</p>
