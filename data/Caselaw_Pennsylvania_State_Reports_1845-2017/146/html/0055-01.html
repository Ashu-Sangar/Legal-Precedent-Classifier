[It was peaceably and quietly built, and no objection or pretence of objection was made to the building of the fence.] 4 It was constructed at times when he was released from his other labors, and it took some time for its construction, as the witnesses have testified ; [and when it was completed, without any objection or remonstrance of any kind, or any resort to any civil proceedings to prevent him as a trespasser, or any other way, in the night-time,-—-one of the trespasses at 9 o’clock at night or after-wards, and the other at 11 o’clock, a force of men, in one case seven and in the other eight, appeared upon the ground and the fence was destroyed, removed, torn down.

He may have been mistaken for all that we know. If he was, there are the fullest means of rectifying that mistake, in the civil courts of this commonwealth. The purpose of the law is to prevent men, or women either, from taking the law into their own hands. Supposing that this prosecutor, when an effort was made to tear down this fence, had rallied a force to protect it, there might have been an assault and battery, perhaps a riot and bloodshed; and hence the necessity of the act, to punish in the criminal courts acts of this kind, where parties recklessly and rashly take the law into their own hands, and commit acts that are made offences by the act of assembly, instead of waiting for a peaceable decision in the civil courts.</p>

We cannot say she had not; but she cannot redress them by the strong arm of force, aided by a crowd of men in the night. That is not the proper way for her to obtain her rights if she has sustained any wrong. The main offence is clearly made out.] 6 The defendants offer to justify here, by some claim of title that they have; but we cannot try titles in the Quarter Sessions. We cannot go into this question here at all. We have another court, another jurisdiction, that would quietly and patiently hear these parties in another tribunal; but here is a plain and'palpable infraction of the law, and courts and juries have no course but to find the defendants guilty; and having found them guilty, the court may, in passing sentence, consider such mitigating circumstances as are presented to it.</p>

That would involve a land trial, where land titles are not tried, in the Court of Quarter Sessions. The law aims to prevent such reckless acts performed in the night time; and if the prosecutor had stood in defence of his property and raised a crowd to oppose the taking away of the fence, the effort to take it away would have been followed, in all probability, by a much more serious offence. [We have no remedy in this case but to direct that the case is made out, and that the defence has failed entirely to show any reason why these parties should not be convicted. Your verdict, under the circumstances, must necessarily be for the commonwealth, because there is no reasonable doubt or any question here in regard to the commission of the act itself.] 7</p>
