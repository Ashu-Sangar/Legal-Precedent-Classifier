I.” to “ S. C.” It occurs twice, and it is plain in the place from which it professes to be sent that there has been a change by somebody on the face of this paper in evidence from “ S. I.” to “ S. C.” In the lower part, where it says “ Coroner Hughes, Clifton, S. C.,” it is not so plain that there has been any change, although I think I would say in looking at it that there has been, but a casual observer might pass it without seeing that a change had been made. In the other one, the first place it occurs, I do not think even a casual observer could pass it without seeing it was changed. You have that fact, and also the fact that the plaintiff went to the office and the operator was away; and you have, in addition, against him, the fact that <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>the sister had disappeared from New York, not from near South Carolina.</p>

I repeat, to find for the plaintiff you must find, first, that the defendant company was guilty of negligence through its officers or employees, causing him to start off to South Carolina; and then, in addition to that, that he himself was free from negligence, namely, that he exercised reasonable care.</p>
