As to the making of nominations, and the privilege of voting for candidates in a group, the act produces odious inequality and unjust discrimination. It is really an act to stifle independent voting and strangle small political parties. If the legislature has power to draw a per-centum line between voters, under the pretext of regulation, it may put the line just where it pleases,—at thirty or sixty per cent, instead of three. The maxim, de minimis, has no application to constitutional law, nor, indeed, to any law mandatory in effect. Testing this law by the results of the last election, the voters of the Republican and Democratic parties have privileges under it which are absolutely denied to those of the Prohibition party. This is a palpable violation of the freedom and equality assured by the constitution.</p>

Nor can these difficulties be obviated by the use of printed adhesive slips. The entire trend of the act leads to the conclusion that there can be no printed names put on the official ballot, except those which the commissioners have caused to be printed on it. Moreover, the fact that in § 12 the act provides for the use of printed slips in one instance, excludes the idea of their use in any other, and this is the conclusion reached by the official compiler of the Pamphlet Laws, as indicated by his marginal notes to § 14.</p>

State, <a href="/tenn/90/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="90 Tenn. 407" data-case-ids="11264126" data-case-paths="/tenn/90/0407-01">90 Tenn. 407</a>. But, even if the provision as to the percentage of electors required to make a party nomination be unconstitutional, tllis will not affect the rest of the act, and it can operate with the restriction eliminated: Cooley on Const.

    <p id="b560-5" data-blocks='[["BL_560.5",560,[263,501,1171,755]]]'>1. The act of June 19, 1891, is a special and local law. It cannot go beyond its title, which is confined to the “ nomination and election of public officers ; ” and therefore it can have no operation as to other elections, e. g., upon a proposition to amend the constitution, or to increase municipal indebtedness. But, if it does not apply to all elections, it offends against § 7, article III. of the constitution, forbidding local or special laws regulating the conduct of elections, and also against § 7, article Yin., requiring all laws regulating elections to be uniform. The moment we admit that it is not good as to all elections, it becomes a special law and must fall as a whole. The difficulty cannot be avoided by the doctrine of classification. That doctrine is confined to narrow limits, defined by imperative necessity : Ayars’ App., <a href="/citations/?q=122%20Pa.%20281" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="122 Pa. 281">122 Pa. 281</a>; and there exists no necessity for classifying elections.</p>
    <p id="b560-6" data-blocks='[["BL_560.6",560,[257,1264,1172,654]]]'>2. The act is special and unconstitutional in that it unnecessarily attempts to classify the voters of the state with reference to political affiliations, and also upon an educational test. It is special and local, in that it legislates differently for portions of the same class of officers with reference to their locality, the regulations applicable to certain officers in boroughs and townships being different from those prescribed as to the same officers in other districts. These officers cannot be classified for legislative purposes: Weinman v. Railway Co., <a href="/citations/?q=118%20Pa.%20201" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="118 Pa. 201">118 Pa. 201</a>. And the title of the act is defective in not giving notice of the provisions in the body of the act regulating the practice of the courts, and also in that it gives no notice of the attempt made in § 37 to repeal certain specified laws or parts of laws.</p>

The act destroys the freedom and equality of elections, and clearly prevents the free exercise of the right of suffrage. The time limit of three minutes in which to prepare the ballot would be an absolute bar preventing thousands of intelligent citizens from voting at all. Electors have a right to vote for whom they please, nor can they be compelled to procure “ pasters, ” supposing that their use is permissible under the act, which is extremely doubtful; and any law which deprives the voter of the time necessary to prepare and cast a written ballot is unconstitutional. The prohibition, in § 5, article I. of the <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>constitution, of any interference with the free exercise of the right of suffrage is new and not to be found in other constitutions. It was the law, before the adoption of the present constitution, that the right to vote could not be substantially impaired by regulation: McCreary on Elections, 57, § 91; Commonwealth v. Maxwell, <a href="/pa/27/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="27 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="979677" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0444-01">27 Pa. 444</a>; Page v.

The act is unconstitutional, in that it confers judicial powers on ministerial officers, in violation of § 1, article V. of the constitution, making the decision of such officers final as to the formal sufficiency of nomination papers, etc.; in that it delegates legislative powers to a ministerial officer, by authorizing the secretary of the commonwealth to prescribe forms, which has heretofore been recognized as a legislative duty: Locke’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=72%20Pa.%20494" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="72 Pa. 494">72 Pa. 494</a>; in that it prevents all electors, except possibly th®se who are,unable to prepare their ballots, from having them attested in the manner specified in § 4, article VIII. of the constitution, § 31 of the act making it a misdemeanor for any voter to show his ballot to any other person; in that it interferes with the federal and state overseers of elections, by prohibiting all persons from remaining within the guard-rail after the polls are closed, except “ election officers, ” which term does not include the overseers, either in the act itself or in the constitution: United States v.

It will probably be found, on trial, that the inconveniences of which the appellant so loudly complains, exist only in his imagination. It is not to be presumed that the election officers will all refuse, if requested, to attest a voter’s ballot.</p>

In other words, it applies to no city unless its boundaries happen to be co-extensive with those of a county. If any doubt could exist on this point, a reading of paragraph 1, § 10, would dispel it. The author of the act knew that in Philadelphia county assessors are not elected by the people, and when he came to provide for the public notice to be given by the sheriff, of the holding of elections, he carefully excluded assessors from such notice. This shows that cities were not in the mind of the legislature.</p>
    <p id="b562-9" data-blocks='[["BL_562.9",562,[250,1874,1166,552]]]'>2. It seems to have been forgotten that, whereas the city and county of Philadelphia are co-extensive, and the county officers are city officers, this state of affairs does not exist as to the other cities of the commonwealth. Again, § 13 provides that the county commissioners shall ascertain the offices to be filled, except in boroughs and townships. The application of this is easy as to the city and county of Philadelphia, but its application to the other counties of the state was certainly not considered by the framers of the act. This court cannot read into the act words which were left out by the framers, either by accident or design: Pittsburgh v. Kalchthaler, <a href="/citations/?q=114%20Pa.%20552" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="114 Pa. 552">114 Pa. 552</a>.</p>

An act which requires the commissioners of Lebanon county to supervise the election of school controllers in the city of Lebanon, and does not require the commissioners of Schuylkill county to supervise the election of the same class of officers in the borough of Pottsville, is not uniform.

That is manifestly its main purpose, and it is in entire ha free and equal.” This means that every citizen shall have an equal right to cast a free ballot. This is the letter of the constitution, and it is a right which no legislature can interfere with. The spirit of the constitution requires that each voter shall be permitted to cast a free and unintimidated ballot. This the act of 1891 was intended to secure. An election to be free must be without coercion of every description. An election may be held in strict accordance with every legal requirement as to form, yet, if in point of fact the voter casts the ballot as the result of intimidation; if he is deterred from the exercise of his free will by means of any influence whatever, although there be neither violence nor physical coercion, it is not a free and equal election within the spirit of of the constitution, which declares <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>the constitution.

It was contended that the provision or discrimination against the Prohibition party is in violation of that clause of the constitution which declares that elections shall be free and equal, and also § 7, article VIII., which declares that all laws regulating the holding of elections by the citizens shall be uniform throughout the state; that these constitutional provisions were intended to secure to every citizen equality in the manner of voting, and to prohibit the legislature from passing any law which shall give, directly or indirectly, an advantage to some voters which will not equally apply to all voters.</p>
    <p id="b567-4" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[176,1064,1169,1063]]]'>This contention is plausible but unsound. The act does not deny to any voter the exercise of the elective franchise because he happens to be a member of a party which at the last general election polled less than three per cent of the entire vote cast. The provision referred to is but a regulation, and we think a reasonable one, in regard to the printing of tickets. The use of official ballots renders it absolutely necessary to make some regulations in regard to nominations, in order to ascertain what names shall be printed on the ballot. The right to vote can only be exercised by the individual voter. The right to nominate, flowing necessarily from the right to vote, can only be exercised by a number of voters acting together. Three persons may claim to be a political party, just as the three tailors of Tooley street assumed to be “ the people of England.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> It follows, if an official ballot is to be used, nominations must be regulated in some way, otherwise the scheme would be impracticable, and the official ballot become the size of a blanket. While so regulating it, the act carefully preserves the right of every citizen to vote for any candidate whose name is not on the official ballot, and this is done in a manner which does not impose any unnecessary inconvenience upon the voter.</p>
    <p id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.6",567,[179,2135,1164,92]],["BL_568.1",568,[266,401,1172,1717]]]'>It was urged, however, that when an elector desires to vote for a candidate whose name is not on the official ballot, he can <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>only do so by writing the name of the candidate upon the ballot; and that this provision, in view of the limited time allowed the elector for this purpose, renders a compliance with it practically impossible, and in many instances would be a denial of the franchise. This is merely the argumentum ab inconvenienti. We cannot say, as a matter of law, that it would be practically impossible to insert the name by writing. The actual enforcement of the act will test fhis as well as many other matters connected with its operation. It is at least probable that when tested by experience it will be found to contain many features that will need revision and amendment. This can be safely left to the legislature, and is no reason why we should declare the act unconstitutional. Aside from this, we see nothing in it to prevent the elector from inserting the name of his candidate by the use of a “ sticker ” as is now practiced. The twenty-third section of the act provides that: “ On receipt of his ballot, the voter shall, forthwith and without leaving the space enclosed by the guard-rail, retire to one of the voting shelves or compartments, and shall prepare his ballot by marking in the appropriate margin or place a cross (X) opposite the party name or political designation of a group of candidates, or opposite the name of the candidate of his choice, for each office to be filled, or by inserting in the blank space provided therefor any name not already on the ballot.” It would be a strained construction to hold that the word “ inserting,” as used in the act, means inserting by writing. It certainly does not say so, and we see no reason why we should place this construction upon it. The fact, that by § 12, the name of a substituted candidate, is authorized to be placed upon the ballot by the use of what is commonly known as a “ sticker,” furnishes no sufficient reason why the name of a candidate, not on the official ballot, should not be inserted in the same way. On the contrary, it recognizes the convenience and the propri-' ety of this mode of insertion.</p>

The principal ground of contention in this, as in Meredith’s Appeal, is that the act in question is a local and special law, and therefore in contravention of the constitution. It was alleged to be special and local legislation, because it does not <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>apply to any one of the cities of the commonwealth whose boundaries are not co-extensive with the county. If the fact were as alleged, we would be compelled to declare the act unconstitutional. An examination of it, however, does not satisfy us that it does not apply to every portion of the state. Its language is general and applies to all public offices, whether in counties, cities, boroughs or townships. It contains a vast amount of detail, and there may be inconsistencies in some of its provisions. There are others which are not free from criticism, and as before suggested, its practical working may disclose omissions and defects which will be doubtless corrected by the legislature in the future. The law itself may be regarded in the light of an attempt on the part of the people to secure a pure, free, and unintimidated ballot. Every presumption is in favor of the constitutionality of the law, and it would require a very clear case to justify us in striking it down on the ground of its unconstitutionality.</p>

As we view the act there is nothing in it which is so clearly a violation of the constitution as to justify this court in striking it down. It would be out of place at this time to discuss its wisdom. If it shall prove beneficial, the people will probably retain it, with such amendments as the future may show to be wise. If it does not meet with the expectation of the people, they will sweep it away.</p>
