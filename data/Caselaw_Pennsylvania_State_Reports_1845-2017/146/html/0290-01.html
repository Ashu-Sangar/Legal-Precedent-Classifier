The controversy is between the Briar Hill 0. &amp; I. Co. and Mr. Andrew Carnegie. The fund for distribution arises from the sale of the leasehold of the Atlas Works, Limited, upon sundry executions; two of which, to wit, Nos. 51 September Term 1886, and 77 October Term 1886, were in favor of Andrew Carnegie. The fieri facias at No. 77 October Term 1886, was issued upon a judgment in favor of the Peoples Savings Bank, for use of Andrew Carnegie, v. the Atlas Works, Limited, upon the bond accompanying the mortgage made by the Atlas Works, Limited, to the Peoples Savings Bank, the payment, of which was guaranteed by Andrew Carnegie. Said bond was assigned to Mr. Andrew Carnegie on the twenty-third of June, 1886 ; and it is conceded that the judgment on said bond related back to the date of the recording of said mortgage, to wit, the fourteenth day of December, 1883, and was therefore the first lien, and Mr. Carnegie would be entitled to the whole of the fund, after the payment of costs and taxes.</p>

It is apparent, therefore, that if the mortgage above mentioned was a valid lien, that would be the end of this case. Mr. Plouseman’s reasons for contesting the validity of the lien of said mortgage, specifically stated, are as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b316-7" data-blocks='[["BL_316.8",316,[303,1931,1157,93]]]'>1. That the organization of the limited-partnership association called the Atlas Works, Limited, was entirely defective.</p>

Each partner is liable, unless saved by the statute. If the partners have not complied with the statutory requisites, a limited-partnership association has not been formed.

But, to hold that on account of these irregularities and defects, there was actually no association under the law capable of performing any acts which would be binding upon it, is another and very different question. .</p>

It is a quasi corporation. It has special restrictions and privileges.. It ex<a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>ists only from the recording of its articles.

When they have made an apparent compliance with the requirements of the act, by filing their articles of association, schedules, etc., they become a partnership limited de facto, endued with all the powers of such associations, restricted in their mode of action according to the requirements of the act, and bound by the acts of their agents when performed in a manner conforming to the requirements of the statute.</p>

The statutory remedy is not to relieve the association itself, but to hold the individual members thereof liable, on the ground that they have not brought themselves within the protection of the statute.</p>

It was solely as to the liability of the individual members of the association; and rve must presume, unless we go much further than the court has gone, that what was meant was that, so far as any protection to the members of the association was concerned, “a limited partnership had not been formed,” and that there was “ no statutory association.” To hold that a failure to comply with the statutory requisites re-<a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>suited in the formation of a mere common-law partnership, and wrested from the association its power to bind itself by the methods pointed out by the statute, would be productive of the grossest injustice and fraud. No deed, bond, mortgage, note, or other paper, executed under the formalities of the statute, would be binding, if the association should subsequently be declared to have been informally organized. It is certainly much more reasonable to say that when a partnership association is organized under the act, all its engagements entered into under the forms prescribed by law are valid and binding, and the defective formation has no effect upon the obligation, but only on the kind of liability which shall arise under it. As has already been intimated, such associations cannot take advantage of their own wrong and plead lack of power to enter into the obligation ; nor can a creditor who had dealt with the firm as a partnership, limited, contest its existence in order to defeat the claim of an adverse claimant.</p>
