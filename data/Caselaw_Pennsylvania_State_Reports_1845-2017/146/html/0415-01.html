In this case, the account filed was merely of the proceeds of the sale of the three pieces of real estate, ordered to be sold under the act of 1876 ; and the duty of the auditor was merely to ascertain the liens against those particular properties which would be divested by the sale. The general creditors were not before the auditor. The contest was not one between creditors. The balance of the fund, after-paying the liens discharged by the sale, was awarded to the assignee. The court took the fund away from the assignee. The creditors could not appeal from that order, therefore the assignee had the right to do so.</p>

The assignee here, however, claims that he has the right to appeal on behalf of the general creditors. We are unable to see the force of this. If the general creditors have any claim upon this particular fund, they have the right to an appeal; if they have no such interest, they have no right of appeal, nor has the assignee the right to appeal for them.</p>
