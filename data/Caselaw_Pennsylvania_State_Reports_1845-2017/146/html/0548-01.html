The defendants introduced testimony to meet the case as presented by the plaintiff, and made various offers to prove the actual value of the one hundred seventy-nine acre tract, as an oil-producing farm, at the time of the lease to the plaintiff of May 10,1889, for the purpose of showing “ that the bonus paid by Mr. Guffey is not in excess of the value of the farm leased for oil and gas purposes, in the estimation of those who knew that territory in that regard at that time.”</p>

A contract is, like any other property that a man owns, transferable. But I do not think that that is a material question in this case, because, subsequently, on the twelfth day of February, 1889, Mr. Clever entered into a contract with Mr. Guffey, in which they changed the terms of this lease to some extent, but provided further, that “ said lease shall remain in full force in all particulars in which the same is not hereby modified; ” and it seems to me that that would make an agreement between Mr. Clever and Mr. Guffey which would carry that clause with it.] 8</p>

But on the twenty-third day of April he wrote a letter which is not now here and which I will have to give you from, recollection ; you have heard it read two or three times. In that letter, Mr. Guffey wrote to Mr. Clever substantially this: “ You know that under the lease assigned to me I have a right to a lease of the balance of the property upon terms equal to those which may be offered by any other person. You will therefore notify me what offer you have, and I am ready to comply with my contract and take the lease upon the same terms.” That is about the substance of the letter. Now, Mr. Clever, in answering that, did not say “No, you have no right to this lease under your assignment; ” but, recognizing his right, (and if there was any dispute about it he ought to have stated it then and there,) recognizing that right, he says in the letter of April 29th, “ I beg leave to say I have an offer to lease the other lands belonging to me in the same locality as your fifty acres,” etc. Then he goes on to state all the terms, and states by whom that offer was made. So that, even if Guffey did not have á right under this lease and assignments, or under his agreement with Clever, to this option, they dealt upon that theory; and, therefore, if Mr. Clever made statements in reference to it, he was bound to make those statements truthfully, and if he made them. falsely, and Mr. Guffey relied upon them and paid his money upon them, it would be deception for which he would be responsible.] 9</p>

There are some cases in which a man has no right to rely upon the statements of another. That is where it is a matter of opinion, or where the fact is one which is equally open to the party to whom the representation is made ; but I do not understand that this is a case of that sort. In this case, the fact stated was one that was peculiarly within the knowledge of Mr. Clever. He stated it upon his own veracity, and Mr. Guffey was not bound to assume that he was telling what was not true. And it is not certain that if he had gone to investí<a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>gate, he would have discovered the real truth. So, I say to you that, under the circumstances, he was not bound to go to Mr. Goettman, but had a right to rely upon what Mr. Clever said.] 10</p>
    <p class="summary" id="A5j" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[167,565,1172,710]]]'>[Then we come down to this statement in the letter as follows : “ The gentleman making this offer is Mr. Peter Goettman, of Atwood street, Oakland, Pittsburgh.” That is admitted by Goettman, by Clever and by Scarborough to be untrue; therefore it was a false statement which Clever knew to be false, and made to the man with whom he was dealing, and upon the faith of which it is unquestioned this money was paid. And Scarborough admits that he knew of the letter at the time it was sent, and subsequently made up this memorandum which was supposed to be the terms of this lease. Therefore, I say to you that, under the undisputed evidence in this case, the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict for something, because the defendant had admittedly imposed upon him, deceived him in this contract, and made a false representation to him.] 11</p>

If you find that there was no actual damage done, your verdict would be for what are called nominal damages, say, six and one fourth cents. But that much, at least, he would be entitled to receive.] <em>12 </em>And now, gentlemen, the question is, what is the damage? And the plaintiff must make out his case, must show damage. When the case was first presented, there was, as you observed, some want of certainty upon the part of both court and counsel as to what would be the measure of damages in such a case. If there had been no offer at all made to Mr. Clever, under this contract, the difficulty would not have been very great. In my judgment, the question would then have been, what would have been a fair offer for such property ; not what it was actually worth, but what any person might be reasonably expected to offer for it.</p>

Mr. Aiken testifies that he made an offer for the lease of ten thousand dollars in good faith, for a responsible party who was able to carry it out, and who intended to carry it out if it had been accepted. He says that there was nothing said about what wells should be put down or what royalty should be paid, but that that was to be a matter of negotiation; he supposed, of course, a reasonable arrangement in that regard. That is a matter you <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>may consider hereafter; but, at all events, he offered a bonus of ten thousand dollars, and I think that there you get a basis for these damages, and can start from that. If that was the only offer that was made, then the difference between that and what Mr. Guffey was compelled to pay by reason of this misrepresentation, would be the measure of damages to that extent. There is a question in reference to the wells of which I will speak hereafter. But the difference between what he paid and what was really offered is the measure of damages, for this reason : This is not a ease of the purchase of property in the ordinary way, but it is a question, you will observe, of contract; therefore, the cases which the counsel for the defendants refer to as to representations and measure of damages, etc., are not .applicable to this case; because it does not make any difference what this property was worth. It turned out not to be worth a great deal, but if it had been worth millions, Mr. Guffey was only bound to pay what he had agreed to pay; and from this contract, as I understand it, he had an option to take the property at what any person else would offer.] 13</p>

In this case, when Mr. Guffey, having an option, says, “ I will take the property upon the terms offered to you by any other person,” he is bound by that. The contract had become perfected, and the only question was the fixing of tlie price ; and the mode of fixing the price was provided by the original agreement; that was, by any offer made to Mr. Clever. When Mr. Aiken made an offer of ten thousand dollars, Mr. Clever was bound to take and Mr. Guffey was bound to give ten thousand dollars for that lease, but was not bound to give any more. It does not make any difference what it was worth ;■ whether less or more, Guffey was bound to pay the ten thousand dollars, and Clever was bound to take it.] 14</p>

In determining that, you consider all the circumstances, precedent, subsequent and during the time, and the first thing you will observe will be this:—I do not propose to go into the testimony at any length,—the first thing that you will observe will be this: that in the letter of the twenty-ninth of April, 1889, Mr. Clever told what was not true: “ The gentleman making this offer is Mr. Peter Goettman, of Atwood street, Oakland, Pittsburgh.” .... [When a man does do that (tells a lie,) it is ordinarily for a purpose. A man does not often tell a lie unless he has an object in view, and you have a right to consider the fact that in making this statement to Mr. Guffey, Mr. Clever told what was not true. And that has some bearing upon the question of whether or not there was such a contract as Clever now says there was. He said he had a contract with Goettman. That is not true, he says now, but that the contract was with Scarborough.] 17 You will consider that. Then you will ’ look at the details, and consider whether they are reasonable and probable; and 3rou find this fact, that Mr. Goettman, a comparative stranger, a mere acquaintance of Mr. Scar<a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>borough, who has no means whatever according to their story, agreed to raise twenty thousand dollars and pay it over to Clever, Scarborough’s father-in-law, as a bonus for a lease of Clever’s property. Is that reasonable ? Is it reasonable that Mr. Goettman would do that without any security, without any arrangement as to rate of interest, as to how and when he should be paid?- And then, afterwards, that ten thousand dollars should be paid over to Mrs. Scarborough, the wife of the man who was getting Goettman to raise the money to pay to Clever?</p>

    <p id="b583-9" data-blocks='[["BL_583.9",583,[145,968,1168,909]]]'>This was stated to be an “ action in trespass for damages by fraud.” A. P. Clever, one of the appellants, owned two pieces of land, one of fifty acres, the other of 179¿- acres. In the year 1888 he leased the fifty-acre lot, for oil and gas purposes, to Gamier and Smith. They assigned this lease to J. M. Guffey, the plaintiff, on December 4, 1888. The lease contained this clause: “ And, in case oil or gas is found on said premises as aforesaid, then the said parties of the second part shall have the refusal, for the term of three months, of the other lands of the said parties of the first part lying in the same location, on terms for the lease thereof that may be equal to the best terms offered by any other person or persons therefor.” On Februuary 12,1889, Clever and Guffey made a written supplement to this lease, based on a new consideration, by which the time was extended for completing the first well and the oil royalties were increased, in which they declare that the original lease then owned by Guffey “ shall remain in full force in all particulars in which the same is not hereby modified.”</p>
    <p id="b583-10" data-blocks='[["BL_583.10",583,[146,1885,1170,556]],["BL_584.1",584,[294,410,1162,146]]]'>Guffey was successful in finding oil on the fifty-acre tract, and on April 23,1889, notified Clever in writing that he elected to take a lease of the 179£ acres, “ on terms for the lease thereof that may be equal to the best terms offered by any other person or persons therefor.” In reply to this offer, Clever notified Guffey that he had been offered twenty thousand dollars for a lease of the property referred to; whereupon Guffey took the lease at that price and paid the money. Subsequently he learned that the1 offer to Clever of twenty thousand dollars was not bona fide, and that the best real offer he had received was ten thousand dollars. This suit was then brought to recover dam<a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>ages for the deceit, and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for the difference between the offer of ten thousand dollars and the amount paid by Guffey.</p>
    <p id="b584-6" data-blocks='[["BL_584.6",584,[292,565,1164,193]]]'>The verdict was abundantly sustained by the evidence, and we find nothing in the numerous specifications to indicate error on the part of the learned judge below, in the manner of submitting the case to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b584-7" data-blocks='[["BL_584.7",584,[287,767,1167,795]]]'>The position that the assignment of the lease did not carry with it the option to Guffey cannot be sustained, in view of the fact of the new agreement between Clever and Guffey, which especially recognized the lease and provided for its continuance in every particular. Nor do we see any error in the ruling of the court upon the measure of damages. If ten thousand dollars was the highest bona-fide offer received by Clever, Guffey was entitled to the lease at* that price. If, therefore, he had been induced by the artifice and fraud of Clever to pay twenty thousand dollars, he was entitled to a verdict for the difference between those sums. In view of this, the learned judge was clearly right in rejecting the evidence of the value of the lease, as bearing upon the question of the damages. Whether its intrinsic value was much or little, Guffey was entitled to have it for ten thousand dollars, and he had been compelled to pay double that sum.</p>
    <p id="b584-8" data-blocks='[["BL_584.8",584,[287,1581,1164,499]]]'>The contention that the plaintiff could not recover without having made a tender of the return of the lease, is fully met by Heastings v. McGee, <a href="/pa/66/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="66 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="432344" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0384-01">66 Pa. 384</a>, where it was held that “ where the vendor of personal property makes fraudulent representations, or is otherwise guilty of fraud in the contract, the vendee may stand to the bargain and recover damages, or may rescind the contract and recover the money paid.” Here the vendee elected to stand by his contract, and recover back the money which he paid by means of the fraud. That he had a right to do so is clear upon all the authorities.</p>
