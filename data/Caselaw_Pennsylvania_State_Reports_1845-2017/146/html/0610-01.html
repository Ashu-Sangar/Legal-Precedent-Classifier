Dr. Everson, the attending physician, testified for the plaintiff that the witness was called to attend the deceased, on the afternoon or evening of October 26th, and found him vomiting, complaining of being chilly, and exhibiting symptom? of bronchitis, but none of pneumonia; that the bronchitis had evidently been caused by exposure to the cold; that, on the next day, the patient was slightly better, but on the third day, symptoms of pneumonia appeared, and this disease developed and became acute, finally causing his death on November 2d ; that the pneumonia-might have resulted from exposure to cold, but that the medical authorities regarded it as an unsettled question whether pneumonia is so caused, and it would be impossible to say whether the cause, in the present case, was the exposure the deceased had undergone on the evening of October 25th, “ because the pneumonia did not immediately follow the exposure; there were some days between the exposure and the pneumonia.” Three other physicians, called by the plaintiff, testified that exposure to wet and cold is generally the exciting cause of pneumonia, though it may and sometimes does result from entirely different causes; that this view was in accordance with the best medical authorities upon the subject, and that, upon the facts which had been testified to respecting the exposure, sickness and death of the deceased, they would attribute the pneumonia to the exposure.</p>

You will separate the two questions. It is not necessary that the death be the immediate result of drinking; as, for instance, the case of Fink y. Garman, a leading case in this state, where the husband, a man of intemperate habits, was given drink, and afterwards, under the influence of that and other drink furnished from other places, he fell off his wagon and the wheel ran over him, and some time thereafter he died. He did not die from the drink directly, but the jury found that was the proximate cause. There is a case from this county, also, that went to the Supreme Court, where liquor was given to a young man under age until he was, as the jury found, very seriously drunk; and he lay out at night exposed, and died a considerable time thereafter, and there was a recovery. The giving of the liquor was not the direct cause, but it was the proximate cause. It must be the cause from which the jury can trace (the injury) as a natural and not improbable consequence of the intoxication; otherwise it is not a cause of action.] 3.....</p>

Dr. Everson was called in, on the evening or afternoon of Saturday, and found him with a “ high temperature and rapid pulse,” I think he said, and complaining about being chilly. He found acute bronchitis. The next day, there were symptoms similar, and on the third morning, when he called, he found decided symptoms of pneumonia, that increased until his death in the short time stated. You will recollect his testimony. [Now, Dr. Everson said it was a matter uncertain among the authorities as to whether exposure to wet and cold caused pneumonia. In that he stands alone, among the four doctors called. The others say that it is recognized as a frequent and the most common exciting cause of pneumonia. That pneumonia can be caused, and is caused by other things than exposure to cold or wet, is not in dispute, and no person will pretend that exposure to wet and cold necessarily leads to pneumonia. It does not; but the weight of testimony in number of doctors (and the credibility is for you, and most of you have some knowledge on the subject in addition), is that it is the most frequent cause of pneumonia.] 4</p>

I would myself have a very decided opinion on the question ; but it is for the jury to say whether this falling in the ditch and exposure was the natural consequence of being drunk or under the influence of liquor, and whether that was the proximate cause of this man’s death.

If so, then they are responsible for the consequences of giving him that liquor. If he was a man of intemperate habits, when they gave him drink, at all, they took the risk of the consequences. Now, giving him drink or having him drunk ten days before, if he was thoroughly sober the day before, could not be made the proximate cause of this injury. Bear that in mind.

    <p id="b641-10" data-blocks='[["BL_641.10",641,[190,1430,1166,910]]]'>The important question upon the trial below was, whether the liquor furnished Robert Davies by the appellants was the proximate cause of his death. This was a question of fact which could not have been withdrawn from the jury in the face of the evidence. There was testimony on the part of the plaintiff tending to prove that Robert Davies left defendants’ saloon on Friday night, October 25, 1889, very much intoxicated, in part, at least, the result of liquor furnished by them; that he was obliged to lean upon the arm of Frederick Turnbull, being unable to walk alone; that, when about half-way home, Davies fell and rolled into the gutter, becoming satura'ted with mud and water; that Turnbull, who was helping him home, was unable to get him out of the gutter, Davies being a large and heavy man, and went to seek help, leaving him lying in the water; that, when finally he was lifted out of the gutter and taken home, he was thoroughly chilled, and put to bed about midnight ; that he was taken with an attack of pneumonia, of which he died in a few days.</p>

But the liquor was <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>undoubtedly the proximate cause of his falling into the gutter and the consequent exposure, and it was for the jury to find whether the attack of pneumonia was the result of the exposure; in other words, a continuous causation from .the furnishing of the liquor. The jury may or may not have made a mistake. We have no means of intelligently deciding this question, nor is it our province to do so. It was peculiarly for the jury; and their verdict ends the matter, unless the court below committed some error in submitting it. This we do not find. The only specifications are to the charge of the court, and we fail to see any misdirection in any of the extracts contained therein. The contention that the voluntary taking of liquor by the deceased, while intoxicated, and being at the time of known intemperate habits, was such contributory negligence on his part as would prevent a recovery by the plaintiff, will not bear examination. Such a ruling would practically destroy the act of assembly. Every drunkard not only takes liquor voluntarily, but whenever he can get it; and because of his weakness the law makes the saloon keeper responsible for selling to such persons. He has not the will-power to resist the temptation, and for this reason the sale to him is forbidden.</p>
