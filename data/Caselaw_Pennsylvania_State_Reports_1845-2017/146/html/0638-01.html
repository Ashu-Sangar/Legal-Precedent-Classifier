The petition did not aver that any notice of the enactment of the ordinance of February 22,1875, was given, as required by paragraph VIII., § 3, act of April 3, 1851, P. L. 323; did not show when or for how long the ordinance of April 1,1890, was published in the Pittsburgh Press, and did not aver that any publication of the latter ordinance was made by bills posted in said borough: See paragraph IV., § 3, of said act.</p>

On September 29th, Hugh M. Bole and Mary Ann Bole filed exceptions, on the ground of want of notice <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>to the exceptants of the proposition to open Taylor Avenue, and of the meeting of viewers.</p>

On January 29th, exceptions to the supplemental report of the viewers were filed by N. W. Shafer and others, raising the same objections as to notice that were raised by the exceptions to the original report, and specifying also, inter alia, that the petition did not show affirmatively “ that Taylor Avenue was ever laid out on the ground or otherwise as now opened; ” that the order of September 1, 1890, confirming the original report nisi thirty days, was improvident, and the confirmation should have been nisi the next term; that the order of November 26, 1890, referring the report back to the viewers, was improvidently made, their duties having previously ceased; and that the viewers should have filed a complete report during <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>the first week of the December Term.

    <p class="summary" id="b665-6" data-blocks='[["BL_665.6",665,[142,750,1169,607]]]'>It nowhere appears in the record that personal notice was given to persons directly interested in the opening of said avenue, either of the ordinance of 1875, or that of 1890 upon which this proceeding is based; nor was personal notice given of the meeting of the viewers to assess the damages. This, I think, is a fatal defect, unless exceptant has estopped himself from setting it up, in some way. While it may be that personal notice of the view was not required under the act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 525, I think it clear without deciding that question, that it should appear from some source that personal notice was given to the resident owners of property, before the report of the viewers should be confirmed.</p>

But, as the report was referred back to the viewers to report to this term, without qualification, I am led to understand that the matter still stands open for all exceptions which may be made to the entire proceedings. I am inclined to think that [notice, required by the act of 1851, should be given, both as to the ordinance and view;] 8 but, however that may be, I am of opinion that [personal notice of the ordinance, at least, must be given, and also of any proposition to fix, regulate, etc., the roads and streets of the borough, to all persons directly interested therein.] 1</p>
