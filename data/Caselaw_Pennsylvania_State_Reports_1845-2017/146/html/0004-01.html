Mr. Brundred said he didn’t see that there would be any question about that; that he had no doubt the Titus-ville people would be willing to give us an order on him for the material, and that could be easily fixed. I was in Oil City March 7th. Mr. Brundred told me that he had sent an order in the latter part of February to the Titusville Iron Works for one still; and that on the sixth of March, the day before I got there, he had closed with them for a couple more, and that he thought he would give them an order for another the day after-wards.
