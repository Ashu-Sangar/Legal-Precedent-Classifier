They then proceeded to mine the coal, and took out all the coal under the land. The pit-mouth and trestle were not used for any other purpose than the taking out of coal from the land of the plaintiffs. Whether they were necessary for that purpose, was disputed.

The defendants claimed in your hearing that this deed did not constitute all of their contract; that they had an agreement beforehand that gave them certain rights not included in the deed. Plaintiffs’ counsel objected to that, and stated that the agreement was merged in the deed, and we sustain the objection. We think the deed is what both parties must stand by, and that which the court will stand by; and we interpret this deed to mean that the McGowans conveyed all the coal finder that farm. [The court read a description of the property from the deed.] That deed standing alone, without explanation, conveys all the coal there may be under that entire farm, merchantable or otherwise, so that the plaintiffs cannot claim to be paid for that which they say they sold, and which their deed conveys, and there is no allowance to be made for the alleged going over the crop line.

According to the testimony there was a spring at one end of the farm, about seventy-three feet above the coal, and that spring has been destroyed, has stopped running. Now, we think there is no evidence that would justify us in submitting .any question of damage on that account. The plaintiffs sold the coal, all the coal in their farm, and it was under this spring. The possibility of the coal being mined from under the farm and then leaving the spring intact, is so slight and uncertain, that we <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>doubt whether any evidence could be adduced in any case that would justify the court in submitting to the jury a question of damages for the loss of a spring, but clearly there is no such evidence in this case.

It seems that in 1883 a pit-mouth was opened, and about three hundred feet of a trestle work was run over the low land of the plaintiffs to connect with other property of O’Neil, to take out the coal. When the defendants conveyed this coal, if a right of way over the land was necessary to get the coal out, they conveyed it as a consequence of their conveyance of the coal. Mr. McGowan says that O’Neil could have got his own coal by another route ; how, he did not undertake to say. There was no explanation of how it could be done that I recollect; nor can I see, either, how the court or jury could well find from the testimony whether or not there was a practicable way; but, if there was a reasonable way for him to get it without doing this, then the plaintiffs had a right to object to him putting it there, and have the right to recover reasonable damages or compensation ; but if you find that, before this trestle was built or at the time, they were notified of it, that they consented to it by allowing them to do it, stood by and saw it built and used without any objection, then the jury is at liberty to and should infer that it was a necessary right of way which came from selling the coal; and if it was not, if you can find from the testimony that there was any damage, you will find it in favor of the plaintiffs on that branch of the case.] 3</p>

Plaintiffs sold the coal, and the defendants, the owners, had the right to take the coal out, and to take it all out, only providing that they were bound to support the surface from falling. They may do it by leaving the coal in, or they may do it with some artificial support; but the rule of law is this, that where the fee in land is separate, one party owning one part or stratum, and another <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>what is underneath, the lower stratum owes support to that portion which is above it; the owner cannot let it down, but must leave the necessary supports. It is not necessar}r for us to discuss the reasons or propriety of this rule. The Supreme Court have settled that, the first case arising in this county, and the rule is well settled. If they let down the surface by mining, by taking out the supports, they are liable for damages caused by the letting down of the surface, whatever those damages may be. The testimony is uncontradicted that portions of the surface have been let down ; just how much, the witnesses differ upon.....But, of course, you will take into consideration Avhat these witnesses saj’-, and render the verdict that you think the testimony warrants, in regard to the amount of damages that plaintiffs have sustained. It would seem that a portion of the damage caine perhaps three years ago, and a portion of it is recent.

The agreement in question certainly does not come within the first exception ; every right granted was to be conveyed by the deed. Nor does it come within the second exception, so far as concerns the rights and privileges to be exercised in the taking out of the plaintiffs’ coal, for these are not collateral to the grant of the coal. If the covenants, in so far as they relate to the running of “ any other coal,” were collateral, the answer to the defendants’ position is (a) that no question as to other coal was raised in this case, and (b) the right to run other coal was not a right appurtenant to this coal, and therefore could not pass by the sheriff’s deed to the defendants, not having been specifically conveyed.</p>

At all events, however, the judge so charged the jury with regard to the pit-mouth and trestle, that the rejection of the agreement could do defendants no harm. He instructed them that the deed carried the right of way over the surface, if it was necessary to get the coal out, and that there was no evidence he recollected of, that it could be gotten out in any other way.</p>

On the other hand, in view of the strong charge against us on the question of right of way, we could have recovered a larger verdict if the agreement had been admitted, as we would then have been allowed compensation for coal mined outside the courses and distances of the deed. And from the beginning to tbe end of this case there was no claim for damages by reason of the drawing of pillars in the future. The language of the charge respecting damage “ likely to be suffered,” had reference to testimony showing that more surface would fall by reason of the removal of pillars which had already been drawn.</p>

    <p id="b602-6" data-blocks='[["BL_602.8",602,[273,1089,1171,910]]]'>In the case of Close v. Zell, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20Pa.%20890" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="141 Pa. 890">141 Pa. 890</a>, we considered with care the subject of the merger of stipulations, whether in writing or verbal, in contracts for the sale of lands, followed by deeds in pursuance thereof from which the stipulations thereof were omitted. In that particular case we held that a parol stipulation by the vendor of land, to refund the purchase money in the event of a failure of title and to reimburse the vendee for any costs and expenses incurred, was not merged in a deed containing a covenant of special warranty, but no covenant of title, afterward accepted by the vendee in consideration thereof. It was the absence of the omitted stipulation from the deed, or from the implied operation of the covenants which the deed did contain, that entitled the omitted stipulation to consideration independent of the deed, as a source of legal obligation. The various phases of the subject, as illustrated by the cases cited in the opinion, were considered at some length. It is not necessary to repeat here the reasoning contained in the opinion. We think the present case comes clearly within the decision.</p>
    <p id="b602-7" data-blocks='[["BL_602.9",602,[274,2006,1163,299]]]'>While the deed from the plaintiffs to O’Neil is not printed in either of the paper-books, and we therefore cannot contrast it with the origiual articles of agreement for the sale, it is stated by the court and counsel that the deed to O’Neil did not contain that provision of the articles, or any substitute for it, which is expressed in the articles in the following words, viz.:</p>

    <p id="b603-6" data-blocks='[["BL_603.6",603,[151,618,1168,604]]]'>We assume that there are no covenants in the deed which take the place of or supply the omitted clause of the articles. We will not now undertake to determine the importance of this omitted clause of the oi'iginal agreement to the defendants. As it contains, among other things, the grant of a right to run other coal than such as might be mined on the land, it is manifest that it does, or may, embrace consequences and rights which do not follow from a subsequent deed which merely conveys the coal on the land. We are clearly of opinion that the original agreement of May 7,1866, between the McGowans and O’Neil was competent testimony, and should have been admitted in evidence. This sustains the first assignment of error.</p>

It is difficult to see, however, in the specific language of the court, anything of which the defendant can complain. The court told the jury that, if the way were necessary to get out the coal, the right to it passed by the grant, and also, that if the plaintiffs stood by and saw the defendants building and using the trestle without objection, they might and ought to infer that it was a necessary right of way. All this was favorable to the defendants. But the court added, if it was not a necessary right of way and the jury could find there was any damage, they should find in favor of the plaintiffs. This, of course, ignored the effect of the articles, and if they were properly out of the case, the charge would be correct. We have held, however, that it was error to disregard the articles which expressly conferred the right in question.</p>
