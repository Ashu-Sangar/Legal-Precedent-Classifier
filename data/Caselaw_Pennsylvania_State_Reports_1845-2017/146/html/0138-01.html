      <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>It is contended by the appellees that the legal effect of compliance with the order, made at the instance of the plaintiff, was satisfaction of his execution. The money was and still is within his grasp whenever he chooses to take it out of court. Whether the judgment should have been satisfied or transferred to those who were equitably entitled to subrogation, was a question for the court, and not for the plaintiff. In the absence of evidence tending to show anything to the contrary, it must be assumed that the only legitimate o.bject the plaintiff could have had in levying on the land in portions of which appellees had acquired an interest, was the collection of his debt. If he had any other lawful purpose to subserve, it was incumbent on him to show it. As a condition precedent to the intervention of appellees for the protection of their interest in the land, he insisted on their being required to pay into court the full amount of his claim. An order to that effect was accordingly made and promptly complied with. The money paid into court, at the instance of the plaintiff and for his use, represented his entire claim; and, while it was not actually paid to him in person, the transaction was tantamount to payment.' It was there for him to take whenever he chose to receive it. It is not even alleged that, by virtue of the judgment, he had or could have any further claim against the defendant therein, or any one else. In view of the undisputed facts, and independently of the provisions of the act insisted on by appellant, the final decree requiring him to assign the judgment was the logical sequence of the position in which he voluntarily placed himself by successfully demanding that the full amount of his claim should be paid into court. The assignments of error are not sustained.</p>
