The plaintiff testified that, while in the sheriff’s office, he said to Mr. Robb that if a bond of indemnity were required by the sheriff, Mr. Corbett would sign it, and to call on him, and Mr. Corbett then tendered his services if needed; but, whether this <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>conversation was heard by the clerk, the defendant was unable to say.

A part of the goods being claimed by Carson’s wife, and a part by his daughter, the sheriff subsequently applied to the Court of Common Pleas No. 1 of Allegheny county, and obtained a rule for an interpleader; but the rule, on motion of plaintiff’s counsel, was dismissed on the ground that that court had no jurisdiction of an interpleader under a testatum fieri facias coming into the hands of the sheriff from the Court of Common Pleas of another county.

Commonwealth, the court lay special stress upon the effect of the return. But the court was applying the principle to the case before it, and in the same connection, says: “ The danger of collusion between the officer and the defendant, marks the wisdom of the rule. The sheriff is bound to execute his writ, saving only when he adopts the means furnished for his security, and which do not injure or defeat the creditor.” In that case, the court cites Hall v. Galbraith, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.%20220" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 W. 220">8 W. 220</a>, in which no stress seems to be laid upon the fact that the return showed a levy, and in which the court says : “ It is of no sort of consequence in whom the right of property is, as that cannot be tried in. the action against the constable. It was to prevent collusion between the constable and the defendant, that the act fixes the constable for the debt, unless he pursues the course pointed out by the law.” The <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>same principles were held, in Commonwealth v.

Hunt, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Pa.%2051" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="14 Pa. 51">14 Pa. 51</a>.0, the return was, “Returned for want of sufficient indemnification.” It was in proof that defendant, a constable, had said that he had levied, and further, that a bond of indemnity had been given and accepted by him. The court says: “ He is compelled, on his part, to proceed to a sale of the goods, and must look to his bond for indemnity. The constable is estopped from showing that the goods belonged to another person. As between the plaintiff and the constable, it must be taken to be the property of the defendant in the execution.” There is a line of cases which seem to limit the rule established by the foregoing decisions, but in no case has the rule been doubted or expressly qualified.</p>

The sheriff had levied on personal property, which was left in possession of the defendant, with consent of plaintiff, and the sheriff so returned. It is clear that if it had not been for the consent of the plaintiff, and the action had been against the sheriff, it would have fallen within the rule of Miller v. Commonwealth. In Hunt v.

The sheriff levied upon the property referred to, but subsequently becom<a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>ing satisfied that Carson was not the owner, he abandoned the levy and returned his vrat nulla bona.

L. 35, entitled “ An Act entitling married wo'men to the benefit of their separate earnings; ” and that the horses, wagon, and household furniture, levied on by the sheriff in this case, were her separate property, bought and paid for with her money.

The offer was to prove that his return was true; that the defendant in the execution had no goods upon which he could levy, and that the property which was pointed out to the sheriff as the property of said defendant was in fact the property of some one else. It would certainly be a severe rule to hold that when a sheriff is sued for making a false return he could not show that his return was true. This is precisely what we are asked to do in this case. The learned judge based his ruling upon Miller v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/5/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="5 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="953538" data-case-paths="/pa/5/0294-01">5 Pa. 294</a>. It is true, there was an offer to prove in that case that the goods levied upon did not belong to the defendant in the execution, which offer was rejected by the court below and affirmed here. But in that case the sheriff had returned a levy, and the rejected offer was simply to contradict his own return. After having returned to the court that he had “ levied on a horse, wagon, sleigh, and clock,” the property of the defendant in the execution, he certainly had no right to show that said property belonged to some one else. His mouth was closed by his official return. As was said by Justice Coulter, in that case: “ Thus, when he returns, goods levied, with a schedule, he assumes the responsibility that they belong to the defendant; and he will afterwards, as a general rule, be estonped from denying that <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>they were such.” Where the sheriff returns a levy upon personal property, it is a satisfaction of the judgment pro tanto, and there is every reason, in good sense and public policy, why he should not be allowed to contradict his return. In the case in hand, there was no return of a levy; the return was, as before stated, nulla bona; and the single question is whether he can show that his return was true.</p>
    <p id="b379-5" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[150,782,1168,1271]]]'>It was contended, however, that the sheriff was fixed because he had made an actual levy. It was true that certain goods had been pointed out to him as the property of the defendant in the execution, and#he had levied upon them. But was this an official declaration on his part that they did belong to the defendant? At that time he had no personal knowledge in regard to the ownership, except the plaintiff’s statement. If that statement was not true, if the property did not belong to the defendant, if the plaintiff had deceived him in this regard, was he bound to go on and sell, or return a levy, when he knew the property belonged to some other person ? Where the sheriff hás a reasonable doubt, and the property is claimed by' a third person, he may demand indemnity, and if it is refused, he may decline to levy and sell and apply to the court for relief: Spangler v. Commonwealth, 16 S. &amp; R. 68. And the inter-pleader act provides a remedy by which the sheriff may be protected in cases of doubt. But where he is in no doubt; where he knows the property pointed out belongs to a stranger, is he bound upon the penalty of his official bond to proceed ? It is true, if he does not, he takes the risk; that is, he acts as a judge in his. own case. Yet, does he incur any further penalty than to be mulcted in damages in case it turns out that he was mistaken ? May he not show, in support of his return of nulla bona, that in point of fact the defendant in the execution had no goods upon which he could levy ?</p>

This the <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>court refused, and this court, through Justice Kennedy, sustained the refusal in a very emphatic manner.

    <p id="b380-6" data-blocks='[["BL_380.6",380,[265,567,1166,501]]]'>“ It would certainly have been a most palpable error in the court, if it had affirmed the proposition advanced by the plaintiffs’ counsel on this point. It would, in effect, have been declaring that it was the duty of the sheriff to do' an illegal act, because the plaintiffs had offered to indemnify him if he did so; for surely it cannot be seriously alleged that it would not be an illegal act and a most glaring violation of law, in- a sheriff to seize and sell, knowingly, the property of a stranger or third person, under an execution, who was nowise liable for the payment of the debt or money thereby directed to be levied......</p>
    <p id="b380-7" data-blocks='[["BL_380.7",380,[266,1075,1167,797]]]'>The sheriff, it is true, is bound to take property, when pointed out to him by the plaintiff in the execution as belonging to the defendant, if it be his in fact, though it may be doubtful at the time whether it is so or not, if the plaintiff offers to indemnify him. And if he should refuse in such case, after an indemnity offered, to proceed against the property under an execution, and the plaintiff, in a suit brought against the sheriff for not having so proceeded, should show clearly that the defendant in the execution was the owner of it at the time, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover; but not otherwise. So that the sheriff, if he refuses to take and sell the property, after being offered an indemnity by the plaintiff, takes the risk and responsibility upon himself of showing, if sued afterwards by the plaintiff, that the property did not belong to the defendant named in the execution; and this is the most that can be claimed of him.”</p>

The criticism that it applies to a case of stocks is without merit. The decision is placed upon a broad ground that applies equally to other species of property.

It is competent, however, for him to show that the property pointed out to him was the property of a stranger. In other words, he may show his return to be true, for, if true, the plaintiff in the execution has sustained no injury.</p>
