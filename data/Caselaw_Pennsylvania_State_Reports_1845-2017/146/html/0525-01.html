Under § 3, article Y. of the constitution, limiting the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, in cases of injunction, to cases where a corporation is defendant, said court has no original jurisdiction of a bill to restrain county officers from carrying into execution the ballot act of June 19, 1891, P.
