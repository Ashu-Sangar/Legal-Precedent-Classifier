I think he alluded to my sister, I would not be positive about that, but anyhow I got the money and brought it down; and he had no mortgage there, and I told him I would have to have some paper to show that I had left the money, and he told me he was perfectly good for the money, and I told him if he took a mortgage that it would have to be double the amount of the money, and he said he would take care of her money for one per cent of the interest. Q. Did he say how much land was in this place ? A. He told me three hundred acres, and it was worth from seventy-five thousand dollars to one hundred thousand dollars. Q. Then the second time you came back did you have the money? A. Yes, sir, I had eight thousand dollars, I think. Q. Did you give it to Mr. Gilpin? A. Yes, sir. Q.

I think the last time I discoursed with him was, maybe, the spring of the year he died, I think in 1881 or 1882. I spoke to him when the property was sold, and I thought my sister was cheated out of it, and I said he ought to get it for her ; and when she came home from Ireland I was down, and I said my sister will need her money, now that she is home she will need it to buy a house ; and he says, I can get the money for her any .time, the property is worth twice as much as the money.
