He is not entitled to the oil drained from his other- lands, for the master has found that the purpose of the restriction in Mrs. Schmitz’s deed was not for the purpose of protecting these lands from drainage by a well on this lot. Oil is a mineral ferse naturae, and is part of the land and belongs to its owner only so long as it is in the land and under his control; and, as soon as the oil left the land of the plaintiff and flowed on or into the lot of Mrs. Schmitz, it belonged to her, unless some contract or covenant existed between the plaintiff and her by which this rule of property in oil in situ was inoperative.

They had completed a well on the leasehold which was producing; and the oil in situ was in their possession, and when brought to the surface and placed in the pipe lines, one eighth belonged to the plaintiff and seven eighths to them. When Gibson &amp; Giles had drilled their well to the oil-producing sand, and it began to flow, they from that moment were in possession of all the oil in the land covered by their lease; and if the six hundred barrels of oil, which the master found the Schmitz well captured from territory belonging to the plaintiff, had been captured and brought to the surface by Gibson &amp; Giles, the plaintiff in the pipe line would have gotten only one eighth thereof. In other words, the oil in place belonged to Gibson &amp; Giles, and in the pipe lines they owned seven times as much of it as the plaintiff. If Gibson &amp; Giles owned all the oil drained from this lot, then they should have been the plaintiffs, so far as any damage to it is concerned.

In the latter, the learned president of the Common Pleas has very carefully considered and correctly disposed of all the questions presented. The decree complained of requires no further vindication, and it is accordingly affirmed on his opinion.</p>

    <p id="b265-12" data-blocks='[["BL_265.13",265,[168,1874,1164,398]]]'>The learned master came to the conclusion that, by reason of defendants’ violation of the restriction contained in the deed to Mrs. Schmitz, the plaintiff was damaged to the extent of seven hundred and thirty-two dollars; and, in the form of decree recommended by him, he accordingly inserted a clause requiring them to pay that sum to the plaintiff. The court, having reached a different conclusion, refused to decree the payment of any damages, and hence this appeal.</p>

    <p id="Agl" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[263,745,1163,552]]]'>In view of plaintiff’s failure to establish these allegations, the court held that he was not entitled to an account for the oil taken out of the Schmitz lot, because, under his deed to Mrs. Schmitz, it belonged to defendants, and not to him. Nor was he entitled to an account for the oil drained from his other lands, because, as the. master found, the restriction in the Schmitz deed was not for the purpose of protecting those lands from drainage by a well on the Schmitz lot. For these and other-reasons, which fully appear in the opinion of the court, we think there was no error in holding that appellants were not entitled to a decree for the damages claimed.</p>
