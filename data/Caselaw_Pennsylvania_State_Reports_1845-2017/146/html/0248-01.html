It is true that the enactment of the first section is broader than the title, and so far as the power conferred on town councils to “ limit the compensation ” for the use of hacks, etc., is concerned, it must be held to be unconstitutional. But, striking this out of the first section, it leaves the enactment the same as expressed in the title of the act, and hence not repugnant to the clause of the constitution which provides that the title of an act shall clearly express the subject thereof: § 3, article III. Neither do we think the act repugnant to § 6, article III. of the constitution; for it does not revive, amend, extend or confer the provisions of an existing law. It is a supplement of the act of 1851, and. simply adds one more power to the many already conferred on the corporate officers of a borough.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b276-6" data-blocks='[["BL_276.6",276,[247,605,1164,701]]]'>The second section, in its provision that the license tax shall be collected as other licenses, taxes, fines and penalties are now authorized by law to be collected, cannot all stand, because taxes and fines and penalties are not collected in the same way, but in á totally different way. To say that a license tax shall be collected as taxes are collected, and to say that a license shall be collected as fines and penalties are collected, is to prescribe two ways of collecting the license tax which are irreconcilably repugnant. And, as but one way of collecting the license tax was evidently intended to be pointed out, the rule is to take the last way pointed out; that is, the license tax is to be collected as fines and penalties are collected, before a justice of the peace under § 7, act of April 15, 1885: Packer v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/19/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="19 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="970541" data-case-paths="/pa/19/0211-01">19 Pa. 211</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b276-7" data-blocks='[["BL_276.7",276,[243,1318,1164,1008]]]'>But, even if § 2 were to be stricken from the act, because of the objections that have been urged against it, still we are of the opinion that the license could be collected by the borough from the defendant, on an implied promise. If the borough had the power under the first section of the act of 1889, as we think it had, to enact the ordinance in question, and that ordinance required the defendant to pay a license of three dollars for his one-horse wagon, and a license of five dollars for his two-horse wagon, if he used them for hire, and he did use them for hire, the law implies a promise on his part to pay the eight dollars, and they can be recovered by the borough in an action of debt before a justice of the peace, if no other remedy is provided. This doctrine is sustained by Stockwell v. United States, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Wall.%20542" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="13 Wall. 542">13 Wall. 542</a>. In that case, an act of congress imposed a tariff on certain imported goods, and provided no way to collect it. The importer refused to pay, and the Supreme Court held that an action of debt by the United States against-the importer, would lie upon his implied promise to pay the tariff when he imported the goods, upon the “ principle that every person will obey the will of the legislature.”</p>

There is nothing either in the title or in the body of the act that offends against any provision of the constitution. The title gives to all persons interested ample notice of the subject of the act; quite sufficient, at least, to lead them to an inquiry into the body of the bill. Nothing more than that is required: Allegheny Co. Home’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20Pa.%2080" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="77 Pa. 80">77 Pa. 80</a>. The power given in the body of the act to limit compensation, etc., cannot be regarded as a distinct subject from that clearly expressed in the title. On the contrary, it is germane to that subject and hence the act is not in conflict with § 3, article III., of the constitution: Millvale Borough v. Railway Co., <a href="/pa/131/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="131 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="810262" data-case-paths="/pa/131/0001-01">131 Pa. 1</a>.</p>
