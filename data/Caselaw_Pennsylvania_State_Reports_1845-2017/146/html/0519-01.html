Pittsburgh, the point of delivery, and defendant was to receive for his services whatever price he could obtain above the bill price and freight. Defendant was to build up a trade for and dispose of said goods to retail dealers in said articles in said city of Pittsburgh and vicinity. In other words, said goods were sent by said plaintiffs into the said state of Pennsylvania, not to be used or consumed therein by defendant, but to be sold to retail dealers who would dispose thereof in small parcels to and among the • people of said state, in violation of the act of assembly aforesaid; wherefore, this defendant says that he is advised and believes that the several transactions sued on in this ease were illegal, and that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover therefor.</p>

This agreement Avas made originally Avith the firm of Caskey &amp; Keally, of which affiant was a member, and after the death of Mr. Caskey about two years ago, Avas continued and renewed with affiant, Avho on his part complied with the terms thereof until about January 24, 1891, when said plaintiffs, in violation of their said agreement and without any just cause or excuse, took said exclusive agency away from him and thereby deprived affiant of large gains and profits; that afterwards, about February 7,1891, defendant met the plaintiffs in the city of Chicago, and it was mutually agreed between them that all matters should be com<a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>promised and adjusted between them on the following terms : Plaintiffs were to make a deduction on their bill of fifty per cent, and were to make out a bill showing exactly how their account stood, and send it to affiant at Pittsburgh, which they have never done. This deduction was agreed to be for such damages as defendant had sustained from January 24,1891, by reason of the breach of said agreement, and would be likely to sustain until plaintiffs could put themselves in position to restore the aforesaid agreement, and also was to cover damages on defective goods theretofore shipped to defendant, and in the meantime defendant was to do what business he could in disposing of plaintiff’s manufactures, and was to receive a salary of thirty dollars per week. And it was further agreed that plaintiffs were, as soon as they possibly could, to rescind all agreements they had made with any other parties as to the sale of their goods in Western Pennsylvania. Defendant says that said bargain or arrangement was made upon an adequate consideration, if said transactions are held to be legal, and that there has been no breach thereof by affiant, who has been at all times ready and willing to comply therewith, and no right of action has arisen therein in favor of plaintiffs.”</p>

    <p id="b548-6" data-blocks='[["BL_548.7",548,[232,453,1167,1503]]]'>The contract under which the goods were furnished by the plaintiffs to the defendant was apparently made in Illinois, as the plaintiffs’ place of business was there, and the goods were delivered to a carrier in Chicago, to be carried to Pittsburgh, the freight being payable by defendant. The presumption, therefore, is that the carrier was the defendant’s agent, and there is nothing in the affidavit of defence to rebut this presumption. The element of illegality under the laws of Pennsylvania is therefore out of the case, unless plaintiffs were to do some act here, contrary to law. The agreement is thus stated: “ The goods were to be billed by plaintiffs to defendant at factory prices in the city of Chicago, less five per cent, defendant paying freight at Pittsburgh, the point of delivery; and defendant was to receive for his services whatever price he could obtain above the bill price and freight.” Notwithstanding the ingenious color of agency thus sought to be thrown over it, this is a contract of sale. The defendant was to get the goods at the stipulated rate, and was entitled to receive the full price he could sell them for. What more or less does any purchaser do who buys to sell again ? If he made a profit, it was his; there was no duty to account. If he made a loss, that also was his, for the agreement made no stipulation for recoupment. It was a plain, ordinary case of sale, and carried with it the obligation to pay the agreed price. Knowledge that the purchaser might, or even that he intended to sell the goods contrary to the law of Pennsylvania, could not vitiate a contract made and executed in Illinois. The dominion of the vendor over the subject ceased before there was any violation of the law, and even the purchaser had still the locus poenitentise, and might never violate the law at all.</p>

Plaintiffs, it is said, “ agreed with defendant to give to him the exclusive agencyforthe sale of their goods in western Pennsylvania ; ” and again, “ it was mutually agreed that all matters should be compromised and adjusted between them,” etc. An agreement to’give an agency may sustain an action for a breach; and a compromise of existing claims may be good, consideration for a promise to liquidate a money demand at an agreed amount, or to make it an account stated. But, to be effective, such agree<a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>ments would require proof of facts, not set up in this affidavit. So far as appears in the defendant’s own version, it is no more than a claim for unliquidated, if not merely speculative profits, and an accord without satisfaction. It is not said that the goods were not bought, nor that they were bought on the faith of the agreed agency, and remain unsold by reason of its revocation. In this respect, the case differs entirely from Luddington v. North, <a href="/pa/141/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="141 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="974825" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0184-01">141 Pa. 184</a>.</p>
