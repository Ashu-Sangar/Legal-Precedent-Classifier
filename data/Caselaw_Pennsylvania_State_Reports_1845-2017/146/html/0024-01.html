They had been husband and wife, but were divorced prior to the transaction which was the subject of the prosecution. When they separated, an agreement was made between them that Mrs. Myers should have possession of the child. On July 2, 1890, she was residing with her father, in Clarion county, and had the child, then between two and three years old, at his house. Tra Myers resided in the same county. The other defendant, who was his mother, resided in Venango county. On the day named, two unknown men came to the house of Jessie Myers’ father in a buggy. One of them entered the house on pretence of wishing to sell a book, and after obtaining admission picked up the child and carried it out to the buggy, when the two men drove off with it. The same night, Ira Myers appeared with the child at the house of a neighbor; shortly after, he took it to the house of one D. McKibbin in Clarion county, and left it there under an arrangement that McKibbin’s <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>wife should take care of it for him. He stated tp Mrs. MeKibbin, apparently on another occasion, that “ it was naked and starving, and he had taken it away to have it properly cared for.” Some time in the year 1889, Ira Myers had offered W. M. Myers five hundred dollars if he would go and steal the child, and on being asked what he wanted with the child, replied : “ She is an heir, and I have to have her.” The buggy in which the child was taken away by the two men, had been hired by them at a livery stable in Clarion county. It was found on the morning of July 8d, bj'' its owner, at the residence of Elizabeth Myers in Venango county. She disclaimed having anything to do with hiring it, but on threats that, if the bill for its hire was not paid, some arrests would be made, she paid it. Declarations made by her, to the effect that the child had been brought to her place in a ragged and dirty condition, and that she had bought and made some clothes for it, were shown.</p>

A Mrs. Creidler was called, also, for the defence, and testified that on a morning in July, 1890, said in the commonwealth’s history of the case to be the morning after the taking of the child by the two unknown men, Ira Myers came to the house of the witness in Oil City, Venango county, with the child, which had on a very dirty dress and no shoes, and asked the witness to make some clothes for it; that the witness made two dresses and a skirt for it, and Ira got it a pair of shoes.</p>

    <p id="b53-7" data-blocks='[["BL_53.8",53,[178,1156,1164,349]]]'>The appellant, Ira Myers, and his mother, Elizabeth Myers, together with divers other persons whose names were to the inquest unknown, were indicted for conspiring to “ kidnap, decoy, and carry away a certain child 'under the protection, control, and authority of one Jessie Myers,” and for taking said child, in pursuance of the conspiracy, from the possession of “the said Jessie Myers.”</p>
    <p id="b53-8" data-blocks='[["BL_53.9",53,[179,1513,1166,653]]]'>The case was evidently regarded in the court below as an indictment for a conspiracy to commit the offence described in the ninety-fourth section of the act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 405, and for the commission of the offence in pursuance of the conspiracy. The indictment is defective in several particulars. It does not disclose the name or sex of the child. It does not allege that the child was under the age of ten years, or that the accused intended to deprive its parent or parents, or other persons having the lawful charge of the child, of the possession of it, or to steal any article of apparel, or ornament, or other thing of value or use upon or about its person. An indictment which omits these essential ingredients of the statutory offence should be quashed on motion.</p>
    <p id="b53-9" data-blocks='[["BL_53.10",53,[183,2173,1162,246]],["BL_54.1",54,[267,388,1164,844]]]'>But, turning from the defective indictment to the equally defective proofs offered to sustain it, we find that the appellant is the father of the child, and that the unknown persons assisted him in obtaining, without violence or a breach of the peace, possession of it. It is admitted that an indictment will not lie <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>against him for taking peaceable possession of his own child, nor against them for aiding him in doing so; but it is seriously contended that their agreement with him to render the assistance he sought, constituted a conspiracy to violate the ninety-fourth section of the act to which reference has already been made. A conspiracy entered into to induce and procure other persons to do an act prohibited by statute, is an indictable offence, whether the object is effected or not: Hazen v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/23/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="23 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="974006" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0355-01">23 Pa. 355</a>. And so is a conspiracy to commit an assault and battery: Commonwealth v. Putnam, <a href="/pa/29/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="29 Pa. 296" data-case-ids="982905" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0296-01">29 Pa. 296</a>. A conspiracy to cheat by offering to sell forged foreign bank notes of a denomination the circulation of which is prohibited in this state, is also indictable: Twitchell v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/9/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="9 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="960788" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0211-01">9 Pa. 211</a>. But, the case at bar is not governed by or analogous to the cases cited, because the agreement which is called a conspiracy, was not to violate a penal statute or to commit a common law offence.</p>
    <p id="b54-6" data-blocks='[["BL_54.6",54,[263,1252,1165,995]]]'>The ninety-fourth section of the act of 1860 is not applicable to an effort by a father to obtain peaceable possession of his child, nor to the parties who at his request assist him in effecting his object: Burns v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/129/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="129 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="568020" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0138-01">129 Pa. 138</a>. If he commit an assault and battery, or a breach of the peace in execution of a purpose which is not criminal, he may be indicted and punished for it; and if he conspire with others to commit these offences, as a means of obtaining possession of his child, an indictment for conspiracy will lie against them. But he .may request and accept assistance in securing possession of it, without violating the statute in question, or committing an indictable offence. In such case, neither he nor the parties aiding him can be held as criminals, if unlawful means are not agreed upon or used to accomplish their purpose. • In Burns v. Commonwealth, supra, it was distinctly ruled that Gregory ■and the parties aiding him were not within the purview of the act of 1860 in relation to kidnapping. It is decisive of this case, because there is no material distinction between them, as to the action of the parties or the motives which prompted them.</p>
