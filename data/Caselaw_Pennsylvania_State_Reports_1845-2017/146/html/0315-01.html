      <em>(а) </em>The plaintiff, as administratrix of a deceased member of an Odd Fellows lodge, brought suit against the lodge to recover weekly sick-benefits for a number of years prior to his death.

Caldwell became a member of Mechanics Lodge on February 22, 1868, and continued to be a member thereof, in good standing, until the date of his death, May 7, 1889, his dues and assessments being paid with satisfactory regularity. In 1872, he became afflicted with locomotor ataxia, which paralyzed him, particularly as to his lower limbs, and totally disqualified him for following any occupation. Such incapacity continued until his death; and after 1872, he spent his life, seated in a rolling chair or lying in bed. On March 23, 1872, he was reported sick to the lodge, and thereafter until March, 1874, he received weekly sick benefits. In March, 1874, the lodge advanced to him the sum of two hundred dollars, which was expended in fitting up and stocking a little cigar and confectionery store, thereafter carried on in his name. In the course of about two <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>years, the stock in the store was run down until it was of little value, when his sister' took charge of it, replenishing the stock with money raised by herself, and subsequently enlarging the business, which she carried on in the name of her brother.</p>

The transaction was an experiment, designed for the mutual advantage of Caldwell and the lodge, attended with an indefinite understanding that, if he succeeded with the store in accordance with his hopes, he should not claim the weekly benefits. From the date when the store was established until his death, Caldwell never claimed or demanded the payment of sick benefits from the lodge, although he continued upon the sick list and under the care of the.relief committee until June 27, 1874, when at his own request he was discharged from their care.</p>

Upon his declarations being reported to the lodge, his name was stricken from the sick list, at the meeting held September 19,1885. On November 13,1886, he was again reported sick to the lodge, and when visited by members of the relief committee, in pursuance of said report, he again declared that he was not a beneficiary of the lodge, that he did not desire the relief committee to visit him, and that it was his desire to be reported to the lodge as well.

The section referred to provided that “ should any person feel aggrieved at the action of this lodge for failing to pay benefits that are claimed to be due, such person shall give the lodge notice thereof within thirty days of any such action,” whereupon a commissioner should be appointed to take down fully the testimony of all witnesses and report the same to the lodge; that <em>“ </em>the aggrieved party shall be notified that the subject will be considered at the next meeting of the lodge, at which time the lodge will consider it, when all the evidence in the case shall be read, and the claim be finally determined.” Subsequent sections provided and regulated an appeal to the grand lodge, in case any such claim for benefits should be rejected in whole or in part.

His relatives did not do so for him, and some of them testify that they were unacquainted with the laws of the order and his rights thereunder. It is not denied that he was sick so as to entitle him to benefits, and the claim of the lodge is simply that, because they withheld his benefits, they should now continue to withhold them.</p>

    <p id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[151,500,1165,1777]]]'>William F. Caldwell, whose administratrix filed this bill, became a member of the Mechanics Lodge of Odd Fellows in 1863. He died in 1889. In 1872, he was afflicted with paralysis, and was practically helpless the balance of his life. His condition entitled him to sick benefits, and he received them until March, 1874, when the sum of two hundred dollars was advanced by the lodge, to establish him in a little store. There was no evidence that he gave the lodge a formal release at that time, but it is distinctly found by the master that he never claimed his sick benefits thereafter. He says: “ William F. Caldwell never presented a claim for the benefits in question during his lifetime. No person legally entitled to receive such benefits ever presented a claim therefor to the lodge after his death.” More than this, the master has found that both in 1885 and 1886 Mr. Caldwell was reported sick to the lodge, and, when visited by the members of the relief committee, he declared to them that he was not a beneficiary of the lodge, and requested them to discontinue their visits. When he died in 1889, the usual funeral benefits were paid to his family, from which fact the master argues that the obligation of the lodge still continued, to pay the sick benefits. It is true, by the laws of the order funeral benefits are payable only to such members as are entitled to weekly benefits, but it does not follow that, because a member is entitled to weekly benefits, any such benefits are due to him. The learned master says: “ After November 13, 1886, I find no evidence that W. F. Caldwell ever declined to receive benefits, or made any declaration that he was not a beneficiary, or that he did not desire the relief committee to visit him.” Upon this state of facts, the master constructs a theory that from 1886 to his death in 1889, Mr. Caldwell was entitled to benefits; yet his condition had not changed in any respect from what it had been in 1874, when his store was started with the help of the lodge, since which time he had neither received nor claimed benefits down to 1885 and 1886, when he expressly declined to receive them.</p>
    <p id="b347-6" data-blocks='[["BL_347.6",347,[154,2285,1163,136]],["BL_348.1",348,[281,408,1165,1158]]]'>After Caldwell’s death, his administratrix filed this bill, claiming the sum of $4,722, as weekly benefits from 1874. The master and the court below entered a decree in her favor <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>for $774, with interest from May 7, 1889. From this decree the defendants appealed. To reach this conclusion the master has wholly ignored the constitution and by-laws of the lodge, and the laws of the order of which Caldwell was a member. That they were binding upon him while living, is so plain that I need not stop to cite authority. That they were binding upon his administratrix and his family after his death, is equally clear. It is provided by article IV., § 4, of the constitution of the order, that “ benefits shall not be allowed to members residing within visiting limits of the lodge, until after they have been reported sick or disabled, to the lodge or to the relief committee.” Section 175, Pennsylvania Digest of the Laws of the United Order of Odd Fellows, provides: “ A brother who, when sick or disabled, neglects or refuses to make application for benefits, as required by the by-laws of his lodge, unless prevented by unavoidable circumstances, forfeits his claim thereto.” This is sufficient. The proposition that a sick member of a lodge, who is visited by the relief committee, and declines to be reported as sick, and further declares he is not entitled to benefits, may, years afterward, without any change in his condition, recover arrearages of weekly benefits for all that time, cannot be sustained. Much less, when he has made no such claim, can his representatives do so after his death.</p>
