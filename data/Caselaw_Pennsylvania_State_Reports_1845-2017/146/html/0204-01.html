It is this: “ A failure to complete such well, or to pay said rental, or within ten days thereof, shall render this lease null and void, and can only be renewed by mutual consent.” The object of a forfeiture clause in an oil lease like this, as construed by the Supreme Court, is merely to give the lessor an additional remedy by which he can enforce his rights; he can either collect the payment of this rental by suit, or take possession of his land under the forfeiture clause. Such an interpretation, having been put upon clauses very similar to this, by the Supreme Court, it is our duty to adopt their <em>construction; </em>and we therefore instruct you that this clause does not relieve the defendant company from paying the rental which, under another clause of the lease, was due on the fifth day of August, 1890 ; and if you believe that there was no well drilled on this farm on August 5,1890, and that the three hundred dollars rent then due has not been paid, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover three hundred dollars, with interest from the fifth day of August, 1890, the date when this year’s rental should have been paid.

It was not intended to prove what might be technically called a custom, or usage of trade. If, however, it be a fact that a uniform construction has been established for language such as this, which precludes the idea that either of the contracting parties could have intended to deprive himself of the right of forfeiture by using it, then this fact should have great weight in arriving at the intent of the parties when they made use -of it.</p>

DeWitt, <a href="/pa/130/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="130 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="568976" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0235-01">130 Pa. 235</a>, and Ray v. Gas Co., <a href="/pa/138/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="138 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="11252411" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0576-01">138 Pa. 576</a>. The substance of the language of the covenants in all of them was that upon certain contingencies the lease should be “ null and void,” and the slight variation of the words following makes no difference in their real meaning. • If a lease is “ null and void,” it is not made any more so by provisions that it “ shall be of no effect between the parties,” or “ can only be renewed by mutual consent,” or other merely cumulative phrases of the same meaning. The legal effect of the covenant is feat the forfeiture is for the benefit of the lessor, and at his option, and such effect can only be changed by an express stipulation that the lease shall be voidable at the option of either party, or of the lessee.</p>
    <p id="b235-10" data-blocks='[["BL_235.11",235,[160,1831,1165,503]]]'>The learned judge correctly instructed the jury as to the meaning of the covenant, but also instructed them that it was competent for the parties to make a different agreement at the time, even if only in parol, and left the fact of such agreement to the jury, who have found against the appellant. Such submission did appellant no harm, even if such point was not intended to be raised by the offer of evidence made. If the writing was to stand alone, the verdict must, as matter of law, be directed against appellant, and he was not injured by allowing the jury a chance to find in his favor.</p>

It is no more than an.offer to show a popular misunderstanding of the law. The legal meaning of the language used was plain, and had in fact been declared by this court in Galey v. Kellerman, <a href="/pa/123/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="123 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="967164" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0491-01">supra,</a> before the date of the lease in suit, and it could not be varied by showing a popular error in regard to it. A deed of land to A, to hold for his own use, or as his own property, conveys a life-estate only; and his heir could not support an ejectment on it by showing that people of that neighborhood at that time generally supposed such a deed passed a fee, though no doubt hundreds of witnesses could honestly testify to such belief. If the parties so far participated in the error as to use such language when they meant something different, the instrument may be reformed in accordance with their intent, but this cannot be done by a jury on evidence of a popular error in regard to the law.</p>
