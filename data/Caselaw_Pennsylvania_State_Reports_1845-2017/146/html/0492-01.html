That binds them unless they have shown you some good excuse. In law there is an excuse even where you make an agreement of that kind, but you must satisfy the jury clearly that it is made out. If the extra work is done on the request of the defendant and a promise to pay for it knowing it is extra work, that in law is considered a waiver of having it in writing, but nothing short of that will do. If <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>you make a contract, unless some good reason is shown the law requires you to abide by whatever is put down in black and white. The plaintiff says every bit of this work was ordered by the defendant and his wife, most always both, and always one or the other; that it was specified, and they promised to pay its fair value. On the part of the defendants that is denied just as positively as it is asserted by the witnesses on the other side; they deny that they made any such agreement; alleging that they were standing upon the written agreement, left it all to the contractors. Now, the burden is on the plaintiff to satisfy you of that. If he has not satisfied you of that, then the contractor has no right to these extras. If they did order and promise to pay for them, and they were extras outside of the contract, then what would they be worth ? This agreement does not say they shall be paid what these extras would be worth by themselves; they are to be considered in connection with the rest of the work, whatever proportion that would be. There is not much evidence to satisfy you of what that is, and you will have to determine that as best you can; and whatever their value is the plaintiff would be entitled to.</p>

The plaintiff says he has; he says that the defendants would not do anything at all. The defendants say they offered to submit to arbitrators. This agreement, as you see, if carried out, would have prevented the jury from sitting here four or five days on the case, because the parties themselves, in writing, fixed a way by which they should have avoided all this expense; somebody is to blame.

That no right of action existed for any part of the contract price, until production of the releases stipulated for, is too plain for argument. The suit was therefore premature. While we were prevented by a strike of printers from printing more than a small part of the testimony, enough appears in the answers to the points to show that the plaintiff’s testimony relating to many of the items of extras, that Dr. Carter said he would pay for them, was accepted by the court as proof of a waiver of the stipulations of the contract on that subject, although no reference was made in any instance to the contract, and although Mrs. Carter was the party affected.</p>

To say to the jury, as the court did. by affirming plaintiff’s seventh point, that they might treat as presumptive evidence of an agreement to disregard the contract, the silence of the defendants as to any plain and palpable changes, that is, departures from it, in the doing of the work by the plaintiff, is practically to commit a written contract wholly to the winds and waves. The word “ substantially,” in plaintiff’s third point, is so indefinite that the jury might infer from the affirmance of the point, that any kind of construction which did not fall to pieces and would answer the purposes of use, filled the measure of performance which would justify a verdict for the plaintiff, for the contract price.</p>

In the face of the provisions of the written contract, it was error to refuse defendants’ tenth point, which referred to work torn down as bad and insufficient, under the direction of the architect. Moreover, no substantial reason was offered by the plaintiff for not having the valuation of extras submitted to arbitration ; and the jury were permitted by the cdurt to find any imaginable excuse on tbe part of the plaintiff, or any degree of supposed fault on the part of the defendants, as entirely overturning the defence. Further, there was no evidence showing any excuse for plaintiff’s delay, and the court should not have submitted the question whether the defendants were entitled to the four dollars per day given by the contract for delay in completing the dwelling.</p>

    <p id="b525-6" data-blocks='[["BL_525.7",525,[180,1285,1165,1018]]]'>The second and third specifications of error may be considered together, as they involve the same principle. The contract in evidence required releases from all contractors furnishing materials, to be produced at the time of the completion of the building, and before the payment under the contract was to be made. At the time the claim was filed and the scire facias issued, there were upon the records certain liens filed by material-men, and it was claimed by the defendants that no right of action accrued until these liens had been satisfied. Upon the trial below, the plaintiff offered a release of these liens in evidence, and they were admitted under exception by the defendants. We think the releases were property admitted. Although payment under the contract could not be compelled, there was nothing in its terms to deprive the plaintiff of the security of his lien under the act of assembly. He had a right to file his claim, therefore, and we see no reason why he might not proceed by scire facias to liquidate the amount due thereon. It is true, the court below would restrain an execution under such circumstances, until the liens were paid and satisfied. This is the proper practice.</p>
    <p id="b525-7" data-blocks='[["BL_525.8",525,[182,2305,1164,149]],["BL_526.1",526,[260,415,1162,400]]]'>The fourth, fifth, and sixth specifications refer to the admission of certain evidence in regard to extra work. The plaintiff contended that the provision of the contract in relation to <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>extras was waived by the defendants, and offered evidence which strongly supported this theory. It is true, it was contradicted by the defendants, but this was for the jury, and we see no error in the admission of the evidence referred to. These specifications are not sustained. For the same reason, it was not error to refuse the defendants’ sixth point. Under the evidence the question of a waiver of the contract could not be withdrawn from the jury.</p>
    <p id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[245,822,1177,1405]]]'>The eighth specification alleges that the court erred in affirming the plaintiff’s third point. It is as follows: “ That if the plaintiff acted honestly, and in good faith substantially performed the contract, that was sufficient.” This point was affirmed without qualification. Nor does any sufficient qualification appear elsewhere in the charge. It is true, we have numerous cases which decide that a substantial compliance is sufficient to entitle a party to recover. But to recover what? Not the full contract price, but such price, less deductions for any minor matters left uncompleted. The point was perhaps affirmed upon the authority of Sticker v. Overpeck, <a href="/pa/127/0446-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="127 Pa. 446" data-case-ids="565742" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0446-01">127 Pa. 446</a>, where it was held “ that if the plaintiff acted honestly, and in good faith substantially performed the contract, that was sufficient; and if in minor points the contract was not complied with, the jury might deduct from plaintiff’s damages the difference between the value of the work as it was turned over to the defendants, and what it would cost to have it completed in strict conformity to the contract.” It will be noticed that the plaintiff embodied the first two lines of this ruling in his point, and omitted the rest or the qualifying portion. Had he included the whole, his point might have been affirmed. The effect of the affirmance was to instruct the jury that they might find a verdict for the full contract price, if they believed plaintiff had substantially performed his contract. It is true, the court instructed the jury in the general charge that they might make a deduction for defective work, etc. But there was no instruction that for minor matters wholly omitted, they might and should make a deduction.</p>
    <p id="b526-6" data-blocks='[["BL_526.6",526,[243,2244,1163,195]],["BL_527.1",527,[192,405,1169,1159]]]'>Complaint is made in the ninth specification that the court erred in instructing the jury in answer to the plaintiff’s seventh point, “ That if the jury believe that changes in the original contract were plain and palpable to the defendants, the silence <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>of defendants is some presumptive evidence of a previous mutual consent.” The plaintiff attempted to sustain this ruling by quoting an extract from the opinion of this court in Bryant v. Stilwell, <a href="/pa/24/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="24 Pa. 314" data-case-ids="9504511" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0314-01">24 Pa. 314</a>. The sentence quoted is as follows: “ The owner’s silence affords some presumptive evidence of a previous mutual consent to vary the terms of the original agreement, where such variance, made in his presence, is so plain and palpable that he must have seen and understood its effect.” The plaintiff gives this as a quotation. It is not accurately quoted, but the substance is correct. It will be seen that it differs from the language used in the point. In Bryant v. Stilwell, the court says: “But if a plain and palpable variance from the plan agreed upon be made in presence of the owner, in such manner that he must have seen it, and understood its effect,” etc. The variance between the point and our ruling is not only plain, but it is essential. The point merely says, if the alterations were plain and palpable, etc. They might have been so, and yet not have been seen by the owner. Nor is there a word about their having been made in the presence of the owner. An alteration that is plain and palpable may not have been seen or noticed. That the distinction is material is obvious from the following extract from the opinion of Mr. Justice Black, in the case referred to:</p>
    <p id="b527-5" data-blocks='[["BL_527.5",527,[200,1580,1164,755]]]'>“ There are cases in which the consent of the owner will be implied from the fact that he was present when the alterations were made, and did not object. But that inference ought to be cautiously drawn. The most serious defects may not be observable, even by the sharpest eye, until the work is finished. A variance from the plan, appai’ently unimportant at first, may have an effect upon the building as a whole job, which none but an experienced carpenter would be able to anticipate. A person who gets a house put up under an entire contract is not bound to understand the business. He confides in the skill, as well as the honesty of the man he employs......For these reasons, the general rule is that if the contractor slights or bungles his work, he cannot justify himself merely by showing that the owner was present when he was wronged, and made no objection. ”</p>

Nor do we find .error in those portions of the charge embraced in the eleventh and twelfth specifications. There appears to have been a conflict of evidence in respect to the willingness of the. parties to submit the value of the extra work to arbitrators. This was left to the jury. As only a small part of the testimony is printed, we cannot pass upon this matter.</p>
