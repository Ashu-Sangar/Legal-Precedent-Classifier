The middle roll was kept in motion, while the machine was in operation, by friction with the rolls above and below. This friction was frequently interfered with by the grease from the journals working along the surface of the middle roll; and when this occurred, that roll would stop re<a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>volving, and its exposed surface would be burned by the heated metal coming in contact with it. To cut this grease and restore the friction, the plaintiff was in the habit of putting sand on the rolls. Testimony for the defendants tended to show that when sand was so used, some of it would unavoidably get upon the journals and cut the necks of the rolls. Testimony for the plaintiff tended to show that any sand falling on the necks would be washed away by a stream of water kept constantly flowing over them.</p>

Plaintiff testified that this cutting was not caused by his use of sand, but that the necks of the rolls were cut before he first took charge of them. He admitted that defendants’ superintendent had twice said to him, prior to the taking out of the old rolls, that he should not use sand, but must use fire clay; that he said to the superintendent that fire clay would not answer the purpose, and thereafter, while he used fire clay on the old rolls whenever he could get along with it, when he could not do so he used sand. It was claimed by the plaintiff that there was no evidence of the giving of peremptory orders to discontinue the use of sand, prior to the putting in of the new rolls. After they were put in, notice was given to the plaintiff and other workmen, that any man found using sand on the rolls would be discharged. Testimony for the defendants tended to show that the plaintiff put sand on the rolls after that, and that he was discharged for that reason. The defendant and another witness denied that he used any sand on the new rolls, and there was conflicting testimony upon the question whether fire clay would effect the removal of the grease from the rollers.</p>

Fearon, 9 A. &amp; E. 548. And the court misled the jury in the definition of the word wilful. They were not instructed as to which of the two definitions given applied to this case, and it was natural for them to suppose that it was not the meaning “ in common parlance,” but the other one, that was the legal definition,- and that the plaintiff’s disobedience must have been with bad design or malicious, in order to prevent a recovery. Must the injury to the employers be “ gross or wanton ? ” Gross means great, excessively large. Wanton means “ reckless sport, wilfully unrestrained action, running immoderately into excess: ” Cobb v.

It amounts to this: That an employee who is lawfully discharged for disobedience of orders, may recover his full wages for the whole term of his employment, less such damages as his employer can prove he has received in consequence of such disobedience; that is, the employer may set off any loss he has sustained to a demand for wages. And if he can show no actual loss, although his servant’s disobedience may demoralize his establishment and <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>injure Ms machinery in the future, the employee may continue, notwithstanding he refuses to obey orders, or he may draw full pay without rendering any services. This would be a beneficent rule for employees, but a very harsh rule for the employer. We are quite sure it is not the law. The plaintiff was discharged for disobedience ; for using sand on the rolls when he was ordered to use fire clay. If the facts be so, his discharge ended the contract relation between the parties, and it was not necessary for the defendants to show that they had sustained any loss. It was enough that they might sustain loss in the future ; and the plaintiff, having been paid up to the time of his discharge, would not be entitled to recover. If he used sand on the rolls after having been forbidden to do so, it was wilful, and the defendants had a right to discharge him. There was no pretence that it was done inadvertently, or by an accident. A trifling injury, the result of an accident, or a single act of negligence, might not warrant a dismissal, but the rule as laid down by the court below is far too broad. And what is sufficient reason for dismissal, is a question of law for the court.</p>
    <p id="b416-5" data-blocks='[["BL_416.5",416,[251,1413,1173,593]]]'>It is very true that an employer may not, without cause, discharge an employee who has contracted to serve for a term. The true rule was stated in Singer v. McCormick, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 265" data-case-ids="1856296" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0265-01">4 W. &amp; S. 265</a>, as follows: “ Faithful service is a condition precedent to the right of wages; and where there is any misconduct inconsistent with the relation of master and servant, the former has an undoubted right, at any time, to put an end to the contract: Libhart v. Wood, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20266" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 266">1 W. &amp; S. 266</a>. But, if the dismissal be unjust and without cause, the master cannot, by his wrongful discharge, prevent the servant from receiving compensation, not only for services rendered, but also the wages he would have earned had the contract continued in full force.”</p>
    <p id="b416-6" data-blocks='[["BL_416.6",416,[250,2025,1167,194]]]'>We need not multiply authorities. The rule we believe to be as stated above, and I know of no decided cases which conflict with it. None such are cited in the appellee’s brief, which is mostly taken up with a discussion of the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b416-7" data-blocks='[["BL_416.7",416,[884,2228,487,42]]]'>The judgment is reversed.</p>
