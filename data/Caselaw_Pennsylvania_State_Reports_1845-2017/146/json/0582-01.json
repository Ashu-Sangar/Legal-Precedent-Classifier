The plaintiff complains that the learned judge below \u201c erred in the whole tone and tenor of his charge, which did not present the plaintiff\u2019s case to the jury in that clear, fair, and impartial manner in which he was entitled to have it presented.\u201d See first specification. In the second specification the charge is set out at length. A careful examination of it fails to satisfy us that the plaintiff\u2019s objection is well taken. The learned judge fairly-submitted to the jury the two important questions of fact above stated. It may be that he was of opinion that the plaintiff attempted to get the brass without paying for it, but he does not tell the jury so. On the contrary, he did not attempt to control them in this respect; and we have repeatedly said that an expression of opinion by the court, so long as the jury are left free to form a different conclusion, is not error.\nThe rejection of the evidence referred to in the third specification, in view of the finding of the jury, is of no importance, and need not be discussed.\nJudgment affirmed.",

J., Green, Clark, Williams and Mitchell, JJ.\nNo. 242 October Term 1891, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 283 April Term 1888, C. P. No. 2. -\nTo the first Monday of March, 1888, N. A.

A rule for a new trial having been discharged and judgment entered, the plaintiff took, this appeal, specifying that the court erred:\n1. \u201c In the whole tone and tenor of the charge, which did not present the plaintiff\u2019s case to the jury in that clear, fair and impartial manner in which -he was entitled to have it presented.\u201d\n2.
