Under the pleadings and evidence in the case, your verdict should be for the defendant.\nAnswer: This point is refused. I decline to say, under the facts and circumstances, as a matter of law to be determined by the court, what your verdict should be.1 8\n\u2014The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $500. A rule for a new trial having been discharged and judgment entered, the defendant took this appeal, assigning for error:\n1, 2. The answer to the defendant\u2019s point.1 3\n3.
