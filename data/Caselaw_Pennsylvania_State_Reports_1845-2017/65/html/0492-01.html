    <p class="summary" id="b494-7" data-blocks='[["BL_494.5",494,[324,711,1162,597]]]'>“We consider the law applicable to the facts of this ease too well settled to admit of any doubt. In Chaffees <em>v. </em>Risk, 12 Harris 482, the distinction is clearly stated between assignments which require to be recorded under the Act of 1818, and assignments directly to creditors without the intervention of a trustee, which are not within the provisions of the act and are not required to be recorded. In that case it is said, ‘ In an assignment made directly to creditors, it is not an assignment in <em>trust </em>for creditors at all. A trust is when the <em>legal </em>estate is in one person and the <em>equitable </em>interest in another. But in the case of an assignment to a creditor for the payment of his own debt, the legal estate and the equitable interest are vested in one and the same person.’ The same principle is decided in <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20441" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Wright 441">6 Wright 441</a>, and Henderson’s Appeal, 7 Casey 502.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b494-8" data-blocks='[["BL_494.6",494,[321,1308,1158,472]]]'>“ In the present case there is neither trustee, nor <em>cestui que trust. </em>The assignment is direct to'the creditors of the assignors. But plaintiffs’ counsel contend that as the assignment includes, after naming the creditors, ‘ any other persons having a claim or demand against the said firm’ that the creditors named will take property assigned for their own use and in trust for the creditors not named. But this argument is not tenable <em>\ </em>no such trust is created by this assignment, it is as direct and positive to creditors not named (if there are any) as to those named, and they take directly under the assignment, and not by virtue of any trust reposed in others.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b494-9" data-blocks='[["BL_494.7",494,[320,1781,1159,418]]]'>“ Plaintiffs’ counsel assume in their argument that there are creditors not named. This is denied by the defendant’s counsel, who say that all the creditors known to the assignors are named, but fearing that one or more creditors, to small amounts, might have been overlooked, and desiring to distribute, their property among all their creditors, the clause including creditors not named was inserted. In this conflict of assertion by counsel we can only say that it is no part of the facts stated, that there are creditors not named in the assignment, and we cannot presume facts outside of the case stated.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b494-10" data-blocks='[["BL_494.8",494,[319,2208,1156,216]],["BL_495.1",495,[208,407,1164,304]]]'>“ The plaintiffs’ counsel further allege that by the assignment Mr. Maglaughlin is made a trustee for the creditors. The claims were placed in Mr. Maglaughlin’s hands for collection before the assignment was made, and it only contains a direction that he shall pay over to the creditors the money when collected, after deduct<a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>ing a reasonable compensation for his services. This gives him no interest in the fund, legal or equitable. The claims were in his hands before the assignment to creditors was. made. The ordinary relation of counsel and client subsisted, nothing more,, and it cannot be that an assignment of a claim by a debtor to a creditor, which is in tbe bands of counsel for collection, must be recorded to give it validity.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b495-6" data-blocks='[["BL_495.4",495,[209,709,1162,301]]]'>“ Tbis case nearly resembles Henderson’s Appeal, 7 Casey 502. In that case certain claims in tbe bands of Mr. Richmond, an attorney, for collection, were <em>assigned </em>to bim for tbe use of certain New York creditors, and although tbe claims were <em>assigned </em>to the attorney who held them for collection, not a mere direction to pay, as in tbis case, tbe court held tbe assignment was not within the Act of 1818, and tbe claims could not be attached.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b495-7" data-blocks='[["BL_495.5",495,[205,1011,1167,639]]]'>“ Tbe plaintiff has certainly no equity to urge in tbis case. He will come in with the other creditors under the assignment; but not satisfied with tbis he attempts to secure more than one-half of the claims assigned. Equality, it is said, is equity, and in tbis case we consider it both law and equity. Assignments of small amounts, honestly made for the use of all tbe creditors of an insolvent, have been favorably considered by our courts. The cumbrous proceedings under tbe Act of 1818 are ’expensive. Recording deed, appointment of appraisers, filing inventory, settlement of account in court, distribution by an auditor, percentage of assignee and fees ofi counsel, when tbe estate is small, leave but little for creditors, and where a fair and just distribution can be made by counsel in whose bands tbe claims have been placed, assignments such as tbe present are equally beneficial to debtor and creditors.</p>
