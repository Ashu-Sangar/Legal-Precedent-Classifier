There was granted to it all such liberties, privileges and franchises, <em>“ </em>necessary or incident to the making and maintaining the said railroad, convenient construction of depots, such cars, locomotives, fixtures and devices as may be necessary for the conveyance of passengers and the transportation of the mail and of goods, merchandise and commodities thereon.” By the 21st section it was declared that “ it shall and may be lawful for the president and managers from time to time to ordain and establish rules and regulations for the due ordering of all travelling and transportation on said road * * * provided that the toll * * * shall not exceed upon each passenger an average of two cents per mile.” By the Act of March 15th 1847, Pamph.

That question is whether the Pennsylvania Railroad Company as the lessee of the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad Company, is subject to the limitation imposed upon it by its charter in the transportation of passengers on its own road ? It might be concluded from general reasoning that the restrictions upon the'company in the transportation of merchandise and passengers upon a railroad authorized to be constructed by it, have no application to the use of another railroad of which it may become the lessee by authority of law. The learned judge admits that this would be so if the lessees were individuals or natural persons, but he failed to see that an artificial person authorized specially by law to take a lease is <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>in the same position unless such authority is itself limited. By virtue of a simple lease, therefore, an artificial as well as a natural person would succeed to all the rights, liberties and franchises, and be subject to all the limitations imposed upon the lessor. The lessee is the assignee for a term or period of the lessor — his bailiff to hold the possession for him: Co. Litt. 289 b, note 2; it is so as to natural persons, why not as to corporations, unless the law has made a difference when it authorized the lease? The limitations which the legislature have prescribed, as well as the privileges they have granted, have exclusive reference to that particular subject-matter to which they relate, namely the road the company was authorized to construct. Good reasons may exist for a difference in these limitations growing out of the nature of the works themselves. The expense and difficulty of construction, as well as the small amount comparatively of travel and transportation, might render a'restriction of charge ruinous as to one road which would be perfectly just and right in the case of another not so situated. It was an argument well put by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, and not answered, that if the rule of construction laid down by the learned judge below be sound, then the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad Company by becoming the lessees of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company could operate their road without being subject to the restrictions imposed by the charter of the latter. We can easily see to what consequences such a construction under existing laws and charters would lead — consequences certainly not foreseen by the legislature. The lessee of a railroad corporation must necessarily be bound by all the prohibitions and limitations contained in the charter of the lessor, and on the other hand must be held to be entitled to all their rights and franchises. The legislature by authorizing another corporation to take such lease have by necessary implication conferred them.</p>
    <p id="b209-6" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[171,1823,1167,472]]]'>But the language of the charter of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in which the restriction relied on is expressed, puts this construction beyond all question. The proviso in the twenty-first section is a limitation upon the power granted to charge such rates of compensation for the conveyance of passengers passing over or on said railroad as to the president and directors shall seem reasonable. The said railroad is of course the railroad authorized to be constructed by that act and no other. The lease of the Philadelphia- and Erie Railroad Company confers, as we have seen, upon? the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in the broadest terms all their1 corporate powers and privileges.</p>

It is clear that tolls, which is the only word employed, means charges upon transporters of passengers other than the company, not charges on the passengers themselves. Under that provision transporters could make any contract they pleased as to the rate of fare or compensation for carriage, but the company could not exact from them more than two cents per mile for each passenger. Toll, properly speaking, is the consideration for the use of a road or bridge, not compensation for carriage over it: Bouvier’s Law Diet. Such was the determination of this court in Boyle <em>v. </em>The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company, 4 P. F. Smith 310, in the construction of a similar provision in the charter of that company. “ The legal meaning of the word toll,” said Mr. Justice Strong, “ is and always has been well defined. It is a tribute or custom paid for passage, not for carriage — always something taken for a liberty or privilege, not for a service; and such is the common understanding of the word. Nobody supposes that tolls taken by a turnpike or canal company include charges for transportation, or that they are anything more than an excise demanded and paid for the privilege of using the way.” When the Sun-bury and Erie Railroad Company was originally incorporated, it was not contemplated that they should engage in the business of transportation. Hence, they were specially authorized “to prescribe the kinds and description of cars, carriages or wagons to be used on the said road for the conveyance of passengers and the transportation of the mails or of goods, wares, merchandise and minerals, and to regulate the speed at which they should travel, and to adopt and enforce such rules and regulations in relation to the transit thereof as they may deem expedient.” Indeed, it seems apparent that they had no authority to engage in the business of transportation, for by the 2d section they were expressly precluded from exercising “ any banking, manufacturing or trading privileges, or any other liberties, privileges or franchises but such as may be necessary or incident to the making and maintaining the said railroad, convenient construction of depots, such cars, locomotives, fixtures and devices as may be necessary for the conveyance of passengers and the transportation of the mail and of goods, merchandise and commodities thereon.” There is a marked difference between this language and that used in the Act of April 4th 1833, Pamph. L. 146, incorporating the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company, to whom was granted such franchises “ as may be necessary or incident to the making and maintaining of the said railroad, and the conveyance of passengers and the <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>transportation of the mail, and of goods, merchandise and com•modities thereon.” It is plain that they were authorized to transport goods and passengers, with no express power to charge freight or fare, and with the same restriction on tolls as is contained in the charter before us. Yet it was held in the case before referred to that they were necessarily empowered to charge for transportation, “No provision,” said Mr. Justice Strong, “ was made respecting rates and charges for their own service as carriers; but the very purpose of their incorporation was that they might carry. How can they carry without compensation ? Authorized to engage in a business, it is necessarily incident to their authority that they have the rights which ordinarily belong to such a business.” * * * * “ The right to charge is implied in the nature of the business authorized, and I cannot conceive of conducting the business of transportation without the imposition of rates and charges.” When, therefore, the Act of 1847 gave to the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company the privilege of transporting merchandise and passengers, with the power to collect freight and tolls therefor, the word tolls could have been used in no other sense than that in which it was used in the original charter. Nor was it necessary that there should be an express power to collect either freight or fare. The expression of freight does not exclude fare. It would be unreasonable in the highest degree to suppose that the legislature intended the one and not the other; for the proviso expressly saved as to tolls has a similar restriction as to merchandise and passengers. Freight, indeed, in its wide sense, may include fare, for it is that “ with which anything is <em>fraught </em>or laden for transportation;” and by a figure of speech the price paid for the transportation : Johnson’s Dict.; Webster’s Dict. We cannot attribute to the legislature the absurdity of providing that the company should collect besides freight, tolls on merchandise carried by themselves. That would be to authorize them to charge themselves for the use of their own road. The meaning evidently was, that as they might allow private transporters to place their ears on the road, they should still have the right to tolls under the original limitation both as to merchandise and passengers. This sustains the 2d assignment of error.</p>
