On the 20th of November 1857, Ripka executed a mortgage to George Shields and Henry K. B. Ogle, trustees, to secure two bonds conditioned to pay in one year a large number of sums of money which Ripka owed to different persons, his creditors, as shown by schedules annexed to the bonds respectively; part of the mortgaged property was the ground-rent of the defendant; the mortgage was recorded on the day of its date.

The plaintiff objected to the offer, it was admitted, and a bill of exceptions sealed. The plaintiff then read the deed; also one from S. Winpenny to B. Winpenny, trustee, for the same ground-rent dated March 19th March 1863 and recorded the 27th of the same month. S. Winpenny testified that Ripka borrowed $1500 from him under the promise of repayment in two weeks; at the expiration of the time, he said he could not raise the money, but said he had a ground-rent of $1300 or $1400 which he would give the witness and would pay him the balance in a few days; he said he wished to secure him; he paid the difference between the ground-rent and $1500. On the morning of the transfer of the ground-rent, witness told Shields and Ogle of the conveyance; Ripka, while he lived, collected the rent and paid witness; witness did not know of the sheriff’s sale till after it took place, when Spackman gave notice to the ground tenant not to pay; witness had held the ground-rent six or seven years, but knew nothing of the mortgage. Ripka requested him not to record the deed. There was other evidence as to the notice to Ogle.</p>

Allison, a creditor under the mortgage, testified that after the trust mortgage was made, he being one of the largest creditors, had frequent conversations with Ogle; the Ott ground-rent being referred to, Ogle said it did not belong to the trust, it had been put there in the confusion of drawing the mortgage. After Clay came into the trust, and before the sheriff’s sale, he told witness that the ground-rent was claimed by Winpenny, who. had a deed for it not recorded ; that as it was doubtful whether it belonged to the trust he had had searches made and could find nothing of it. He said he got his information from Ogle, the mortgage had been given to secure wages and borrowed money. The defendant proved that the plaintiff bought as agent for the trustees. The plaintiff in rebuttal called Clay who testified that he had no recollection of notice of Winpenny’s deed before the sheriff’s sale, but had after the sale when he was making efforts to sell the ground-rent; he then made searches.</p>

It was absolute on its face, and after the verdict below must be assumed to have been for a valuable consideration, having been given and received in payment and extinguishment of a debt, due by the grantor to the grantee. It was not recorded, however, until April 3d 1867.</p>
    <p id="b134-12" data-blocks='[["BL_134.12",134,[313,1206,1158,514]]]'>On November 20th 1857, Joseph Ripka executed a mortgage of this ground-rent with other real estate, to George Shields and Henry K. B. Ogle, in trust to secure certain of his creditors, conditioned for the payment by the mortgagor, within one year from the date, of a sum sufficient to discharge their debts with interest. George Shields died, and Harry G. Clay was appointed by the Court of Common Pleas trustee in his place. Afterwards Mr. Ogle, the other trustee, died, and Mr. Olay proceeded by scire facias on the mortgage, and the plaintiff, Samuel Spackman, became the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale, but bought, however, as agent for the trustee, as the jury have found. The. mortgage was recorded the same day.</p>

It has not been and cannot be pretended that the purchase by the trustee at sheriff’s sale gave him any better title than he had before. The jury must have found that Ogle had notice of the deed to Winpenny, and that notice was communicated by him to Mr. Clay, after his * appointment and- before the sale. All question on that point, must be considered as at rest.</p>

In The Lessee of Henry <em>v. </em>Morgan, <a href="/binn/2/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Binn. 497" data-case-ids="1788967" data-case-paths="/binn/2/0497-01">2 Binn. 497</a>, an ejectment against a trustee, it was held not to be competent to give evidence that he had notice of an unrecorded deed before his appointment, because it cannot affect the <em>eestuis que trust. </em>But <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>were the creditors of Eipka, secured by the mortgage, purchasers for a valuable consideration, within the protection of the recording Act of March 18th 1775 ? (1 Smith’s L. 422.) It provides that an unrecorded deed <em>“ </em>shall be adjudged fraudulent and void against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagor for valuable consideration.” It is very well settled that an assignment in trust for the payment of debts is not within the protection of the act. The assignee is not a purchaser for value, neither are the creditors, having surrendered no right, nor agreed to any forbearance on the faith of the instrument: Twelves <em>v. </em>Williams, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Whart.%20493" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Whart. 493">3 Wharton 493</a>. “ Perhaps nothing is better settled in this state,” says Mr. Justice Agnew, in In Re Fulton’s Estate, 1 P. F. Smith 211, “ by uniform and numerous decisions than this, that a voluntary assignee is the mere representative of the debtor enjoying his rights only, and no others ; and is bound where he would be bound; that he is not the representative of creditors and is not clothed with their powers; that he is but a volunteer and not a boná fide purchaser for value. Nor are the creditors for whom he holds his trust such purchasers under his deed.” See the cases there cited. Wherein does a mortgagee for the benefit of creditors differ from an assignee ? The ingenious counsel for the plaintiff has indeed argped very strenuously that the assent of the creditors to the delay of a year under the mortgage would amount to a contract to forbear for that period, and thus constitute them purchasers for value. But where was the evidence of their assent? Had they actually become parties to the mortgage, or executed a release or letter of license, there might have arisen such a question. There is nothing to show that every one of the creditors could not have proceeded against Ripka personally at any period. In Bixler <em>v. </em>Ream, 3 Penna. Rep. 282, the defendant endorsed on a bond held by the plaintiff an agreement to pay it in one year from the date, yet it was held that, there being no agreement to forbear, it was without consideration.</p>
