Early in 1860 the plaintiffs, having retained Wilson, who was a lawyer residing in Huntingdon, as their counsel, visited Sinking Valley, in which the farm was situated, and as a result, determined to purchase mining leases in the Valley. In the fall of the same-year Henry B. Tatham, Wilson and Taylor again visited the Valley, and obtained several mining leases in the names of Henry B. Tatham (representing the plaintiffs) and Taylor. Under Wilson’s instructions the wives of the lessors joined in the leases, and a number of blank leases,, signed by Taylor and Tatham, were left with Wilson, with instructions to him to secure as many as he could. In 1862 Taylor, finding it inconvenient to bear the expense, requested H. B., <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>Tatham to procure a purchaser for his interest, and negotiations were entered into with one Manning in New York, which were not successful. In 1863 Gr. N. Tatham and Taylor, with Wilson as their counsel, again visited the Valley to procure a lease from Waite, as well as leases from other persons. Several leases were obtained, and after Wilson and Taylor had returned home, Tatham .obtained a lease in duplicate from Waite, duly executed and acknowledged by him; Waite took the lease to procure his wife’s signature, promising to send it to Wilson; it was not executed by the wife. The next day Tatham informed Wilson of these facts, and in June informed Taylor also, who repeated his wish to sell out his interest. At this point II. B. Tatham invited Lewis to purchase Taylor’s interest, telling him of the locality of zinc, having previously informed him of the discovery. At Lewis’s request H. B. Tatham procured him an interview with Taylor, when it was arranged that Lewis, Taylor and Dr. Mucklé, then in the employment of Lewis, should visit the Valley, Wilson to accompany them. Lewis had been informed of the incomplete lease from Waite, and it was agreed that the entire operation should be for the joint account of Taylor, Lewis and the plaintiffs. Lewis knew that Wilson had been retained as Tatham’s attorney. In July 1863 Lewis, Taylor and Wilson visited the Valley. In August, Wilson procured an agreement from Waite to sell his farm for $10,000, and afterwards obtained a deed for it to Lewis, representing that he was acting for the plaintiffs, Taylor and Lewis. Wilson then instructed Waite to destroy the lease to Tatham, that it had all been done away by the purchase; Waite accordingly burned the lease. The plaintiffs did not know of the sale to Lewis until October 1863, when they were informed of it by Wilson. H. B. Tatham tendered to Lewis $5000, his share of the purchase-money; Lewis said he had bought on his own account and had sold one-half of it. Gr. N. Tatham went to Huntingdon and saw Wilson, who told him that Mrs. Waite had refused to sign the lease, but not that it had been destroyed. The next day Waite informed Gr. N. Tatham of the transaction, and told him that he supposed. he had been selling to the plaintiffs, Taylor and Lewis, as being represented by Wilson. Lewis and Taylor afterwards sold to O. &amp; H. Borie for $100,000.</p>

He found that on the 18th of the same month, G-. N. Tatham obtained a mining lease from Waite, and left it with him to obtain the acknowledgment of his wife; and that Wilson in the same month knew that Gr. N. Tatham was in negotiation with Waite for mining privileges. He further found that when Taylor visited the Valley in July 1863, he did not know of the lease from Waite to Gr. N. Tatham; that the allegation of the plaintiff that the entire operations in the Valley were agreed to be on the joint account of Taylor, Lewis and H. B. Tatham is,not sustained by the evidence. He found that on the 1st of August 1863 Wilson commenced a negotiation on behalf of Lewis with Waite for the purchase of his farm, which was consummated on the 15th by a conveyance of the farm to Lewis for $10,000; that Wilson then advised Waite to destroy the lease, as being of no use to anybody after the conveyance, and in consequence the lease was afterwards destroyed. He found specifically <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>as a fact, that at the time when Wilson negotiated for the sale of the Waite farm to Lewis, he knew of the existence of the lease executed by Waite to Gr. N. Tatham, but that he did not inform Lewis of it. The master further found that Lewis had no actual notice of the lease to Gr. N. Tatham; nor was he chargeable with constructive -notice by reason of Wilson being his attorney, and having knowledge of the lease. He further reported that if Lewis had purchased with such notice, the remedy of Tatham would have been to enforce the lease against the fee, but that after having sold the Waite lease to Borie for a valuable consideration, it was too late to follow it as against Lewis’s profit in the sale of the farm, having failed to show they were jointly interested in the profits.

What was there, then, of which Wilson’s conduct deprived the Tathams ? Simply of the benefit they might derive from the existence of a partly-executed undelivered mining lease, which of itself was of very questionable value, but for' which, together with seven other leases, they were paid by the Messrs.

    <p id="b70-9" data-blocks='[["BL_70.9",70,[288,949,1159,1329]]]'>The facts as now ascertained may be briefly stated. The complainants were jointly interested with Taylor in the project of procuring mining leases in Sinking Valley. They engaged the services of the defendant, Wilson, as their attorney. Several leases were obtained by his assistance and intervention. As these leases were for a long term of years, by his advice the wives of the lessors were in all instances required to join with a separate acknowledgment in order to bar dower. Henry Waite, the owner of a farm, had executed a lease to George N. Tatham, one of the complainants, but it was in the names of himself and wife, and it was left in his possession to be executed and acknowledged by her. Wilson had nothing to do with this lease, but George N. Tatham informed him of what had been done. Taylor was entirely ignorant of it. He proposed to sell out his interest to Lewis, and accompanied him with Wilson on a tour of exploration through the Valley. In the course of it the Waite farm was visited. Neither Taylor nor Lewis were informed by Wilson of the existence of the lease. Lewis declined to buy out Taylor’s' interest, but authorized Wilson to purchase the Waite farm. There were no negotiations by the Tathams pending with that view;-they had distinctly declined to take it at the price at which it had been offered. Wilson did purchase the farm for Lewis, and by his advice the lease was subsequently destroyed as of no value. After all these transactions were fully known to the complainants, they sold out for a large sum of money all their interest in the leases in Blair county, including specially the alleged lease of the Waite farm. The master has reported <em>“ </em>that the evidence in the case does not support the allegation that it was understood that the result of Lewis’s operations in the Valley should be for the joint interest of himself and plaintiffs, or of himself, plaintiffs and Taylor.”</p>
    <p id="b70-10" data-blocks='[["BL_70.10",70,[288,2278,1154,171]],["BL_71.1",71,[208,436,1164,386]]]'>Assuming, as we must, this to be so, there is no principle of equity upon which'Lewis can be made to account to the complainants for any share of the profits subsequently realized by him from the sale of the farm. The lease was clearly not binding <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>upon the lessee. He could not have been compelled to accept it without execution by the wife; neither could the lessor have been compelled to deliver it. It was evidently a condition of the bargain that the wife should agree. It must be mutually binding on both parties or neither. The lessor had a perfect right, when his wife refused, to cancel and destroy the instrument. How, then, can notice, actual or constructive, of such a paper affect Lewis with any equity, if there existed at the time of the purchase of the farm no confidential relation between him and the plaintiffs ?</p>
    <p id="b71-6" data-blocks='[["BL_71.4",71,[212,824,1163,864]]]'>The existence of such a confidential relation is evidently the turning-point, of the whole controversy. If the lease had been a valid subsisting lease, complete by delivery without the joinder of the wife, the destruction of it by the lessor could not destroy the estate or term. The plaintiffs could have compelled the execution and delivery of another by proceeding against the lessor, and if Lewis was affected with constructive notice by the knowledge of Wilson, his attorney, it could have been established as against him, and he could have been obliged to confirm it. His remedy would then have been against Wilson, his attorney, for not having communicated to him the knowledge he possessed of it. It is not easy to see how Wilson incurred any responsibility to the Tat-hams for not having given actual notice to Lewis, if he was equally well affected by constructive notice. The extent of his liability would have been the costs of a proceeding to establish the lease as an encumbrance. But the complainants did not take this course to enforce their rights, if they had any. Instead of this, they voluntarily parted with all their interest in their leases in Blair county, for a valuable consideration, to Messrs. C. and H. Borie, including specially this very lease of the Waite farm.</p>

In equity they stand in the shoes of the plaintiffs, so far as regards any claims or demands based upon the transaction of this lease. It is plain, then, that the whole matter of this alleged lease of the Waite farm is as irrelevant to the true merits of the controversy, as was the question of the Earp lease of the Ueberoth farm in Lehigh county, in regard to which so much testimony was given before the examiner, with what object it is difficult to comprehend.
