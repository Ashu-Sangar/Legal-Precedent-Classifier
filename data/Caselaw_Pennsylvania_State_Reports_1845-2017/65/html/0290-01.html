Another supplement was passed February 21st 1856, giving the company power to borrow $200,000, to issue bonds for the same, and to secure them by a mortgage on their lands, road, works, franchises, tolls, &amp;c.; and provided that the mortgage, “when duly executed and recorded,” should “be good and valid as a lien on the subject-matter mortgaged to all intents and purposes.” On the 23d of May 1857, the railroad company executed a mortgage to George Swope. The mortgage recited that the directors, on the 16th of January 1857, had resolved to execute a mortgage of the road to Swope, in trust to secure bonds issued by the] company by virtue of the Act of 1856, payable in twenty years, with interest payable semi-annually, and that the president and treasurer be authorized to execute a mortgage under the seal of the company to secure the bonds, with the stipulation that if default should be made in payment of the interest for one year, the principal should become due, and the trustee might “commence proceedings at law by scire facias or otherwise, for the recovery of said sum.” The mortgage then proceeded in the usual form, conveying the road from Hanover to Middleburg with its franchises, locomotives, cars, lands, tolls, privileges, &amp;e., under the stipulations of the resolution.</p>

In his answer, he admits the execution of the mortgage and the sale of $85,000 of bonds prior to June 4th 1862, but he denies that it was delivered to the trustee, George Swope. The evidence shows that the mortgage never was actually in the possession of Mr. Swope. The supplement of 1852 authorizing it, provides that when executed and recorded, it shall be a good and valid lien. The mortgage was duly executed under the corporate seal of the company, on the 23d May 1867, and on the same day Eobert McCurdy makes affidavit that the same was signed, sealed and delivered as the act and deed of the Gettysburg Railroad Company. The mortgage was recorded in the counties of Adams and York, and the recording fee in one of the counties was paid by McCurdy. After this was done, the company issued and sold its bonds, and it is too late for either the company or the sequestrator to deny its validity. The master, therefore, is of opinion that the mortgage dated May 23d 1857'to George Swope, trustee, is a first lien upon the premises mortgaged, and the holder’s bonds secured by it, are entitled to the benefit of all the rights and securities thereby given.</p>

The Act of 11th April 1862, Pamph. L. 477, declares that this court “ shalFhave and exercise all the powers and jurisdiction of a court of chancery in all eases of mortgages given by corporations.” This power has been so often exercised in the sale of railroads, and interests of so much magnitude hang upon our decrees, the public <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>would be surprised to learn that this act is unconstitutional. It falls, however, within the express terms of the 6th section of the 5th article of the state Constitution, authorizing the legislature to “vest in the said courts (Supreme and Common Pleas) such other powers to grant relief in equity as shall be found necessary; and from time to time to enlarge or diminish their powers or vest them in other courts, as they shall judge proper for the due administration of justice.” It belongs to the legislature to determine the necessity for enlarging our equity jurisdiction, and it does not lie with us, because a party may have a remedy at law in some shape, to say that the legislature cannot give him another, by means of a chancery proceeding. The legal remedy may be very inadequate, as it has been found to be in relation to corporation mortgages, involving the right of way and the franchises of railroad and similar corporations. It is no objection that the Act of 1862 was passed after the date of the mortgage. It interferes with no vested right and injures no one. It merely provides a new and a better remedy for the default of the company, more pliable, and adapted to protect the interests of all the parties: McElrath <em>v. </em>Pittsburg &amp; Steubenville Railroad Co., 5 P. F. Smith 189, was a strong ease by reason of the remedy provided in the mortgage itself, and yet we held the Act of 1862 applicable to that case.</p>
    <p id="b296-6" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[307,1418,1156,771]]]'>The 2d error is also unfounded. The Act of the 21st of February 1856, Pamph. L. 84, merely conferred an additional authority on the directors to mortgage the <em>franchises </em>of the road. Under the charter and the General Railroad Act of 1849, the corporation had power to borrow money and <em>pledge </em>all its property, <em>rights </em>and <em>privileges </em>for the payment. The substance of the thing, therefore, existed before. The mortgage in this case was executed on the 23d day of May 1857, and recorded on the same day. Bonds were issued under it, negotiated, interest paid on them, recognised by the sequestrator, and by auditors appointed to distribute funds in the sequestrator’s hands; and in almost every way the mortgage has been recognised as a valid and binding instrument down to the time of the application to make the sale under it. Under these circumstances there has been a clear recognition, by way of ratification at least, of the power conferred in the Act of 1856 : Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations, 2d ed., 51 to 55; Gordon <em>v. </em>Preston, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20387" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Watts 387">1 Watts 387</a>; Fell <em>v. </em>McHenry, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%2041" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 Wright 41">6 Wright 41</a>.</p>

It was duly executed, acknowledged and recorded, and the corporation acted upon its valid existence, as did others receiving bonds under it. The fact, therefore, that Swope, the mere trustee, had not manual possession of the paper does not invalidate it, or detract from its delivery in law. The evidence of such delivery is <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>ample to carry the benefit of the trust to those for whose use the mortgage was intended: Miller’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Rawle%20317" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="3 Rawle 317">3 Rawle 317</a>; Blight <em>v. </em>Schenck, 10 Barr 285; Stinger <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 2 Casey 428; McKinney v.

    <p id="b297-4" data-blocks='[["BL_297.4",297,[190,639,1157,393]]]'>The master finds that Maltby is the absolute owner of the $112,000 of the bonds which had been hypothecated to secure debts of the company. ' The sale was made under a resolution of the company passed and carried into effect while McCurdy, the sequestrator, was a director. There seems to be some evidence of his assent to the sale. But whether this be so or not need not be decided; for Maltby, if a holder of the bonds, even as a collateral security only, would be entitled to press for a sale under the mortgage to make his security available.</p>
