These authorities, and many more might be added, present the rule on this subject much as it was presented by Sir William Blackstone, who says: “ If a servant, by his negligence, does any damage to a stranger, the master shall answer for his neglect, but the damage must be done while he is actually employed in his master’s service.”</p>
    <p id="b259-7" data-blocks='[["BL_259.5",259,[212,1713,1156,213]]]'>If this be^eo, where there is a wrong done, he can certainly justify doing anything as a servant which his master had a right to do. He cannot be disconnected from his employer and held answerable for want of original authority in himself if his master had it, and he acted by and within the scope of his master’s authority.</p>

Provided, that no injury shall <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>thereby be done to private property outside the limits of the stream aforesaid.</p>

    <p id="b260-7" data-blocks='[["BL_260.5",260,[291,782,1160,902]]]'>The defendants claimed in their defence, that they were the servants of the corporation, and exempt from liability for the consequences of the company’s acts. It was not shown, or pretended, that they acted wilfully or maliciously, or outside of what the company was authorized to do. The company accepted the act incorporating it on the terms on which it was granted: viz., that it would do no injury to private property outside the stream, the correlative of which would be, that if it did, it would compensate the injury. The idea of holding its employees to a like accountability, would be as novel as it would be unjust, and this the citation of the authorities referred to prove. There was, neither by law nor contract, any privity between the plaintiff and them. If damages could be rendered against such parties, such improvements could never be made, as no one would be willing to take upon himself to assume the acts of the corporation over which he had no control. Nor would he have any recourse to the company to reimburse himself, if damage's were recovered against him. The defendants justified as servants of the company. . But the right to do so was entirely ignored by the learned judge. This appears throughout the charge, but culminates in the portion assigned for error by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, as follows:—</p>
    <blockquote id="b260-8" data-blocks='[["BL_260.6",260,[294,1683,1155,163]]]'>“We therefore say to you, that neither .the defendants nor those under or with whom they were acting, acquired any right, by virtue of the act referred to, to disregard the plaintiff, and flood his mill-wheels to his detriment.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b260-9" data-blocks='[["BL_260.7",260,[293,1855,1157,600]],["BL_261.1",261,[207,434,1155,257]]]'>If any thought lingered in the learned judge’s mind that damages such as these, being entirely consequential, are to be prepaid before the dam could be erected and used, all the authorities in Pennsylvania on the point are against him, a majority of which have been referred to in the paper-book of the plaintiff in error, and will not be repeated. The point is too clear to need it. Consequential damages are never recoverable from á corporation of this nature, excepting when expressly given, and on the terms on which they are allowed. Here, by the act of incorporation, it is not to be doubted that consequential damages may be recovered in the common-law courts and forms of action. Of course, those who suffer must move, for <em>non constat </em>the corporation is apprised of any injury having been done. A common-law procedure in form is the remedy in this case, and in case of non-payment of <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>damages found, the bond of the company approved and filed in the county of Clearfield, stands as an indemnity. The suit is first to be against the company. That is, to ascertain the amount of damages- to be paid, which if not paid, recourse may be had to the bond. I would suppose that no one would think of suing the bond in the first place.</p>
    <p id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.4",261,[206,691,1155,217]]]'>We think the learned judge was clearly wrong in the instruction referred to; it in fact disposed of every question in the case but the amount of the damages. The company had most unlimited authority in the stream itself, on the condition of paying for damage done outside of it.</p>
    <p id="b261-7" data-blocks='[["BL_261.5",261,[206,905,1154,389]]]'>It was not in default in not having paid them, until demanded ; nor then, if the demand was unreasonable. This being the case, the charge was error, if the company alone had been sued, but it was most unquestionable error, to allow a recovery against the defendants, unless for a wilful trespass, which was not pretended. The action was case, and not trespass for acting without authority in raising the water on the plaintiff, before paying for the right. This was not required. There might have been plausibility in this, although it would want soundness.</p>
    <p id="b261-8" data-blocks='[["BL_261.6",261,[203,1292,1155,561]]]'>It was strenuously argued, that- this branch of the Sinnemahoning having been declared' a public highway before the plaintiff erected his mills,' his right, under the Act of 1803, so to erect, was but a license as between the Commonwealth and him, which, if revoked or destroyed by authority of the ¡state, no damage could be demanded. This is true, on the authority of Young <em>v. </em>The Railroad Co., 9 Casey 180; Canal Co. <em>v. </em>Wright, <a href="/watts-serg/9/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 9" data-case-ids="12168751" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0009-01">9 W. &amp; S. 9</a>, and other cases. But if the Commonwealth require damage done to such property to be paid for by a company, it must be done. That is what it seems to me was done here. The company accepted its charter on the condition of paying for any injury it might do outside the bed or body of the Sinnemahoning creek. The point insisted on does not therefore arise.</p>
    <p id="b261-9" data-blocks='[["BL_261.7",261,[197,1852,1159,429]]]'>There was no error on the part of the learned judge in denying the estoppel as complained of. It mattered not how much the plaintiff might have aided the company in building the dam. It was not on his property, and even if it had been, he could do nothing except by contract, to weaken his right to be compensated by the company for' injuries such as the law required to be compensated. He could give no notice which would avail to affect the company in building the dam. This was authorized by the state. It is not the kind of case to which the doctrine of equitable estoppel applies.</p>
    <p id="b261-10" data-blocks='[["BL_261.8",261,[198,2279,1156,175]],["BL_262.1",262,[317,455,1157,428]]]'>The charge on 'the measure of ;damages was indefinite, but I am not willing to say there was absolute error in it, I incline to think that the damage to be recovered in an action against the company, is not sustainable on the ground of being a nuisance. <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>The company being authorized, in the course of the construction of their works, to do as was done here, raise the water, on paying the damage done, it could not be chargeable as for a nuisance any more than could the state from which it derives its power. The claim, whenever asserted, we think should cover the damage to the property as mills, past and future. In fixing this, it should be done, in our opinion, on the estimate of the value of the property, and then the deterioration it has suffered. This would be the damage done. What portion that would be of the unit of value would be a safe standard, we think.</p>
