In January 1861 Snyder, who was a storekeeper, sold his store to Mrs. Patton, and on settlement with her she fell in his debt $800, for which she gave him notes; these he assigned shortly afterwards in the same month to Gabriel Walker, to whom he owed $926.44, which Walker had paid as surety for him on his bond as assignee of one Heiple. On the 1st of February 1861, he assigned to his sisters three of the $500 Walker bonds. Walker, in his answer to the interrogatories, admitted that two of the Walker bonds, due respectively April 1st 1869 and April 1st 1870, were unpaid and owing by him, and that they had not been transferred at the time of the attachment. The garnishee gave evidence that at or about the time of the assignment of Mrs. Patton’s $800 notes to Gabriel Walker, Mrs. Patton and Snyder <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>agreed that he would verbally assign to her the two bonds in controversy as collateral security, she to pay Gabriel Walker the balance of $126.44 due to him, and also other indebtedness amounting to $425; that Mrs. Patton assumed and subsequently paid this indebtedness; some of G. Walker’s remained unpaid. The bonds were assigned on the 3d of October 1868. He gave evidence also that the husband of Mrs. Patton was present when she gave the $800 notes, and the arrangement was made between her and Snyder that she should pay Snyder’s debts and he assign the bonds; that the notes given by her for the store were paid to Gabriel Walker by her husband as her agent.</p>

There was no benefit to accrue to her so far as appears. She was not legally competent to make such a contract. What then was Josiah Snyder’s position with relation to these two last instalments of the Walker judgment on the 6th of February 1861 ? for Bittner, the attaching creditor, doubtless stood in the shoes of Snyder.

The court below held that the verbal transfer of these two instalments by Snyder to Mrs. Patton, as collateral security for certain debts, which she undertook to pay for Snyder, was void as to all sums paid by her after service of the attachment on her and Samuel Walker. This is on the ground that she is a married woman, and her contract not binding on her. In this we think the learned judge erred. While the contracts of a married woman cannot be enforced against her, if she dissents, it does not follow, that rights of property acquired by her on the faith of her promise which she performs voluntarily, can be struck down by the creditor of the person who has ceded his property to her upon an honest contract. Clearly her title is not void if she pays or fulfils the consideration she has promised. The right of the creditor of the assignor cannot rise higher than that of the assignor himself. The attaching creditor stands in the shoes of his debtor as to the property attached. In this case the agreement of Mrs. Patton to pay the debts of Josiah Snyder, for which he made the assignment of the last two instalments of his judgment against Walker, was made by and through her husband, so that the contract and assignment both had his assent. Part of the debts of Snyder she paid before the service of the attachment, and the remainder she has since paid. The assignment of the two instalments was a complete and executed transaction before the attachment issued. The fact that it was a verbal transfer cannot change the effect of the act. It was not an agreement for a future transfer, but a present security given by Snyder to secure her in making the payments for him. The payments to be made by her were the consideration only, and not a condition to the vesting of title in her to the instalments. Therefore, when the plaintiff <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>issued his attachment, the title to the instalment had already vested in her, and was beyond the reach of the writ unless she were incapable of accepting a transfer, or she had avoided the assignment to her by refusing to perform the agreement which constituted its consideration. The attaching creditor could not avoid it by his option alone. That a married woman can take property by purchase is very clear: Bacon’s Abridg. tit. <em>Baron &amp; Feme, </em>Div. 1; Kutz’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%2090" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="4 Wright 90">4 Wright 90</a>; Williams’ Appeal, 11 Id. 309-10; Wieman <em>v. </em>Anderson, 6 Id. 311; Bortz <em>v. </em>Bortz and Wife, 12 Id. 382; Manderbach <em>v. </em>Mock, 5 Casey 43. There was no question here as to the rights of-the husband of Mrs. Patton, as he had assented to the assignment to his wife, and the plaintiff was not his creditor.</p>
