Craver and Philip Craver, plaintiffs and claimants, and D. J. Miller &amp; Co., H. &amp; J. Meyers and J. H. Shaffer, defendants, who had issued executions against Jacob Craver. Jacob Craver was the brother of the plaintiffs. He had been carrying on a store, <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>and was also extensively engaged in manufacture of staves and shooks at five different places. On the 29th of March 1869, by an agreement under seal, he sold to the plaintiffs for $7000 all his staves and shooks, and the interest he had in the several shops, with all the tools, &amp;c., all his personal property whatever, including household furniture, farming implements, horses and carriages and store goods, &amp;e. Part of the consideration was an indebtedness of $2948 from Jacob to the plaintiffs, and for the balance they gave four notes, the first of $1052, payable on the 1st of April 1870, and the remainder in annual payments of $1000 each, the last being due on the 1st of April 1873. The defendants issued executions against Jacob Craver; — Miller &amp; Co. on the 8th of May 1869, H. &amp; J. Meyers on the 14th of May, and Shaffer on the 11th of August. On these executions levies were made on the property sold to the plaintiffs by Jacob as his property. On the 11th of August each of the defendants issued an attachment execution, and attached the notes given by the plaintiffs to Jacob for the balance of the purchase-money of the goods.</p>

      <em>■“ </em>They contend that it is a fraud in law, because there was no change of the possession of the property sold, that the business was carried on after the alleged sale precisely as it had been conducted theretofore, and that the sale was clandestine and private, and unknown to any person except the parties to the transaction, until after the executions were ordered and issued,</p>

"We believe this position to be supported by the case of Kepner <em>v. </em>Burkhart, 5 Barr 478, recognised as good law in The York County Bank <em>v. </em>Carter, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20455" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Wright 455">2 Wright 455</a>. We can conceive of no more effectual mode of delaying a man’s creditors than that adopted by Jacob Craver. It is not a sufficient answer to this to say that the defendants have attached the money due from the plaintiffs to their brother Jacob. We instruct you, therefore, that the defendants are entitled to your verdict on this ground alone, if there was nothing else in the ease.] * * * When actual fraud is alleged it must be proved, and to justify a verdict adverse to the plaintiffs it must be made to appear that the plaintiffs combined with their brother to protect his property from the grasp of his creditors, knowing his insolvency. There may be and doubtless are some circumstances in the case to excite the suspicion of unfair dealing and a purpose to defraud, but that is not enough— the demands of the plaintiffs against their brother appear to be honest, and if they were only actuated by a desire to secure their claims they had a right, for the purpose of accomplishing that object, to purchase the property of their brother, and he had a right, so far as the laws of Pennsylvania are concerned, to prefer them. [If it were a question of any importance we would submit to you to say whether the transaction was fraudulent or not. But having already ruled that the transfer from Jacob Craver to his brothers, in view of the fact that the property was sold on long payments, is a fraud in law, the jury need not trouble themselves about the fraud in fact.”] * * *</p>

It was not a sale with retained possession; no such great inadequacy of price as to make it a <em>presumptio juris et de jure </em>that it was fraudulent, nor were the terms of payment so conclusive as to justify the presumption. We think the learned judge greatly erred in pronouncing that the transaction was fraudulent <em>per </em>se.' It was altogether a question of fact for the jury. If the plaintiff’s evidence were true, and that was for the jury, there was no fraud in fact, but it was for them to say. It is said that it is essential in order to a valid sale of property, that it must be removed from the premises of the vendor, or he from the possession of the goods. The last was this case.</p>

It was a question of fact, and should have gone to the jury. I do not regard Kepner <em>v. </em>Burkhart, 5 Barr 478, nor York County Bank <em>v. </em>Carter, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20455" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Wright 455">2 Wright 455</a>, as authority for the ruling in this case.</p>
