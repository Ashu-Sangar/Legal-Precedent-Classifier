The prisoner’s counsel then applied to the attorney-general for his consent to a writ of error, under the 33d section of the Act of 1860. This section applies to writs of error in all cases of indictment in the Courts of Quarter Sessions and Oyer and Terminer, and does not embrace the cases of murder and voluntary manslaughter, specially provided for in the 57th, 58th and 59th sections of the same act, confining the allowance of the writ to the Supreme Court, as before stated, The Act of 1860 is a revision of all the criminal laws of the state by a learned commission, headed by that eminent criminal lawyer, Judge King. It cannot be supposed they intended the several parts of the act to conflict with each other. The limitation to thirty days, and to. cause shown to the court <em>in bane, </em>or one of its judges, is incompatible with the issuing of a writ of error upon the mere consent of the attorney-general, at any time afterward. The attorney-general, however, from motives of humanity, and the point not having before arisen in practice, gave his consent, and the writ of error was issued and heard before us, at Philadelphia. But the defendant having failed to bring up his bills of exceptions under the 59th section of the Act of 1860, it became evident that the writ of error then before us brought up nothing but the common-law record, in which it was not pretended there was any error. The judgment of the Court of Oyer and Terminer was of course affirmed. Thus the case passed into final judgment; for the affirmance being by the highest court in the state, there could be .no writ of error to it.

The case of Paul Schoeppe having been decided before the passage of the act, he has obtained a second writ of error from the prothonotary, claiming it as a matter of right under the late act, and this writ is now before us. The Commonwealth, relying on the judgment of affirmance under the former writ, has pleaded that judgment in bar of this writ. The Act of 1870 applies only to future writs of error, and to those pending in this court when the law was passed. Final judgment having been rendered, and the record remitted on the 14th of February, the case was not pending before us on the 15th, when the law was <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>passed.

The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Mayloy, 7 P. F Smith 291, decided against the exercise of this power by the Courts of Quarter Sessions and Oyer and Terminer, after the expiration of the term, notwithstanding a rule had been entered to show cause against the sentence. The same reasons therein given would seem to apply as well to this court. The fact that we act as a court of review to correct the errors of lower courts, does not seem to justify a revision of our own final judgments. The law requires an end of litigation, and, admitting the power, litigation may never come to an end ; for the same power will enable us to review the judgment of review, and so on <em>toties quoties. </em>The English authorities are against the power, and there appear to be no good reasons for its exercise in this state, that do not exist elsewhere. The power being admitted after the first term has passed,.there is no limitation of time, and the doors of prisons and penitentiaries may be opened at any time before sentence is finally executed. This clearly would be an infringement of the pardoning power, in our ease, as much as it could be affirmed of the judges of the inferior courts. In times of high excitement, a change of judges would often be the signal for a change in judgments, upon cases exciting the popular mind. But, granting the existence of the power, for we do not decide it at this time, it is very clear it can be exercised by us only where we have made a mistake, or committed an error which justice requires us to rectify. Judicial discretion is not the pleasure of the court, nor the arbitrary result of our will, hut is governed by sound judgment founded on good reason and controlled by a conscientious conviction of right. In this case there has been no mistake made, no error which our sense of justice calls upon us to correct. It cannot be pretended that our judgment on the former writ of error was incorrect. We are now as firmly of opinion as then, that the defendant had his day under the Act of 1860, and no remedy remained to him under that act. We are now as firmly of the opinion as then, that the writ of error consented to by the attorney-general was improvidently issued, and brought up with it nothing but the common-law record. If, <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>therefore, we should now open the judgment in that case, it would he an act of questionable power in the first place, and one of mere sympathy in the second; and not the exercise of a sound judicial discretion.</p>
    <p id="b58-6" data-blocks='[["BL_58.4",58,[299,606,1161,771]]]'>But, should we permit sympathy to override judgment, how is the defendant’s situation bettered ? The former writ of error was not pending at the passage of the Act of 1870, and therefore not then within its terms. If not then within the law, nothing but another law can place it there. Ours is not the power of legislation, and the moment we determine judicially, as we must, that the case was not within the law, no act of ours nor effort of ours, can bring it within the law. If not then pending, the fact of opening the judgment and making it a writ now pending, does not draw it within the folds of the law by any retro-operation of ours; but we are merely sent back to the case as it stood when final judgment was rendered before the passage of the law. We can have before us nothing but what we then had before us, and that was the common-law record. If we open it to consider it anew, we consider it not by force of the Act of 1870, for that did not embrace it, but by force only of our judicial discretion, which can remit us only to that which we passed upon before, in order to consider it again.</p>
    <p id="b58-7" data-blocks='[["BL_58.5",58,[299,1376,1157,171]]]'>_ Having, then, no ground of error or mistake in our former judgment, the Act of 1870 having no application, and the defendant being in no better position by the opening of the judgment, we are compelled to decline opening it.</p>
    <p id="b58-8" data-blocks='[["BL_58.6",58,[297,1547,1162,677]]]'>It is not improper, before closing, to say a few words in reference to the Act of 1870, to draw attention to some of its defects, and to the radical change in our criminal jurisprudence it will produce. It was passed for this case, but owing to the governor’s veto it came too late. It is another evidence that laws which are the offspring of feeling are seldom wisely framed. It commands this court to review the <em>evidence, </em>and to determine whether the ingredients to constitute murder in the first degree were proved to exist, and yet, in forgetfulness of the former law, it provides no means to <em>take, preserve </em>and <em>bring up </em>the <em>evidence. </em>This, the first attempt to act.under it, proves its inefficiency, the judge below returning to our certiorari that he was not able to make the return of the evidence. He is not bound by law to take the testimony, or to certify to it. A bill of exception brings up only so much of the evidence as may be required to explain the point of law contained in the bill.</p>
    <p id="b58-9" data-blocks='[["BL_58.7",58,[297,2233,1160,172]],["BL_59.1",59,[197,430,1166,821]]]'>The effect of this law seems not to have excited attention. It has changed the whole doctrine of the criminal law as to the speed and certainty of punishment, and left to the felon both the hope and a door of escape, not only from the law’s delay, but by prison <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>breach, and all the various means of avoiding retributive justice. At this moment two cases occur to my memory of convictions of murder in Allegheny county, delayed by dilatory motions, where the prison-doors opened by unknown means, and the prisoners escaped for ever. Any murderer may, under this law — though, like Prohst, he may have murdered a whole family — take out his writ of error, without limitation of time or condition, whether in prison under sentence, or stepping upon the trap of the gallows, with cause or without it, and suspend- his case until the next term of the Supreme Court. No one could condemn him if, the death-warrant not preventing, he should wait till the term of the Supreme Court he passed, and then take out his writ of error to delay the execution of his sentence for a whole year. That only security to the public, the examination of the case and allowance of the writ for cause, is repealed. To us, as judges, it makes no difference, for to us it is immaterial whether we hear civil or criminal cases. Indeed, it is more easy to decide on the merits of the evidence in a criminal case, than upon a difficult and abstruse question of law in' a complicated civil case.</p>
