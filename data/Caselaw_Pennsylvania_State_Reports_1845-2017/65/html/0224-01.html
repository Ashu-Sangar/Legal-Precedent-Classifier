Henry died before February 1864, probably in the fall of 1863, intestate, leaving a widow Eliza and four children, James, Liza, wife of David A. Baker, and Livingston Gr. and and Lois, both of whom were minors. Administration of his estate was granted to James Parshall, who filed an inventory amounting to $70. The decedent’s debts amounted to about $2000, of which about $1500, including the above judgment of Grrandin, were liens. On the 7th of April 1864, the widow and the two adult children made a power of attorney to Parshall authorizing him to sell or lease their interest in the decedent’s real estate for such price as he should think fit.

In May or June 1864, Parshall entered into a negotiation with J. W. Snedeker for the sale of his refinery and the Cleland farm and the Henry farm, the three to be sold together; the negotiation resulted in a conditional sale of <em>the </em>whole for $18,000; the conditions were that Snedeker’s partners should approve of the contract, and that other persons to whom Parshall had given the refusal should not accept within a week. This bargain was afterwards consummated by an absolute sale at the sum above stated which was to be paid cash. The title of the <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>Henry farm being encumbered with the lease to Brown and also with the liens above mentioned, in order to pass a clear title to Snedeker it was determined to have this farm sold at sheriff’s sale under the Grandin judgment which had been entered before the date of the lease. Accordingly on the 14th of July 1864, Parshall suggested the death of Henry on the record, and substituted his name as administrator. On the same day a fi. fa. was issued, and Parshall waived an inquisition. On the 16th of August, the Henry farm was sold by the sheriff to Snedeker for $2200 under an understanding with Parshall, that whatever sum Snedeker should pay at that sale was to be credited on the whole purchase-money of $18,000. The sheriff’s deed was acknowledged September 7th, and on the same day J. L. Grandin was appointed guardian of the two minor children of Henry. About the last of September, the whole property purchased by Snedeker passed into the hands of The New York and Allegheny Oil Company, which had been organized on the property; the par value of the stock was $5 per share. Parshall received 1000 shares of this company at $2000, the remainder of the consideration, except Snedeker’s bid at the sheriff’s sale was paid to Parshall in cash.</p>

The accountant claims that he made the sale hereinafter mentioned of the 265 acres of land aforesaid, under the said contract and power of attorney, and that he is liable to account only to the estate for the $7000 therein mentioned. But <em>t </em>the auditor is of opinion that this claim of the administrator is groundless for the following, reasons among others: Because neither L. Gr. Henry nor Lois Henry, the minor children, were parties to the contract and power of attorney, nor had they any guardian or other person competent to bind them <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>as parties thereto. Nor did the widow, Eliza Henry, or Betsey Baker or James Henry, by the said contract and power of attorney, assume to act for the said minor children, but for their respective interests alone. Nor was there at any time any person competent to ratify any such arrangement for or on behalf of such minor children.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b228-6" data-blocks='[["BL_228.4",228,[307,712,1159,600]]]'>“ The auditor is also of the opinion that the contract and power of attorney was not at the time of the consummation of the sale hereinafter mentioned operative to bind the interests of the parties who signed it for the following reasons: First, the said contract and power of attorney manifestly were based upon the supposition that Parshall was to make private sale of the interests of Eliza Henry, Betsey Baker and James Henry, and no sale ever was made by Parshall under the power of attorney or the contract. The evidence shows that at the time Parshall commenced negotiating the sale to Snedeker, and after the making of the contract and power of attorney, he had a negotiation with other parties for a private sale, but that was never consummated. And it may have been with reference to such expected sale that the power of 'attorney was given and contract executed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b228-7" data-blocks='[["BL_228.5",228,[305,1311,1157,1111]]]'>“But second, whether it was or not, by the express terms of these papers they were to be null and void unless the sum of $7000 should be paid to said Eliza, Betsey and James by the 1st day of July, A. D. 1864. And it is not pretended that any sum of money was paid to them or either of them until long after-wards. Third, Parshall himself does not appear to have regarded this contract and power of attorney as a subsisting agreement. When he files his administration account he does not charge himself with, or make mention of the $7000 which he was clearly bound to charge himself with, so far at least as the minor children were concerned, even if the claim he sets up as to those of full age who signed the papers was correct. Fourth, there is no evidence that Eliza Plenry, Betsey Baker or James Henry, after the 1st of July 1864 did, either expressly or by implication, extend the time for the sale under the power of attorney and contract. Fifth, the receipts for moneys paid to Eliza Henry and Betsey Baker and J. L. Grandin, hereto attached, afford to the mind of the auditor no evidence from which it can be inferred that the parties intended thereby to revive the agreement and power of attorney of the 7th of April, A. D. 1864. On the contrary the receipts upon their face bear testimony that when they were written and signed, no such thing was intended by the parties signing them. Nor does the parol evidence afford justification for any such conclusion. And in this connection the auditor calls attention to the receipt signed Betsey Baker-and David Baker, dated October 8th 1864.</p>

He mingled the property of the estate of Henry with his own, and sold the whole for a gross sum, thereby disposing of sixty-three acres of his own lands, not treated by the purchasers or Parshall as valuable, and thereby disposing of a refinery which had not been in use for a considerable time; he takes stock in his own name in lieu of cash; he receives dividends thereon, and appropriates them to his own use; and he refuses to account for and denies his liability to account to the estate for the moneys received from Snedeker, and for the stock and dividends thereon.</p>

The mode suggested in the argument of the counsel of the appellant for apportioning the amount produced by the sale of the three items of property — the farm belonging to the heirs of Henry — and the Cleland tract and refinery belonging to the accountant, — which he sold together, is certainly ingenious, but there is nothing in the testimony to support it. It is very clear that the high price of the whole was obtained because <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>of its being oil territory, and that the Henry farm in that respect was by far the most valuable, and without it there probably could have been no sale of the rest. The refinery of course was entirely independent, and the auditor arrived at the value of that not on his own knowledge, but as he states from the weight of the testimony. The fact which he mentions that he was well acquainted with it certainly did not disqualify him from forming a correct judgment. The accountant has no reason to complain of the report in this particular.</p>
    <p id="b234-6" data-blocks='[["BL_234.4",234,[337,837,1162,1630]],["BL_235.1",235,[192,445,1171,1170]]]'>We concur with the auditor and the court in thinking that under the circumstances the appellant was liable to account for the full amount of what he received from the sale of the real estate of the decedent. The agreement of April 7th 1864 certainly did not bind the interest of the minors, who were not parties to it; but looking at the subject-matter — a subject of speculation in an excited market — we think that time was made of the essence of the contract. This is strongly confirmed by the letter of attorney of the same date to the appellant to sell. It is not easy to see for what pui’pose that power was given, if the intention was an absolute and unconditional sale in the ordinary way. The consideration was to be paid on or before July 1st 1864, otherwise the contract was to be void and of no effect. Construing these two papers together, the agreement seems to have been that if $7000 were paid on or before the time stipulated,- Parshall was to be the owner; but if not, then any sale made by him under the power was to be for the benefit of the heirs. It appears that at the time the contract was made Parshall had agreed that a purchaser should have the refusal of the property. At least he stated to Snedeker in May or June that he was under such an arrangement, and it certainly was incumbent on him to have produced that party, and shown when and for what price he had agreed. It is very doubtful whether a court of equity would have enforced the contract against those who signed it. Parshall stood in a relation of confidence towards them which made it necessary for him to show affirmatively that his conduct in the transaction had been perfectly fair and open, and that the demand for the property in the market was communicated to them. Re that as it may, when he failed to pay or procure an extension of the time on the 1st of July, he was no longer vendee but administrator and agént. When therefore he made the contract with Snedeker, he must be regarded as acting for the estate and the heirs whom he represented. To secure a good title he arranged with the purchaser that there should be a sheriff’s sale under a judgment against the decedent, and that whatever he should be obliged to bid and pay in order to obtain such title should be credited on account of the agreed price. It is very clear that an administrator who takes this course may be rightfully surcharged in his account with the <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>whole sum received by him, just as if that sum had been paid to the sheriff, and the balance after the payment of liens paid to him as administrator. The heirs are not to be turned over to a common-law action against him for the amount. The appellant contends, however, that according to the ruling of this court in Fisk <em>v. </em>Sarber, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 18" data-case-ids="480095" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0018-01">6 W. &amp; S. 18</a>, and other cases, he could himself have become the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale under the judgment; but the doctrine of that case must be received with the necessary qualification that the judicial sale has not been brought about by the act or procurement of the trustee. Nothing is clearer than that if a trustee or agent with power to sell makes a private sale, and it is arranged that his vendee shall become the purchaser at a judicial sale which is to follow, he must answer to his cestuis que trust for the amount actually received, and not merely that at which it was bid off. It would not have altered the case if Parshall himself had bought at the sheriff’s sale and taken a deed to himself, if it could be shown that he had a previous contract under which a much larger price was paid for the property. Under the facts as reported by the auditor the sheriff’s sale in this case was resorted to simply to make a title to the purchaser under the contract, which had been before privately made by the appellant. Nor do we think that the heirs were estopped or concluded by their receipts. In order to make them available for such a purpose, it was incumbent on the appellant to have shown that the facts of the case were fully known by or communicated to them. The same remark applies to the paper filed by James Henry in the ejectment suit.</p>
    <p id="b235-6" data-blocks='[["BL_235.4",235,[185,1613,1167,861]],["BL_236.1",236,[332,455,1164,300]]]'>But we think the léarned court below erred in surcharging the appellant with $2750 on account of the stock received by him as part of the purchase-money of the entire property. Even if he is to be held liable for the highest price of that stock at any time after the purchase, it ought to be added to the purchase-money and apportioned as well as the money received in cash. It is to be recollected however that a considerable part of this purchase-money was indubitably Parshall’s own — certainly more than the sum in cash for which this stock was taken. He took the stock in his own name and mixed it with other stock of his own. He never could have pretended to have a right to throw this stock upon the estate or heirs of Henry. As administrator or as agent he had no right to accept it in payment. It was no part of the original agreement that it should be so taken. It was an investment by Parshall of that part of the purchase-money which belonged to himself. It was in effect the same as if he had received the cash, and with it purchased the stock. The auditor therefore, very properly we think, laid this investment out of view, and charged the accountant with the cash for which the stock was received. Ho doubt if the entire purchase-money had belonged to Henry’s <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>estate, he might have been liable for all that he could have made at any time by the sale of the stock. But in a ease so peculiarly circumstanced as this, where a trustee receives an amount in gross to part of which he is clearly entitled in his individual capacity, and accepts in part payment, stock or securities taken in his own name, it is an unequivocal indication that they are received for that part which belongs to himself.</p>
