It is necessarily consequential, but is directed to be paid. That it was not paid nor secured before possession taken or injury occurred is not a constitutional requirement: McKinney <em>v. </em>Monongahela Nav. Co., 2 Harris 65; and its non-payment does not change the remedy to enforce it. In this ease the remedy would cover the claim if otherwise good: Buckwalter <em>v. </em>Blackrock Bridge Co., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20281" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Wright 281">2 Wright 281</a>.
