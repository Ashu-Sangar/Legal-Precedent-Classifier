To prove by Philip Smyser, that in the year 1850, John Emig, Sr., requested him to draw a deed of conveyance from himself to his daughter Sarah for the land in dispute. That witness prepared such a deed and handed it to said Emig, who soon afterwards exhibited said deed to witness. That when said deed was so exhibited to witness it had been signed by said Emig and witnessed by one subscribing witness, and that there was also a certificate of acknowledgment duly signed, upon said deed. That said Emig then and there declared to witness that said deed was right, and requested witness to sign it as an additional subscribing witness, which he did, by writing his name under the words, “ signed sealed and delivered in presence of us.” That said Emig soon afterwards notified Moul, then the tenant on said farm, under said Emig, that he was no longer the owner of said farm, that it “ now belongs to Sarah and you must rent it from her.” To be followed by proof by other witnesses that said Emig, soon after the execution of said deed, declared that he was no more the owner of said farm', that “it now belongs to my daughter Sarah.” That soon after the execution of said deed, said John Emig, Sr., declared to other witnesses, in the presence of said Sarah, that she had given him all her writings to take care of for her as long as he lived ; and that he had put them in a tin box together with his own papers and had placed said box in the vaults of the York Bank for safety against fire. That after the marriage of said Sarah, said John Emig, Sr., was requested by his son Michael to give Sarah her writings; that he refused and said Sarah had given him her writings and money to take care of for her as long as he lived and he would do it. That at the death of said John Emig, Sr., (in February 1868), said tin box containing-a number of deeds and other valuable papers, was found in possession of his son John Emig, Jr.-, one of the defendants; and <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>

To be followed by proof that from and after the time of the formal execution and delivery of said deed, said John Emig, Sr., acted as the agent of said Sarah in the leasing and management of said farm; in the collecting of the rents, issues and'profits thereof; and that from time to time he declared to numerous witnesses that the farm now belonged to her, that he was acting and managing it for her as her agent; that she was to “ pay nothing out” on said farm, because the rest of his children had been advanced in money and she had not. This latter part of the offer is not for the purpose of showing title or the creation of estate, but as corroborative evidence from which the jury may infer the <em>actual </em>delivery of said deed to the grantee, plaintiff in this suit.</p>

John brought the box out of another room. John opened the box. Valentine brought the key there and laid it on the piano. John hunted'in it for the will. Then I got up and was going to walk there to the box. Then John held his two hands over the box, and said, ‘ here nobody has any right to hunt, except we, for the will.’ Then I went back to my chair and sat down. Then John hunted in it, for the will. Then Valentine reached into the box too, and took out some papers— writings. When he drew it out, it was the deed, parchment it was, from George Emig to father for the place that father bought. So they said, I didn’t look in it. Valentine said so. He had it nearly open the whole width and looked in it a little while. Then Eli went there and said he should give it to him once, and he did. Then Eli sat down and looked in the deed, what he wanted to see. Then Valentine took out the same pack again, and pulled out a new paper and opened it pretty large, and still looked in it, but when Valentine was taking out the papers, John said he should let them be. Valentine then looked over it a little yet, and then folded it and put it back. Then John found the will. That new paper was folded like a deed. It was something larger than a sheet of foolscap, but he hadn’t it fully open. I say this was a new paper, because the others were old papers. I didn’t examine it or I could have told. These things were then put back in the box, and the will was then read. That I believe was all that there was there then. I was present afterwards at my brother John’s, when the appraisement was made. I don’t remember how long afterwards. The box was opened then in presence <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>of the appraisers. John produced the box again. I don’t know whether one of the appraisers opened it or not, but I think John did. Then the appraisers searched through the papers and appraised what they had to appraise. I was about eight feet from the box, perhaps not quite so far, sitting back, while the appraisers were searching through the papers. I took sharp notice when they took that same pack of papers, and that new paper was not in any more. No person said anything that I heard at that time about that paper. Mr. Diehl was there. I can’t remember whether Mr. Diehl said anything at that time about that paper.”</p>

The effect of such proof is of equal force in sustaining the title of the grantee as if the deed itself had been presented. This is so <em>ex necessitate rei, </em>otherwise titles might be defeated by fraud or accident, without fault on part of the vendee, and in disregard of the consideration for the conveyance. A rule like this would he so obviously unjust that it could not exist in any civilized land. A near equivalent of such a rule, would be any rule which should render such proof impracticable by technical requirements,or to the order of proof; such for instance as the requirement of perfect proof in the theory of a 'first step taken before a second should be attempted. All competent evidence in such a case should be received when offered, whether in logical sequence or not, especially if offered to be followed by what would make out a complete case if believed. When the testimony is in, it is the duty of the judge to inform the jury what the law requires to be extracted from the body of it in order to make out a good and valid case in law, and what effect a failure to do so would have. A party must begin with his proof somewhere; and where, is less important a great deal than its completeness. A judge will look at the latter with great care as being of the very essence of the contest, and at the former as a desirable result rather than an essential one.</p>

It was not only orderly but essential. It went to prove <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>tbe drawing of a deed by a scrivener at tbe request of the grantor, John Emig, Sr., for the land in question to his daughter Sarah, and to establish its execution and delivery to her. The witness saw it after he had drawn it as requested; and it ,was completely executed by the grantor’s signature in the presence of a witness, and was duly acknowledged before a magistrate. It was produced by the grantor, it is trfle, but simply to obtain what he supposed was necessary in order to make it valid as a complete conveyance. The signatures of the witnesses, and. more especially the official certificate of the magistrate, attested that the deed was executed and had been delivered. “ Signed, sealed and delivered,” was the solemn statement of the grantor, formally acknowledged before a magistrate,and admitted to the witnesses. In Blight <em>v. </em>Schenk, 10 Barr 285, it was held that such circumstances, unaccompanied by any fact which would countervail their effect, would establish a prirná, facie case of due execution, including delivery, and call upon the other side to rebut their effect by proof of non-delivery. This view was overlooked by the learned judge below; and not only were these facts thought to be no evidence of delivery, but the accompanying proffered facts set forth in the offer were held to be no aids in the establishment of the material fact. The auxiliary proof, as it may be called, not only strengthens the presumption of delivery of the deed arising from its acknowledgment, but was itstelf strengthened by that fact. It was offered to show acts and declarations of the grantor, in and out of the presence of his daughter, in exact accordance with the effect of his conveyance, and furthermore how he happened to have possession of the deed. He declared the land hers — told his tenant in effect to attorn to her; told him and others that she owned the land; and he acted as her agent in leasing the farm and collecting rents for her. He took charge of her papers and money to keep for her, as he declared, and at her request, during her life. We are to consider all this as if it had been proved, because in its identity and unimpeached form the court refused to hear it, on the ground that it was inherently insufficient to tend to prove an execution and delivery of the deed. We discharge our duty in this review by simply holding, as we do, that all this was competent testimony, and, if believed, important evidence for the plaintiffs for the purpose for which it was offered, without applying to the features of the case in hand, or to any special features that may be in it — ■ that will be done by the court and jury, aided by counsel when it is re-tried. This assignment of error is therefore sustained.</p>

If a jury should be convinced of the spoliation, it would he their duty to infer anything in favor of the deed as against the spoiler. I do not limit the testimony to this view alone. It may be important in other aspects ; certain it is it ought to have been received. As George Diehl, the husband of the grantee in the deed, will probably be a competent witness for the plaintiff in another trial, under the provisions of the Act of 1870, to prove what is proposed to be proved by him on the last trial, the scope of these offers will he more distinctly apparent. We think the fourth assignment of error is also sustained, independently of this consideration.</p>
    <p id="b328-6" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[292,1205,1159,557]]]'>There seemed to be some appearance of an idea in the mind of the court below,that the ground of the controversy assimilated itself to a case of parol sale, and hence declarations of the grantee could not be given in evidence. The evidence was not to prove a grant or sale by parol, but the existence of a deed containing the terms of a grant. The factum of a grant was not proposed to be proved — but the instrument containing it, and then the contents would show the grant, and the case would not be within the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries. The existence and loss of the deed was a fact <em>in pais, </em>to be proved like any other fact; of course its nature would require clear and full proof of the fact, but this would not exclude the declarations of the grantor, especially when corroborated by actual proof of the existence of the deed at one time.</p>

As the law stood the husband was not a competent witness, although he will be, we think, under the act above referred to, to prove anything occurring since the decease of the decedent, and that was what was proposed to be proved by him. The wife was incompetent under the Act of 1869, and will he under the Act of 1870, to prove what was proposed to be proved by her at the last trial. These errors are therefore not sustained; but the judgment must be reversed for the reasons given above.</p>
