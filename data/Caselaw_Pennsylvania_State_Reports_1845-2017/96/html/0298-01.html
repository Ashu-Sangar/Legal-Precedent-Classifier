The Act of May 4th 1855 recites additional causes for which a wife shall have all the rights and privileges secured to a feme sole trader under the Act of February 22d 1718. And the second section of the Act of 1855 declares that if the husband of said wife, being the owner of lands, shall mortgage or alienate from his wife and children any of said land, without making an equivalent provision for their maintenance in lieu thereof, such mortgage or alienation shall be deemed null and void: <em>Held, </em>that this second section was intended to apply to the wife’s property and not to the real estate of her husband. „</p>

P., who owned a farm, whereon he resided with his wife and family, wilfully deserted them without any provision for their maintenance and never thereafter returned or contributed to their support. Previous to his desertion he had negotiated with M. for a loan, to be secured by a mortgage on the farm, and eight days after the desertion P. received the money and executed the mortgage. It clearly appeared that the mortgage was executed by P. with the intention of its resulting in a judicial sale of the farm and the deprivation of his wife and children of the enjoyment thereof: <em>Held, </em>that as the evidence failed to show any want of good faith in the mortgagee, Or any notice or knowledge of the desertion or intended fraud, the mortgage was valid..</p>

Such a construction would practically prevent the acceptance of a mortgage unless the wife of the mortgagor was present. It would cause great embarrassment and annoyance in the transaction of business and give an effect to the act never intended by its language nor contemplated by its purpose.</p>

The amount of money actually received by him on this mortgage is not clearly disclosed by the evidence, but would seem to have been $4500, but might have been more. The amount named in the mortgage, and secured thereby, was $6380. The mortgage itself was duly recorded in the office for recording deeds in and for said county of Beaver; and afterwards, on the 8th day of August 1871, said A. A. McCarty, the mortgagee, by his attorney in fact, assigned the mortgage to the Duquesne Savings Bank, the defendant in this suit, who, having thus become the owner thereof, afterwards, to No. 153 of November Term 1873, issued a scire facias thereon, to which the sheriff made return that on the 4th day of November 1872, he served the same ‘on the defendant by making contents known, and leaving a true copy with his wife, in his absence.’ There being no appearance by Peter Powell or any one else, and no defence of any kind being taken, judgment was entered on the scire facias against said Peter for $7321. A writ of levari facias issued thereon, and on the 15th'day of March 1873, the land was sold by the sheriff, the defendant in this case becoming the purchaser thereof, and receiving a sheriff’s deed therefor; and although it does not directly appear in the evidence for what price the land sold, yet it seems to be admitted, and may be taken as a fact, that the price at which it was bid off was less than the amount of the' mortgage debt.</p>

Mr. Fetterman, who, it appears, was acting as the attorney of McCarty, the mortgagee, and who, it seems, really did all the business for him, it is claimed, had notice of the acts and intention of the husband, and such notice and knowledge as should and would affect his client; but a careful examination of all the evidence fails to furnish anything showing that he had any knowledge on the subject.

The mortgage was executed on the 22d of April, so that she had knowledge of the mortgage almost immediately after the same was given. The scire facias issued on the mortgage was served by making contents known and giving a true copy thereof to the wife, the plaintiff here, on the 4th November 1872. No defence was taken by her, nor anything done to notify the defendants that she objected to the mortgage, or would contest the same.

It is true, however, that the plaintiff sought legal advice after the mortgage was given and before the sale, but was advised that nothing could be done — that the mortgage would have to be paid; and subsequently, when the land was about to be sold, it seems she employed an attorney, directing him to give notice of her claim at the sale; but no notice, so far as the evidence shows, was given, and after this no further steps were taken by her in the matter until after notice served upon her to give possession of the land.</p>

Peter Powell, the husband, had, at the date of the execution of the mortgage, withdrawn himself from his wife and family; there w'as yet upon the farm, and which might be used by them, certain property that furnished them the means of support for the time being (but which was soon swept away by the sheriff’s sale to satisfy the debts of the husband), but his desertion of his home and family was .complete. It would seem evident, therefore, that his acts toward his wife and family were such as clearly brought the wife within the provisions of the Act of 1855, and entitled her to whatever benefits were <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>secured thereby. These benefits were that she should have all the rights and privileges secured to wives declared feme sole traders under the Act of 1718. One of these rights and privileges secured to a wife declared a feme sole trader by 'that act, as shown by the second section, was that she and his children should have the use of the husband’s real estate within the province, for their maintenance, and that any gift, grant, mortgage, or alienation thereof by the husband that deprived them of this, without an equivalent provision for their maintenance, should be deemed, adjudged, and taken to be void. The negotiations for the loan were begun before he left his family, but his desertion was complete for some time before the same were consummated, and the mortgage executed. The case seems to fall fully within the provisions of the Act of 1718, as extended by the Act of 1855. There does not seem to be any reported case giving judicial construction to this portion of these statutes, yet if they are to be effectual in promoting the purpose that seems to have prompted their enactment, the protection of wives and children from the recklessness, profligacy, or maliciousness of those whose duty it is to protect and' maintain them, it seems to us they must be construed to embrace such cases as the present one, and that this mortgage must be held to be avoided thereby. It is urged that, although it be held that this mortgage falls within the statute, and is therefore declared void, yet as judgment was obtained and a sale effected, of all which the plaintiff had notice, but to which she did not object, it is now too late to urge any objection, and she is estopped from asserting the invalidity of the mortgage, or the title of the defendant. If, however, the statute avoids the mortgage, we do not see how any proceedings thereon, even with her knowledge, unless they were promoted or in some way furthered or encouraged by her, should stop her. She was not a party in any way to the proceedings; she merely remained silent — did nothing — but in this there was no fraud on her part. So long as she was not actually disturbed in possession of the land, we do not perceive any duty on her part to take any measures to have the mortgage declared void. It undoubtedly is a hardship to defendant to lose what was supposed to be an ample security for its money, especially as there seems to have been no bad faith on its part, no knowledge of the desertion by the husband, the mortgagor, nor of his intention by this means to alienate the land from his wife and family, leaving them without the means of' maintenance, but we do not see how it is possible to avoid this, and at the same time secure to the wife and children that protection which it was the design of the statutes to afford. So far as the present defendant is concerned, an inquiry at the date of the assignment would no doubt have led to a knowledge of the desertion; and the same may be said of the mortgagee. An inquiry at the date of the mortgage, properly directed, would have revealed the <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>same facts, which it is now claimed render the mortgage void. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant cannot legally disturb the plaintiff in her possession of the land, and that the mortgage should be held as void.</p>

The judicial proceedings upon the mortgage, of which the plaintiff had actual notice, and to which she made'no defence or objection, conclude her, and cannot'be avoided in this collateral suit. 3. The silence and acquiescence of plaintiff was a fraud upon the mortgagee and his assignee, the plaintiff in error; therefore she is estopped from asserting her alleged right under the Act of May 4th 1855. 4. The judgment on the mortgage, and the title acquired under it, were conclusive against Peter Powell, if not so against his Avife; therefore the decree was erroneous in that it perpetually enjoined the defendant from setting up any title to the land.</p>

On the 14th April 1871, Powell left his home and family on the farm in Beaver county, where he and they had been residing for a year or more, and never returned nor contributed anything thereafter to their support and maintenance. It was a wilful desertion without any just cause and without any intention of returning. He has since been living with another woman as his wife in Ohio. Prior to this desertion he had entered into negotiations with one McCarty for a loan of money to be secured by mortgage on this farm. Before closing it the attorney of McCarty went out and examined the farm. Powell and his family were living together on it. The arrangement was closed by his executing the mortgage and receiving the money in Pittsburgh on the 22d April 1871. He left his family <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>in possession of the farm, and of personal property consisting of horses, cattle, farming implements, household goods, &amp;e.

The other a denial of power to such absent husband to sell or mortgage his lands without making an equivalent provision for the maintenance of his family.</p>
    <p id="b305-7" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[147,1871,1170,559]]]'>Thus the Act of 1718 dealt only with cases where the husband had gone to sea and allowed the wife to deal in and manage personal .property. The second section of the Act of 4th May 1855 states other causes for which a wife shall have all the rights and privileges secured to a feme sole trader under the Act of 1718. She shall have them whenever her husband from drunkenness, profligacy or other cause, shall neglect or refuse to provide for her or shall desert her. The section then proceeds to enlarge the subject-matter to which her powers shall apply. It declares “ her property real and personal howsoever acquired shall be subject to her free and absolute disposal during life, or by will, without any liability to be interfered with or obtained by such husband, and in case of her intestacy shall go to her next of kin as if he were Dreviously dead.”</p>

      <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>Thus it appears her rights and powers to enjoy, sell, devise and transmit, her own property are enlarged; but no reference whatever is made to his lands or to restricting his powers in regard thereto. The first section of the act restricts the right of a married woman in devising all her property to the prejudice of her husband. The third specifies under what circumstances she shall have all the rights of a father over their children. The fourth provides the manner in which she may obtain a d'ecree of the court affirming her power to transact business. The fifth states certain acts of the husband which shall exclude him from claiming any right or title in the real or personal estate of his deceased wife, as tenant by the courtesy or under the intestate laws. The sixth states what act of the father towards his child shall ba;r his right to appoint a testamentary guardian for said child.</p>

The second section can have a fair, just and reasonable effect given to its language by holding, as we do, that it was intended to apply to the wife’s property and not to the real estate of her husband.</p>
    <p id="b306-7" data-blocks='[["BL_306.5",306,[245,1259,1163,516]]]'>Every part of this transaction show's entire good faith in. the mortgagee and in the purchaser. The examination of the farm, which induced the acceptance of the mortgage, was made a few weeks only before its execution. Although the mortgagor had been absent from his home and family for eight days when he executed it, a fact unknown to the mortgagee, and in regard to which he was not bound to inquire, the instrument was not thereby made null and void. Such a construction would practically prevent the acceptance of a mortgage, unless the wife of the mortgagor was present. It would cause great embarrassment and annoyance in the transaction of business, and give an effect to the act never intended by its language nor contemplated by its purpose.</p>
