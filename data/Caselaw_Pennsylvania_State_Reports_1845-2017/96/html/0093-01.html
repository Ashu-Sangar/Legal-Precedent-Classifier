But afterwards, on the 9th of January 1876, on motion of Alfred Patterson, the order making said rule was rescinded: and on the 10th of March 1876, the motion to strike off said judgment was withdrawn by Mr. Schoyer, defendant’s attorney, he being at that time also the attorney for Mrs. Nancy B.

But his administrator, Henry W. Patterson, filed such an account after the death of the said Alfred Patterson ; and this is the account now in controversy, the matter in dispute being the credit taken in said account for the sum of $8694.53 appropriated to the aforesaid judgment. Exceptions were filed to the allowance'of such credit by Cyrus Clark, Jr., the present administrator <em>de bonis </em>non, of the said S. M. Kier, deceased, and also by a number of the creditors of said estate, on the ground, as they contended, that said judgment was not entitled to priority over other debts of the decedent in the distribution of the fund.

It was claimed on behalf of Mr. Patterson; (1) That his judgment could not be attacked collaterally; it appeared upon its face to have been entered against Mr. Kier in his lifetime, and must be presumed in this proceeding to have been in fact so entered; and (2) that the lien of his judgment related by a legal fiction to the beginning of the day on which it was entered, and therefore antedated the death of Mr. Kier, and is entitled to priority of payment by reason thereof.</p>

F. Smith 232; Roumfort <em>v. </em>McAlarney, 1 Norris 193. The twenty-fifth section of the Act of February 24th 1834, Purd. Dig. 422, pi. 89, makes ‘ all judgments which at the time of the death of the defendant are liens on his real estate * * * rank according to their priority at the time of such death.’ The twenty-second section of the same act, Purd. Dig. 421, pi. 85, provides for ‘ all debts other than these:’ Ramsey’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%2073" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="4 Watts 73">4 Watts 73</a>. In the absence of provision for the priority of lien of judgments entered subsequently to the.‘time of death,’ it must be presumed that no priority was intended to be given. <em>JSxpressio unius exalusio alterius. </em>And without statute it cannot exist. ‘It is a fundamental doctrine in the Pennsylvania law of decedents, that the legal character and effect of a debt due by a decedent’s estate is to be collected from what was its condition at the decease of the debtor. If it was specialty or simple contract, then such it continues, so far as respects the order of its payment, although it has passed into a judgment in a suit brought by the creditor against the executors or administrators of the deceased:’ Wootering <em>v. </em>Stewart, <a href="/yeates/2/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Yeates 483" data-case-ids="812745" data-case-paths="/yeates/2/0483-01">2 Yeates 483</a>; Moliere’s Lessee <em>v. </em>Noe, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Dall.%20450" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="4 Dall. 450">4 Dall. 450</a>; Penn Bank <em>v. </em>Stambaugh’s Adm’rs, 13 S. &amp; R. 399; Fryhoffer <em>v. </em>Busby, 17 Id. 121. This doctrine holds equally good whether the question to be determined be, whether a debt is entitled to rank in the order of payment as a judgment; or, whether an admitted judgment .is or is not a lien. The <em>rationale </em>of each is the same, viz., that at the death of the debtor his estate, real and personal-, stands pledged by operation of <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>law for the payment of his debts; that the actual appropriation of his estate for this purpose, although postponed for reasons of convenience, is supposed to be made immediately on his decease, consequently the condition of claims against him as they stood at his decease are to be regarded; no particular creditor, who may-have lost an advantage by laches during the lifetime of the debtor, being permitted to regain his loss at the expense of others, who in abstract equity stand equal to himself.</p>

Nor is there any particular hardship in this, more than the creditor might have suffered from his laches, even living his debtor. If in either of the enumerated cases the judgment-creditor had sold his land, the purchaser would have held it discharged of the lien of the judgment; why then, if he should die while judgments against him stand in this condition, should not his general creditors occupy as favorable a position as a purchaser under him?

A satisfactory answer to this question may be found in the opinion of the court in Leiper <em>v. </em>Levis, 15 S. &amp; R. 108. That was a case in which an execution had been issued after the death of the debtor, and was sought to be made effective by the fiction of relation- to the first of the term in which the debtor had died: but the principle of the two cases is the same. Rogers, J., said : ‘ The practice of Pennsylvania is too well settled to be now shaken, that a judgment may be entered or execution issued after the death' of the defendant, and that the execution has relation to the -first day of the preceding term. This legal fiction works no injustice between the parties themselves or their legal representatives, and may be justified by the consideration that the practice facilitates the collection of debts certainly due, from an estate acknowledged to be solvent. If we were now, for the first time, to consider whether legal relations and legal fictions should be introduced, it would perhaps be wise to inquire into, and sift most minutely, the foundation on which they were supported. This, however, is not a case where rights of the parties only are involved, but it concerns creditors and the responsibilities of administrators. It is the case of an insolvency, and an attempt, by means of a legal fiction, to deprive other creditors <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>of a vested right. * * * Fictions were not intended to do injustice, nor should they be permittted to interfere with the operation of a most beneficial statute.’ The court then recites the eleventh section of the Act of 1794, which was substantially re-enacted in the twenty-second section of the Act of 24th February 1834, and goes on to say: ‘ The right of the creditor became vested to be paid in the order pointed out by the act. * * * What, then, is the matter submitted to the court but an attempt, by means of a legal fiction, which was never in the contemplation of the legislature, to change the rights of creditors by mere issuing of an execution after the death of the intestate. Establish the principle contended for by the plaintiff, and it would be unsafe for an executor to pay the funeral expenses. * * * A creditor with a warrant of attorney to confess a judgment would have it in his power to sweep the whole estate in prejudice of debts of equal or superior .degree, contrary as I believe to the manifest interest and policy of the Act of 1794.’ The same principle has been applied in the analogous cases of bankruptcy and voluntary assignment, in which evidence of fractions of a day is admitted with a view to defeat the lien of a judgment : Ex parte D’Obree, <em>supra; </em>Bank <em>v. </em>Gorman, <em><a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20309" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 309">supra</a> ; </em>Boyer’s Est., <em>supra. </em>The time of death of a debtor is therefore an import tant element in the distribution of the estates of decedents. It is a question of fact -which determines the relative rights of creditors, not a fiction; and the admissibility of evidence with respect to that fact must obviously be governed by the exigency of each case. It is competent to show the day or fractions of a day as circumstances seem to require. It is the instant of death that fixes the rights of creditors: McClintock’s Appeal, <em>supra. </em>And judgments afterward, whether on the same day or not, gain no priority, by virtue of their entry, over the claims of general creditors. The only effect of such judgments was to liquidate the amount due and prolong the duration of the claim upon which it was based: Pitts, and Steub.

It is true that the language generally used is .that judgments against personal representatives have no priority; but this means, we think, judgments entered after decedent’s death. If Samuel M. Kier had died one day earlier, which would have been the return-day of the writ, and judgment had been entered as it was entered, surely the judgment would have had no priority. It would have fallen within the class of judgments against personal representatives who would have been substituted on application under the twenty-sixth section of the Act of 1834, Purd.
