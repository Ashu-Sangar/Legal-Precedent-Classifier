Mr. ICaine insists that under the state of the case no sci. fa. could have issued, and that there was a legal necessity sufficient to take the case out of the operation of the Act of the 26th of March 1827, and cites as authority to show that such a case might exist where the lien might be preserved beyond five years without a sci. fa., the cases of Ebright <em>v. </em>The Bank, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20399" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Watts 399">1 Watts 399</a>, and Fulton’s Estate, 1 P. F. Smith 209, 215. If any case could exist where the facts would warrant the court in taking this case out of the operation of the act, it would be difficult to conceive one with stronger points or greater legal necessities than this. It is not necessary to determine here whether, under the circumstances of the case, a sci. fa. to. continue the lien of the opened judgment could at any time have been issued. It seems that such a writ had been issued in the case of Frick’s Appeal, <a href="/watts/1/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Watts 393" data-case-ids="1838085" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0393-01">1 Watts 393</a>, upon a judgment which had been opened and not then determined, and was tacitly, at least, recognised by the Supreme Court .as proper. A judgment of reversal is a judgment of the Supreme Court, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Rawle%2039" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Rawle 39">2 Rawle 39</a>. The several judgments entered on the verdicts in this case which were reversed, were no liens at any time. There is a material distinction in this respect between a judgment opened to let the defendant into a defence, and one reversed and set aside by a higher court. If such judgments before reversal were valid liens, there could have been no necessity for the Act of 17 05, preserving the rights of purchasers at sheriff’s sales, where the judgments on which sales were made should be after-wards reversed. It seems clear, therefore, that while the judgments <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>entered on the verdicts might have the effect of giving notice, they could not have the effect of a revival to continue a iien. Since the Act of the 26th of March 1827, a rule tying up the proceedings would not continue the lien longer than five years : Frick’s Appeal, <a href="/watts/1/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Watts 393" data-case-ids="1838085" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0393-01">1 Watts 393</a>; Ebright <em>v. </em>The Bank, <a href="/watts/1/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Watts 393" data-case-ids="1838085" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0393-01">Id. 399</a>. The Act of the 26th of March 1827, is explicit in declaring that no order or rule of court or any other process or proceeding thereof shall, have the effect of obviating the necessity of a scire facias to continue the lien: Styer’’s Appeal, 9 Harris 89. Under these authorities, even if the judgment of Kaine and Cope remained a lien after it was opened by the court, it had lost its lien on the 1st of July 1872, and was not again restored until the 20th of May 1876. In the distribution of the fund the judgment of Kaine and Cope must therefore be postponed in favor of the judgments entered prior to the latter date.”</p>

The subsequent incumbrancers had notice of the state of the record, for these were not only the first judgments standing on the judgment docket but they still remain there. The five several judgments are the same as one judgment. There is no law, rule or decision, anywhere to be found that decides that where a judgment of the court below is reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded, the judgment on the judgment docket does not remain a lien until the new trial is had and the case is disposed of.</p>

They suffered a period of three years to elapse, to wit, from the 18th of March 1871, to the 27th of April 1874, without any action on their part. The judgment of the appellees was entered during that period.
