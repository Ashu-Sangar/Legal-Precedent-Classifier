Wilson of the city of Meadville, which in substanee set forth: That.on the 17th of May 1855, Theodore S. Minniss was the owner in fee of a lot of ground in the city of Meadville; that on the said 17th of May 1855, the said Minniss executed a mortgage on said lot to H. H. Thompson, conditioned for the payment of $400 on the 17th of May 1863; that on the 24th of March 1857, the said Minniss and wife conveyed the south half of said lot to Silas Taylor, Sr., by deed of general warranty; that on the 16th of November 1864 said Taylor conveyed the south half of said lot to your petitioner by deed, since which time your petitioner has been living on said lot; that a sci: fa. on said mortgage was issued to August term 1875, and returned July 2d 1875, served personally on defendant, Clara S. Minniss, administratrix of the estate of Theodore S. Minniss, deceased, on which sci. fa. the said administratrix appeared January 11th 1877, and confessed judgment for $410; that a writ of levari facias on said judgment was issued to <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>February term 1879, on which the whole of said lot was sold February 8th 1879, to Ezra Cooper, for the sum of $756, and a sheriff’s deed therefor acknowledged <em>to him </em>February 13th 1879. The petitioner further represents that he never knew of the existence of said mortgage; that no writ or process of any kind was ever served on him with reference thereto, and that he had no knowledge that his property had been sold until Friday February 21st 1879; that the title to the north half of said lot remained until said sheriff’s sale in the estate' of the said Theodore S. Minniss, and that said north half of said lot is worth more than said Cooper gave for the whole lot. The .petitioner is informed and believes that said purchase was made by said Cooper in the interest of the estate of said Theodore S. Minniss, and with intent to' procure title to the property of the petitioner. The petitioner therefore prays the court to strike off the confirmation of said sheriff's deed, and to set aside said sheriff’s sale for the purpose of enabling the petitioner to protect the title to his property ; and to the end that no rights may be prejudiced the petitioner offers, in case said sale is set aside, an irrevocable bid of $900 for the north half of said lot of ground, when an order of court directs that that part of the mortgaged premises be first sold.</p>

Minniss was the owner of lot No. 308, being 50 feet by 200 feet, situate on the southwest corner of Liberty and Arch streets, in the city of Mead-ville. On that day he mortgaged these premises to these plaintiffs. On the 24th of March 1857 he conveyed the south half of the premises aforesaid to one Silas Taylor. On the 16th of November 1864 they conveyed the same to Francis E. Wilson, the petitioner in this case.

The deed was acknowledged by the sheriff, and after registry was sent by the prothonotary to Cooper by mail. This sale included the premises sold by the mortgagor twenty-two years ago under which Wilson claims. Two days after acknowledgment of the sheriff’s deed Wilson applied to the court to set the sale aside, and also the acknowledgment of the sheriff’s deed. This was done at the same term, or as soon as Wilson heard the facts, and after the deed had been sent by the prothonotary to Cooper, but before the lapse of <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>time which usually occurs in this county between the acknowledgment of a sheriff’s deed and its final delivery to the purchaser.</p>

Among these other circumstances is the fact, as appears from the evidence taken,' that the sheriff did not advertise the sale properly. No handbills were put up on the south half. It was separate and distinct from the other, made so since the giving of ' the mortgage by the act of -the parties in such purchase and improvement of this south half. It was as much separate and distinct as any other property requiring it, and the notice required by law should have been- given, if it was intended that the property of the terre-tenant should be -sold. But in truth and in fact it was not intended to be sold. Mrs. Minniss, the defendant, testifies that she did not' know the whole lot, that is the terre-tenants’ half, was being sold, and that Cooper, the purchaser, did not know the whole was being sold. Mr. Cooper testifies to the same thing; that the property was advertised as a house and lot, and he supposed he was himself buying Mrs. Minniss’s house and lot, and the house and lot of no one else. The sheriff did not know it, nor did the plaintiff know it. The sheriff took his description from the old mortgage, and of course did not describe two lots and two houses, as seem to have been in fact sold.</p>

Courts of equity have the power to set aside, cancel, annul or reform a private indenture on the ground of fraud, accident or' mistake. Why even in a greater degree have they not the power to set aside or reform the deed of one of their own officers ? There is nothing so sacred about a sheriff’s deed as to prevent the same principles of light and equity being invoked as in the case of private writings executed with all the solemnity required by our laws. In applications of this kind to avoid a sheriff’s sale much must depend on whether the sale or acknowledgment was made through fraud, and with what promptness the application is made. In this case the application was made at the same term, and the moment the applicant could obtain a hearing in court, and before ordinary routine would put the purchaser in possession of the deed. What induced the haste in the purchaser to get possession of the deed does not appear in evidence, but is left to conjecture. • Indeed, from the evidence, I question very much whether the deed was ever effectually and properly delivered.

    <p id="b414-8" data-blocks='[["BL_414.6",414,[252,1122,1159,555]]]'>We have looked through this record in vain to find something upon which we could sustain the action of the court below. The property was sold under a valid judgment, and upon legal process. The sale was duly advertised and a bill posted upon the premises. It is true no bill was posted upon the half -of the lot owned by Cooper, the terre-tenant. The writ followed the mortgage and described it as one property. We have no doubt that relief might have been granted for the -misdescription, had an application been made in proper time. But it was too late after acknowledgment and delivery of the deed and payment of the purchase-money. There must be a point of time when such irregularities are cured. The law fixes the acknowledgment of the sheriff’s deed as that time. Were we to relax this rule we might imperil titles.</p>

The court below concedes that he contemplated no fraud until after the sheriff’s sale. If this be so, and there is nothing in the' case to gainsay it, the mere fact that the purchaser was disposed to hold on to an unexpectedly good bargain does not make out a case of such fraud as the law can recognise. It is a matter that he must settle with his conscience.</p>

The latter took the property subject to the mortgage. It was upon record and was a lien on his property. That he did not know of its existence is not to the purpose. He had record notice and that is sufficient. His ignorance upon this point was the result of his own negligence, and is the source of all his trouble. Had he examined his title when he acquired it he would have discovered the mortgage. This would have been notice that his property was liable to a sale by the sheriff at any time. While the law protects <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>the rights of every citizen when arrested at the proper time and in the proper way, it cannot undertake to correct all the evils which are the result of supine negligence.</p>
    <p id="b415-6" data-blocks='[["BL_415.4",415,[128,522,1166,646]]]'>I have already adverted to the fact that while the order of court directs the purchaser to deliver up his deed for cancellation, there is no provision for a return of the purchase-money until after a resale of the property. In the meantime he is kept out of it as a species of forced loan. There is no authority for this, and yet it is manifest the court below could not have coupled the order for cancelling the deed with an order for the return of the purchase-money, for the reason that the money had been paid to the plaintiff in the writ. Having received it lawfully, and been guilty of no fraud it was beyond the power of the court below to order him to restore it. The effect of the receipt of the money by the plaintiff was to satisfy the writ as well as the judgment upon which it was issued. Both the writ and the judgment were dead, and in this state of the record it is difficult to see how they could be galvanized into life for the purpose of re-selling the property.</p>

For the truth of his return the sheriff is responsible upon his official bond. The sheriff may amend his return by leave of court, but I have never known him ordered to do so. We do not reverse, however, by reason of these irregularities; our object is to call attention to them that -they may be avoided in the future.</p>
