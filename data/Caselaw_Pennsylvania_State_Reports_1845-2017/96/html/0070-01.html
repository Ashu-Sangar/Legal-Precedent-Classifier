Defendants can only escape liability by showing payment or release, neither of which have been set up in the affidavit of defence, and could not, therefore, be proven.

As suggested by the affidavit of defence, before an action could be maintained the plaintiff must first have an account filed by the guardian for each ward, setting forth the amount due to him, and on what account, and the amount of each: Weyand’s Appeal, 12 P. F. Smith 198. Then the court, in the action upon the official bond, could fix the amount due to each, and thus conform to the act, and enter judgment for the Commonwealth for the penalty of the bond, and for the amount due to each child under the decree. But the plaintiff not only failed to observe the act relating to actions on official bonds, but he failed even to file a declaration. Rule 9 of the court requires that before judgment can be taken for want of an affidavit of defence, the plaintiff must file a declaration, if one be ne.cessary.</p>

It is manifest, therefore, that in an action of debt upon such bond the defendants can have no defence but payment. The affidavit of defencesets up nothing of the kind. It makes some suggestions as to what ought to be done in the Orphans’ Court.in the way of distribution of the funds, but this is a question with which a defaulting guardian can have no concern. Having been removed from the trust his duty is to pay the money which the Orphans’ Court has adjudged to be in his hands.</p>

The, Act of 14th June 1836, Pamph. L. 639, prescribes the manner of proceeding upon official bonds. The <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>plaintiff appears to have proceeded in substantial conformity to the act. It is true he did not file a declaration, but he did file a copy of the bond with an affidavit distinctly setting forth the breach. Rule 9 of the court below provides for the filing of a declaration before judgment by default only when necessary. It was not necessary here. The only benefit of a declaration would be to assign the breach and that was sufficiently done by the affidavit. The bond in question was clearly within the rule of court which prescribes in what cases judgment may be taken for want of an affidavit of defence, and as the affidavit of defendant disclosed no defence the plaintiff was entitled to judgment.</p>
