Inasmuch as the case goes back for further proceedings, we refrain from expressing any opinion on any of the questions that are likely to arise. We do not feel called upon at present to say more than that upon the facts sufficiently averred in the bill and admitted by the demurrer, the appellees are at least trustees <em>ex maleficio </em>of the assets of the Citizens’ Oil Refining Company, and as such liable to account to appellant as owner of the three hundred and fifty shares of the capital stock of said company.
