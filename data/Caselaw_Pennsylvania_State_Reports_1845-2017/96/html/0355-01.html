Certain citizens made subscriptions to the stock of a railroad company whose road was in process of construction. These subscribers were interested as property ownei-s in the completion of the road. The subscriptions were to be made to the company and by the company turned over to these subscribers. The latter entered into a contract for grading, tieing and bridging a certaiq portion of the road at a designated -cost, the subscriptions to be collected by those engaged in this work, and if more than sufficient to pay for the work, the surplus was to be returned to the company. It was farther agreed that the company should give either stock or transportation notes, in payment for materials furnished and work done, to each individual subscriber in proportion to his subscription. Of the subscriptions $6000 were thus collected and work done under the contract to the amount of $9900. Further work was suspended by reason of the insolvency of the company and a sheriff’s sale of its property. In the distribution of the proceeds of said sale the parties who had done the work under the above contract claimed to participate therein as creditors and contractors and to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale. <em>Held, </em>that their claims were properly rejected.</p>

Instead of paying these subscriptions to the company in money and letting the company use the amount in building the four miles of road, the committee took the subscriptions and agreed to grade, tie, and bridge the road. If this claim were allowed these subscribers to the stock of the company would stand in the position of parties who had subscribed $7000 to the stock of*the company to be used in building the branch, now getting the amount subscribed back in money, dollar for dollar; indeed perhaps more than dollar for dollar, because an advantage was given to the committee in the estimate of the work; for Mr. Hart in his testimony says: ‘ TheHillsboro committee was to be paid on the estimate of the engineer at one price, and the engineer also made out another estimate at a different price from which the committee paid their contractor.’</p>

If the claimants were entitled to receive stock and the company were still solvent the delivery to them of the certificates thereof is all that the corporation would be bound or competent to do.' If the company had violated the agreement by refusing to deliver the certificates of stock, then perhaps an action for damages might have been maintained against it, but that is all.

The claimants here are seeking to be paid in money to the full value of the work done because, as they say, they have not received certificates of stock which, if they had received them and the corporation was solvent would only entitle them to such dividends as might be made by the corporation, and could not be realized except upon its dissolution and winding up. It was urged on behalf of these claimants that their claim -to participate in the distribution of this fund is strengthened by the fact that by the contract the railroad company were to give them either stock or transportation notes in payment for work done.</p>

The contract is silent as to which one belongs the right of choice, but assuming for the sake of the argument that the committee and subscribers on the completion of the road, would have had the right to choose which they would take, certificates of stock or transportation notes, how does that better the claim? What are transportation notes ? They are what their name imports. Notes payable not in money but in transportation over the railroad, of such freights and passengers as are connected with the holders’ immediate business or household at the regular schedule of rates, under such regulations as may from time to time be fixed by the company — rto an amount not exceeding in any one year the tenth part of the principal and the interest due. If the holder of one of these notes were refused transportation over any portion of the railroad, what would be his remedy ? Simply an action for the breach of the contract. What would be'the measure of the damage? Would it be the amount of the fare at the then established rates for the distance over which the company had refused to transport him, or compensation for the loss to be measured by some other standard ? If these claimants had received transportation notes and were now presenting them here for allowance out of this fund, your auditor is of the opinion that they could not be allowed, as he does not regard the holders- of transportation notes as entitled to participate in this distribution. If the claimants had received,, certificates of stock they would have no claim upon this fund for the value thereof. How then can they ask to carry away from the other creditors $9900.72 because they have not received the certificates. Your auditor for these reasons is of opinion that this claim for $9900.72 is not entitled to be paid out of the fund, and he deems it unnecessary to express any opinion as to the legal effect of the contract of August 26th 1879, with the Pittsburgh Southern Railway Company.”</p>

But suppose the Hillsboro committee were entitled to transportation notes instead of stock, and as such were now claiming out of the fund for distribution. Could the auditor have allowed them a pro rata (for this is all they would have been entitled to) with other unsecured creditors? The auditor held that these claimants would not have been entitled to participate in- the distribution of this fund, even though transportation notes had been issued to them. Simply because such a note is payable not in money but in the transportation of “such freights and passengers as are connected with his or her immediate business or household.” If such transportation became impossible — by reason of the insolvency of the railroad company — the holder of the note would have to. bring an action for the breach of the contract. Until his damages were ascertained and liquidated by a judgment, he could not claim, as against bona fide creditors, a share in the estate of the insolvent. The auditor very properly ruled that claims of this character were not debts against the railroad company of sufficient certainty to entitle them to payment. He could consider such persons only as were creditors of the railroad company. We contend that holders of transportation notes are not creditors until after the breach becomes final — by refusal or failure of the railroad company (in consequence of their insolvency) to furnish the transportation, and the claim for damages for the breach of the contract has been' liquidated by a judgment.</p>

It will be observed, therefore, that every one of these cases was the case of a direct transfer or alienation of the property of the company by the voluntary act of the company itself, and so was clearly within the provisions of the resolution of 1843. But in the case now under consideration, the company did nothing prohibited by the resolution. It executed no “ general or partial assignment, conveyance, mortgage or other transfer of its real or personal estate.” True, the sale which produced the fund for distribution operated as a transfer, but it was not a transfer in which the company had any agency, and, therefore,' was not within the plain meaning of the resolution or its supplement, both of which contemplate volition on the part of the company in the disposition of its property.</p>

It is that the court erred in not sustaining the following exception to the auditor’s report: “ That the auditor erred in not allowing the claim of the said committee, contractors for the construction of the Southern Railway Company, for the full amount of their said claim, viz.: $9950.72.” The auditor rejected the whole of this claim, which ruling was affirmed by the court below. It is proper to say that the decree was entered <em>pro forma </em>to enable the parties to have the ease heard at the last term of this court, in the Western District. We are, therefore, without the aid which the opinion of the learned president of the Common Pleas would have given us.</p>

The appellants had constructed a portion of said road under the following circumstances, as we gather from the auditor’s report: A number of citizens, including the committee referred to, had made subscriptions to the stock of the Pittsburgh Southern Railway Company, amounting to about $7000. These subscribers were interested as property owners in the completion of the road. The subscriptions were made to the company, and by the company turned over to the committee and those with whom they acted. The committee took them, and entered into a written contract with the company, dated December 21st 1877, for the grading, tieing and bridging of a portion of the road therein designated, at a cost not to exceed $3000 per mile ; the subscriptions to be collected by the committee, and if more than sufficient to pay for the work was realized therefrom, the surplus was to be returned to the company. It was further agreed that the company should give either stock or <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>transportation notes in payment of materials furnished and work done, to each individual subscriber in proportion to his subscription.</p>
    <p id="b374-6" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[240,485,1154,258]]]'>Under this arrangement the committee collected about $6000 of the subscriptions, and have done work under the contract to the amount of $9950.72. Further work was suspended by reason of the insolvency of the company and the sheriff’s sale of its property. The committee claim as creditors and contractors, and ask to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale.</p>
    <p id="b374-7" data-blocks='[["BL_374.5",374,[240,742,1152,259]]]'>In the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the property of an insolvent corporation the court acts upon equitable principles. See Price’s Appeal, 29 P. S. Smith 168, and cases there cited. We are, therefore, to ascertain whether these appellants have any equity to come in upon this fund to the exclusion of creditors who put their money into the enterprise in good faith.</p>
    <p id="b374-8" data-blocks='[["BL_374.6",374,[235,998,1158,899]]]'>Are they stockholders or are they creditors ? In one sense a stockholder is a creditor of a corporation to the amount of his paid up stock. The corporation is his debtor to that extent. But his claim must necessarily be postponed until the general creditors are paid their demands in full. He holds his stock subject to their rights. The appellants are doubtless contractors in the sense of having graded a certain portion of the road at a price agreed upon. To this extent they are also creditors and entitled to be paid in someway. But how? The contract says in stock or transportation notes. The appellants assume they had the right to elect payment in transportation notes. The contract does not say so, and I am not sure but a tender by the company of either stock or transportation notes would have satisfied the covenant. This, however, is not material and is not decided. The appellants’ contention is that inasmuch as the company by reason of its insolvency, and the sale of the road, cannot furnish transportation notes — it is bound to pay in money. As between the appellants and the company this proposition would appear to be correct. But just here the rights of creditors come in, and they say-the appellants if not technically stockholders yet in equity must be treated as such, and be postponed until the general creditors of the company are paid in full.</p>
    <p id="b374-9" data-blocks='[["BL_374.7",374,[236,1897,1155,514]],["BL_375.1",375,[170,386,1162,603]]]'>There is great force in this suggestion. A stockholder is an owner of the property and franchises of a corporation to the extent of his stock. He is entitled in the same proportion to a share of the net earnings. If the appellants are stockholders it is too plain for argument they have no claim upon this fund. Have they any higher claim as holders of or as persons entitled to transportation certificates ? While the status of such certificate-holders is not accurately defined in the books, we deem it clear that in equity they must be treated as part owners of the road. In one respect they have superior advantages over the owner whose title is represented by stock. The latter can receive only a share of the net earnings, while the holder of a transportation certificate is entitled <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>to a portion of the gross earnings. The right to participate in the earnings implies ownership to that extent in the thing which produces such earnings. The application of this equitable principle does exact justice in this ease. The appellants had an interest in the completion of this road. They had subscribed with others to its capital stock. Instead of paying in money they paid in work and materials to the amount subscribed, and agreed to take stock or transportation notes for the amount of the contract over and above the amount of said subscriptions. There would be no justice in placing them in a better position than other friends and contributors to the enterprise who paid in money. The form of the transaction is nothing. Equity disregards mere form and looks only to the substance. The claim of the appellants was properly rejected.</p>
    <p id="b375-6" data-blocks='[["BL_375.4",375,[169,988,1158,344]]]'>2. Bell’s Appeal. There is nothing in this appeal to require discussion. The appellant contracted to furnish 5000 railroad ties to the company to be used in the construction of the road. He now claims that he is a contractor and preferred creditor under the resolution of 1843. If his position be correct, then every storekeeper who furnished a pound of spikes to the company is a contractor for t'he construction of the road. No such absurd result as this was intended by the resolution of 1843.</p>
    <p id="b375-7" data-blocks='[["BL_375.5",375,[157,1333,1176,1073]],["BL_376.1",376,[250,382,1160,418]]]'>3. Hopkins’s Appeal. This appeal is sustained upon a single point. The auditor awarded the sum of $371.85 to laborers and workmen employed by contractors for work and labor performed by them in the construction of the road. (See schedule E.) This was error. The joint resolution of the General Assembly of January 21st 1843, Pamph. L. 367, was intended, as its title implies, to protect laborers and contractors employed upon railroads, canals and other public works, and in order to give effect to such intent it declared that all assignments, conveyances, mortgages or other transfers of the property of such corporations should be null and void as against the claims of such persons. But by the very terms of the act its benefits are extended only to such laborers and contractors as have a contract relation with the company. Sub-contractors, and laborers employed by sub-contractors, are not within its protection. The auditor concedes this to be so, but held that the supplement of 4th April 1862, Pamph. L. 235, extended the protection of the resolution of 1843 to all contractors and laborers employed upon the work. It is true the two acts must be treated' in <em>pari materia. </em>But the plain object of the Act of 1862 was to give a remedy to the persons named in the resolution of 1843. The mischief was that in the case of the sale of other transfer of a railroad in violation of the resolution of 1843, the contractors and laborers had a right to pursue the property in the hands of the purchaser, yet there was no adequate remedy to enforce such right. Accordingly the Act of 1862 provided that after obtaining <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>a judgment against the company a scire facias mignt issue upon said judgment with notice to the purchaser. This gave the latter his day in court and enabled the creditor to sell and pass a good title. The Act of 1862 did not enlarge the class of persons who are protected by the resolution of 1843. That this is so clearly appears by the remedy therein provided. It authorizes a scire facias to issue upon a judgment recovered against the company. How could a sub-contractor, or a laborer employed by a sub-contractor, get a judgment against the company ? He has no contract relation therewith.</p>
    <p id="b376-4" data-blocks='[["BL_376.4",376,[249,809,1155,289]]]'>What has been said applies to the case of sub-contractors as well as to the claims of laborers referred to in schedule E. I do not, however, find that the auditor has. allowed the claims of sub-contractors although error has been assigned thereto. If I am mistaken in this, the report must go back to the auditor for correction. If not, the $371.85 in schedule E can be divided among the general creditors without further order.</p>
