White, the plaintiff, was the owner of three lots of ground situate in Temperanceville, now Thirty-sixth ward, city of Pittsburgh. On or about the 1st of April 1855, he and his wife con veyed them to one Nathaniel Ballantine, by deed absolute upon its face, but accompanied by a parol defeasance, which made it a mort<a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>gage for the security of money loaned or to be advanced by Ballantine to White to an amount not-exceeding $2000. The parol defeasance stipulated that Ballantine should have possession of the property, collect the rents thereof until reimbursed, and then to reconvey to White. In pursuance of this agreement, Ballantine took possession and received the rents until 1867. White, at that time, alleged that Ballantine was fully reimbursed, and demanded a reconveyance according to agreement. Ballantine then denied the parol defeasance, claimed his deed to be an absolute purchase, and refused to reconvey. On the 25th of March 1867, White brought ejectment to No. 371, April Term 1867, to enforce the parol agreement and recover possession. This suit was tried on the 2d of December 1872, and resulted in a verdict for White. Ballantine removed it to this court, when the judgment of the court below was affirmed on the 9th of November 1874. (See case reported in 27 P. F. Smith 20.)</p>

In the summer of 1873, Main and Walnut streets, which bounded two sides of this property, were graded and paved by the city. For this improvement the property was assessed by the city with the sum of $1068.96. To secure the payment of this assessment, the city filed a municipal lien on the 30th day of January 1874, to No. 2, of April Term 1874, for the said sum of $1068.96,’ with interest from the 1st of August 1873. The said Nathaniel Ballantine, being in possession during the making of the improvements, and at the time the lien was entered, it was filed against him as defendant. Afterwards a scire facias by the city as plaintiff was issued against the said Ballantine as defendant to No. 2 of April Term 1874. And, on the 8th of July following, judgment was entered against the defendant for the sum of $1127.75. On this judgment a levari facias was afterwards issued, and the property was sold by the sheriff on the 5th day of January 1877, and-<a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>purchased, by James W.

      <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>The property in dispute was sold to James W. Ballantine, the defendant, on a levari facias issued on a judgment, obtained on a municipal claim for grading the street or streets adjacent to this property, which claim was filed January 30th 1874. At that time Nathaniel Ballantine was in the possession of the property, and against him the scire facias was issued and judgment obtained. It seems, however, as was afterwards determined by an action of ejectment, that the fee of the property was in E. C. White, the plaintiff, and that the possession of Ballantine was only that which he had acquired as White’s mortgagee. • This then is a summary of the facts upon which.this case rests, and the question involved in, and arising from them is, what title did the defendant acquire by his purchase at the judicial sale ? The plaintiff contends that inasmuch as the scire facias and judgment were in the name of Nathaniel Ballantine, the tenant of the property, the sale falls within the provisions of the Act of 6th January 1864, and passes to the purchaser no more than Ballantine’s title, whatever that may be. On the other hand, it is insisted by the defendant that he thereby acquired the entire title by virtue of the terms of the Act of 24th February 1871. We think, then, that this contention must be determined by the construction put upon this last named act. If this statute does not cover the case, then the hypothesis of the plaintiff must prevail, and, in that event, since there was no service of the scire facias upon White, the owner, the purchaser took nothing but Ballantine’s interest. The question thus presented is not a new one, and our task is rendered light by the opinion of our brother, Mr. Justice Paxson, in the case of Emrick <em>v. </em>Dicken, filed on the 5th of January last, and reported in 11 Norris 76. The case here cited is full in point, for the claim filed, the scire facias and judgment, were against an “ unknowm owner,” and though George Emrick, the owner, was without notice, and, at the time, resident upon the property, it was nevertheless held that the purchaser took a good title under the Act of 1871. That was a case where the equities of the owner were much stronger than in the case in hand. There, there was no notice to the owner; here the assessment was against the plaintiff’s mortgagee, and there is no pretence that he was without notice. But even were he without notice, we cannot see any hardship in a law which makes the result complained of possible only through the negligence of the owner. Had the plaintiff complied with the requisitions of the.statute, as in good faith he was bound to do, personal notice of the sci. fa. must have been given to him, or the sale un'der it would as to him have been worthless. Who then was to blame if the plaintiff’s property was assessed in a wrong name ? Not the city officers, for there was no registration of the premises to which they could refer. They did what they could — what was proper under the circumstances — they assessed the property in the name of the person in <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>possession, and who at that" time claimed to own it. And, indeed, if we should concede to the plaintiff what his counsel contends for, in his fourth point to the court below, that is, that he had no title when the assessment was made, then, of course, Nathaniel Ballantine was in fact the owner, and there can be no exception taken to that assessment on any ground. But as, even in the face of such an admission, we can scarcely suppose that it was intended thus to cut up the plaintiff’s case by the roots, especially as the verdict in ejectment, rendered in December 1872, determined the case in White’s favor, we prefer to rest the case on the Act of 1871.</p>
