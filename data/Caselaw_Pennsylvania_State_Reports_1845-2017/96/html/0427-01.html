Myers signed a-mortgage which was given to Boyd, upon eight acres of land in Crawford county, the consideration therefor being $2000. At the foot of the mortgage was the following: “ Crawford county, <em>ss: </em>Subscribed and acknowledged before me, this eighth day of July 1872, A. M. Smith, Recorder.” The mbrtgage was for five years, and was recorded. The Second National Bank purchased the mortgaged property at a sheriff’s sale without notice of the mortgage. On the 26th of March 1875, Boyd issued this scire facias upon the mortgage. At the trial the plaintiffs offered the mortgage in evidence, which was objected to because it was not properly a record, and, therefore, not notice to the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale. The court admitted it in evidence.</p>

Dig. 460, provides that in all cases and before all officers, the grantor shall go in person before the officer who shall take the acknowledgment. . This must be done before record of the instrument is permitted. The certificate of the officer must state the requirements of the statute. It is true that no particular form of words is necessary, but it must appear that those things required to be done to insure protection were done: Watson <em>v. </em>Bailey, <a href="/binn/1/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Binn. 470" data-case-ids="1787861" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0470-01">1 Binn. 470</a> ; Jourdan <em>v. </em>Jourdan, 9 S. &amp; R. 273. It is clear that to guard against fraud and false personation, if is the grantor who should appear before the officer and acknowledge his signature to the instrument. Certainly the officer should say so in some form, and not leave material things to be inferred or guessed at. To infer that the grantor, Myers, appeared before the recorder and acknowledged this particular instrument, is to assume that which nowffiere is shown. Nor does it appear what instrument was acknowledged.</p>

Nothing whatever, but the paper to which each, in the presence of the other, put their respective hands and seals. There was no other paper subscribed, or to be subscribed, no other subscription acknowledged, or to be acknowledged, than the subscription to that particular deed, to which the recorder set his name and affixed his official seal.</p>

It does not state that the grantor appeared before the officer, though the statute positively requires the personal presence of the grantor before the person who is to take the acknowledgment. It does not state that either the grantor or any one else made an acknowledgment of any kind of the instrument in question, although the statute distinctly directs that the officer shall certify “by whom” the acknowledgment was made.</p>
    <p id="b429-8" data-blocks='[["BL_429.6",429,[106,1548,1169,860]],["BL_430.1",430,[302,399,1174,771]]]'>The Act of 24th February 1770, sect. 2, which directs the manner in which married women shall make acknowledgment of deeds executed by them, does not prescribe any form of words in which it shall be done, nor does it direct the officer to certify the acknowledgment in any particular. Yet the decisions under that statute have constantly held that the requirements of the act must be com.plied with, and further, that this must appear in the certificate of the officer, otherwise the deed as to the feme covert grantor is inoperative and will not pass her estate: Watson <em>v. </em>Bailey, <a href="/binn/1/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Binn. 470" data-case-ids="1787861" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0470-01">1 Binn. 470</a>; Fowler <em>v. </em>McClurg, 6 S. &amp; R. 143; Evans <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 4 Id. 272; Jourdan <em>v. </em>Jourdan, 9 Id. 273. How much more is it essential that the requirements of the statute should be observed and pursued, in a case like the present, where the officer is expressly directed to certify to the special facts of the acknowledgment. This certificate contains no information upon the most vital subjects. It does not state what was acknowledged nor <em>by whom </em>any acknowledgment was made, and above all it does not state affirmatively, as it certainly should, that the grantor in the mortgage appeared before the officer for this or any other purpose. Were such a latitude allowed in the performance of this important <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>duty, the opportunities for false personation would be alarmingly increased. In all the particulars mentioned, this certificate is fatally defective, and the necessary consequence, also prescribed by the same statute, follows, to wit, that the mortgage was not entitled to be recorded at all. In Goepp <em>v. </em>Gartisor, 11 Casey 133, we ruled as follows : “ But if a deed or mortgage is defectively registered, or the judgment or lien appears on its face to be null and void, then he (a purchaser at sheriff's sale) is not bound to notice them at all: Magaw <em>v. </em>Garrett, 1 Casey 319—22; Bolton v. Johns, 5 Barr 149. In the last case Chief Justice Gibson says : ‘ The defective registry of a deed is a nullity,’ ‘ and in the case before us the lien filed was a nullity which the purchaser was not bound to notice. Even had actual notice been given him he would have been informed of nothing but an abortive attempt to create a lien where none could exist.’ ” To the same effect is Uhler <em>v. </em>Hutchinson, 11 Harris 110. It follows from these considerations that the learned judge of the court below was in error in his answer to the defendant’s first noint, and in admitting the mortgage in evidence.</p>
