Underwood, Esq., at Library Hall, Pittsburgh, on the evening of May 11th 1879, at 7.30 p. M. The title of the lecture was, “ If Not Christianity, What ?” An admission fee of twenty-five cents was charged. No license was obtained from the mayor for the right of delivering such lecture, although an application -was made for a license, but refused by the mayor.</p>

F. Underwood, at Library Hall, in said city, on the evening of May 11th 1879, without first having received a license or permit from said mayor, contrary to a city <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>ordinance passed in pursuance of an Act of Assembly of the legislature of Pennsylvania.” After a hearing the defendant was “ duly convicted,” the mayor being of the opinion “ that the lecture, delivered on May 11th 1879, by B. F. Underwood, at Library Hall, "was an exhibition,” &amp;c., &amp;c., and imposed on the defendant a fine of “ twenty-five dollars and costs, or in default of payment thereof, to be committed to the Allegheny county workhouse for a period of twenty days.” The defendant paid the fine.

Provided, that lectures on historic, literary or scientific subjects shall not come within the provisions of this section.’</p>

The alleged violation was an exhibition or entertainment by B; F. Underwood, on Sabbath evening, May 11th 1879, in Library Hall, under the auspices of the appellant and the Liberal League of Pittsburgh, at which admission tickets were sold.</p>

The mayor, at the hearing before him, heard the evidence and the argument of counsel, and decided it was not such a lecture, but was of such character as required a license under the Act of Assembly and the ordinance of the city. We have no evidence on the subject except what is set forth in the mayor’s transcript. Whether it contains all the evidence heard by the mayor we are not informed. He is not bound to set forth and return to court all the evidence. In the absence of evidence to the contrary it is to be presumed he had sufficient evidence to justify the finding of the fact.</p>

Underwood will deliver his famous lecture, entitled If not Christianity, What ? under the auspices of the Pittsburgh Liberal League, Sunday evening, May 11th 1879, at 7| o’clock. Admission 25 cents; no extra charge for reserved seats. Box open at hall Saturday and Sunday.’ It is also set forth as a conceded fact, ‘that application was made to the mayor for license or permit for such entertainment, to be exhibited on Sunday evening, May 11th 1879, and the issue of which was refused for said Sunday evening.’</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b220-10" data-blocks='[["BL_220.8",220,[245,1587,1161,643]]]'>Peet then took this writ and alleged that the court erred, 1. In not disposing of the appeal de novo. There having been no testimony offered by the prosecutor, as is evident from the record, the court should have reversed the judgment of the mayor, as the prosecutor was bound to establish his case de novo, and the court in an appeal could not pass on the merits of the case on the faith of the testimony set forth on the mayor’s transcript, even though such transcript contained all the evidence submitted, which it did not. 2. The decision of the court should have been in the form of an original judgment, and should have specified that the offence committed was not within the exception of the city ordinance, under which the conviction was had, to wit, was not a “ lecture on a historic, literary or scientific subject.” 3. The act of defendant set out on the record was not contrary to law. 4. The judgment entered was not original.</p>

The prosecution presented no witnesses, and the decree of the court was pronounced solely upon the-faith of the testimony submitted in the transcript, as will appear from the following citation from the decision of the court when speaking on the question as to whether the performance was an exhibition or a lecture. The court says : “ We have no evidence on this subject except what is set forth on the mayor’s transcript.” All the elements essential to the making up of a new judgment were wanting, and the sentence of the court was pronounced solely on an inspection of the trans-script, as a review of the court’s decision will emphatically disclose.</p>
