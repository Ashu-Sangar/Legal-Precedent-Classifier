The words of an Act of Assembly as well as those of an ordinance, deed or will, are always to be taken as having a meaning, if such act or instrument is susceptible of construction, which will give force and effect to all the words, and only when they are unintelligible or obviously insensible are they to be distinguished.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b26-8" data-blocks='[["BL_26.6",26,[270,1432,1166,928]]]'>“ The first part of section 7 clearly presents certain objects for which taxes may be levied, assessed and collected. But it is clear that if the powers conferred by that part were to be limited to those expressed objects, the charter would be a dead letter so far as many essentials in the ‘ well ordering’ and ‘ better government’ of the borough would be concerned. We see no power conferred by which the dangers of fire could be averted. An engine could not be bought,'or an engine house erected; and yet this should be of first consideration as to the protection of the property of the citizens as <em>salus populi suprema est lex. </em>Anticipating, therefore, the various exigencies of municipal existence, the additional clause was added, which, if it has a meaning, and we cannot doubt that it has, carries with it a power beyond and different from those in the preceding clause, and conferring additional power, the purview of which is the ‘well ordering’ and ‘better government’ of the borough ; incidental to which, and a necessary sequence of laying of tax is the collection of money. It is, therefore, clearly in the power of the burgess and council to create such ordinance and by-laws as may be conducive to the ‘ well ordering’ and. ‘ better government’ of the borough ; and incidentally they are empowered to provide for the necessary expenses that may attend and effectuate such enactment.</p>

It does not express the object or the application of the revenue thus to be derived. In the absence of any averment to the contrary, or evidence, it is presumably for some purpose within the chartered powers of the municipality. It therefore only remains to inquire whether the method resorted to to raise this money is ultra vires or not. The rule applying to the passage and enforcement of ordinances would seem to be that they must be reasonable and not in restraint of trade.

Each taxpayer,' whether he owns or uses a vehicle or not, under the ordinary taxing powers of the borough is compelled to contribute more or less to the improvement and repair^of the public streets. The streets, however, are free to all, and any ordinance restraining their use would be unreasonable and invalid, but not so if a class of persons amongst whom this use is more general were -required by a general ordinance to contribute something for the privilege, provided that it be not unreasonable or in restraint of trade. Examining the ordinance in question, the amount demanded would not seem unreasonable, more especially as it is within the power of the persons so charged to demand the equivalent, either specifically or by an increased charge, from the purchaser; while by the means thus used the actual value of the article is ascertained and a <em>quid pro quo </em>rendered by the borough, at whose expense the scales are erected and the weighmaster maintained, thus affording secuxúty to the purchaser and vendor alike. Similar ordinances, though under greater statutory powers prevail in every city, authorizing not only the weighing but the inspection of nearly every article of food, which jnot only custom but general good resulting therefrom vindicate as reasonable and absolutely necessary.

So far as we can discover, nothing has been put in issue by the pleadings but the power of the borough to make an ordinance, such as the one in controversy. The counsel for the plaintiff, in his argument, inter alia, contends for a strict construction of the ordinance; that it is operative only upon those who both <em>sell and deliver </em>coal within the borough limits. If, however, for argument’s sake, we admit of a construction so exceedingly strict as this, nevertheless by the hill it docs not appear but that the plaintiff both sold and delivered his coal within the borough limits. The argument thus assumes facts not found in the case. Moreover, the plaintiff bases his complaint not upon any improper construction of the ordinance itself, nor upon the fact that it lacks applicability to his case, but upon the broad ground that the borough council had no power to make a regulation such as 'this. But a proposition of this kind is refuted by the act of incorporation itself. The seventh section of that act expressly confers upon the municipal authorities all powers necessary “ for the well ordering and better government of said borough.”</p>

Does, then, the ordinance complained of come within the limitations above named. We think with the learned judge of the court below that it does. Indeed, we cannot understand how any one can take exception either to the reasonableness, lawfulness or constitutionality of a regulation requiring 'people to buy and sell by lawful weights and measures rather than by guess. A proposition such as this is too plain for discussion; it is determined at once by the application of the ordinary principles of fair dealing and common sense.</p>

Such charge is not a tax any more than is a charge for for the use of a stall in a market-house, or for a stand upon a public street. It has less the character of a tax than an ordinance compelling occupants or owners of houses bordering on certain streets to keep their sidewalks clear from snow. It is no <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>more of a tax than is a charge for the use of a public sewer, and yet all the above-mentioned impositions have been held not to be an exercise of the taxing power, but as in the nature of police regulations: 1 Dill.
