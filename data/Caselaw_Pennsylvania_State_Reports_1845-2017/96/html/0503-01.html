The defendant was indicted for seduction under the provisions of the Act of .March 31st 1860, sect. 41, Pamph. L. 385, and also for fornication and bastardy under the provisions of the 37 th section of said act. The* defendant moved to quash the count for fornication and bastardy for the following reasons: “ That no information had theretofore been made charging the defendant with fornication and bastardy; nor was said charge made or indictment for fornication and bastardy found upon the return of a constable; and that said count was unauthorized by law.” The defendant,- at the trial, pleaded “not guilty.” The Commonwealth offered in evidence a letter from defendant to Hessie Thorn as showing the relation existing between them. Admitted under objection.</p>

Seduction partakes essentially of the character of civil process: 2 Whart. Am. C. L., 7th ed. sect. 2667; Duncan <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 4 S. &amp; R. 448. The two offences cannot be joined in one indictment. See also, Updegraff <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 6 Id. 9.</p>
    <p id="b504-9" data-blocks='[["BL_504.10",504,[249,1890,1157,341]]]'>It has been the uniform practice in Pennsylvania for years to require prosecutions to he instituted either upon information made before a committing magistrate, by return of constable, upon motion of the district attorney, or upon personal knowledge of the grand jury: McCullough <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 17 P. F. Smith 30; Rowand <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Norris 405; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Maloy; 7 P. F. Smith 298.

The court could scarcely have been more emphatic in their instructions <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>to the jury — not only to disregard any comments upon the law made by defendant’s counsel, as well as any opinion of their own— than their often repeated and binding instructions which we assigned for error. The jury are the judges of the law as well as' of the facts. The power of the jury to judge of the law in criminal cases is one of the most valuable securities guaranteed by the Bill of Rights: Sharswood, C. J., in Kane <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 8 Norris 522.</p>

The court gave no binding instructions to the jury. They only recommended the safest course the jury could adopt in ascertaining what the law was. Had the court been requested to charge that the jury were the judges of the law, they would undoubtedly have done so and given the jury the same advice which the court did and which is so emphatically affirmed in Kane <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <em>supra.</em>

The other assignments of error, to the rulings of the court below on questions of evidence, are not sustained by bills of exception, and must fall for that reason; but if they had been they would not avail the plaintiff in error. •</p>
