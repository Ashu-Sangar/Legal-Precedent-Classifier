The latter being insufficient for the payment of his debts, his assignee made application to sell the land divested of liens under the provisions of the Act of February 17th <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>1876, Pamph. L. 4. The court granted an order of sale on the usual terms, to wit, one-third of the purchase-money payable on confirmation of sale ; one-third thereof with interest from the date of confirmation, in six months thereafter, and the remaining one-third thereof, with interest from date of confirmation, in twelve months thereafter. In pursuance of said order seven of the said tracts and lots were sold on the prescribed terms. The assignees made report of the sales, which were confirmed by the court August 26th 1878. The assignees then filed their account, charging themselves with the proceeds of sales, taking credit for deferred payments, which was confirmed. Auditors were then appointed to determine claims and prepare schedules of distribution. The total amount of sales of realty, collected and uncollected, less the proper expenses, was $17,992.57, which the auditors were allowed to distribute. This sum embraced only the principal, no interest on the deferred payments being included. This sum was applied by the auditors to the various judgments in their order, including the several judgments of the Washington Savings Bank and a portion of the judgment of the Brownsville Deposit and Discount Bank, with interest to date of confirmation of sale. The latter judgment amounted, with interest, on the day of confirmation of sale, to $4911.68. The real estate fund above stated paid off this amount, $4121.74, leaving a balance to be paid by sale of the remaining real estate. No interest on the purchase-money was included in this distribution. This report was confirmed, without exceptions, May 19th 1879.</p>

And observe, it is distinctly said in Tomlinson’s Appeal, supra, and as a <em>ratio </em>decidendi, that the court has no power to order a sale against the objection of lien-creditors on time, so as unduly to postpone them if stay of execution is ordered. In that case Mercür, J., delivering the opinion, said : ‘ The act requires notice to the lien-creditors, and an opportunity for them to be heard before the sale is ordered. If it is so ordered as to postpone the payment of liens and deprives the owners of interest thereon for a time longer than may be reasonably required to make distribution of the fund, it cannot well be said that the sale is for the <em>‘ </em>manifest interest’ of such creditors; it is not necessary for the purpose of discharging the lien or of giving an undoubted title to the purchaser. It would therefore be unwarranted by the statute.

In </em>that case the sale was confirmed on the 24th December 1877, the terms of sale being ten per cent, of the purchase-money to be paid in cash, and the remainder on the 1st April 1878. The auditor allowed Ilarple, a lien creditor, interest on his judgment to April 1st 1878. The court below confirmed the report; and on appeal to the Supreme Court <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>the decree of confirmation was reversed on this single point — the court holding that interest on liens should be computed to the time of confirmation only, and not to the date of the payment of the purchase-money.

The debt is as fully discharged as though the assignee, had, on the very day of confirmation, paid him the debt, interest and costs in full, and taken his receipt in satisfaction of the judgment. The truth seems to be, in the light of these authorities, and particularly of Tomlinson’s Appeal, that the vice of this proceeding was in the original order to sell on time instead of for cash. And it does not help the matter to say that it was so ordered by general consent of the lien creditors. In this court, hereafter, such time sales will not be allowed, unless it be under very special circumstances and upon very short credit.</p>

It is true that they decide that interest on judgment liens ceases at the date of confirmation of sale ; but the letter of these decisions should not be extended to cover the present case, where a wholly different state of facts exist. The question raised by our appeal is, to whom belongs the interest accruing on purchase-money after confirmation of - sale ? while in Tomlinson’s Appeal there was no interest whatever for distribution, the purchase-money did not bear interest, and the question as to the distribution of an interest fund was not then before this court. The interest in the estate' of <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>Azariah Crow commenced to accrue on the day of the confirmation of sale, after the rights of judgment-creditors had all been fixed and vested, and after full effect had been given to the principle of Tomlinson’s Appeal. Tomlinson’s Appeal leads us to the point where the facts of this case begin, and there is no conflict whatever between those cases and the principle we contend for. Even, as in the present case, where the fund is productive after confirmation of the sale, the principle of Tomlinson’s Appeal applies in order to determine when the debtor ceases to pay interest, and also to determine the share of each creditor in the fund. It is obvious that the formulated statement^of the principle of the cases referred to has reference to the debtor’s rights, and was never intended to be taken so literally as to apply to a case like the present, where the interest accrued after the confirmation of sale ; after the liens were divested; after the appellants acquired a vested interest in the fund; after the debtor and creditor both had the full benefit of the appropriation. But the claim of appellants is not without direct precedent. In Cowden’s Estate, 1 Barr 284, it is held as follow's : “ If interest has been made and received on the moneys or any portion thereof made by the sheriff’s sale, it shall follow and be paid to the parties respectively who shall-be entitled under the decree to receive the principal upon which it shall have been made and received.”</p>
    <p id="b354-6" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[303,1415,1159,642]]]'>In Rice’s Appeal, 29 P. F. Smith 208, Mr. Justice Paxson says: “ The interest is the product of the principal. Each of the parties is entitled to interest in exact proportion to his share of the capital earning such interest. So likewise as to the increase of the fund. The rights of the parties to the principal were adjusted as of the day of sale. Since then the fund as a whole has grown or increased a certain amount or percentage, it follows that the share of each creditor entitled to participate in the distribution has grown in a corresponding ratio, and he will be entitled to said increase in the same proportion that the amount of principal awarded him bears to the entire, principal of said fund.” The interest therefore accruing on the purchase-money after the confirmation of sale must be distributed pro rata to those lien-creditors entitled to the principal, and we therefore respectfully submit that the court erred in confirming the auditor’s report.</p>

The reason is that the money should then be paid and take the place of the land. The creditor whose lien is thus divested is entitled to receive his money. If it is not then paid to him, and is so kept or invested afterwards as to draw interest, it is interest produced by the money to which he was justly entitled, and he is therefore entitled to the interest thus produoed. It follows that each lien-creditor who was entitled to share in the fund, for which the land sold, is entitled to share in the interest afterwards produced, in proportion to his share in the fund producing the interest: Cowden’s Estate, 1 Barr 267 ; Rice’s Appeal, 29 P. F. Smith 208; Burkholder’s Appeal, 13 Norris 522. The learned judge therefore erred in confirming the report of the auditor as to the distribution of the interest produced by the fund after confirmation of sale.</p>
