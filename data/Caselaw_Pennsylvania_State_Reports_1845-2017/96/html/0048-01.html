This would reduce the supposed perpetuation of testimony toa nullity ;for before the Act of 1869 it was always allowable to prove what either party said or swore to in the presence of the opposite party.</p>

    <p id="b49-8" data-blocks='[["BL_49.8",49,[117,1257,1170,933]]]'>A witness may state the substance of what was sworn by a witness on a former trial: Conner <em>v. </em>Green, 10 S. &amp; R. 14; Lightner <em>v. </em>Wike, 4 Id. 204. When this court decided in Evans <em>v. </em>Reed, 24 P. F. Smith 415, that the judge’s notes were evidence they decided, <em>a fortiori, </em>that the testimony of a witness, who remembers what was sworn to, is evidence. The brief notes are but the shadow. The substance is the testimony of the party who gave his testimony in the lifetime of his adversary, under the sanctions of a judicial oath,-with full opportunity for cross-examination. The Act of 1869 says that it shall be evidence. When did it cease to be evidence ? The case of Pratt <em>v. </em>Patterson, <em>supra, </em>determines that it does not cease to be evidence at the death of the opposite party. Then the only question is as to the method of proving what the party did testify to in his lifetime. This may be done according to Evans <em>v. </em>Reed, <em>supra, </em>by notes taken of his testimony. They serve to refresh the memory of the witness or judge taking them, but are weaker or secondary evidence to that of the witness who can testify positively to what was sworn to. Parol evidence is competent in Pennsylvania to alter or disprove writings of any kind, and why 'the hasty notes of the testimony of a witness, should be evidence, whilst that of the living witness who speaks from recollection is excluded is difficult to see.</p>

In the case of Evans <em>v. </em>Reed, 28 P. E. Smith 417, the notes of testimony of the plaintiff, properly proven and authenticated, were treated as a deposition and as such his testimony was perpetuated under the provisions of the third section of the Act of 1869, and were made admissible under the provisions of the Act of March 28th 1814, and in Pratt <em>v. </em>Patterson, 31 P. F. Smith 114, the same doctrine is more explicitly set forth. This doctrine is again held in Zell <em>v. </em>Benjamin, Leg. Int., Oct. 3d 1879. In the case of Allum’s Ex’rs. <em>v. </em>Carroll’s Administrators et al., 27 P. F. Smith 68, this court held that the testimony of McKenna given on the trial before arbitrators, could not be shown in a subsequent trial after the death of Carroll, one of the parties. This case is very like the one at bar, and two very potent reasons are given why the offer to prove what McKenna testified to before the arbitrators should have been rejected. 1st. Because it required the force and power of an Act of Assembly to make the deposition of a party evidence on the trial, and if it required an Act of Assembly in such case how could a much more inferior kind of testimony be admitted without an Act of Assembly so providing. 2d. Because if not excluded the equality intended to be preserved between parties by the provisions of the Act of 1869 would be destroyed. The rule deducible from the cases then is that the testimony of a party to a suit after the death of one or both of the parties, can only be used and admitted in evidence, in the form of a deposition, as provided by the Act of Assembly, or that which is equivalent thereto, notes made a deposition by a proper authentication.</p>

Nor is the rule restricted to deceased witnesses. It applies equally to those who are non-residents of the state in which the trial takes place, and out of the jurisdiction of the court; and also to those who have intermediately become insane (Emig <em>v. </em>Diehl, 26 P. F. Smith 359), or incompetent by reason of the decease of the opposite party since the former trial: Pratt <em>v. </em>Patterson, 31 P. F. Smith 114. In Emig <em>v. </em>Diehl, supra, the present chief justice says: “ It seems clear on principle that the deposition or testimony of a witness, formerly taken in the same cause, can be read in evidence on showing that he is sick or unable to attend, insane or in such a state of senility as to have lost his memory of the past, equally as where he is dead or out of the jurisdiction.”</p>

The fact that his testimony before the arbitrators had not been reduced to writing would not have been a valid objection; nor the additional circumstance that the defendant was not present and did not hear him testify, provided he had an opportunity of being present and neglected to avail himself of it. What difference can it make that the testimony offered was that of the plaintiff instead of the testimony of a stranger to the suit ? It is impossible to point out any valid ground of distinction. As to competency, it was the purpose of the Act of 1869 to place the parties to an action on the same plane of equality with strangers, leaving the fact of their being parties in interest to go to their credibility. We have-■already held that it is competent for the surviving party to a suit to reproduce his own testimony, given on a former trial, when both were living and alike competent, by introducing his deposition or proving his testimony from notes of former trial, as well as for the personal representatives of a deceased party to introduce, in like manner, his testimony given on a former trial when both were living and competent to testify in person as other witnesses: Evans <em>v. </em>Reed, 28 P. F. Smith 415; Pratt <em>v. </em>Patterson, <em>supra. </em>The conclusion reached in these cases was the logical result of the application of well-settled principles of the law of evidence to the act allowing parties in interest to be witnesses. A proper application of the same principles requires us to hold that the testimony when not perpetuated by depositions or preserved in notes of trial, may be proved by witnesses who were present at the trial and remember what was then testified to by the party since deceased or rendered incompetent by the death of his adversary. Any other construction of the act would, in effect, be legislating into its provisions an exception or limitation that does not exist. What has been so well said by our brother Mercur in the cases last cited, in relation to <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>the spirit and purpose of the' act, is so appropriate to the present case that further consideration of the question before us is rendered unnecessary.
