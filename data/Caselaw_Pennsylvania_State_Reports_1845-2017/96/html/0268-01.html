The Act of Rebruary 12th 1869 created a central board of education and made the city of Pittsburgh an independent school district. The board of directors in the sub-districts were empowered to purchase real estate and to conduct the schools and levy a special tax therefor. Said boards were to notify the central boai’d of the amount thereof, and the tax was to be collected by the city treasurer. The Act of March 22d 1877 provided that the annual levy of taxes of the city should be based upon statements of the various departments, including education and school boards, to the finance committee of councils, which amount was to be certified to councils, and the tax levied by the latter. The Act of June 12th 1878 provided that the central board should ascertain and determine the amount of money necessary for conducting the schools of the city and certify the same to councils, and .that councils shall add the amount to the aggregate taxes required for the city <em>and </em>appropriate the same for said purpose. A sub-school district petitioned the court for a writ of mandamus upon the central board to compel them to grant and appropriate to the petitioner the sum of §12,000 for permanent improvements, and to add the same to the amount already ascertained by them to be necessary for conducting the schools of said city for the next fiscal year, and to certify the same <em>to </em>city councils : <em>He Id, </em>that the writ was properly refused.</p>

Many of them had built large and costly houses — the cost of which they had, in many instances, paid in whole or in part. To impose the cost of buildings in other districts upon the whole city would be so grossly unjust to the districts which had already provided suitable buildings, that it cannot be supposed the legislature intended such effect. This would be the effect of the construction claimed by plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b276-7" data-blocks='[["BL_276.7",276,[216,975,1161,259]]]'>All difficulty is avoided by holding that the Act of 1877 does not include the affairs of the sub-districts, and that their power to levy taxes for local purposes are not affected by it. This would be consistent with the principle of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Allegheny County, <a href="/wright/1/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Wright 290" data-case-ids="626186" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0295-01">1 Wright 290</a>, “That authority to create a debt implies an obligation to pay it.”</p>
    <p id="b276-8" data-blocks='[["BL_276.8",276,[216,1233,1161,375]]]'>If the position of the plaintiffs is correct, that the power to levy taxes is taken away from the local boards, then it follows that the power and duty of the local boards to build school houses falls, and as it is not pretended, that this power has been devolved upon the city, it is simply a case in which the legislature has failed to furnish appropriate means to carry on these public duties. But admitting that the duty has been imposed upon the city to levy taxes to pay for building school houses, is the duty mandatory or one of discretion ?</p>
