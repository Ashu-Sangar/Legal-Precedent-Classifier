J., it appeared that Spier, on August 19th 1872, took from M. R.

These notes were all signed by Kerney, Montgomery and Corll, and on the back of each of them was the following: “ I guarantee the payment of the within note, for value received. L. H. Mizner.” Judgment was entered on all three of the notes on August 23d 1872. The first note became due on November 19th 1872, and on the next day the plaintiff issued a fi. fa., on which, however, there was no levy, the writ having been stayed at the instance of plaintiff’s attorney. No further effort to collect the amounts of the judgments was made until December 9th 1874. During this time Montgomery lived in Mercer county, and it was alleged the notes could have been collected from him at any <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>time during that period.

The parties to the note and the defendant in this case all being present, I drew the notes with the guarantees thereon, and they "were signed in the presence of the plaintiff, Gr. W.

After the notes were signed and delivered to the plaintiff; the case of the Commonwealth was settled on the docket of the justice, signed by the attorneys of the parties.

Upon the trial-we were of the opinion that the contract of Mizner was a general guaranty, and, being a collateral undertaking to entitle the plaintiff to recover, he must <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>have shown, due diligence in his. efforts to collect the indebtedness from the principal debtor. If we were córrect in the view then taken, a new trial should be granted, for under an erroneous-view of the facts in evidence the jury were not instructed as they should have been upon some material points. The v.erdict was for the plaintiff, and,'if upon the uncontroverted facts in evidence, the verdict of the jury is right, it should not be disturbed for an error which could work no injustice. Upon a more careful examination of the question of law raised, we are forced to the conclusion that we were in error in our construction of the contract. It is in these words: ‘ For value received I hereby guarantee the payment of this note. (Signed) L. II. Mizner.’ Bearing in mind that this undertaking of Mizner’s was entered into at the time of the execution of the notes, and was the real consideration for .the transfer of the property,-we are satisfied that it was an original undertaking upon the part of Mizner, and being so, under th-e evidence in the cause, it was unnecessary to.first pursue the parties executing the note as principals, of show their insolvency. In Snevily <em>v. </em>Johnston, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 307" data-case-ids="1852641" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0307-01">1 W. &amp; S. 307</a>, the guaranty was in these words: ‘ I guarantee the within note to John Johnston;’ and in the opinion the broad principle that ‘ when the guaranty or promise, though collateral to the principal contract, is made at the same time with the principal contract, and becomes an essential ground of the credit given to the principal debtor, the whole is one original and entire transaction.’ In Amsbaugh <em>v. </em>Gearhart et al., <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20482" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Jones 482">1 Jones 482</a>, in a-Per Curiam opinion, it is held that when one endorsed without date upon a note ‘I will see the within paid,’ he is liable as an’original promisor, and not as a guarantor. The same principle is enunciated in Campbell <em>v. </em>Baker, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20243" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="10 Wright 243">10 Wright 243</a>; Reigart <em>v. </em>White, 2 P. F. Smith 483; Roberts <em>v. </em>Riddle, 29 Id. 468. In the light of these authorities it would seem that the contract of Mizner was not a contract of guaranty in the technical sense, but rather that of surety. For these reasons the rule for a new trial must be discharged.”</p>

    <p id="b538-7" data-blocks='[["BL_538.7",538,[258,1080,1171,1277]]]'>The learned judge who tried this case, whilst admitting that his ruling on the facts was wrong, yet refused a new trial because, as he thought, the writing under consideration being, in fact, an original undertaking, and not, as upon its face it purports to be, a guaranty, a re-trial would but result in a verdict the same as that already rendered. Whilst we grant that the arguments leading to this conclusion are not without plausibility, yet, upon a careful review of the authorities, we have been led to a different opinion. The undertaking in 'controversy was appended to three several judgment notes, drawn by M. R. Kerney, Hugh Montgomery and William Oorll, to Seth Spier, the plaintiff, and reads as follows : <em>“ </em>I guarantee the payment of the within note, for value received. L. H. Mizner.” Without doubt this is technically a guaranty, and unless there is in the case something which we have failed to discover, by which its legal meaning is altered, it must be so treated. In Isett <em>v. </em>Hoge, <a href="/watts/2/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="2 Watts 128" data-case-ids="1840037" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0128-01">2 Watts 128</a>, an undertaking of a like character was held to be a guaranty. The similarity of this case with the one in hand will be apparent when the two agreements are compared ; the one is: “I do hereby guarantee the payment of the above note to said Henry Isett;” the other: “I guarantee the payment of the within note, for value received.” Thus, though there is, between these two contracts, a slight verbal difference, their legal effect and meaning are precisely the same. To attempt to distinguish these two cases would be idle, and unless we overrule Isett <em>v. </em>Hoge it must govern. But, as we would, in its overruling, be supported neither by authority nor reason, we must permit it to stand, and under its authority hold that Mizner’s undertaking was an agreement to pay only in case of the insolvency of the makers, or after due diligence had been used to collect the notes from them.</p>
    <p id="b538-8" data-blocks='[["BL_538.8",538,[299,2367,1120,43]],["BL_539.1",539,[129,379,1161,1190]]]'>Nor do we discover anything in the authorities, cited for the <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>plaintiff, which in any degree impugns the doctrine of Isett <em>v. </em>Hoge. In Amsbaugh <em>v. </em>Gearhart, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20482" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="1 Jones 482">1 Jones 482</a>, the agreement was: “ I will see the within paid;” there is-in this nothing more or less than an unconditional promise to pay the obligation when due, if, for any reason, the payor is in default. It is a contract of suretyship and not of guaranty. So, in Campbell <em>v. </em>Baker, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20243" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="10 Wright 243">10 Wright 243</a>, though the word guaranty was' used, yet as the guaranty was to pay “ <em>when due” </em>the undertaking, obviously, had reference to the liquidation of the note at the time specified and not to the solvency of the maker. A like case is Roberts <em>v. </em>Riddle, 29 P. F. Smith 468, where the guaranty was to pay the bond <em>according to its terms,” </em>and as one of its terms, of course, was its payment when due, the undertaking was, in effect, not different from that in Campbell <em>v. </em>Baker. Some stress seems to be laid on the fact that the guaranty, in the case in hand, was made at the time of the execution of the note; this, however, affects not the character of contract, but only the consideration by which it is supported. As was said in Snevily <em>v. </em>Johnston, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20309" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 309">1 W. &amp; S. 309</a>, where the guaranty is made at the same time with the principal contract, it becomes an essential ground of the credit given to the debtor, and supports both the promise of the debtor and of the guarantor. On this point this case is authority, but not so when used to support the main proposition of' the plaintiff. The words of the contract expressed a warranty, and by all parties the case was treated as one of warranty; the insolvency of the maker was proved by the plaintiff as a pre-requisite to his recovery, and the only question was that of consideration, which was settled as above stated.</p>

If it was true that the principal debtors, or any of them, residing within the county of Mercer, or, for that matter, within the' state of Pennsylvania, were solvent when the notes fell due, it was the duty of the plaintiff to have used proper diligence in the collection of those claims, and failing-in this the guarantor was discharged. Mizner’s assent to the stay of the executions of 1874, was of no force if at that time Montgomery was insolvent, for, in such case, the attempt to make the money on them would be fruitless, and, if he was already released from his undertaking, there would be in this no such new consideration as would serve to rebind him. But if, at that time Montgomery was solvent, able to pay the notes in whole or in part, the stay, if given at Mizner’s instance, would be consideration enough to rebind him to his original contract, or, what comes to the same thing,' to estop him from setting up the previous negligence of the plaintiff by way of release.</p>
    <p id="b539-8" data-blocks='[["BL_539.5",539,[334,2349,913,43]]]'>The judgment is reversed and a new venire ordered.</p>
