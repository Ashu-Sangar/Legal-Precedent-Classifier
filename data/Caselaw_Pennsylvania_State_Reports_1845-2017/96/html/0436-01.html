The pipes of the company extend along the streets of what was Birmingham, East Birmingham, Monongahela ’borough, Temperanceville, and other suburbs of the old city. In the summer of 1876, the company, at the request of the citizens on the heights of Allentown, were laying pipes in the comparatively unsettled portions of the city. For that purpose they employed William Dickson, who had sole and exclusive control of the excavation for pipe laying. On the 14th. of June 1876, an excavation was made in what is on the map as Plain avenue, an unpaved street. The plaintiff, Mrs. Stewartson, saw the men at work at the excavation during the 14th. On that evening she alleged that she was proceeding down an alley leading into Plain avenue and fell into the excavation and sustained the injuries complained of. ■</p>

The defence proposed to ask her if she had not agreed to waive her right to damages if the company would grant her immunity from Avaterrent. The question, if answered in the affirmative, tended to show that she Avas not greatly injured. We contend that a large latitude of cross-examination is alloAvable when the party is a Avitness testifying to the extent of injuries which mainly consisted of “ pain and anguish,” and the truth of Avhich rests entirely in the veracity of the witness.</p>

A party will not be permitted to leave out new matter constituting his own case: Jackson <em>v. </em>Litch, 12 P. F. Smith 451. Where the plaintiff testifies in his own behalf, the defendant has no right to introduce his defence on the cross-examination; at the time of making his defence he may examine the plaintiff in chief as if under cross-examination: Malone <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 19 P. F. Smith 46. The question, made the subject of the first assignment of error, was whether the plaintiff had not agreed to waive her right of damages for a consideration. That was matter of defence— it was not said to be for another purpose — and the court rightly overruled it.</p>
    <p id="b438-11" data-blocks='[["BL_438.12",438,[315,2356,1112,42]],["BL_439.1",439,[135,395,1164,375]]]'>The second assignment is the refusal of the court to permit tlie <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>defendant, on cross-examination of the plaintiff, to ask whether she did not say to Stengle that she had been only a little scratched. The witness had already stated that Stengle was at her house the next day after the accident. In chief she testified that she was severely hurt. Had she answered the question affirmatively, it would have tended to show her view of the injury at the time; if negatively, ground would have been laid for contradiction. The question directly related to the subject of her examination in chief and was admissible.</p>
    <p id="b439-6" data-blocks='[["BL_439.4",439,[134,780,1165,895]]]'>Reese testified that a barricade was put up the next morning after the accident, and that was competent on the question of negligence: McKee <em>v. </em>Bidwell, 24 P. F. Smith 218. Then the plaintiff was allowed “ to ask the witness whether or not, immediately prior to the putting up of the barricade, he notified the party in charge of the work of the dangerous character of the place and that a barricade was necessary, for the purpose of showing an admission of negligence upon the part of the defendant company, by the erection of a barricade after the accident, and also to show that there rvas no such barricade before.” This notice was after the accident; so, also, was the admission of the person in charge of the work; altogether too long after for declarations of an agent to be competent. Frazier <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20104" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Wright 104">2 Wright 104</a>, cited in support of the offer does not apply. There testimony was rejected relating to the knowledge of the superintendent prior to the accident, and nothing in the case touches admissions by a laborer or agent. The admission by an agent as to a past occurrence is not evidence against his principal: Fawcett <em>v. </em>Bigley,. 9 P. F. Smith 411; Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Titusville &amp; Pithole Plank Road Co., 21 Id. 350; Bigley <em>v. </em>Williams, 30 Id. 107. The third assignment of error must be sustained.</p>

Miss Fern was acquainted with the plaintiff before the accident and was with her a number of weeks after. It does not appear that she had any experience whatever to qualify her to speak as an expert, and yet she was permitted to give her opinion of the effect of the injury upon the plaintiff’s health. She was positive that the accident had a very bad effect, but had she been an expert she might have been as doubtful of the cause of the plaintiff’s subsequent ill health as was Dr. Case. No better illustration than this can be given of the propriety of excluding opinions of persons who have no knowledge or experience on the subject. It was said by the present chief justice that no clearly defined rule can be found as to what constitutes an expert. Much depends on the nature of the question in regard to which an opinion is asked. While, undoubtedly, it must appear that the witness has enjoyed some means of special knowledge or experience, no rule can be laid down in the nature of things as to the extent of it: Ardesco Oil Co. <em>v. </em>Gilson, 13 P. F. <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>Smith 146. This witness had no means of- special knowledge or experience, and the jury, not herself, should have drawn the inferences from the facts she narrated.</p>
    <p id="b440-6" data-blocks='[["BL_440.4",440,[330,535,641,43]]]'>The fifth assignment is not sustained.</p>
