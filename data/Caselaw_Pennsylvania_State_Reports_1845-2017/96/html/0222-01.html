P. Milligan had been chosen at said election to serve for the term commencing April 1877, and that said return was false, fraudulent and untrue in that, inter alia, certain tickets had been counted for the respondent, Milligan, which did not specify for what .term they were cast.</p>

The voter should so express his intention as to leave no doubt, when two persons are elected at the same time to like offices, but for different terms, for which term he casts his ballot. The omission is his, and he should not complain if from the impossibility of ascertaining his intention, his ballot be rejected.”</p>
