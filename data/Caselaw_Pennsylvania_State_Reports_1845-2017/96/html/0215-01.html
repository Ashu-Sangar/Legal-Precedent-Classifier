A sheriff of a county entered into an agreement with the commissioners of the county to board the prisoners in the jail at a fixed rate, and contracted with F. to furnish the bread therefor. The sheriff died insolvent, largely indebted to F. for bread, a portion of which debt F. received from the administrator of the deceased sheriff. By a subsequent special Act of Assembly the 'county was required to ascertain the amount due from the sheriff to F., and to certify the amount to the commissioners for payment. The controller refused to comply with the requirements of the act,, and in a proceeding by mandamus to enforce the payment, <em>Held, </em>that the Act of Assembly was unconstitutional and void, as the debt was the personal debt of the sheriff.</p>

That petitioner received from the estate of the said Woods- the sum of $651.52, leaving a balance of $855.48 due for bread furnished as aforesaid, which balance the estate of the said Woods is insufficient to pay. Your petitioner further represents that in view of said insufficiency of the estate of Harry Woods, by an Act of Assembly, approved the 30th day of March 1870, the controller of said county was authorized and required to examine the claim of petitioner against the estate of the late Harry Woods and ascertain the balance due him, with interest, after receiving his proper dividend from said estate, and to certify the balance so found to the commissioners of said county, whose duty it shall be to direct the same to be paid as other claims against the county are paid.

The county paid over such money in her own way, and was bound to know of and provide for her own debt, or those contracted for her benefit; She could not relieve herself of the obligation to provide and pay for the sustenance of the prisoners by a private and secret contract with one of her officials. 2. We are not seeking to compel the county to pay a second time. On the contrary, it appears that the county received credit on the plaintiff’s bill for such portion <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>of payment as he received from the estate of Harry Woods, out of the moneys paid over by the county. It must be presumed that all the moneys so paid over to the estate of Harry Woods on account of bread furnished for the use of prisoners was properly applied and has been received by the plaintiff. And it is only for the balance remaining unpaid that the plaintiff demands payment, and for which the state has said, in its supreme wisdom, that the county ought to pay.</p>

The fact that the debt was for bread furnished the prisoners at the instance and on the credit of said Woods, the then sheriff, does not make it any the less the private debt of Woods. The plaintiff could not recover it from the county, because the county never contracted with him to furnish the bread.</p>

The answer alleges that the county of Allegheny did not contract the debt mentioned in the petition and was never liable for the payment of it. It avers on the contrary that the county contracted with Woods, the sheriff, for a stipulated sum,* for the support of the convicts, and that this compensation necessarily included bread as well as all other articles of food necessary for’their support. The answer further avers that the entire contract price was paid to Woods and his administrator in various sums and at different dates, aggregating $7333.25, which sum, it says, was “more than ample to pay for all the food (including bread) furnished” to the prisoners. The petition itself avers that Woods, personally, contracted the debt in question, and that a considerable part of it was received from his estate in payment. It thus appears that the petitioner’s claim was purely a personal one by himself against Woods, and <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>further that there was not even a shade of obligation, legal or moral, on the part of the county to pay this debt. In such circumstances an act of the legislature directing the county to pay it is of no'more validity than would be an act directing the county to pay the debt of any private citizen. Such legislation is void for want of constitutional power to enact it. No authority has been shown in support of the claim of the plaintiff, and we are clearly of opinion that the court below was right in refusing the writ of mandamus prayed for.</p>
