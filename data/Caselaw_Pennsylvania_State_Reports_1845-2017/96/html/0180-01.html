The plaintiffs brought this action against defendant as a <em>feme sole </em>trader- to recover the value of produce furnished to her in her business. It appeared that Mrs. Orrell was a huckster, and bought and sold on her own account; that her husband lived with her and occasionally worked for her, but was idle, intemperate and worthless, and made no provision of any kind for his wife, but that on the contrary she supported him; that she personally ordered the goods, except in a few instances, when her husband acted as her messenger, and that they were all- charged to her upon the books of the plaintiffs.
