Insurance Company issued a policy of insurance to John W. Simons on a farm-house and a bam and contents in Crawford county, Pa., for the sum of $1900, for the term of three years from that date. In the policy the house was insured for $1400. The policy was written and countersigned by E. J. Smith, agent of the company at Williamsfield in Ohio, duly constituted and appointed agent according to the laws of the state of Ohio. The application upon which the policy was issued was taken and written . by E. D. Cole, a sub-agent under Smith, and. countersigned by Smith as <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>agent and Cole sub-agent. The company alleged that in the application for this insurance the assured stated that his house was a two-story frame dwelling-house worth $2000; that it was thirteen years old; that the dimensions given were 20x25 feet for the main building, west wing 16x16 feet, east wing 14x25 feet, and that the absolute ownership of the property was in him ; that upon these representations and statements the company was induced to insure the house for the sum of $1400, about two-thirds of the valuation; that by the terms of the policy the application was made part of the contract, and all the statements and representations therein made were taken and deemed warranties on the part of the assured. On November 22d 1877, the house was burned. The company having heard of the loss, Henry Kraber, the state agent, called upon Simons to ascertain the facts concerning the fire. From Simons he took a sworn statement, wherein, as defendant alleged, the company learned for the first time that the larger part of the house was only one story, and a low story at that, one wing being only eight feet in height, and the other nine feet, and the main building a story and a half; that it was also ascertained by Simons’s estimate, that the property had been largely overvalued, he estimating the building in his statement at $1000, when in the application it had been estimated at $2000; that the further discovery was made that the building, instead of being thirteen years old, as stated in the application, was some twenty-one years old at least. It also was alleged that the title was in his wife, and that Simons’s interest was at most an equitable one, the legal title being vested in his wife. Other facts will be found stated in the opinion of this court.</p>

One of the objects of the statutes is protection of the people against worthless foreign companies, and as the insured is not required to see that the laws have been observed, before making a contract, we discover no reason, founded on public policy, which will enable a solvent foreign company, which has violated our laws in making a contract and receiving its consideration from an innocent citizen, to escape liability for non-performance, by setting up its own turpitude.

Certainly a contract is fair and reasonable when it expresses that representations affecting the risk arc warranted; and, if its meaning were doubtful, a court will not construe the language so as to avoid the policy for trifling and immaterial matters which neither party probably considered at the making of the contract.

They were'told if the house was a story and a half instead of a t-wo-story building, there was a misdescription on part of the plaintiff, and defendants were not liable on the policy. Simons testified he would “ consider it a two-story house; some considered it a story and a half house.” “ The building was two stories, and the wings one story.” It is a mistake to say there was no evidence that it was a two-story building.</p>
    <p id="b527-9" data-blocks='[["BL_527.7",527,[127,1577,1166,728]]]'>In examination of this case we note that the fire was but little more than two months after the date of the 'policy ; that the defendants called no witness to prove the value of the house at the date of insurance, or loss; nor did they to rebut any part of the plaintiff’s testimony respecting the contract, notice or proofs of loss; that they relied almost entirely on the statements of value of the land, before and after the fire, set forth in the proofs of loss, which were written by the defendants’ agent and adjuster; and that said proofs do not directly state the value of the house, but say “ deponent has no value of the said house or what it would take to build a new one.” A considerable part of the proofs could not be read by the plaintiff, nor the justice before whom he was sworn. Erasures and interlineations were noted at the foot without stating what they were. Instructions to the jury in every case should be with some reference to the state of the evidence before them. We are not convinced of any error, having reference to the evidence which requires this cause to be sent back for another trial.</p>
