The question reserved in the verdict is not altogether free .from difficulty in view of the apparently different opinions expressed in a number of cases arising under the Acts of 1797 and 1834, relating to-the lien of decedent’s debts. But a careful examination of these cases will show, we think, that the difference in the views expressed are rather apparent than real. While in a number of cases it is explicitly declared that the widow and heirs must be brought into court within ten years from the death of the debtor in order to continue the creditors’ lien against the real estate of the deceased debtor, still, we understand those cases to refer to the lien of debts for which suits have been commenced and judgments obtained within five years after the death of the debtor. But we are not aware of any case like the present in which it has been decided that where the suit is commenced within five years, but judgment not obtained until after the expiration of that period, the lien of said judgment was to be counted from the expiration of the period of five years after the <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>death of the debtor instead of from the date of its entry, as is done in cases of judgment <em>inter vivos. </em>On the contrary, in several cases, it has been held that the lien of the judgment would begin to run from the date of its entry, although in none of these cases does it appear that the question now before the court was involved in the decision rendered, and, therefore, we must regard what was said in reference to it, rather as the views of the judge who delivered the opinion, than as a decision of the Supreme Court. In Duncan <em>v. </em>Clark, <a href="/watts/7/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts 217" data-case-ids="1846789" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0217-01">7 Watts 217</a>, Justice Kennedy, in speaking of the Act of 1797, says: ‘ This lien will continue seven years without suit or judgment from the death of the debtor; and if judgment be had for it, at any time within that period, then the lien, by means thereof, will be extended five 'years beyond the seven years; making twelve in the whole; but, in order to continue the lien beyond this period it is requisite that a scire facias should be sued out for this purpose before t'he expiration thereof, otherwise the lien of the debt upon the real estate will cease at the end of the twelve years from the death of the debtor. When, however, the suit is commenced within the seven years, but judgment cannot be had in it until afterwards, the pending of the suit would seem to be sufficient to keep the lien alive ; and the first term of five years would not commence until the rendition of the judgment; so that a revival of the judgment within five years after its date, would preserve and continue the original lien of the debt for another period of five years.’ So, in Bredin <em>v. </em>Agnew, 8 Barr 233, it is said by Judge Bell, that, ‘under the equitable application of a rule borrowed from the Act of 1798, a scire facias must be sued out within five years from the expiration of the statutory period, or, when this is overrun before judgment recovered within five years from its rendition.’' In Benner <em>v. </em>Phillips, <a href="/watts-serg/9/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 13" data-case-ids="12168761" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0013-01">9 W. &amp; S. 13</a>, Judge Rogers says: ‘As has been already decided, commencing suit against the administrator without naming the heirs, and obtaining judgment, does not release the lien. It is competent for the creditor, notwithstanding, afterwards to proceed against the heirs ; and when this is done within five years from the rendition of judgment against the administrator, we think, in analogy to the twenty-fourth section of the Act of 1834, the lien remains.’ See also, Moore <em>v. </em>Skelton, 2 Harris 359.</p>

It is true, that expressions may be found in these cases rather sustaining the position taken by defendant’s counsel, but in none of them was the question now before us involved and passed upon. In McMurray’s Admr’s <em>v. </em>Hopper, <em><a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wright%20468" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="7 Wright 468">supra,</a> </em>a restricted judgment had been obtained <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>against the debtor in his lifetime, and the question decided by the Supreme Court was in reference to the effect of a revival of that judgment against the administrator aloné, on land of the decedent, not bound by the original judgment. In Soles <em>v. </em>Hickman, supra, the question was whether the alienee of a devisee was entitled to notice before his land could be held liable for the decedent’s debt. And in Corrigan’s Estate, <em>supra, </em>suit was commenced and a judgment obtained within five years after the expiration of that period, a scire facias was issued to bring in the widow and heirs, but before judgment was obtained upon the scire facias the decedent’s lands were sold by order of the Orphans’ Court, and it was held by the Supreme Court, that the judgment-creditor was entitled to have his judgment paid out of the proceeds of that sale.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b398-6" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[251,955,1166,720]]]'>“ We have also examined the case of Maus <em>v. </em>Hummel et al., <a href="/nc/46/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Jones 228" data-case-ids="8682171" data-case-paths="/nc/46/0228-01">1 Jones 228</a>, and the cases therein referred to by counsel, and also some cited in the opinion of the court. In speaking of the Act of 1797, Judge Coulter says : ‘ The construction given to the words ‘duly prosecuted,’ is, that no matter at what-time within the seven years the suit was brought, it continued the lien for five years after the termination of the seven, although judgment was not obtained within the seven. The lien, therefore, of the debt in this case extended twelve years from the time of Jackson’s death, and no longer; and the land in dispute, not having been brought into execution, within that period, was beyond its power, and the estate had vested in the heir absolutely at the expiration of the twelve years.’ It seems difficult to reconcile the language of Judge Coulter with the opinions expressed in Duncan <em>v. </em>Clark, <em><a href="/watts/7/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="7 Watts 217" data-case-ids="1846789" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0217-01">supra,</a> </em>and the other cases to which we have before referred, and also with Paine <em>v. </em>Craft, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 458" data-case-ids="481766" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0458-01">7 W. &amp; S. 458</a>, where the death took place in 1813, and the sale of the real estate in 1833.</p>
