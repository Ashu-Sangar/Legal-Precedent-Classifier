The balance he claimed was the value of the stock. The amount of purchases made between the date of the inventory and the date of the fire, he said he arrived at by referring to some unpaid bills in his possession, and to his bank account. The checks which had been drawn upon his bank account were not produced on the trial, but were also alleged to have been destroyed by the fire.</p>

J., the plaintiff produced witnesses in order to show the value of his stock of goods at the time of the fire. One of these witnesses was a wholesale dealer in notions, with an experience of sixteen years,' who had sold goods to Braden and had been in his store a number of times. Another kept a similar country store. A third was a travelling salesman for a large wholesale firm in Philadelphia, and a fourth a prominent auctioneer whose business had principally consisted in the sales of the goods of stores. These witnesses had all seen the stock shortly before the fire. They were permitted under objection to give their opinion of the gross valué of the stock prior to the fire, from the appearance of the store as they had seen it, and from their experience in selling and estimating the value of goods. They all estimated the value at about $12,000. •</p>

Whether they were competent to form an opinion and testify to an estimate of the stock was one thing, and was for the court; whether that estimate when made was of any value and entitled to any weight was another thing, and wrns for the jury. It will appear from the history of the case that the plaintiff had already testified in detail to the value of the stock, giving items, both as to quality and value. These witnesses were' called to corroborate the plaintiff, not as to the items embraced in his loss, but as to <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>the general appearance and value of the stock. But the admission of the testimony of these witnesses falls within the rule laid down in Ardesco Oil Co. <em>v. </em>Gibson, 13 P. F. Smith 146, and Sorg <em>v. </em>First German Congregation, 13 Id. 156, that “ whether a witness is an expert, qualified to pronounce an opinion, must, in a great measure, be confided to the discretion of the court below trying the cause, and we will not reverse either on account of the admission or rejection of such evidence, unless in a clear and strong case.”</p>
