If for the purpose of the business, then plaintiffs, having kept their interests in the firm secret, could not prevent a sale of the goods as the property of John F. Denny, that being the firm name. That is, if the debts were for money to be used in the business, then we think John F. Denny, under the powers in this agreement, and the fact that the partnership was kept secret, could give an obligation under which the whole title to the goods could be sold and would pass to the purchaser.”</p>

Denny. The fact of Callender &amp; Co. being partners was kept a secret. They did not make that known to any one. No one in Butler seemed to know that there was any other person interested in this store but John F. Den-ny alone. We have received evidence, under objection, of John F. Denny’s declarations from time to time to persons dealing with him, that no other person was interested in the store, and that he owned it himself. We <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>have also received evidence that at the time Denny obtained Robinson’s endorsement on the note for which this note was after-wards given, that he stated that he was obtaining that money for use in his business. There is a difference in law between where parties carry on business in the individual name of one of the members of the firm, keeping their interests secret, and where it is made known. Where the interest is kept secret, the power of the partner carrying on the business is greater than where all persons having interests are known to parties dealing, or can be easily ascertained by parties dealing.with the firm. In this case, from the evidence, there was no means by which Robinson or any one dealing with Denny could have obtained information as to there being other parties interested in the firm* except Denny, and when they applied to Denny for that information, he stated that there were no other parties interested in the store. Therefore, from the fact that Callender &amp; Co. put Denny in that position, and there was no other person from whom to obtain that information except Denny, and if the jury believe he did not give the information when demanded, that there were other persons interested, but claimed to own the store himself individually, then we think the law gives to third parties dealing with him whatever rights they would be entitled to if the fact that other parties were interested could have been known, or with reasonable diligence and inquiry ascertained by parties dealing with him. * * *</p>

Thus if a man in business have a dormant partner, and a creditor of the first sue him and attach his goods, this attachment shall not be postponed to a later attachment by another creditor who discovers this unknown partner and makes him defendant.’ That seems to us, in a measure, to sustain our position.</p>

Denny, on a claim that the money raised by that endorsement was for use in his business, and not knowing any other partner there, that judgment could not be set aside in favor of a man who knew there were other partners and had obtained judgment against them. The same principle, if carried out, covers a sale of the goods as against a sale of the individual interest of the partner. We think, too, that there is a difference, and we might as well mention that a different principle applies between a writ against the goods alone and a suit against the-partner. Now, if Mr. Daniel Denny had sued this firm, and Robinson had sued the firm — sued Oallender &amp; Co. and John F. Denny — they would be bound to show, in order to hold Callender &amp; Co., that they were partners, and they would be bound to show that this debt was a partnership debt; but <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>where there is a sale of the goods only of the partnership, then, we think, a writ against one partner alone — the ostensible partner— the parther known to the world, might, in certain cases, pass title to these goods, although it would not hold other members of the firm. But if suit had been brought against the individual, they would have been compelled to make out a different kind of ease from that where the party merely claims to levy on the goods of the firm.</p>

It is true they tried to restrict the contracting of debts to only those necessary to carry on the business, but they could not restrict him from contracting debts individually, and, having placed him in that position, he has greater power, having put him in possession of the goods, and if he desflt with the public as though he was sole owner of the store, therefore, his powers were greater than if the other partners had been known.”</p>

We contend there was but one question in this case, as the court below admitted, and that was whether the sheriffs sale to Thomas Robinson carried only Denny’s interest in the firm of John F. Denny, or the title of the firm, and therewith the right in Robinson to the possession of the goods; and, to determine this question, the court left it to the jury to ascertain the character of the loans to, or endorsements for Denny — whether to him individually or to the firm. The frequent, uncalled -for, and most pointed references in the charge to Denny’s being contradicted, and to the alleged claim of defendant that the agreement was a fraud, &amp;c., together with numerous statements that the arrangement between Callender &amp; Co. and Denny was kept a secret, made up the greater portion of the charge, and left the case in such shape that the minds of the jury were necessarily strongly impressed with the idea that the court had concluded that the plaintiffs could not, and should not, recover.</p>

While they were in fact in partnership with him under an agreement whereby they were to have one-half of the net profits after deducting necessary expenses, yet the business was to be carried on in the name of Denny alone. They did not file in the office of the prothonotary any statement under the Act of 14th April 1851, Purd. Dig. 1119, giving the names of the members of the partnership, but permitted him to have the ostensible ownership of the whole property, whereby he obtained credit on the strength of his presumed ownership. He held himself out in the community as the sole owner of the stock of goods. • As such he bought and sold, and obtained credit. Under a fair charge the jury has found that at the time Denny obtained the money for which the judgment was recovered, and by virtue of an execution thereon the property was sold, he represented that he wanted it to put into his business. The plaintiffs having thus held him out to the world as the sole owner of the property in his possession, and having permitted him to claim it as his own and obtain credit and contract debts by reason of his possession and claim thereto, why shall not that property be liable for the .debts thus contracted. To hold otherwise would be to permit the secret contract of the plaintiffs to work a fraud on innocent and confiding creditors. We deem it unnecessary to discuss the assignments separately.</p>
