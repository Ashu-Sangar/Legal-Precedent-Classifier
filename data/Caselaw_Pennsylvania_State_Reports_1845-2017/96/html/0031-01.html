Under the terms of the lease Floyd had the right to remove, and on November 29th 1875 he sold said leasehold interest and the machinery and fixtures to the' plaintiff, Boyles, for $425. A bill of sale was prepared and Floyd went at once to the land with Boyles, showed him the machinery and fixtures in a little wooden house, and gave him a key to the door of the house. <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>Boyles took the key, locked up the house, and went home. It was in evidence that at the time of the sale the debts of Floyd did not exceed §150, and that he was worth, by his own estimate, between §2000 and §3000. The fixtures and machinery sold were estimated to be worth about §250. During the following December suits were brought against Floyd and judgments recovered to the amount of §150. In the meantime Floyd had remained in possession of a house on the property sold by him to Boyles, which he had reserved out of the bill of sale, occupying the same at a small rental which he paid to Boyles. About three weeks after the sale Boyles went to the land and nailed up the house containing the machinery. About the 7th of January 1876 he returned and directed Floyd and some other men to remove the machinery and fixtures, as he wanted them elsewhere. On the next day Floyd and others proceeded to remove them, wdien they were interrupted by the defendants, who, as constables, had levied on the same as the property of Floyd. The latter informed the defendants that he had put the property out of his hands, and that he had things fixed so that his creditors could not get a cent out of it. A day or two thereafter Boyles served on the defendants a formal notice of his claim to the goods. They, however, proceeded with the levy, and on the 14th of January sold the property and the purchasers carried it away. Boyles then brought this suit.</p>

In such case it is a question for the jury whether the change of possession has been actual and bona fide; and so I leave this case to you, for you to say from the evidence how that was.</p>

If you find it bona fide and honest, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff for such measure of damages as I have already indicated: but if you find it fraudulent and colorable, as 1 have already explained, your verdict should be for the defendants on the executions in the hands of W.

Barr ; but as to any of it sold by the defendants which has not been levied and sold on the executions in the hands of Barr, your verdict should be for the plaintiff, giving compensatory damages therefor, as the defendants have shown no warrant or execution to justify themselves for selling any property not levied and sold in said three executions.
