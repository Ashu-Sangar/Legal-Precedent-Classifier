It must, however, be remembered that the defendants h-ad a large sum of money invested in this enterprise. Furthermore, theexperiments were encouraging and the defendants were hopeful of ultimate and complete success. Again, if they had succeeded in getting this pair of dies to perform their desired function, they might reasonably expect and did hope to succeed with the finishing dies. For a considerable part of the time in question George Palmer was in the service of the defendants ait an annual salary of $2000, his sole employment being to superintend the defendants’ experiments with this patent. Fair dealing to George Palmer required the defendants to give the patent a full trial. The experiments with dies in the end proved unsuccessful, and this part of the patent, like the other steps in the patented process, was demonstrated to be a failure, and had to be abandoned.</p>

Hubbard, who, on the date of the agreement, assigned their entire interest in the patent to the appellees, Hubbard, Lippincott, Bakewell &amp; Co., of which firm, Mr. Hubbard, one of the patentees, was a member; and that, in consideration of the assignment, the firm agreed to “ keep a true and correct account of <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>all the axes and hatchets manufactured by them by the process described and claimed in said letters patent, and on the first day of July and January in each and every year during the term of said letters patent, after the first day of January 1872, render unto the said Palmer a true and correct statement of the number of axes and hatchets manufactured by the process aforesaid, and pay him as royalty one cent for every axe and hatchet so manufactured by them.” The contract also provides that the parties shall agree on such sums as to them shall appear reasonable to be paid as royalty on axes and hatchets made between the date of the assignment and the first day of January 1872.</p>

He further found that dies for straightening, swaging and rough shaping the pole were used before the letters patent were issued, and have since been largely in use by other manufacturers.</p>

    <p id="b110-7" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[269,729,1177,1666]],["BL_111.1",111,[125,372,1176,678]]]'>The ground on which the bill appears to have been dismissed is, that in manufacturing axes the appellees did not use the entire process described in the letters-patent, and that appellant is not entitled to any compensation for the use of such parts of the process as were employed, because they were practically valueless, and cost the appellees, in their attempt to utilize them, more than they were worth. This view of the contract we think was erroneous. The patentees first assigned their interest in the letters-patent to the firm of which one of them was a member, and in consideration thereof the firm at the same time contracted' to pay Palmer the stipulated royalty for his.interest in the patent. The transaction was practically a sale of the patent to the appellees, coupled with the contemporaneous agreement on their part to pay Palmer one cent for each axe manufactured under the patented process or any part of that process. There was no warranty as to the validity or utility of the patent, nor is it pretended there was any fraud in the transaction. The patent had been but recently obtained and had not then been fully tested. The appellees assumed the risk of its success. The agreement evidently contemplated the use of the patent by them in their business of manufacturing axes, and while perhaps they were not bound to persevere in its use to their own detriment, it is very clear that if they employed the patented process or any part thereof, they were bound to account according to the terms of their agreement. They might not find it advantageous to use all the mechanical devices covered by the patent; but, according to what must be regarded as the true interpretation of the contract, the employment of one or more of them was a manufacturing “ by the process described and claimed in the letters-patent.” It could never have been contemplated by the parties that the omission by the appellees to employ one or more of the devices or processes described in the patent, would entitle them to use the others free of •charge, or by paying therefor according to a <em>quantum valebant </em>basis. The contract is entire and indivisible, and the appellees having availed themselves of at least a part of the patented process should account and pay as provided in the contract. In the words of the learned master, “ having elected to use even one of the three patented processes under the agreement, they must pay the royalty as provided therein. It is immaterial that this part of the patented process was unsatisfactory. They must pay for second as well as <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>first class axes manufactured in this way. The language of the agreement is “ every axe manufactured.” The conclusions of the master are sustained by principles recognised in the following cases, viz.: Lawes <em>v. </em>Purser et al., 6 E. &amp; B. 930 ; Hall <em>v. </em>Condor et al., 89 E. C. L. R. 20 ; Birdsall <em>v. </em>Perys, 5 Blatch. 255; Kinsman <em>v. </em>Parkhurst, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Howard%20289" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="18 Howard 289">18 Howard 289</a> ; Vaughan <em>v. </em>Porter, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Vt.%20270" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="16 Vt. 270">16 Vt. 270</a>, and Bellas <em>v. </em>Hays, 5 S. &amp; R. 427. In the last case, Judge Gibson, speaking of the uncertain value of a patent, says : “ Where a particular fact is known to be doubtful,.or supposed to be so, if the party to be benefited neglects to secure himself by a covenant, he will be without remedy if it turns out contrary to. his expectations, for he will be considered as having paid his money for the benefit of a chance. It would seem to me that whether the invention, which is the subject of the plaintiff’s patent, .were valuable or not, was in its nature doubtful, and that the defendant took the risk of that matter on himself.”</p>
    <p id="b111-6" data-blocks='[["BL_111.4",111,[131,1061,1173,560]]]'>The master having found that the only use made of the drop and die after the 1st July 1873, was for shaping and'straightening, concluded that this was not a using under the patented process. In the language of his report, “ taking into account the fact found, that drops and dies were already in use for the purpose of shaping and rough-swaging, and the language of the letters-patent that the process patented is that of <em>shaping and welding by the same bloiv, </em>it is plain that the subject-matter of the agreement is not the use of a die simply for shaping, and consequently defendants’ use of the drop and die for <em>shaping </em>alone is not a manufacturing of axes under the patented process.” While this conclusion is not quite so clear to us ás it appears to have been to the learned master,we cannot say he was in error.</p>
    <p id="b111-7" data-blocks='[["BL_111.5",111,[129,1621,1174,556]]]'>On the whole we are of opinion that the conclusions of the master were quite as favorable to the appellees as they could justly claim, and that the decree recommended by him should have been adopted.
