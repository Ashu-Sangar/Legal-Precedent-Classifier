It was contended by the complainant that it was necessary that the alley way should pass as an easement, because of the great disadvantage resulting to his property from its loss as a means of access to the yard for the purpose of cleaning the vault or privy on his premises. The only way by which this work could be done without the use of the alley was to pass through the house on complainant's own ground, or perhaps to sink the vault to the gravel. <em>Held, </em>that these difficulties or disadvantages, however great, ought to have been provided for by express grant if the complainant expected to use other ground than his own to surmount these difficulties.</p>

That at the time of the purchase and for some time thereafter, the. buildings on the property consisted of one frame house fronting on Grantham street, near the corner of River avenue, and two other connected frame houses on Grantham street a few feet from the northern line of the lot. That between the frame near the corner and the other two houses, there was an open space used as a yard, about twenty-eight to thirty feet in front. In this open space, Stafford built two brick houses with a three feet covered alley-way between them ; having just moved the two connected frames to the northern line of his lot and <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>forward to the street line. In the rear of all the nouses, there was a yard about thirteen feet in width extending from the’northern line of the lot to River avenue. Stafford, as the owner of the entire property, did not separate the yards to the houses by fences, nor did he provide hydrants and separate drainage and al'ley-ways for the use of each house. He occupied one of the houses himself and rented the others, and he and his tenants used in common one hydrant which stood near the back line of the property, and opposite the alley-way between the two bricks, and in addition used at their pleasure and convenience the alley-way between the bricks and the foot-path to River avenue as a means of access to the back yards. Two privies or vaults stood on the ground, one in the rear of the two upper frame houses for their use, and the other in the rear of the lower brick house for the use of the corner frame and the two brick houses.</p>

There is, however, a stronger argument to-show that it was not intended as a burden on adjoining property, to be found in the deed itself; the deed provided for a separation of the properties so far as the vault or privy is concerned ; and the difficulties of the care of such vault and its cleaning cannot legitimately be made as a reason for the creation of a servitude upon the respondent’s property.
