That said association is a foreign corporation is shown not only by the record itself, but by the certificate of the secretary of the .Commonwealth, made out by him <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>under the provisions of the Act of 22d of April 1874, and which certificate was offered in evidence by the plaintiff himself. The first question is, can a foreign corporation be made a garnishee by service upon such agents as the uncontradicted testimony, or rather answers of Henry and Hoomer show themselves to be ? An attachment in execution is a proceeding unknown to the common law. When it lies, who are liable to it, and the mode and manner of its service must be determined by the statutes calling it into existence and regulating 'the practice under it. In a suit against a corporation the process must at common law be served on its head or chief officers. Admitting that said association could at common law be made liable in this proceeding, the service, not having been made on its head or chief officer, is not legal. We say they are not its head or chief officers, because Henry and Hoomer, the agents upon whom the service was had, in their answers say they are agents for the purpose of procuring insurance only. Surely such an agency does not make them the head or chief officer of the corporation.</p>

By no necessary implication can this act be held to relate to the service o.f process for the enforcement of contracts to which foreign corporations are strangers, and that this association is a stranger to the contract between the plaintiff and defendants is clear. The Act of 22d April 1874 merely prohibits foreign corporations from transacting business in this state until they have established an office and appointed an agent in the Commonwealth. It no more than any former act has relation to contracts other than those between such corporations and their own creditors. The court .was cited to and can find no act by which a foreign corporation can be made a garnishee, and as it cannot be so made at common law, at least by a service on such agents as Henry and Hoomer, the service in this case must he set aside.”</p>

Could they compel the association to make an assessment? Would any of the members be obliged to pay what they had already paid? If the plaintiff could have no remedy against the association, what is the object and purpose of the judgment? It cannot be for the purpose of execution, as the court would-be powerless to enforce it. The Statutes of 1849 and 1874, cited by plaintiff in error, apply only to the business of the corporation. It was not the intention of the legislature to permit creditors of individuals to harass and annoy foreign corporations by making them parties to suits in which they had no interest. The object and purpose of said acts were to make foreign corporations answerable to action against them within this Commonwealth.</p>

In that case it was decided that a foreign corporation that had accepted the privilege of extending -its works through this state, <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>upon the condition, “ that in all suits or actions which may he brought against said company, the service of process upon any manager, toll-gatherer, or other officer of the company shall be as good and available in law as if made on the president thereof,” and that said company shall keep an officer, resident in the county of Susquehanna, could be made a garnishee in an attachment execution. There the defendant resided in New York, and had obtained judgment against the corporation in that state. It was said that the true intent of the ninth section of the Act of 1841, Pamph. L. 29, was to bring the corporation within the jurisdiction of this state to answer in all suits or actions at law which might be brought against it; and that an attachment execution is within the meaning of the act. Now.by general statutes all foreign corporations, as a condition on which they may transact business in this state, must establish an office and have an agent, a chief purpose of which is, that process may be served, and such corporations be compelled to answer in all suits or actions brought against them. These statutes are so comprehensive as to embrace all actions to which such corporations are liable, and have like effect on them as the Act of 1841 had on the railroad company to which it specially applied. The language of that act relating to suits, service of process and keeping an agent, is substantially the same as in the general statutes of later date, and if that embraced an attachment execution so do these. The one made service on the manager or other officer, resident in the county, as available as if made on the president, the others declare that service upon the agent “ shall be good and valid in law to all intents and purposes.”</p>

No reason exists why a foreign corporation engaged in business here should be exempt from attachment process. It is a proceeding against the garnishee personally for the value of the thing attached when the thing itself is not produced. If a debt be attached it compels payment to the creditor of him to whom the garnishee is indebted. The object is to appropriate the debtor’s assets to payment of his debts, and this object ought to be favored. It may be accomplished whenever the court has jurisdiction over the person who has actual possession of the property, or who owes the debt, as well as when the property maybe taken into possession by the officers of the law: Childs &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Digby, 12 Harris 25.</p>
