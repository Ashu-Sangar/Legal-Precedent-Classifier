Shortly after this-Allen came to Pittsburgh and desired an extension of time; that he had very large interests in coal and oil leases in Butler county with Thomas A. Scott et al., and if he could get a little time he could convert his leases into money and pay off the entire mortgage. He said the sale of his property would ruin him, and if he could get time he could pay all; at his urgent request Robb agreed to see Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Gregg agreed to give time, provided his security remained unimpaired; Robb and Allen met in Butler May 28th 1877, and it was agreed that Allen should withdraw his affidavit of defence and confess judgment for the mortgage and interest then due and attorney’s commission of five per cent., and that Mr. Gregg would extend the time of the mortgage for one year or till February 1st 1881, and allow Mr. Allen a credit of $1000 on interest accruing thereafter, or a deduction of that amount on the discount that was on the mortgage, and that Allen should pay the interest falling due on the judgment semi-annually, ac<a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>cording to the terms of the mortgage,» all proceedings and execution to be stayed.</p>

Mr. Allen never gave any notes of any amount whatever as payment on the Gregg mortgage ; could not accept such a thing, as I had no authority to do so from Mr. Gregg ; the notes given were for my own services rendered Robert Allen in perfecting his title to his leases. There was no fraud practised by me on Mr. Allen in his confessing judgment, but on the contrary, it was not done until after a full and fair understanding on his part, and the time was extended on condition that he would pay the interest promptly, which he has failed to do. When employed by Robert Allen to perfect his title to his leases I found them quite complicated, and it required a great deal of labor to put them in a condition that would make them available. The service necessary I rendered 'and the money paid in Butler, and the notes given were for my services in the employ of Mr. Allen, and had no connection whatever with the Gregg mortgage. The paper given Mr. Allen, which he put in evidence, shows what the contract was. The services I rendered Mr. Allen were professional services and done in the uttermost good faith.</p>

On this rule testimony was taken — to which the attention of this court is respectfully called — and after due consideration this rule was, on the 18th September 1879, discharged.

    <p id="b323-6" data-blocks='[["BL_323.7",323,[166,750,1171,1028]]]'>On petition of the defendant the court afterwards granted a rule to show cause why the judgment should not be opened and satisfied to the extent of a sum specified in petition. ' An answer was filed denying the averments in the petition. Depositions were taken, and after argument the rule was made absolute and judgment reduced as prayed for. Thus the court in effect ordered satisfaction to be entered for a part of the judgment. The discretion of the court in 'opening the judgment we will not review'. But in ordering satisfaction to be entered of a part of the judgment, when the facts were disputed and there was no agreement to submit to the decision of the court, ivas error. The court has no power to strike off a judgment regular on its face when the facts are controverted: Breden <em>v. </em>Gilliland, 17 P. F. Smith 34; nor to compel it to be satisfied. The proper course is to award an issue: Homer &amp; McCann <em>v. </em>Hower, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20126" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Wright 126">3 Wright 126</a>. The plaintiff therein cannot be deprived of his constitutional trial by jury unless he has agreed to waive it. In this case the record does not show any waiver, 'and it was admitted on the argument there was no such agreement. The evidence is persuasive that the judgment was the result of a compromise of the plaintiff’s claim. Against his consent he cannot be deprived of it without its validity being passed upon by a. jury. Regularly this should be reviewed on writ of error. We can now change to one, and it is ordered accordingly. An appeal does not lie;</p>
