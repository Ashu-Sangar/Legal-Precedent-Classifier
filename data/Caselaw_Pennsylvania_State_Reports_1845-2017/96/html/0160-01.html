Is the judgment in evidence a judgment against Mrs. McLaughlin personally, or against her as executrix ? On this question we are inclined to take the view of the learned counsel for the plaintiffs. Mrs. McLaughlin was a member of the firm of C. Ihmsen &amp; Sons, under the provision of her husband’s will, and she authorized the execution of the note, upon which the judgment was had, by her attorney-in-fact, James E. Ledlie. Judge Parsons, in his work on Contracts, ch. 8, sect. 109, says: ‘ If an executor or administrator receives as such a promissory note or bill of exchange of the deceased, and endorses the same, he is liable upon it personally. If he make a note or bill, signing it as executor, he is personally <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>liable, unless he expressly limits his promise to pay by the words ‘ out of the assets of my testator, ’ or ‘ if the assets be sufficient, ’ or some equivalent. ’ No limitation of liability appears in the note in this case. It is simply the note of the firm of C. Ihmsen &amp; Sons, of which Mrs. McLaughlin, as executrix, was a member. -We, therefore, think that the judgment is a judgment against her personally. .</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b163-6" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[132,702,1169,1118]]]'>“But suppose the judgment against Mrs. McLaughlin is a personal judgment, upon which she would be liable as any other partner; what does the record show ? It is an admitted fact that at the date of the making of the note, and at the date of the entry of the judgment, she was, and still is, a married woman. She was married to W. F. McLaughlin, her present husband, on October 17th 1874. The note is dated May. 11th 1875, and the judgment upon it is entered on August 10th 187 5. The record does not show that her husband was joined, or that it was had for necessaries contracted for by her, or for any of the causes for which a married woman can be held liable. This raises the second question —Is the judgment void.? We think it is. A judgment by a personal action can be obtained against a married woman only for necessaries contracted for by herself, or in some of the cases enumerated in the Act of Assembly; and the facts to fix her liability must affirmatively appear on the record, otherwise the judgment is void: Hecker <em>v. </em>Haak et al., 7 Norris 238. But the plaintiffs’ counsel contends that'the plea of the defendants being ‘nulla bona,’ the question cannot be raised in this action. While it is true that, generally, the plea of ‘ nulla bona’ waives all irregularities in the process, yet we think that the defendant in the original judgment may come in at the trial and show that the judgment is void, and so prevent his money or property from being taken by attachment. At any rate, the question is raised in this case, for the question of law reserved is; ‘ whether under the facts admitted and the record evidence, the plaintiff is entitled to recover?’</p>

The suit is hot on the <em>note.
