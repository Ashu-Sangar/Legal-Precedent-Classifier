That this latter contingency has not yet arrived, and the period in which accumulations are valid has not yet been exceeded. That, as the point of time when the accumulations are to cease, under the directions of the will, is the mother’s death, and as this direction, if void in any part, is only void for its excess, that is, by as much as it exceeds the minority of the beneficiary, and as it may be that, on the death of the mother, Melissa 'the daughter may be living, Frederick dead, and thus Melissa be the sole beneficiary under the will, therefore the accumulations during her minority are good.'</p>

This legacy being contingent, Frederick McKee, the son, can not under the will claim to receive any share of the accumulations, if they form part of the estate of the testator, which is distributed under the will. The point of time at which bequest is to take effect, is the decease of his wife — “ upon her decease.” Until then neither of the children have any interest in the personalty. The condition precedent upon which they are to take is living “ at the time of her decease.” If they are not then living they take nothing, but it will go to his brothers and sisters. In no manner is anything given to these children unless provided that, on condition that they be living at her decease. This, we submit, clearly makes the legacy contingent: Moore <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20407" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Watts 407">9 Watts 407</a>; King <em>v. </em>Crawford, 17 S. &amp; R. 118 ; Provenchere’s Appeal, 17 P.

      <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>But suppose it be held that .the children of the testator took vested remainders in the corpus of the estate, or rather a vested estate to enjoy in future the corpus of the estate, including the accumulations during minority, which vested estate was liable to be divested and transferred to others, if the children did not survive their mother. Then these accumulations are permitted by the very language of the act. If the interest of Frederick, the son, is in remainder, then it is.vested, subject to be divested by his death before his mother. If the contingency upon which the enjoyment is to take place were to happen now, Frederick would at once enjoy, and this is the test as to whether the estate is vested or contingent. But, of course, as the present estate af'Frederick is merely a right to future enjoyment, he can only enjoy the interest or issues of the accumulation (until he has fulfilled the condition of surviving his mother), and this only upon condition of giving security to refund both the corpus and interest of the accumulation during minority to those persons who, by his father’s will, may be ultimately entitled to the same. Suppose the legacy here to the children to be vested as the court below seemed to think it was; then is Frederick McKee, the son, entitled to one-half of the accumulation ? His estate then in the personalty would seem to be this: a present vested interest, with the period of full enjoyment postponed until his mother’s death. If he dies before his mother, then a limitation over to his sister, Melissa, if she then be alive; but if not; then to the brothers and sisters of the testator. If, then, it should be held that the will does in effect contain a bequest to trustees, with directions to accumulate, that the directions to accumulate are void; that both Washington’s Estate, 25 P. F. Smith 102, and Stille’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20W.N.C.%2042" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 W.N.C. 42">4 W. N. C. 42</a>, were correctly ruled, and that the bequest to the children is a vested legacy; that it would seem to be a case where personal property, <em>i. e., </em>the accumulations, as well as the corpus of the estate, has been bequeathed to the children of Frederick McKee, deceased, upon a contingency, <em>i. e., </em>that upon the death of either before their mother, their share goes over: then Fredérick McKee is now entitled to the one-half part of the accumulations; but, as he takes this under the will (Stille’s Appeal, <em>supra), </em>it is just as the corpus would be, subject to a limitation over provided he dies before his mother. This being so, he must, under the provisions of Act of Assembly of May 17th 1871, sec 1 (Purd. Dig., pi. 214, p. 449), give security which will, in the opinion of the court, sufficiently secure the interest of the persons entitled in remainder, whenever the contingency happens on which these in remainder will be entitled to possession. Why he should not so do it is difficult to see. If the present cases in Pennsylvania stand, he takes the accumulations under the will ju-st as much as he would the corpus of the estate. <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>If he dies before his mother, without children, to the whole fund those in remainder are entitled.</p>
    <p id="b282-6" data-blocks='[["BL_282.4",282,[247,481,1162,1016]]]'>And if the court belowis correct in holding that the accumulation is void <em>in toto, </em>nevertheless a grave error has been committed in the form of the distribution. If it be held that the testator did not die intestate, but the accumulations go on under the will, then Frederick must give security under the Act of 1871; but if the testator did die intestate as to accumulations, then also the court erred. The court below supposed that as the testator used the language “in place of her dower or share at law,” and, as the widow accepted under the will, she is thereby debarred from her right as heir-at-law under the intestate law of the state. This is a misapprehension. The widow, by taking the devise under the will, is debarred of her option to take against the will, whatever that right might be. Her husband has, in fact, purchased that right from her, and she, by taking under the will, has released it to him. But obviously a widow cannot release a right to take as heir any more than a child could do. A release to the husband during lifetime would only confer rights to which, if he died intestate, certain persons designated by law, and these only, could lay claim. Mrs. McKee’s non-claimer hero vests nothing in her children, but her rights may pass under her will, or if she die intestate, according to the intestate law. The court below has therefore committed an error, even if right in all other branches of the decision, in the ratio of division, which in this case should be one-third to each of the children and one-third to the widow.</p>

The sufficient answer to this proposition is, that the will does not create a joint estate in the children. Their shares are separate and individual. There are not even cross-remainders created as between them.

    <p id="b284-6" data-blocks='[["BL_284.6",284,[252,484,1162,685]]]'>Frederick McKee died on the 21st of March 1865, leaving to survive him a widow and two children, one of whom is the petitioner. By his will he devised his mansion house to his wife for life, and also bequeathed to her, for a like period, an annuity of $2000. He then made the following direction: “ And upon her decease I will and bequeath said, house, as also all the rest of my worldly estate, to my children in equal shares, and in default of children or lineal heirs of my body, at the time of her decease, I will and bequeath all my worldly estate to my brothers and sisters in equal shares.” In this we have a precedent, estate so limited as to determine on an event which must certainly happen, that is, the death of the Widow, and the remainder so limited to ascertained persons <em>in esse, </em>Frederick and Melissa McKee, that the preceding estate may determine'before the estate limited in remainder. It follows that this is a vested remainder — an estate vested <em>in prcesenti, </em>but enjoyable <em>in futuro ; </em>that is, upon the mother’s death.</p>
    <p id="b284-7" data-blocks='[["BL_284.7",284,[253,1169,1161,256]]]'>The corpus of the estate is thus easily disposed of, for of that the testator determined that it should not go to his children until the death of his widow. But since his death there have been large accumulations arising from rents, issues and profits; accumulations which exceed the original estate, and the necessities of the trust, and the serious question is, what disposition shall be made of them ?</p>
    <p id="b284-8" data-blocks='[["BL_284.8",284,[254,1426,1163,769]]]'>Were we allowed to dispose of the matter, as we may suppose the testator would have disposed of it, had he known the facts as they now exist, we would say, without hesitation, these accumulations shall go to his children, for so he would have directed. But as it is obvious that he did not anticipate an increase so large to his estate after his decease, so it is just as obvious that he entertained no intention concerning it. Hence, of such intention we can predicate nothing. On the other hand, were it not for the eighth section of the Act of 18th April 1853, the question would not be difficult of solution ; for, before that act, accumulations as necessarily and naturally formed part of the original estate as vegetable accretions form part of the growing plant. In such case, as the children must wait for the possession of the corpus of the estate until the time fixed for the expiration of the precedent trust, so must they wait for the accretions which by natural growth form part of the corpus. But the Act of 1853 has altered this, and made such accumulations unlawful and void, unless, with relation to them, its terms and conditions are strictly followed.</p>
    <p id="b284-9" data-blocks='[["BL_284.9",284,[259,2195,1163,213]],["BL_285.1",285,[126,377,1166,892]]]'>If, in the present case, we compare the provisions of the will with the terms of the act, we will find that not only were the latter not complied with, but the testator, as we have already said, not having any such accumulations in view, never intended to comply with them. The extreme period allowed for accumultions by the <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>act is t-wenty-one years, with the additional allowance of the ordinary time for gestation. Here the time is indefinite, it may be much more than twenty-one years, for it depends upon the life of Mrs. McKee. Again, in Washington’s Estate, 25 P. F. Smith 102, it was held that the statute permits accumulations in favor of one class of persons only, who are to be possessed of two qualifications; they must he minors; they must also be such persons who will be entitled to take the rents and profits from which the accumulations arise, when the gift or grant goes into effect, though at that time they have passed their minority. Under the operation of the will before us there is no direction in favor of any person or persons. On the other hand, if accumulation is allowed at all, it must be allowed to swell the general estate until the death of Mrs. McKee, when, as part of the corpus, it must go to whomsoever at that time may be entitled. No ingenuity can reconcile a provision of this kind with the statute and it must' therefore fall. Had we to deal merely with time, the act itself would settle any difficulty arising from that matter, for it avoids only the excess, but where the effect of the provision is solely to swell the bulk of the estate, it is so diametrically opposed to the intent and spirit of the statute that it cannot be sustained.</p>
