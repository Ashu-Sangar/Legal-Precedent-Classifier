Its claims are nearly identical with the grounds of defence set forth in the defendants’ abstracts of title and which they advanced at the trial. When the suit was commenced there was no such artificial person as this association — it was contemplated. Natural persons had possession, were served with process, made defence, and verdict and judgment were rendered against them. Not one disclaimed possession. They were the persons W'ho negotiated with and obtained possession from the plaintiff, and if they did not hand it over to the corporation it is an intruder. Whatever title and possession the association has it got through the agency of the defendants, and it is clear that when the suit was brought, as well as when the possession was delivered and taken, the corporation was not in existence. When the association says it took possession in July, it means, of course, that the defendants took possession, who subsequently, perhaps with others, became incorporated. That it did not come into possession by collusion with defendants, doubtless, is literally true, and the presumption is strong that it took from the defendants with actual knowledge of the pending ejectment.</p>
