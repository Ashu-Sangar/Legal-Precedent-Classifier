The first question for you to look at, then, is whether these words were uttered, and several witnesses have been called to prove that they were. The defendant denies uttering some of the words, and qualifies the uttering of others. If you find that the words were used in their plain ordinary meaning, with nothing to qualify them, your verdict must be for the plaintiff There is a defence set up, however,, which is made the great contest in this case. On the part of DeOamp it is denied that he used the word ‘ thief ’ unqualifiedly, except in one instance, where he had a personal encounter in the cars; thatJie used it there because the plaintiff came up behind him and struck himj that at all other, times it was under certain circumstances, and with certain qualifications, that would render the words used privileged, and therefore not actionable. DeOamp alleges that he was a citizen and large property owner in the borough of Verona; that the plaintiff was burgess of the borough and a member of the town council; that at some time, early in 1875, the council passed an ordinance to build a town hall, and to issue bonds to a large amount to pay for it; that on his own behalf, and at the request of other citizens and property holders, he opposed the building of the town hall and the issue of the bonds ; that an indignation, meeting was called, <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>and as a result of <em>the </em>opposition to it, the council repealed the ordinance ; that a short time, some few months afterwards the ordinance was re-enacted, and two lots were sold to the borough, in an indirect way, by the plaintiff, who was still burgess, and that he eventually got the bonds of the borough in payment for them; that it was done by a covinous, sinuous, tortuous arrangement, to which the plaintiff was a party ; that, acting for some of the citizens of the borough as well as himself, he (the defendant) was endeavoring to defeat the issue of these bonds by legal'means, by speaking in meetings, talking to taxpayers and other citizens interested, -while, in the meantime, the burgess and council were proceeding with their scheme for a town hall, until stopped by an injunction (suggested by DeOamp) obtained on the ground that under the Wallace Act the council had no power to issue bonds. Under such a state of facts, if believed, the question arises had the defendant a right to use the language complained of. Merely to say of aman, because he is in office, that ‘he is a thief,’ is as bad a slander as to say it of a private citizen, and probably worse, because he has ordinarily less chance to defend himself. I apprehend that the law of Pennsylvania is, and so instruct you, that if the burgess and council were going to issue these bonds, the citizens had a right, in every proper manner, to defeat the issue, but whatever they did must have been done in a truthful, or bel'ievingly truthful and fair way; that any words uttered by DeOamp during the time this controversy ivas going on, if uttered in good faith, DeCamp believing them to be true, would be justified, unless express malice, personal malice, personal ill-will, or malice in fact is shown.</p>

If that is so, if at any time before this controversy arose DeOamp, called Rowand a thief, said he would steal a thousand dollar bond, for instance, on the 4th of January 1875 (although the utterance on that date is disputed), the plaintiff would be entitled to recover. DeCamp’s right to speak what he honestly believed to be true existed only under the circumstances alleged here on his behalf. If what he said was said under these circumstances, and so understood by the parties to whom it was addressed, he is protected, unless express malice or malice in fact is shown. The defendant must have acted in good faith in the utterance of.these words; he could not go around and use that language maliciously, and with intent to injure Rowand, with personal ill-will and hate and spite. ,</p>

Also, evidence what DeCamp said to one witness that he had a paper in his safe that would send him (Rowand) to the penitentiary, and to another witness that he would ‘ ruin him.’ This testimony bears on the question of express malice, or malice in fact, and if this is shown the law will not shield the defendant.</p>

He had no right to speak those words except under the circumstances and in the light of the instructions I have given you.</p>

It is your duty to carefully consider the testimony. If you should believe that the defendant used the words ‘he is a thief,” ‘a damned thief,’ as alleged, without any explanatory words showing a meaning other than the common ordinary meaning, they are actionable <em>per se, </em>and the law implies damages. They must have been spoken however within one year from the beginning of this suit, which was December 27th 1875. But if you believe that these words were spoken in good faith concerning the burgess, acting in his official capacity, the defendant believing what he uttered, he is protected unless express malice is shown, malice in fact, ill-will, or that the words were uttered before this trouble commenced, all of which the plaintiff contends has been shown. If you should conclude that the words spoken were justifiable, were spoken of the plaintiff in his official capacity, that there was no personal malice, you should return a verdict simply for the defendant; but if you should find for the plaintiff on any of these points, the last question will be the measure of damages. The measure of damages in an action of slander is first, compensation for the injuries received; then if there are circumstances of aggravation or express malice is shown, you can give punitive damages, such damages as you «nay think proper under all the circumstances. The question of damages in an action of slander is one peculiarly for the jury. You take the case with these instructions and give it a careful consideration, remembering that many of these questions of fact are hotly contested on either-side, particularly the question of the selling of the íots to the borough.”</p>

The third point of defendant, being the third assignment of error, lays down a principle which, if law, would sap the foundation of any society sufficiently human to require public officers or servants. To say that “ the citizen is protected whenever he speaks the truth as he designs to be understood, and as he is understood by his hearers, no matter what may be the form of expression or the language employed,” is simply to say that the private character and reputation of any citizen, no matter how honorable or just he may be, who may serve as officer or public servant, is open continually to the scurrilous attacks of abandoned and dissolute men.</p>

    <p id="b501-10" data-blocks='[["BL_501.10",501,[159,1379,1159,558]]]'>This cause was so fairly submitted that not a phrase of the general charge is alleged to be erroneous; and the plaintiff does not complain of the answers to his points, which embraced everything on which he desired special instructions. Therefore, no just complaint can be made that matter was omitted necessary to enable the jury to understand the case. The defendant’s points, and answers thereto, must be considered with the charge, which explains and qualifies them. Indeed the charge and the points of both parties, which were affirmed, together constitute the instructions to the jury, and one part should not be taken without reference to the others. Had the verdict been for defendant, perhaps some of the assignments of error would be sustained — being in favor of the plaintiff, we cannot say the jury were misled.</p>

When a man exercises the citizen’s right to denounce the action of a public officer, it is unlawful for him to make a false and malicious charge of crime or misdemeanor in office. We think the learned judge of the Common Pleas intended to be so understood; and although he affirmed the defendant’s third, fifth and ninth points, which seem to recognise the right to denounce an officer a3 a thief and his transaction as a theft, yet he told the jury that to say of a man in office that he is a thief is as bad a slander as to <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>say it of a private citizen and probably worse; that if the defendant used the words as alleged without explanatory words, showing other than their ordinary meaning, they are actionable <em>per se, </em>and the law implies damages; and (plaintiff’s fourth point), if the words were privileged, and malice in fact be shown, the verdict should be for the plaintiff. The jury could not have found the words were privileged, for there was express instruction that if spoken of the plaintiff in his official capacity, without malice, to find for the defendant. Hence, if it be true, as urged, that the court should say whether the words were privileged, the omission to do so did the plaintiff no harm. No statute or rule was cited which obligates a citizen when discussing the conduct of public servants in their official capacity, who speaks the truth as he designs to be understood and as he is understood by his hearers, to employ any prescribed form of expression or language. So long as he speaks the truth, in words meaning nothing else, he is not liable in damages, whether his language be chaste or vulgar, refined or scurrilous. The style of speech seems to be governed by the taste of the speaker and not by'the civil law. No error is found in the matter set forth in the second, third and fifth assignments which can avail the plaintiff, he having obtained the verdict.</p>
    <p id="b502-6" data-blocks='[["BL_502.4",502,[241,1327,1175,430]]]'>It is assigned that the affirmance of the defendant’s second point-must have led the jury away from the issue which centered in the words proved by Iioughteling. As a general proposition that point is sound. If it needed remark to explain its application to the case, it is found in the charge where it is said, among other things, that if, before the difficulty, the defendant called the plaintiff a thief, adding that he had stolen a thousand dollar bond, it -was totally unjustifiable, and the verdict must be for the plaintiff. Moreover, the answer to plaintiff’s first point directly and positively affirmed his right to recover if the facts therein stated were true.</p>

Hope in consideration of a promissory note for $1500; and, on the 30th of December thereafter, Hope conveyed the same lots to the borough for $1500 in borough bonds. Hope exchanged the bonds with plaintiff for the promissory note. Before the plaintiff conveyed to Hope he had offered two lots to the borough for $1500, and, by the end of the year, the lots -were vested in the borough, the bonds in the plaintiff, and Hope had neither paid, made nor lost money. According to the testimony of nearly a half-dozen witnesses, in 1875, the lots were worth about $500— one-third the amount of bonds given for them — two or three witnesses said they were worth $1500. The plaintiff called in chief numerous witnesses to prove words spoken by defendant at various times down to the end of the year 1875, who, on cross-examination, said they were uttered after the controversy had arisen respecting the bonds. Property owners had become alarmed about a proposed <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>issue of borough bonds, and requested the defendant to oppose it for them as well as himself: the dispute between him and the plaintiff soon became violent. Notwithstanding the perverted use of the word “theft” where it occurs in defendant’s seventh and eighth points, it certainly applies to the transaction described in said points; and, in view of the evidence, we are not convinced their affirmance was error.</p>
    <p id="b503-6" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[154,691,1163,386]]]'>The ground covered by the plaintiff’s testimony opened the door for the defendant to show there was a controversy about the propriety of issuing the bonds, and the circumstances under which the words were uttered: Chapman <em>v. </em>Calder, 2 Harris 365; Stees <em>v. </em>Kemble, 3 Casey 112; Minesinger v. Kerr, 9 Barr 312. The evidence admitted had no tendency to prove the truth of the words set out in the declaration, and was not received for that purpose. It was to show the circumstances under which the words were spoken, and was clearly admissible.</p>
    <p id="b503-7" data-blocks='[["BL_503.5",503,[153,1078,1163,343]]]'>We have not been unmindful of the point urged in argument, that though the plaintiff obtained a verdict he failed in recovering punitive damages because of erroneous answers to defendant’s points. We áre of opinion the instructions fairly left the question of damages to the jury. Possibly the result was more on account of the personal satisfaction attempted to be taken of the defendant in a public conveyance, before the suit was commenced, than of any supposed error by the court. Jurors usually have common sense.</p>
