At that time he executed and delivered to Eliza Rector (now Eliza Barndollar), a deed for said lot. No consideration passed for said deed, and it remained unrecorded until the 4th of January 1868. It was claimed by defendant that on the 29th of June 1868, Mrs. Rector reconveyed said lot of ground to Berryhill, by deed recorded December 4th 1876. Berry-hill was in possession of the property when he made the deed to Mrs. Barndollar, and never left the possession, but continued there until his death, which occurred in September 1871. At the time of Berryhill’s death, his deed from Mrs. Rector was not recorded. On the 20th of May 1876, Mrs. Barndollar (formerly Rector), with her husband, executed a mortgage on said premises for $1350 in favor of A. L. McGeary, areal estate broker. No money passed on this mortgage until December 29th 1876, when it was sold and <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>assigned to IT. S. McGeary. At this time the deed of Mrs. Rector to Berryhill had been recorded twenty-five days. Of the proceeds of this mortgage, $300 or $400 was given by Mrs. Barndoliar to Mrs. Elizabeth Hibler, wife of the guardian of the Berryhill heirs. Mrs. Barndoliar retained $150. A portion was applied to payment of some small liens against the property, and the costs of negotiating the mortgage. What became of the balance did not appear.</p>

Kirchner. At the sale, notice was given that the title to the premises was not in the mortgagors, but in the Berryhill heirs. At the time the mortgage was negotiated, some of the Berryhill heirs were in actual visible and notorious possession of the premises with their guardian, Samuel Hibler, and so continued until after the sheriff’s sale. Mrs. Barndoliar denied that she ever executed the deed of June 29th 1868. She acknowledged the signatures to the mortgage in evidence, and to her deposition.</p>

Indeed it does not appear that these heirs were, at that time, <em>sui juris ; </em>that they had the power, even if they had the will, to assent to such an encumbrance. What then does it amount to, that she, of her own motion, made a gift to <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>them of part of the money so raised, or paid it in relief of the estate ? She was in this but a volunteer and her mortgagee could claim no benefit from an act or acts of that kind. Had the Berry-hill heirs been of age at the time of the execution of the mortgage— had they been privy thereto, or perhaps had they afterwards, though ignorant of the mortgage at the time of .its execution, received the money knowing whence it came and how it was raised, they might have been estopped from setting up their title as against the mortgagee. But, of all this there is not one particle of evidence; on the other hand, it would seem from parts of the learned judge’s charge, that these heirs, or some of them, were minors — “little children,” and therefore incapable of the performance of an act that would estop them. The fifth, sixth and seventh assignments, so far as they embrace exceptions to th’e submission to the jury of this kind of evidence, are sustained.</p>

This was but an attempt to prove handwriting by comparison with other signatures of the same parties, and was, therefore, not within the rulings of Ballentine <em>v. </em>White, 27 P. F. Smith 20, or Reese <em>v. </em>Reese, 9 Norris 89, but it does fall directly within the case of Aumick <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 1 Norris 211, wherein it is said, by Mr. Justice Paxson, “ evidence by comparison of handwriting is not allowed as independent proof.
