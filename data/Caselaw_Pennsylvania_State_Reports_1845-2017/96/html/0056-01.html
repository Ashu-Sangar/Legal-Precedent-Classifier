Originally, at common law, a technical criminal conspiracy embraced a very narrow class of cases: Lord Coke, in 3d Inst. 143; 4 Blackstone 136; Jacob’s Law Dict., tit. <em>Conspiracy ; </em>King <em>v. </em>Turner, 13 East 228 ; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Gallagher, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Pitts%20L.J.%2063" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Pitts L.J. 63">4 Pitts. L. J. 63</a>. By the 128th section of the Criminal Code, Purd. Dig. 350, the offence of conspiracy is clearly definéd. It embraces elements the common law did not. By it also the common-law punishment was changed. The indictment should have been under this statute. It fails to charge the offence in its terms — omits to charge the acts as <em>dishonestly </em>and <em>maliciously </em>done. The language of the statute should have been pursued and failing in this the indictment is bad and no sentence under the statute can be pronounced, nor can any otherwise for the offence charged: Warner <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Barr 156 ; Chapman <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/whart/5/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Whart. 427" data-case-ids="8878399" data-case-paths="/whart/5/0427-01">5 Whart. 427</a>; State <em>v. </em>Abernathy, Busbee’s Rep. 428.

If the omissions in the indictment to conclude against the statute were considered not merely formal defects, still we submit that it concludes in' proper form and is good in law. Where a statute creates or expressly prohibits an offence, and inflicts a punishment, the indictment must conclude against the form of the statute. But where a statute only inflicts a punishment on that which was an offence before, there is no necessity of mentioning the statute : Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Searle, <a href="/binn/2/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Binn. 332" data-case-ids="1788996" data-case-paths="/binn/2/0332-01">2 Binn. 332</a>; White <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 6 Id. 179; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Russell, 7 S. &amp; R. 489. In the case in hand the crime charged in the indictment is conspiracy. The statute does not create that offence, but simply changes the common-law punishment.</p>

The record having been removed into this court, the defendants have assigned for error, 1st, That the court below erred in overruling the motion in arrest of judgment; and 2d, That the court erred in sentencing the defendants upon the verdict of the jury.</p>

The gist of the offence in conspiracy is the unlawful combination, and the offence is complete the moment such combination is formed.</p>

      <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>We are unable to see any good reason why the defendants should not have been sentenced. We have no question affecting the merits of the case before us. It was said, however, that the indictment was for the common-law offence, while it should have been laid under section 128 of the Code: See Pamph. L. 412. An examination of this section shows that it is confined to conspiracies to cheat and defraud, just as the previous section (127) relates to conspiracies to indict. 'A conspiracy at common law is a much broader offence, and embraces cases where two or more persons combine, confederate and agree together to do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by the use of unlawful means. Section 128 of the Code does not, nor was it intended to interfere with the indictment and punishment of a common-law conspiracy.</p>
    <p id="b59-6" data-blocks='[["BL_59.4",59,[127,950,1172,219]]]'>It is manifest, therefore, that the discrepancies pointed out between the indictment and section 128 are immaterial. The indictment was irot laid under the Code. It does not use its phraseology, nor does it conclude against the form of the statute. The count for conspiracy is laid at commop law.</p>
    <p id="b59-7" data-blocks='[["BL_59.5",59,[128,1167,1170,123]]]'>It is said further that the sentence is erroneous; ■ that while the indictment charges a common-law offence, the learned judge imposed sentence under the statute!</p>
    <p id="b59-8" data-blocks='[["BL_59.6",59,[128,1300,1171,215]]]'>There is no such assignment of error.' The assignments are not to the form of the sentence but to its illegality ; that it was error to sentence the defendants at all. Nevertheless if there were error in this respect we might set aside the sentence and impose the proper one ourselves, or send the record back for that purpose.</p>
    <p id="b59-9" data-blocks='[["BL_59.7",59,[128,1514,1171,693]]]'>For offences under section 128 the law .prescribes- both fine and imprisonment. It is not denied that both may be imposed at common law. But it was contended that at common law it was not compulsory to imprison as well as fine. From this the ingenious argument has been constructed that the court below would not have sentenced the defendants to an imprisonment of one hour unless the learned judge believed he was constrained to do so by the statute; therefore the defendants were sentenced under the statute although convicted at common law. This is assuming that which nowhere appears in the case. The court below gave no reasons for the sentence, and the working of the judicial mind does not come up with the record, nor is it assignable for error. We can only reverse for what the learned judge did, not for what he may have thought. As both fine and imprisonment may be imposed at common law, the sentence was clearly legal whatever may have been the line of judicial reasoning which led to it.</p>
    <p id="b59-10" data-blocks='[["BL_59.8",59,[127,2205,1172,218]],["BL_60.1",60,[281,382,1166,90]]]'>Nor is there any merit in the further criticism that the sentence is erroneous for the reason that it is greater than the statute provides for the completed offence. Hartman <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 6 Barr 60, and Scott <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 6 S. &amp; R. 224, have no application. Had the defendants been convicted under the counts <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>charging the forcible entry and detainer they could have been sentenced to a fine of $500 and imprisonment of one year.</p>
