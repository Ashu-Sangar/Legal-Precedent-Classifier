Simmons and J. P. Penno.ek one piece of land in Harmony township, Venango county, Pa., containing one hundred acres, for the sum of $4000 ; and one other piece of land in Deerfield township, Warren county, containing ninety acres, for the sum of $5000, in all $9000 for the two pieces of land, to be paid $1000 in hand and the balance in thirty days; and, further, to account to first parties for the one-fourth of the excess they might sell said lands for over and above the purchase price. January 14th 1865, endorsed on said article is a receipt for $1000, signed A. &amp; J. Lamb, executors, in the handwriting of Alfred Lamb. Immediately following said receipt is an agreement also signed A. &amp; J. Lamb, and in the handwriting of Alfred Lamb, extending the time for four days. During this four days’ extension, one Wesley Martin, who alleged he was acting for the plaintiffs in this suit as well as for himself, sold the property, or two farms, to Zenus Newell for $21,000. Subsequently to this sale some days Newell received from the Lambs .a deed for the Deerfield tract, and paid on his contract with plaintiff $10,000, as follows, viz. : $4000 to Martin for plaintiffs, and $6000 to the Lambs, whose receipt therefor is endorsed on the original article between the plaintiffs and the Lambs. This receipt is dated February 9th, and is signed A. &amp; J. .Lamb. Both the receipt and signature were in the handwriting of John Lamb. At the time that this $10,000 were paid and a deed taken for the Deerfield tract, the Lambs were not yet ready to make a deed to the Harmony tract, the title to which ivas yet in the Commonwealth. Newell was ready to pay the remaining $10,000 whenever the plaintiffs could make or procure for him a good and sufficient deed to this tract. This was well understood at the time by all the parties in interest, hence the agreement mentioned in the following receipt:</p>

There was. no assignment of the contract to P. Cross-man, nor any evidence that he has a right to sue. The contract was sealed. Martin claimed to have a contract with Alfred Lamb for a division of the money, and alleged that Lamb did not divide as he (Martin) thought he ought to do. There was no evidence of any written contract between the Lambs and Martin, or of any agreement between them, nor that the former knew' of any interest of Martin in the matter, except that they had employed him to go to Harrisburg to take out a patent for the land. Martin was not a party to the suit upon the record in any form. The names of the parties as they stood upon the record at the time of trial, were Robert S. Tyrrill and Franklin Simmons, now for use of P. Cross-man, against Alfred Lamb and John Lamb. The latter was not served with process and did not appear. The declaration was against both, and alleged that the defendants received money which belonged to the plaintiffs, that is, to J. N. Tyrrill, administrator of Robert Tyrrill, F. Simmons and J. P. Pennoek, and these plaintiffs sought to recover from Alfred Lamb,.upon his implied assumption to pay over money he was alleged to have received. To this declaration the defendant, Alfred Lamb, pleaded <em>non assumpsit, non assumpsit infra sex annos, </em>payment, and payment with leave, and .also a special plea, which averred that the plaintiffs had changed their cause of action in this suit more than six years after the same accrued, and that the Statute of Limitations, had barred the same before such change. The court below granted a motion for a non-suit at the conclusion of the plaintiffs’ testimony, and afterwards refused to take it off, which action of the court was assigned for error by plaintiffs who took this writ.</p>

If the action is commenced within six years, it does not matter that its form was changed after the six years had run.

We-could not recover in covenant because there was no condition of the case under which we could charge breach of covenant. Our right to the money we claimed depended not upon any stipulations contained in the articles of agreement, but upon what occurred subsequently, when Newell received the deed for the Harmony tract and paid over the last $10,000. Martin and Alfred Lamb had by settlement ascertained and determined the proportion each was to receive of the last $10,000. In the case at bar our only purpose in changing the form of action was that we might have a “ decision of the case upon its merits.” This we were apprehensive we could not reach in covenant.</p>

If the action was not lawfully changed from covenant to case, the former must have been what the court below tried or ought to have tried. There was no evidence to sustain an action of covenant. All the covenants of the defendants as set forth in the article of agreement had been fully performed. If the form of action was properly changed, was there any evidence to sustain the declaration in assumpsit for money had and received ? There was certainly no express contract, written or oral, by which Alfred Lamb was obligated to pay the plaintiffs upon the record any money.

The Act of 10 th May 1871 gives power to the court, to change the form of action if the same shall be necessary for a proper decision of the cause on its merits. Although the power is thus given, it should be exercised with due regard to the <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>rights of both parties. It should not be allowed so as to deprive the opposite party of any valuable right: Trego et al. <em>v. </em>Lewis, 8 P. F.

When amendments are allowed, a just regard for the rights of all persons interested sometimes requires that the effect of the amendment should be qualified.

    <p id="b468-6" data-blocks='[["BL_468.4",468,[295,1023,1165,946]]]'>The facts in this case show the suit was commenced in covenant, in 1870. After it had been pending for nearly three years, on motion, the court permitted the form of action to be changed from covenant to case. During all .that time the cause of action was for a breach of the defendant’s contract under seal, with the plaintiffs. Under the changed form of action, it became a claim for money had and received by Alfred Lamb for the use of one Martin, and the attempt was to enforce it in this action, for the benefit of Cross-man. If any cause of action existed in favor of the legal plaintiffs, covenant was the proper form. The plaintiffs gave in evidence an article of agreement under seal. ' It was made between Alfred Lamb and John Lamb, as executors of John Lamb of the first part, and the plaintiffs, Tyrrill and Simmons, of the second part. It provided for a sale from the former to the latter of two pieces of land, in consideration of a sum specified to be paid therefor. Before the contract was fulfilled by either party thereto, the vendees therein sold the land to one Newell. He paid to the Lambs the residue of the purchase-money due them, and they made and delivered deeds for the lands, to him. It appears when Newell paid this money, in February. 1865, to Alfred Lamb, Martin claimed and demanded of Lamb, a portion thereof, which was refused. That money is the sum claimed in this suit.</p>
    <p id="b468-7" data-blocks='[["BL_468.5",468,[292,1968,1161,428]]]'>As the only agreement entered into between the legal plaintiffs and the defendants had- been fully performed, no right of action under it existed in them. Neither Martin nor Orossman was a party thereto. ■ It does not, therefore, appear that an action, in any form, could be maintained by the plaintiffs against the defendants. If any action for money had and received arose against the defendants, it did not accrue to the plaintiffs ; but to Martin alone. Ilis cause of action was not their cause of action. He did not derive it from them. Their claim was satisfied on the land being conveyed. They had no claim for money against the defendants.</p>
    <p id="b468-8" data-blocks='[["BL_468.6",468,[336,2395,1115,44]],["BL_469.1",469,[142,403,1169,473]]]'>Under precisely what agreement the claim of Martin rested is <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>not clearly shown. It was under some express or implied contract between him and the defendants. It was, therefore, in his own right, and should have been enforced in his own name as the legal party. His right of action accrued in February 1865. The amendment changing the form of action, was made in September 1873, being more than eight and a half years after the alleged right of action accrued. The effect now claimed for the amendment is a right to substitute a new and different cause of action. This cannot be allowed : Koyse <em>v. </em>May, <em>supra. </em>The case of Smith <em>v. </em>Bellows, 27 P. F. Smith 441, does not remove this difficulty from the pathway of the plaintiffs. There the cause of action was the same.</p>
    <p id="b469-6" data-blocks='[["BL_469.4",469,[142,876,1167,259]]]'>It was too late to commence and maintain a new action based on the alleged agreement with Martin. The right of the defendants to interpose a plea of the Statute of Limitations was to them valuable. This amendment could not deprive them of that right. The form of action having been changed does not prevent us from now declaring its effect: Killed. Ege, <em>supra; </em>Leeds <em>v. </em>Lockwood, <em>supra.</em>
