Solms (if he shall survive her) to him or at the discretion of the said party of the second part, to apply the same for his maintenance and support in such way and manner that the same shall not be liable for his debts or' contracts; and upon his death occurring after her death, or upon her death occurring after his, to assign, convey, transfer or pay over the corpus or principal of the estate so as aforesaid derived in the right of the said Sidney J.
