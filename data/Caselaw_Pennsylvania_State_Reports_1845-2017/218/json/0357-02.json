There is, therefore, no occasion for present discussion of the question here sought to be raised. It is sufficient to say that because of manifest error in the order the appeal must be sustained. Had the original decree confirming the auditor\u2019s report stood, the only proper way of enforcing liability thereunder would have been to require an account by the legal representatives of David Young deceased,\nso that the parties claiming under the decree could obtain such award as they might be entitled to in the distribution of the estate. An order to pay in advance of any statement of account would be in disregard of the equal rights of other possible creditors of equal standing. Appeal sustained, and the order and decree of the court below reversed.",

C. \u2014 Decree.\nAn order upon the personal representatives of a decedent to pay in advance of any statement of account cannot be made by the orphans\u2019 court as such an order would be in disregard of the equal rights of other possible creditors of equal standing.\nWhere a decree of the orphans\u2019 court sustaining the liability of a deceased trustee\u2019s estate for a loss of trust funds, has been reversed, a subsequent decree directing the representatives of the deceased trustee to pay over the award against them to the petitioning claimant, falls as a matter of course with the reversal of the previous decree.\nArgued Jan. 15, 1907.\nReargued April 1, 1907.\nAppeal, No. 14, Jan. T., 1907, by Frank D. Graham and John D. Ford, Executors of and Trustees under the will of David Young, deceased, from decree of O. O. Phila.
