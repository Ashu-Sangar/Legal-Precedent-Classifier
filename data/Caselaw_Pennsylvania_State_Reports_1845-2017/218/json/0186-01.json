But he added, \u201cso long as she remains my widow.\u201d These words, however, do not indicate any intention to cut down the quantum of estate granted, which is never done except in obedience to a clear intent. No such intent is expressed here. On the contrary, the words are equivalent to saying \u201cprovided she remains my widow,\u201d and instead of cutting down the estate, merely attached a condition which made it defeasible in toto on a'breach. The widow not having remarried died seized in fee.\nThe learned court below thought the case governed by Cooper v. Pogue, 92 Pa. 254. But the operative language of the will there was \u201c to my wife, so long as she remains my widow, I give the income of the home farm .... also the Mansion House,\u201d etc. There was no primary gift of the fee as in the present case, but a gift of income and profits, expressly limited to widowhood, and the court held that the devise of the Mansion House, etc., was limited to the same estate. The present case is more analogous to Redding v. Rice, 171 Pa. 301, and is a stronger case for a fee.\nJudgment reversed and judgment directed to be entered for plaintiff.",
