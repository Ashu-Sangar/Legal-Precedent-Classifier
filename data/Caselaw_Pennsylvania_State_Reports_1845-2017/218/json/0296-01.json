J., Fell, Brown, Mestrkzat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nFrom the record it appeared that the decedent died on February 11, 1905, leaving a will whereby he gave his entire estate in equal shares to his sister, Alida Gouverneur Montgome^q and his brother, Alfred Wharton, Jr. The sister died on October 9, 1903, a widow without issue. The deceased left to survive him his brother, Alfred Wharton, and also a nephew, Edward Wharton, Jr., a son of Edward Wharton, Sr., a brother of the deceased. Edward Wharton, Jr., claimed a share in the estate. His legitimacy was denied. It appeared that Edward Wharton, Sr., made a -will on March 21,1872, and therein provided as follows: \u201c Second. I give and bequeath to my friend Mrs. Kate Lawrence the sum of $20,000 for the support of herself and my son Edward Wharton and in case of her death to be held in trust by my executors hereinafter named for the use and maintenance of my said son until he arrives at the age of twenty-one years, the principal to be paid to him at their discretion.\u201d He died June 2, 1873.\nThe auditing judge disallowed the claim for the reasons stated in the portion of the adjudication quoted in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nExceptions to the adjudication were overruled.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nThomas James Meagher, for appellant,\ncited: McCausland\u2019s Est., 213 Pa. 189 ; Thewlis\u2019s Est., 15 Pa.
