Thus where a man standing in a crowded car gives his place to a woman, and takes his stand on the front platform of the car, and is injured while there, he forfeits the advantage of the presumption, which the law raises in favor of one injured while riding in the car, that the accident resulted from the negligence of the company.</p>

The body of the car was already filled with passengers. The plaintiff knew that there was no more room inside of it. Nevertheless, he alighted from the car to make way for the ladies. As might have been expected, one of them took the place he had vacated. There was no other place for her to take inside the car. When the plaintiff stepped on the car again he was obliged to take a position on the platform or step. Here he was standing when the car passed a wagon which struck and injured him. He would not have been hurt if he had remained inside the car.</p>

Whether serious or trivial, the result is the same. The platform is a known place of' danger, and one voluntarily there assumes the risk. Por the exigency which determines him to take the risk rather than delay for another car, the company is not responsible. In this case the plaintiff, with a courtesy altogether commendable, surrendered his place within the car to a lady who, but for his action, would have been excluded. Having once yielded his place in the car, he was put to his choice whether to ride on the platform or take a later car, just as the <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>person he accommodated would have been obliged to do had he not surrendered his advantage to her. The legal consequence of his choice was that he forfeited the advantage of the presumption, which the law raises in favor of one injured while riding in the car, that the accident resulted from the negligence of the company. His riding on the platform would not excuse negligence on the part of the company in exposing him to known and avoidable danger ; but it put upon him the burden of showing that his injuries resulted from negligence of this degree. There was nothing in the evidence to support any such contention. From all that appears, it was an accident which even more than the care required under the circumstances to exculpate the defendant would not have avoided.</p>
