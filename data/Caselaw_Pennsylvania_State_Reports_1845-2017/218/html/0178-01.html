In 1856, after the acquisition of the narrow strip of ground upon which the alley had been located, Mr. DeBorbon enlarged or reconstructed his Mansion House building, extending it across the three feet of ground which had been used for the alley, and inserted the joists of his building in the western wall of the Keim building, using that wall as part of the eastern wall of his hotel building. The use then made of this wall was by inserting the joists of the Mansion House therein, building against it, supporting some of the joists of their building thereon, and building upon the top of the eastern southern portion of the said wall for the purpose of raising the Mansion House four stories in height. Defendants in their answer admit that upon this occasion the said wall was used as part of the Mansion House property to a depth of forty-three feet, five inches south from Penn street. At the time these improvements were made Harriet deB. Keim was the owner of plaintiff’s building. There is no evidence of record nor have any of the parties to this litigation shown any agreement or arrangement or the terms thereof under which Mr. DeBorbon, in 1856, inserted the joists of his enlarged hotel building in the western wall of Mrs. Keim’s building.
