There was no exception taken to the admission of the evidence as to the registration of unnaturalized persons, but the defendants subsequently moved to strike out this evidence and requested the court to charge the jury that they were not to take it into consideration. The court refused to strike out the evidence and declined to charge as requested, which rulings are the foundations of the second, third and seventh specifications of error. These specifications raised but one question : the relevancy of the testimony as to the registration of unnaturalized persons to the issue being tried. The indictment charged a conspiracy to cause the registration, as voters of the district, of persons ivho did not reside in' said district and were not then and there qualified to vote therein. The offense as charged referred only to voters of a particular class, and having thus been limited by the indictment, the burden was upon the commonwealth to establish a conspiracy to cause the unlawful registration of persons who came within the class. Had the evidence been insufficient to justify a finding that there had been a conspiracy to cause an unlawful registration which embraced persons falling within the particular class, the conviction could not be sustained. The commonwealth having proved, however, that the names of a large number of persons who were not residents of the district, and for that reason not voters, had been placed upon the list of voters and that the appellants had been active in causing this to be done, their motives and intentions in so acting became material to the inquiry as to their guilt or innocence of the offense actually charged. "Were they misled by innocent mistakes, or acting in pursuance of a corrupt combination ? For the purpose of throwing light upon their motives and intentions it was competent for the commonwealth to prove all that they did at the time of the offense charged . in the indictment, in dealing with the same subject-matter and which contributed to the same specific purpose.. The evidence in question directly tended to establish that the placing upon the list of voters of the names of persons who did not ' reside in the district was not an innocent mistake, but was but a part of a general scheme, to which the appellants were <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>parties, to cause the registration of a large number of persons who were not voters of the district, and for this reason it was relevant to the issue as to the intentions of the appellants: Commonwealth v.

The offense charged was one which affected all the people of the commonwealth; its purpose and effect, if successful, was to corrupt a public election, and it was indictable at common law, independently of the provisions of the Act of January 30, 1874, P.

The case was tried with the greatest care by the learned trial judge to whose charge no exception was taken. Numerous points for charge were presented on the trial by counsel for appellants, and all were answered by the court. A motion for a new trial was made for which twelve reasons were assigned. The learned trial court below refused this motion in an exhaustive and convincing opinion in which it reviewed the errors alleged to have occurred on the trial, and supported its legal conclusions by the citation of numerous authorities. Appeals were taken to the Superior Court. There, the cases were presented and heard on thirteen assignments of error which were the same as we have here, except an additional assignment which formally complains of the affirmance of the judgment of the trial court by the Superior Court. There, as <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>here, more than one-half of the assignments were not supported by exceptions taken by appellants in the trial court, and under our uniform rulings were properly dismissed by the Superior Court without consideration. The other assignments were considered in an elaborate opinion by Porter, J., in which he discussed at length the questions raised there and here by the assignments and conclusively shows that they are wholly without merit. The judgment of the trial court was unanimously affirmed by the six judges of the Superior Court who heard the case.</p>

    <p id="b45-4" data-blocks='[["BL_45.5",45,[181,1287,1179,1124]]]'>The offense charged is a grave one. As said in the opinion of the Superior Court, it “ was one which affected all the people of the commonwealth ; its purpose and effect, if successful, was to corrupt a public election, and it was indictable at common law independently of the provisions of the Act of January 30, 1874, P. L. 31.” The evidence clearly discloses that the two appellants were the chief conspirators to commit this heinous offense, although the jury would have been fully justified in also convicting McCartney. He was manifestly unfit for the official position he occupied, and, speaking charitably, through age and weakness permitted the appellants, evidently adepts in the business, to use him to further their criminal and corrupt designs. As well said by the learned assistant district attorney in his brief: “Had the assessor been a free agent, and not under the absolute control and- dictation of the appellants, no one will deny that he was guilty of a most flagrant offense against the election laws, and his acquittal by the jury was a gross miscarriagé of justice.” Under the law, the three parties were all principals in the crime charged in the indictment, and the jury exercised their undoubted authority and convicted the appellants, and acquitted McCartney, the assessor.</p>

The learned trial judge said: “ They (the articles) narrate incidents of the trial which had already happened in the presence of, or within the hearing of, the jurors themselves, nor do they make false statements of such incidents.” The Superior Court said on the same subject: “We have carefully considered the publications in question and are of opinion that, as the articles did not refer to any previous misconduct of the defendants, or discredit any material witness, or misstate the evidence, it is by no means clear that they could have affected the verdict.” An examination of the articles in question will show that they contained nothing which would have warranted the court in granting a new trial. They disclosed nothing to the jurors who, iE attentive to the testimony, were not fully cognizant of all the articles contained. If, as urged by appellants’ counsel, the facts contained in the articles were to the disadvantage of their clients, it is sufficient to say they, were fully supported by evidence which the appellants did not, if they could, meet by contradictory testimony.</p>

From the beginning of his duties in making the list of voters, and without the shadow of authority, they took charge of the assessor, and, as it were, led him from house to house, until the list was completed. They absolutely controlled and directed him in every step in making the list of voters. They not only determined what names should go on the voting list, but one of the two wrote nearly, if not all, the names entered on the list. By this means they succeeded in placing on the voter’s list of that election district the names of 169 persons who were disqualified as legal voters. The appellants were with the assessor and dictated his action when he sat at the polling place in September to hear applications for striking off the list the names of persons who were not legal voters. They and the assessor being then notified that these persons were disqualified as voters and requested to strike their names from the <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>list, struck off 109 names, which, with knowledge of the disqualification, they had placed upon it; but the appellants persisted in their criminal conduct by openly and defiantly refusing to permit the assessor to further correct the list by striking from it the other sixty names. A more bold, determined and persistent assault upon the rights of the legal voters of an election precinct than that disclosed by this record is seldom, if ever, brought to the attention of a court of justice. The statutory penalty is wholty inadequate to the offense.</p>
