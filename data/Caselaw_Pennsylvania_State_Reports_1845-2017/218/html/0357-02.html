There is, therefore, no occasion for present discussion of the question here sought to be raised. It is sufficient to say that because of manifest error in the order the appeal must be sustained. Had the original decree confirming the auditor’s report stood, the only proper way of enforcing liability thereunder would have been to require an account by the legal representatives of David Young deceased,</p>
