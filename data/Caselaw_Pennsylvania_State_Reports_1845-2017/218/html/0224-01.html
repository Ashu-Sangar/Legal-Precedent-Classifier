It was admitted at the argument that the case as presented by the offers and testimony was different from that which appeared on the face of the averments of the bill, which is that the defendants were equitably estopped from setting up a title to the tracks in dispute. Contention is made further that while the court would entertain jurisdiction to inquire into the validity of the alleged equitable estoppel, still, as here, the alleged estoppel is invalid and ineffectual as against the defendants, the court should dismiss the bill on the merits. We have given the question of jurisdiction considerable thought, and have concluded that the court has jurisdiction of this bill on a well-defined equitable ground, namely, the violation of a franchise conferred by legislative authority. As the value of a franchise is dependent upon its exclusive use and possession, it may be protected on the ground of the inadequacy of the legal remedy and the probability of thus avoiding a multiplicity of suits. In England it was formerly required that the plaintiff first establish his right at law, but in this country it is well established that to warrant the interposition of equity for the protection of franchises it is not necessary that the owner of a franchise should have first established his right by action at law. The right for whose protection the aid of equity is invoked should, however, be coupled with possession: High on Injunctions, sec. 897, etc.</p>

'Mr. Justice Shiras, in delivering the opinion of the court in Roberts v. Northern Pacific R. R. Co., <a href="/us/158/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="158 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="1220493" data-case-paths="/us/158/0001-01">158 U. S. 1</a>, on page ten, says: “ It is well settled that where a railroad company having the power of. eminent domain has entered into actual possession of land necessary for its corporate purposes, whether with or without the consent of the owner of such lands, a subsequent vendee of the latter takes the land subject to the burthen of the railroad, and the right to payment from the railroad company, if it en<a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>tered by virtue of an agreement to pay, or to damages, if the entry was unauthorized, belongs to the owner at the time the railroad company took possession.” And in support of this statement he cites Schuylkill, etc., Nav. Co. v. Decker, <a href="/watts/2/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="2 Watts 343" data-case-ids="1840053" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0343-01">2 Watts, 343</a> and McFadden v.

This company never set up any claim for damages, nor did its lessees, the Centre Iron Company, or its successor in title, the Yalentine Iron Company, the purchaser at the sale on the mortgage, during a period of ten years of continuous operation of the railroad; and it must be apparent that if they had any claim for damages by reason of the construction of the road, they waived it. Furthermore, the Yalentine Iron Company, the purchaser at the judicial sale under the mortgage, recognized the title of the railroad company to the tracks in dispute and acquiesced in their use and operation of the road while operating the furnace.</p>
