In the syllabus of that case, the expression is that the action must be brought by the person to whom the right is given by the statutes of the <em>“ </em>state where the injuries were inflicted.” For the facts in that case the expression is entirely accurate, for the injuries and the death both occurred in New Jersey. But the more general expression, <em>“ </em>the state where the cause of action arose,” is the better one. The learned judge below appears to have been misled by the assumption that an exception to this principle has been established in Derr v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/158/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="158 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="848240" data-case-paths="/pa/158/0365-01">158 Pa. 365</a>. But no such question arose in thát case, for the decedent, for whose death the action was brought, died in Pennsylvania, and, if an action lay at all, it was in this state and under our statute. In that case the injuries were received in New Jersey and the action was sought to be sustained by showing that the negligence, which was the proximate cause, began in this state and continued till the injuries were actually inflicted. A nonsuit was sustained for the failure of evidence on this point. “ Unless a negligent act or omission in Pennsylvania,” said McCollum, J., “ which was directly responsi<a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>Sr the injury received in New Jersey, is shown by the evi5"fi|ge, there is no question of jurisdiction to be considered. If fhe "evidence is insufficient to warrant an inference of such 'ligence the nonsuit must be sustained.”</p>
