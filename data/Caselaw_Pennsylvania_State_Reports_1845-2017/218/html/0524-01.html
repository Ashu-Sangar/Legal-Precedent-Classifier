The controlling fact in that case was, however, that the conduct of the association and the borrower showed that, nowithstanding the election to apply the payments, they were not so applied by the parties. The payments were credited on the books of the association, and also on the pass book of the debtor, as payments upon account of dues and premiums, and the debtor was credited on his stock with the profit accruing to his shares. The pass book of the debtor in the stockholder’s possession, showed weekly credits and also profits realized on his stock, and his conduct in permitting payments to be so appropriated and credited, and in receiving his dividend, was deemed to be a ratification of the appropriation of his payments made by the association, and notice to him that the association did not recognize his election. It was not intended to be a decision that a right of election did not exist.</p>
