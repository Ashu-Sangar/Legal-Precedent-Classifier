If, however, the circumstances in any case are such that, running a train at a high rate of speed would prevent a person entering a crossing to get over before the train would get at the crossing, then it is the duty of the railroad company to moderate its speed.

Now in this case, you will remember there is some testimony that at the crossing there was a creek nearby, the noise of which may have prevented the hearing of approaching trains, and the alarm given thereby. There is also some testimony that there was a tie yard along the road, between the road and the railroad track. There is also some testimony that there was a bluff along the track in the neighborhood of this crossing or a little beyond, and there <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>is also testimony that there were trees in foliage along the track. . Whether all of these elements would be present to determine at what distance the whistle should sound, and as to what speed the locomotive and the train should approach the crossing, is a matter for you to determine. The question is, what, was the speed of the train upon this day, and after you have determined that, then the question is, taking the alarm given and the place it was given, would it afford sufficient time for a person entering upon the track of the railroad to pass over or to back, if that were feasible, in order to get out of the way of the approaching train.] [8]</p>

It is apparent, gentlemen of the jury, that all these statements are but estimates. We have no testimony in this case which would fix with mathematical precision the exact rate of speed that the train was going at, at the time that these boys were struck, and it is therefore for you, under all the evidence in the case, to determine at what rate of speed this train was going, and I recur to this, and you may apply it to my former instructions as to the rate of speed as bearing upon the question as to whether the alarm was given at the right place and whether it was sufficiently given, under all the surroundings in this case, as described by the witnesses.] [9]</p>

The weight of the testimony as to the whistling may have been with the defendant, but, even if the court below so thought, and we so think, it conflicted with that submitted by the plaintiff, sufficient, if believed, to justify a finding that the whistle had not been blown, and it was, therefore, for the jury alone to pass upon this important disputed question of fact: Cromley v.

The time-table offered in evidence by the plaintiff, showing the distance between Stroudsburg and Water Gap, was published by the company itself, and, therefore, presumably correct. It was offered in evidence to show the distance between these points, as a basis for fixing the speed at which the train was approaching the crossing. The sole objection to it as evidence was that the distance as given in it between the stations was only approximate, that it had not been printed for the purpose of showing the distance with any accurac,y, but only for the general information of travelers. It was admitted with leave to the company to show that it was not correct, and, as the objection to it was properly overruled, the eleventh assignment is dismissed.</p>

Ordinarily a railroad company has the right in the country districts, in the open country, to run its trains at such speed as it believes to be right or thinks proper. That is the general principle of law. If, however, the circumstances in any case are such that, running a train at a high rate of speed would prevent a person entering a crossing to get over before the train would get at the crossing,"then it is the duty of the railroad company to moderate its speed. I state the matter plain in this connection, in order that there will be no quibbling about what the court says, and in order that if the court is wrong, it may be consistently wrong.” This was error, repeated in the court’s refusal to affirm the fifth and seventh points presented by defendant. From that portion of the charge quoted the jury might have found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff simply because the train was running at a high rate of speed, even if the proper warning had been given of its approach. There was nothing in the case to show that the warning, by a whistle, of the approach of a train at the crossing could not be heard; nothing to show that looking and listening would not protect the traveler from danger at that point. Further on the trial judge said what is the subject of the eighth assignment of error : “ Where there is much travel <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>at all hours over a crossing, it is the duty of the company, not to accelerate, but to moderate the speed of its train. This, of course, applies to only exceptional cases. Ordinarily the ordinary country crossing does not admit of any qualification of this rule, but where the circumstances are different, there it is the duty of the company to moderate its speed. Now in this case, you will remember there is some testimony that at the crossing there was a creek nearby, the noise of which may have prevented the hearing of approaching trains, and the alarm given thereby. There is also some.testimony that there was a tie yard along the road, between the road and the railroad track. There is also some testimony that there was a bluff along the track in the neighborhood of this crossing or a little beyond, and there is also testimony that there were trees in foliage along the track. Whether all of these elements would be present to determine at what distance the whistle should sound, and as to what speed the locomotive and the train should approach the crossing, is a matter for yon to determine. The question is, what was the speed of the train upon this day, and after you have determined that, then the question is, taking the alarm given and the . place it was given, would it afford sufficient time for a person entering upon tbe track of the railroad to pass over or to back, if that were feasible, in order to get out of the way of the way of the approaching train ? ”</p>

The instructions complained of may have been intended for that purpose, but they could hardly have been so understood by the jury, for they were told that where there is travel at all hours over a crossing, it is the duty of the company to moderate the speed of its trains. There was nothing to show that a traveler approaching this crossing could not have heard the whistle if it had been sounded. The case was tried on the theory that no whistle had been blown, not as' to where it ought to have been blown, and the speed of the train was not involved. The crossing was in an open country, and in the direction from which the train was coming there was an <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>unobstructed view of 600 feet. Its speed was immaterial, for sight and sound would have availed to protect the deceased from collision with it.</p>
    <p id="b228-4" data-blocks='[["BL_228.4",228,[250,518,1176,902]]]'>It is not the rate of speed that prevents a traveler from passing safely over a railroad crossing in an open country, but the failure to give notice of the approach of the train by those in charge of it, or disregard of such notice by the traveler when given. What we said in 211 Pa. may have been misunderstood by the trial judge. All that was there said, or intended to be said, was that if one about to cross a railroad in the open country stops and listens, and no train is heard, that is, no warning of its approach is given by the engineer, the railroad company cannot, under such circumstances, run its train at such a reckless rate of speed as will run down the unwarned traveler. This simply means that it is not the rate of speed that is the negligence of the company, but the failure to give proper notice of the approach of the train. With proper warning given of such approach in an open country, rate of speed is not a question in determining whether the railroad company was negligent, and this has been settled in our own and other states.</p>

Ritchie, <a href="/pa/102/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="102 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="502654" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0425-01">102 Pa. 425</a>, we said : “ The very purpose of locomotion by steam upon railways is the accomplishment of a high rate of speed in the movement of passengers and freight. It is authorized by law, and a railroad company in propelling its trains at high speed along its tracks in the open country is simpl}r engaged in the lawful exercise of its franchise. If it is evidence of negligence that a train is run at this rate of speed, it must be because running at a less rate is a legal duty, but there is no such duty established either by statute or decision.” One of the complaints of the plaintiff in Childs v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/150/0073-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="150 Pa. 73" data-case-ids="834474" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0073-01">150 Pa. 73</a>, whose husband was killed at a railroad crossing in a rural portion of Philadelphia, was the rate of the speed of the train, the testimony showing it to have been from forty-five to fifty miles an hour. She was allowed to recover because the jury 'found proper warning had not been given of the approach of the train, but as to her contention that its speed was negligence, it was said: “We do not think any question of negligence grows out of the rate of speed upon <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>these facts. The right of a railroad to move its trains at such rate as the necessities of its business, or the requirements of the public may make necessary, is subject only to such restrictions as maj' be found necessary in cities and populous towns. In the crowded centers of business and population the public safety requires the speed to be moderated, but in the open country the single traveler over the wagon road may, under all ordinary circumstances, provide for his safety by compliance with the rule of law and of common sense that requires him to stop, look each way along the track and to listen, for an approaching train, before attempting to cross the track. The movement of trains must be regulated by the railroad companies in the exercise of a business discretion, and upon consideration of the competition they have to encounter and the necessities of modern business. We do not think a jury may fix the maximum rate of speed at which a train shall be moved in the open country, or that a high rate of speed is negligence per se. But while railroad companies may move their trains at such rate of speed as the character of their machinery and roadbed may make practicable, they must not forget that increased speed for the train means increased danger to those who must cross the tracks, and that increased care on their part to guard against accidents becomes a duty.” In Newhard v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/153/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="153 Pa. 417" data-case-ids="840353" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0417-01">153 Pa. 417</a>, the plaintiff was driving a wagon over a grade crossing in an open country, and was injured by collision with one of the company’s trains. The train was running over the crossing at the rate of fifty miles an hour. It was alleged that this was negligence and that the duty of the company was to slow up at the crossing, but we said : <em>“ </em>Wherein did the defendant in an3^ particular fail in duty <em>% </em>It gave the signal of its approach to the crossing by the steam whistle ; this was a duty which the law imposed, and it was performed. But, it is argued, it was negligence in defendant to maintain the speed of fifty miles an hour in its approach to the crossing, for if it had £ slowed up ’ the plaintiff could have cleared the crossing before the train reached it. The weakness of this argument is in the implied duty it imposes on the railroad company of conceding the superior right of the traveler to the crossing; undoubtedly, when both are approaching the crossing at a rate <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>of speed which would put them on it at the same time, unless one or the other £ slows up ’ or stops, disaster to one or the other or both follows. If the train had given the proper warning signal to the traveler of its intention immediately for a very short space of time to occupy the crossing, the further duty of £ slowing up ’ or stopping until the traveler has safely passed is not by law imposed upon it; that duty is on the traveler. In passing over a street in a city, town or village, the circumstances being wholly different from a crossing in the country, ordinary care changes the duty, because these street crossings usually are at short intervals ; the view of the traveler from the cross streets is obstructed by lines of buildings close to the track; while the sound of the whistle and the bell can be heard, it is difficult to determine their locality, or tell whether they come from an approaching or receding train. But the evidence here fails to show this crossing, so far as concerns danger, was in any material particular different from other crossings. The view at some points in the approach to it, as may be said of nearly all of them, is obstructed. Invariable human experience, however, as well as the evidence in the case, proves that the steam whistle of this coming train, in the open country, could be heard from a quarter to a half mile from where it was sounded. . . . The question of speed becomes material only when neither sight nor sound can avail the traveler to guard against danger.”</p>
