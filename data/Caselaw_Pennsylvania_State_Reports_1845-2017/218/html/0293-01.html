Hanstein the Boyal Palace Hotel, and she agreed to pay the sum of $400,000 in four cash payments and the balance of $300,000 by her bond. Six thousand dollars was paid upon the date of the agreement, and on August 5, 1905, Prettyman gave Mrs. Hanstein a receipt for $25,000 on account of the purchase price. The Bacharach Beal Estate Company paid the money to Prettyman, advancing it for the Hansteins, and being reimbursed by checks signed Clara L. Hanstein, by her attorney, Samuel Hanstein, and also by checks of Wolfe, Mrs. Hanstein’s brother. The Boyal Palace Hotel Company was then formed and chartered, and on September 16, 1905, at the request of Mrs. Hanstein, Prettyman conveyed the hotel to the company, to which Mrs. Han-stein also quitclaimed all her title and interest in the property under her agreement of sale with Prettyman.</p>

J., and his occupation in that place was that of a real estate broker. In January, 1904, he learned that the defendants property, the Royal Palace Hotel, in Atlantic City, was in the market for sale, and called upon the defendant at his place of business in this city, and it was verbally agreed between them that, if Callaway should make a sale or exchange of the property at the price of $400,000, the defendant would pay him a commission of $5,000. Callaway did not attempt to sell the property in this city, but during the year 1904 tried to exchange it for property in New York. It was not shown that'he was engaged in the business of buying and selling properties in this city; and his arrangement with the defendant was a special contract for compensation for procuring a purchaser of a specific piece of real estate, the plaintiff coming to this city only for the purpose of securing the employment, and he did not, therefore, require a license: Chadwick v.

In the first place, the rejection of the printed statute did not injure the defendant, inasmuch as upon cross-examination the plaintiff testified that he knew that the law of New Jersey required such agreements to be in writing, and the jury was instructed in the charge that, if they believed that the contract of employment of Callaway to sell was made at Atlantic City, N. J., the verdict should be for the defendant. But under the pleadings the offer of the printed statute of New Jersey was properly rejected, for it was • not admissible under the plea of non assumpsit, but only by way of special matter, after due notice, under the rule of court, No. 30, sec. 8: 9 Ency.
