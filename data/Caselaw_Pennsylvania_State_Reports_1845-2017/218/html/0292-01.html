    <p class="summary" id="b324-12" data-blocks='[["BL_324.18",324,[274,1958,1181,454]],["BL_325.1",325,[177,354,1180,714]]]'>The exceptions to the award to Mr. Murphy are sustained. He presented his claim under the compromise agreement before the former auditor and it was allowed. We held that the auditor was in error in his measure of damage as Mr. Murphy had not proved the value of the houses he was to get under that agreement, and referred the matter back to the auditor to let him prove the amount of his loss, to wit: the value of the houses. He declined to offer any evidence of that value, probably because there was no value to the houses above the <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>incumbrance. The auditor then declined to award him anything and the Supreme Court sustained that finding. It must be borne in mind that it was never decided that he had no claim on the compromise agreement, but on the contrary the reverse was decided. He failed to get an award because he did not prove the amount of his loss. A new fund having arisen, and a new auditor appointed, Mr. Murphy seeks to rescind or declare ineffective the compromise agreement and claim on what he calls a “quantum meruit” for the work he did. This we think he cannot do. He has had his day in court and he cannot now change his claim as he seeks to do. When the new fund was raised he might perhaps still have presented evidence of the value of the houses if such a thing was possible, but that was the limit of his right.</p>
