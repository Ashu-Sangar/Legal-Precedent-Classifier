It was in the morning, shortly after going to work, about half past seven o’clock. On that particular morning, for some reason not explained, the man whose duty it was to attend, and charge, and care for this cupola, and furnish the molten iron, or a part of the molten iron, to the works, did not appear at this place of business. It was a Saturday morning; and it was usual to <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>close the place at 12:45 o’clock on <em>Saturday; </em>and it was necessary to do a certain amount of work before the shop was closed and the hands were discharged for the week. It seems to have been necessary that morning to get a heat in this cupola to produce the molten iron required for manufacture of articles in the shop, and the employment of the hands there. It was then that Mr. Baugher, who was the foreman of the hands in the yard and in the shop, and his assistant, Mr. Reiser, who were both present, called upon the plaintiff, according to his testimony, to take the place of this hand on the cupola, who had not appeared that morning, and to prepare the heat in the cupola. He was at work at the time unloading this car of sand, that we have spoken of, with another man; and this foreman came and requested the plaintiff to take charge of the cupola ; that the man had not appeared, and that he should go up on the cupola platform, and get up the heat. He demurred at the time, according to his testimony, and said it was too late to do anything of that character that day. I infer — but the jury will draw their own inference' — I infer that he meant to say that it was too late to get up a heat sufficient to have a moulding that morning, or before the shop closed, at 12:45. He said it was too late, and demurred about going up to the cupola. He testified that then Mr. Baugher said that he should go and hurry the matter, and get up the heat; and that upon that request, or that command, he went to the cupola. It was about half past seven o’clock in the morning.</p>

As he went to the cupola he found that the large partition did not extend between the cupola and shop below, as I understand, at that time; but it was only above, where the platform was ; that this wooden partition had a hole or window in it between the cupola platform and the shop. He found that the cupola had to be cleaned, and in doing so it was necessary to use water, and he ordered the man who was down below to turn on the hose, when he gave him orders from the platform above. He testifies that when he was ready to have the water turned on, he called to the man below to turn on the water in the hose, and that he got no reply from him ; that he called to him again, and got no reply; that he then <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>leaned out of this window or the hole in the partition that led to the foundry, and called to him. After calling some time the man made answer, but the dust was so great — or the foggy morning with the dust — and the noise was so great, that he did not seem to know where the call was coming from ; and then he leaned out of the window for the purpose of calling him again.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.5",628,[277,1090,1179,1118]]]'>He was then leaning out of the window, with his head and shoulders out of the window; and whether or not he had his hand on the beam at that time, or on the track, he is not certain ; but seeing the danger he was in, and a part of his body out of this hole, and the crane rapidly approaching, he made an effort to draw his body from the danger of being struck by the car, and threw himself back; and, he said, in doing so, his hand got on the track. Whether it was necessary to put his hand there to withdraw his body is one of the questions which the jury will have to consider; whether he did it in the endeavor to withdraw his body from still greater danger, or whether he placed his hand there when he was looking out of the window, and failed to withdraw his hand when he had the time to do so, and in the meantime to escape injury. That is one of the important questions that the jury will have to consider. He did manage to withdraw his body, but his hand remained on the rail,,which was supported by the beams, which I have already mentioned; and he was standing facing the foundry. While in this position his thumb and front finger were caught by the wheel; and he says by wrenching the other fingers aside when he was struck he managed to save the balance of his hand, and keep it from being run over by this wheel.</p>

The law requires the employer of hands to furnish them with reasonably safe tools and materials with which to work, and to furnish an ordinarily safe place for the employee to work in ; [and the law further requires also that the employee shall take upon himself the risk of his employment when properly instructed. In a case like this, where he is urged about the work, where some allowance is made for the employee, his not being as vigilant as he is at other times to take upon himself the risk of his employment — but he must be shown and made to understand the dangers connected with his employment, and to be able to comprehend the danger which he undertakes, and the risk which he takes when he goes into the employment]; [10] and, if understanding the risks and dangers which he is in, if he is guilty of any negligence in the performance of his work which contributes to his injury — the injury which- he may receive in any accident or injury resulting from this employment — -why, then, he cannot recover damages against his employer for any negligence on the part of the employer. In other words, when both parties are proven to be negligent, it is impossible for the jury to divide the responsibility, or for the court to divide the responsibility — that is, the theory of the law — and that if he helps to produce, or causes or inflicts an injury upon him, or causes an accident by which he is injured, that he cannot then call upon the defendant to pay for damages which he helped to bring upon himself. There cannot be a recovery of damages in a case where both parties are negligent, or where any negligence is shown on the part of the plaintiff which contributed to this injury — the burden must be with the plaintiff.</p>

The testimony on the part of the defendant is that the crane made a peculiar noise in starting, which could have been heard a considerable distance; that it made a noise when running, which would not be deadened by the noise of the cinder machine, and that the plaintiff could have heard it; that the sound could be heard outside of the shop, at the office, when that crane was running; and that the rail upon which this crane ran was. five inches above the window — several inches from the window, the track, by measurement — and that other operators there had called the hands easily by just calling out at the cupola; that there was an opening in the boards below by which the call could be heard; and it was not necessary to put himself out of that hole at all in order to call to the hands below to turn on the water; that they heard otherwise the call of the operators.</p>

Under such circumstances an employee would assume the risks of his employment, including all dangers, open and obvious. In the present case, however, the appellee was a laborer, not familiar with the work he was imperatively directed to perform, nor with the situation into which he was hurriedly ordered. He objected when ordered to do this work, but finally yielded when the foreman insisted. He did not act voluntarily, but followed the direction of his superior. After the cupola ivas prepared for washing out it was his duty to call for water, which was turned on by an employee on the floor below. Because of the confusion in the foundry, his calls for water were not heard, and, finding an open window, it was but natural to lean out in order to make the water-man hear him. The use made of the window was therefore a proper one. The moving crane passing within six inches of the open and unguarded window made the situation extremely dangerous to an employee unfamiliar with the conditions. Under these facts the learned trial judge would not have been warranted in holding as a matter of law that there was no negligence on the part of the defendant company. This was a question for the jury where it was left with proper instructions as to the respective duties of the parties.</p>
