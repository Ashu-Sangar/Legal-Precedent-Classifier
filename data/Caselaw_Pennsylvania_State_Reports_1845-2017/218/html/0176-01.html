And that M. A. Kilker, one of the defendants, is solicitor for the school board of said school district. That one Thomas Horan was tax collector for said school district for four successive years and gave his bond in the sum of $30,000 for each year, upon which four bonds judgments were entered. Your orator under article of agreement, of November 1, 1905, and by deed, of April 14, 1906, purchased two certain lots from Michael Horan, one of the several sureties on said bonds. That on April 11, 1906, the said school board by resolution directed the said M. A. Kilker, its solicitor, to proceed against the bondsmen, to compel them each to pay his or her proportionate share. That the said M. A. Kilker contrary to the instructions given to him by said school board proceeded to collect the whole amount due on the several judgments from the property of your orator. That your orator paid the whole amount due on the first judg<a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>ment, to wit: $602.78, which was more than her proportionate share due on all of the said judgments, and asked to be subrogated, whereupon the said M. A. Kilker appeared in court as attorney for eight of the defendants in the judgments. That the said M. A. Kilker, without any authority, has since issued two more writs of venditioni exponas, under which your orator’s property is advertised for sale on February 9, 1907. That your orator is financially unable to pay the whole amount due for debt and costs on said several judgments and in that way protect herself by subrogation from the effects of the said several unauthorized executions. And your orator believes that her said property is being unjustly and exclusively pursued by said M. A. Kilker because he in fact represents certain of the defendants in said judgments and is laboring to shield them from liability. ,J</p>
