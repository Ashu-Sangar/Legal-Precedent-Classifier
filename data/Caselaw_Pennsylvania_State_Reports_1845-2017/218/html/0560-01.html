And the plaintiff’s testimony tends to show that after passing a little below or southerly from Donaldson’s store, he stopped and looked and listened, and the plaintiff has called quite a large number of witnesses who testified to that fact. They have also, more or less of them, testified to what they could see from that point, looking up the track, or westward towards Corry on the track.

I do not remember of any of them putting it more than that. And they mention the number of cars that they could see on the track, looking westward from the point where they saw the deceased stop. Evidence is .given by the plaintiff also to show that that was the usual place where people, traveling the public road, stopped to look and listen. And some evidence is given to show that at no other point, going from that point towards the railroad tracks, could they see the track, looking westward, until after they passed the corner of the depot, and I do not remember of any evidence which showed that they could see up the tracks, and see the tracks, until after they passed the corner of the railroad depot.

I believe there is no evidence which shows that he stopped after the point below Donaldson’s store, but there is evidence to show that he looked up the track before attempting to cross .the track, but not that he stopped his team.</p>

ITis duty is not wholly discharged by stopping and looking and listening at the usual place; he must continue his vigilance until he gets across, the railroad ■ track. And it was his duty to look, and not only his duty to look, but to stop again if necessary. And the authorities say that if he cannot see without it, he must get off and go ahead of his horses, where he can see, and take those precautions.

Sometimes mortuary tables are given as to the average length of time that a man would live (or what would be the average mortality of persons of that age), but this has not been given in this case, and you will have to figure it out for yourselves, if you come to that question, and you must use judgment and care if you reach that question, gentlemen, and figure out in a business-like way what would be his earnings per year for the period which you come to the conclusion might be an average period of a man’s life who had reached that age.

The learned trial judge so understood it; the case was tried on this theory, and the absence of exceptions shows the defendant’s acquiescence. Defendant’s fourth point, the refusal of which is the subject of the first assignment of error, was not directed to this feature of the case; it had reference, not to the charge of negligence contained in the statement, but to the law of the case, and was properly refused. The distinction made in the point between positive and negative testimony was correct enough, and so much of the point was affirmed, but it did not follow as a result that the verdict should be for the defendant.</p>

All that can be said is, that it is the duty of a railroad company in the running of its trains to exercise care according to the circumstances, and when the railroad track crosses a much traveled street or highway, the <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>company is bound to exercise a degree of care commensurate with the danger; to give some sufficient notice of the trains’ approach, and to moderate the speed of the train to such a rate as, under the circumstances, is reasonably consistent with public safety. The law does not designate the mode in which these precautions against injury are to be exercised. This much was said in Lehigh Valley Railroad Co. v. Brandtmaier, <a href="/pa/113/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="113 Pa. 610" data-case-ids="457599" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0610-01">113 Pa. 610</a>, and it has been many times repeated. In the present case while there was agreement between the witnesses that the whistle of the engine ivas sounded at or near the whistling post, more than a half mile west of the crossing, there was very positive disagreement as to whether it was sounded more than once, or whether any signal by bell had been given. One of plaintiff’s witnesses testified that although the engine on this particular occasion was running at unusual speed, yet some of the customary signals were omitted. It could not be said as matter of law that the one whistle which witnesses on both sides agree was given, was an adequate warning; therefore it became a question for the jury to determine from all the evidence in the case whether the defendant had come short of its duty in this regard, and a submission of the question was unavoidable.</p>

An imperative duty rested upon him to stop, look and listen ; and there was evidence going to show that he did this ; but the contention of the defendant was that he did not do it at the places or in the manner that proper regard for his own safety would have suggested. Whether he did all that he was bound to do depended upon the situation ás he found it, and the circumstances in which he was placed; and it became a question for the jury under proper instructions as to the law. The court’s refusal to give binding instructions for defendant is the subject of the second assignment, and this is overruled.</p>

It is only necessary to a'dvert to this feature of the charge with this expression of its insufficiency, to secure fuller instruction at another trial of the case which must be the result of the <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>manifest error which is made the subject of the fourth and last assignment.</p>

If you find it was not rung, that would be an element of negligence on the part of the defendant company. ” However this expression may have been qualified in the answer to points submitted it stands out so conspicuously in the charge, and would necessarily be so misleading if uncorrected, that we cannot be sure that it did not influence the result. Whether the failure to ring the bell, if there was such failure, was negligence, became a question for the jury to determine from all the circumstances in the case ; it was not for the court to declare it as matter of law.</p>
