    <p id="b372-7" data-blocks='[["BL_372.8",372,[270,766,1180,759]]]'>The Act of February 17, 1906, P. L. 36, is an enactment to systematize, regulate and put under control of positive law, party nominations for public office. It is the latest of a series of statutes extending the direct and immediate control of law, over methods and details of the exercise of the elective franchise which previously had been left in the unrestricted discretion and control of individuals or party managers. Under the earlier system ballots were prepared by individuals or party officers in any form they desired, nominations were made by party machinery, usually conventions, under party rules and at irregular dates. Justly or urijustly these steps, which practically controlled nominations and elections, were exposed to the suspicion of manipulation not for convenience of party voters alone, but for undue advantage to individuals and party cliques.</p>
    <p id="b372-8" data-blocks='[["BL_372.9",372,[270,1533,1176,595]]]'>The act of 1906 was passed to put an end to this system. Its first requirement is uniformity throughout the state, and in the first section it is enacted that it shall be known as the uniform primaries act. It provides that there shall be two primary elections in each year, one on the fourth Saturday before the February election, to be known as the winter primary, the other on the first Saturday of June (except in the years of presidential elections) to be known as the spring primai’y. These dates are fixed by the statute, and there is no claim by anyone that there is any discretion in anybody to alter them. Then follow a series of provisions which give rise to the present case.</p>

These provisions do not refer to the exact matters now in controversy, but are referred to as bearing on the general intent and construction of the act.</p>
    <p id="b373-5" data-blocks='[["BL_373.6",373,[155,1343,1182,353]]]'>The exact question is whether the provisions of section 3 as to time are mandatory. We do not understand that any claim is made that any of the requirements themselves are not mandatory, but that if circumstances are such that convenience can be served and the substance of the requirements obeyed, the direction as to time may be treated as directory only.</p>

As already said the things to be done are a series of prescribed steps for a prescribed purpose. The terminus ad quem whereto they all lead is the spring primary whose date is fixed and immovable. The initiatory step of the series is the notice by the secretary of the commonwealth to the county commissioners, and the next is the publication. For these the statute fixes in positive terms the exact time, “ on or before the ninth Saturday preceding the spring primary,” for the notice, and the publication to begin “ within a week ” after receipt of the notice, and to be “ at least once each week for three successive weeks.” The argument is that the substantial requirement is a reasonable time for the electors and others for the purpose indicated, and if that is given, the intent of the statutes is fulfilled. But <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>reasonable time is matter of opinion on which there may be large differences. It is plain as a practical matter that the duties imposed on the county commissioners and others in the preparation, distribution, etc., of ballots are such in a large city like Philadelphia that between the statutory dates there is no time to spare for even a diligent performance, and a delay in any of the steps throws all the subsequent ones back and interferes perhaps seriously with their performance. If the secretary may think seven weeks preceding the primary early enough for notice, and the county commissioners think two weeks after receipt of notice early enough to begin publication, there would be confusion at once, and who is to decide? But the conclusive objection is that this construction would restore in large measure the practical individual and party control of the whole subject which was the obnoxious feature of the previous system the act was intended to take away. What is reasonable time as already said is matter on which opinions may fairly differ, and to settle all questions on that subject the law itself fixes reasonable time and its provisions are mandatory.</p>
    <p id="b374-4" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[284,1390,1177,501]]]'>If there were any doubt of this on the general construction of the act the provision of clause three of section two would effectually settle it. “ No .... candidates for the public offices herein specified (shall) be nominated in any other manner than as set forth in this act.” The principal object of the act was to break up “ snap conventions ” and other devices for unfair ends, under the old system, and one of its principal means of so doing was to enforce uniformity of time as well as methods. Its provisions for that purpose are mandatory.</p>

Prior to the latter date the secretary of the commonwealth notified the county commissioners of Philadelphia of the vacancies in office to be nominated for at the primary, including, inter alia, two judges of the court of common pleas No. 1. This was in accordance with the facts as they were then and up to March 30, and the' commissioners commenced the publication required by the statute, on April 5. On April 16, after the second of the three publications required had been made, the secretary notified the commissioners that an additional vacancy had occurred in common pleas No. 1 by the resignation of Judge Biddle, and under advice of counsel directed them to change their publication of notice, accordingly, and to print at the head of the judicial column of the official ballot the words “ Yote for three.” The commissioners under advice of counsel declined to follow this direction and this application is for a mandamus to compel them to do so.</p>

The provisions of that section as to time being mandatory the third vacancy occurred too late for the nomination to be made under that section and it necessarily, therefore, falls under the alternative provisions of section twelve.</p>
