    <p class="summary" id="b205-6" data-blocks='[["BL_205.13",205,[156,1019,1179,300]]]'>The plaintiff is the owner of a house and a lot of ground, situated on Weidman street, in the city of Lebanon, and alleges that on September 20, 1902, several bullets were fired into her dwelling house by employees of the defendant company, damaging her house, and by reason whereof she was frightened and shocked, thereby causing her to be permanently injured.</p>

In taking said car with said colored men from the station to the works they were followed by a crowd of men and boys, some of whom jumped on the platform of the car, opened the door and called them vile names, to which no reply was made by anyone inside of the car. When the colored men left the car, at the works inside of the inclosure, the persons congregated on the outside commenced to throw stones and other missiles into the inclosure; a number of shots were then fired from the inside and also from the outside. During this time it is alleged and sworn to by the plaintiff, that a bullet was fired through a second-story window of her house at or near where she was standing, facing the defendant’s works and which was afterwards found imbedded in the wall of the house and which produced the said fright and shock. An attempt was also made by the plaintiff to prove <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>that'the men brought there that day were armed by the defendant company or at their dmection, but failed. The evidence produced by the plaintiff shows that those of the men who had revolvers had them without the knowledge of the defendant company and did the shooting that was done against the protest of the persons who had charge of them. That the colored men were not hired to protect the works or the property of the company, but to operate its works and that the discharge of firearms was not in the course of their employment.</p>
