Counsel for the respondents take the position that the sale having been finally consummated, deed executed, acknowledged and delivered, that it is too late for the ward to disaffirm the sale. With this contention we cannot agree. In our opinion she has the right at any time before arriving at the age of twenty-one years and <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>within, a reasonable time thereafter to disaffirm and avoid the sale.

E. Haffey under a previous arrangement so to do, and no information of this intent was given to the court. True it is that the answers of the respondents deny any fraud in the transaction or any inadequacy of price, and it may be that the price paid was all the interest of the minor was reasonably worth. Be that as it may, the fact that the guardian without leave of court made the sale with the understanding that he was to have an interest in the property re-conveyed to him puts him in the same position as a guardian purchasing at his own sale, and amounts to a fraud in law and gives the ward the right to avoid the sale at her election. As we understand the law, where a trustee purchases at his own sale the interest of his cestui que trust the sale is avoidable at the election of the cestui que trust without proof of actual fraud. The rule that a party will not be elected to purchase- and hold property for his own use and benefit to which he stands in a fiduciary relation, if contested by the cestui que trust is inflexible, and without regard to the consideration paid or the honesty of the intent: Chorpenning’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/32/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="32 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="986767" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0315-01">32 Pa. 315</a>; Beeson v.

That the intent was honest and a full consideration was paid does not prevent the application of the rule that a person assuming a fiduciary relation towards another in regard to property is disabled from using his power for his private benefit and that he cannot directly or indirectly become a purchaser at his own sale. It is a rule founded on public policy to prevent a conflict between interest and duty. It is said in the notes to Fox v. Mackreath, 1 Lead: Cases in Equity, 239: “ It matters not that there was no fraud contemplated and no injury done. The rule is not intended to be remedial of actual wrong but preventive of the possibility of it; it is one of those processes, derived from the system of trusts, by which a court of chancery turns parties away from wrong, and from the power of doing wrong by making their act instantly enure in equity to the rightful purpose. The cases are uniform in declaring that it matters not how innocent and bona fide, and free from the suggestion of fault, the transaction may be.”</p>
