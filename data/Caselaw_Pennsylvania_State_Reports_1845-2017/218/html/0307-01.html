The coal from the leased premises was prepared for market through breakers upon adjoining properties. The breaker burned, the Babylon breaker, was upon an adjoining property, and was one of the breakers through which the coal was prepared for market. The Babylon breaker was never rebuilt. Coal was never actually prevented from being mined and prepared from the property as a consequence of the burning of the Babylon breaker. Coal was actually mined and shipped after burning of the Babylon breaker the same as it had been prior to the burning of the said breaker, through the Phoenix and Seneca breakers. This is clear from the testimony.</p>
