The rule is undisputed, but it was not violated in this case. Briefly expressed, the difference between the two statements is that the first avers there was no stop of the car at all while the second avers an insufficient stop. Both relate to the same injury, at the same time, the same place and the same circumstances, except for the difference in regard to the stop. But on the question of negligence there is no legal difference between no stop and no sufficient stop, the inference is the same in both cases. A difference might arise on the question of contributory negligence of the plaintiff, but both statements expressly negatived that by the averment of due care. As a material fact it was as necessary for plaintiff to show a case clear of her own negligence under one statement as under the other, and as a defense it was equally open to evidence from defendant under both.

And also that the assignment of error in this regard refers not to earnings, but to earning power. Neither of these matters, however, is material in the present case.</p>
    <p id="b65-4" data-blocks='[["BL_65.5",65,[156,790,1179,350]]]'>The Act of February 22, 1718, 1 Sm. L. 99, empowered the wives of mariners who had gone to sea, leaving their wives at shopkeeping or to work for their livelihood, to sue without naming the husband. And the Act of May 4, 1855, P. L. 430, provides that wives whose husbands have deserted them “ shall have all the rights and privileges secured to a feme sole trader, under the Act of the 22d of February, 1718.”</p>
    <p id="b65-5" data-blocks='[["BL_65.6",65,[156,1149,1179,340]]]'>The Act of June 11, 1879, P..L. 126, provides that, “In all cases where a wife has been deserted, abandoned or driven from her home by her husband, it shall be lawful for her to bring suit in any of the courts of this Commonwealth, against her husband or any other person or persons, without the assistance or intervention of a trustee or next friend, .... in same manner and with like effect as if she were sole and unmarried.”</p>
    <p id="b65-6" data-blocks='[["BL_65.7",65,[157,1507,1179,455]]]'>The Act of June 3, 1887, P. L. 332, provided that property owned, acquired or earned by a married woman shall belong to her and not to her husband. Under this act it was held that wages of her labor were included: Lewis’s Est., <a href="/pa/156/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="156 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="844936" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0337-01">156 Pa.' 337</a>. And under the Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 344, which supplied the act of 1887, it was held that though the word “ earnings ” does not appear in the later act, personal services are a species of property, and earnings acquired by them are equally within the act: Nuding et al. v. Urich, <a href="/pa/169/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="169 Pa. 289" data-case-ids="870719" data-case-paths="/pa/169/0289-01">169 Pa. 289</a>.</p>
    <p id="b65-7" data-blocks='[["BL_65.8",65,[160,1968,1176,300]]]'>Under these statutes and decisions it is clear that a deserted wife may sue separately in her own name for compensation for her services and earnings, and if she may thus recover for what she has acquired as her property in the past she may certainly recover for the loss of capacity to acquire other property of the same kind in the future.</p>
    <p id="b65-8" data-blocks='[["BL_65.9",65,[205,2274,368,45]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
