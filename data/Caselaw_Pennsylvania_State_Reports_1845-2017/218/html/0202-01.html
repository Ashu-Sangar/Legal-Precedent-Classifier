The machine was of simple construction, consisting of two metal rolls revolving toward each other in' open view, the motion being-imparted by belt, pulley and cog gearing- operated from a line shaft, a loose pulley being also provided to stop the machine by a shifting belt moved from operating pulley to the loose pulley.</p>

At the time of the injuries complained of the foot treadle was fastened to the floor, and the belt was made to shift on to the loose pulley by the use of a stick or a piece of leather or other substance held in the hand of the operator, or by his hand alone being placed against the belt, and in that way the machine put out of gear and the motion of the rollers stopped.</p>

The plaintiff proceeded to clean the rolls from the front by the use of waste without stopping the motion of the machine. The waste caught in the rolls was pulled in between them and with it the right hand of the plaintiff, whereby his hand was crushed and injured.
