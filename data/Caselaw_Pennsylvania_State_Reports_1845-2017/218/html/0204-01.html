They must be presumed to know that the claim, whether great or small, is the subject of review by another tribunal; and they ought not, except in an extreme case, undertake to be the final judges. Their duty is to lay out the road so as to do the least damage to the owner, and assess damages accordingly, and if they are wrong in their estimate, an appeal is the method of correcting their error. The county commissioners have not objected to the confirmation of the report so far as it lays out the road. If their present contention is correct, then every road case would result in a trial on the merits before the jury of view uncontrolled by any tribunal to control its regularity. We should avoid such a result.</p>
