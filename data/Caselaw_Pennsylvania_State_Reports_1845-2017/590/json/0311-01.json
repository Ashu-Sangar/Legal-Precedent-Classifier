        "text": "OPINION\nJustice BAER.\nWe granted allowance of appeal in this case to consider whether Appellant Roy C. Pinto, while on a leave of absence from his position as a Corrections Officer l(CO) to serve a term as Vice President of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association (Association), to which he was elected by the membership, was subject to the political activity prohibition of the Civil Service Act, 71 P.S. \u00a7 741.905b (hereinafter CSA \u00a7 905b), and, if so, whether his transmission in his official capacity of a letter informing then-gubernatorial candidate Edward Rendell of the Association\u2019s endorsement of his candidacy and the posting of that letter to the Association website violated the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition. The Commonwealth Court, in a divided en banc opinion, effectively took for granted that Appellant\u2019s status under the arrangement at issue counted as a \u201cpaid\u201d leave of absence, notwithstanding that during the period in question he was wholly occupied as an officer of the Association, which ultimately paid every penny of Appellant\u2019s compensation in a \u201cpass-through\u201d arrangement detailed infra. Without material discussion, the court proceeded from this determination to the conclusion that, as a member of the classified service on \u201cpaid\u201d leave, Appellant necessarily was bound by the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth Court found that neither transmission of the letter nor posting it to the Association\u2019s website violated CSA \u00a7 905b. See Pinto v. Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, 860 A.2d 593 (Pa.Cmwlth. 2004) (en banc).\nWe find that the question whether Appellant\u2019s leave was \u201cpaid\u201d or \u201cunpaid\u201d does not provide an adequate basis to discern whether the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition should apply under the circumstances at bar. Instead, we have determined that the answer lies in other indicia of legislative intent \u2014 in particular, the interplay of the CSA and the State Employee Retirement Code, 71 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5302(b)(2) (hereinafter SERC \u00a7 5302). We hold that the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition did not apply to Appellant while he was on leave to serve as a Vice President for the Association. Our ruling on this question renders it unnecessary for us to consider the corollary question whether transmission or posting to the Association website of the letter informing Governor Rendell of the Association\u2019s endorsement violated the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition. Thus, although we affirm the result reached by the Commonwealth Court, we do so on a different basis.\nWe begin with a recitation of the factual background of the case. Appellant, a CO, was elected Vice President of the Association\u2019s Eastern Region and took a leave of absence to work full-time in that capacity beginning on June 1, 2001. Pursuant to the applicable collective bargaining agreement, DOC granted certain specified officers of the Association, including Appellant, \u201cleave without pay for the maximum term of office [in the Association], not to exceed three years.\u201d Pinto, 860 A.2d at 595 (quoting Collective Bargaining Agreement). From June 1 to November 19, 2001, the Association directly compensated Appellant.\nOn October 15, 2001, however, the Association asked DOC to change the status of Appellant and four other Association officers to \u201cpaid\u201d leave of absence as provided by SERC \u00a7 5302. The Association also requested that the five officials receive retirement seniority retroactive to the start dates of their respective periods of leave. The Department agreed to both requests. Under their modified status and pursuant to SERC \u00a7 5302, DOC paid Appellant the salary and benefits to which he was entitled as a CO, and the Association made up the difference in Appellant\u2019s compensation. DOC, in turn, submitted to the Association a quarterly bill reflecting all expenses incurred on Appellant\u2019s behalf, and the Association reimbursed DOC in full. Accordingly, Appellant effectively \u201cwas carried as a DOC employee for retirement seniority purposes,\u201d Pinto, 860 A.2d at 595, but as a practical matter the Association was bound to pay all costs DOC incurred on Appellant\u2019s behalf.\nEarly in 2002, Fred McKillop, an Association lobbyist, sought an advisory opinion from the Chief Counsel of the Commission regarding whether a CO on \u201cpaid\u201d leave to serve as an Association officer is permitted under Commission regulations to form a political action committee. The Chief Counsel responded that a CO on paid leave to serve as an Association officer generally is not exempt from the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition because the exceptions provided by Commission Rule 103.11(b) do not apply to COs on paid leave. The Chief Counsel noted, however, that \u201cclassified service employees who are on a regular leave of absence, or leave of absence to take a non-eivil service position, are exempt from the political activity restrictions.\u201d Pinto, 860 A.2d at 595. Thus, in effect, the Chief Counsel determined that the leaves of absence subject to the Commission Rule 103.11 exception are mutually exclusive of any \u201cpaid\u201d leave of absence. Notably, the Chief Counsel did not elaborate, however, on how Appellant\u2019s status differed from a \u201cleave of absence to take a non[-]civil service position.\u201d\nLater that year, the Association membership voted to endorse the candidacy of now-Governor Edward Rendell. . Appellant, in his official capacity, signed and transmitted to Governor Rendell a letter dated October 7, 2002, conveying the Association\u2019s endorsement. On October 8, the letter was posted on the Association website.\nOn May 1, 2003, the Commission convened an investigatory hearing pursuant to CSA \u00a7 951(d) (allowing the Commission, sua sponte, to \u201cinvestigate any personnel action taken pursuant to this act and, in its discretion, hold public hearings, record its findings and conclusions, and make such orders as it deems appropriate\u201d), 71 P.S. \u00a7 741.951(d), to consider the propriety under the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition of Appellant\u2019s transmission to Governor Rendell and posting to the Association website of the letter signaling the membership\u2019s endorsement of Governor Rendell\u2019s candidacy. The Commission determined that only employees on unpaid leave are exempt from the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition, and ruled that Appellant, by electing \u201cpaid\u201d leave status to protect his retirement seniority under SERC \u00a7 5302, remained subject to the prohibition. Thus, the Commission found Appellant subject to disciplinary action pursuant to CSA \u00a7 905b(f) and suspended him without pay for five days.\nAppellant appealed the Commission\u2019s determination to the Commonwealth Court, which agreed with the Commission that the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition applied to Appellant and others on \u201cpaid\u201d leave while serving as officers of the Association. The court ruled that\nconsidering Pinto\u2019s receipt of retirement credits while on leave from his State job as a corrections officer, he is essentially on a paid leave of absence, since pursuant to [SERC \u00a7 5302(b)(2) ], an individual in [Appellant\u2019s] position could only receive retirement credits if he is a state employee on paid leave.\nPinto, 860 A.2d at 596-97 (emphasis added). Having found that the prohibition applied, however, the court failed to find evidence of record to support the Commission\u2019s finding that transmission of the letter in question to Governor Rendell coupled to the posting of that letter to the Association website constituted prohibited political activity under CSA \u00a7 905b. Instead, the court determined that the letter was sent \u201csolely for informational purposes and not as part of any official campaigning activities,\u201d id. at 597, and emphasized that Appellant appeared to have had no knowledge that the letter had been made public -via the Association website. Thus, the court reversed the Commission\u2019s order suspending Appellant without pay.\nBoth parties accede in full to the Commonwealth Court\u2019s emphasis on the distinction between paid and unpaid leaves of absence, and argue as though the distinction has dispositive effect on this case. The characterization of the Appellant\u2019s leave, the parties appear to agree, controls whether Commission Rule 108.11(b) applies to Appellant in this case. As noted, Commission Rule 103.11(b) excepts from the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition \u201cthe classified service employe ... who is on a regular leave of absence, or leave of absence to take a non[-]civil service position,\u201d but explicitly does not except \u201c[a]n employe on another type of leave of absence.\u201d 4 Pa.Code \u00a7 103.11(b). There appears to be no dispute that \u201cregular leave of absence,\u201d as used in Rule 103.11(b), shares a definition with \u201cleave of absence\u201d pursuant to Commission Rule 91.3, which defines \u201cleave of absence\u201d as \u201c[a] temporary interruption of employment for which the employe is given a specified period of leave without pay for purposes such as illness, school attendance, cyclical employment, military duty or training or employment in a non[-]civil service position.\u201d 4 Pa.Code \u00a7 91.3 (emphasis added).\nAppellant disputes the Commonwealth Court\u2019s reliance on the first sentence of SERC \u00a7 5302 for the proposition that Appellant\u2019s leave necessarily was \u201cpaid\u201d for purposes of Commission Rule 103.11(b). See 71 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5302(b)(2) (protecting the retirement credit of \u201c[a]n active member on paid leave \u201d to serve as an elected officer of an employee organization (emphasis added)). Appellant argues that SERC \u00a7 5302, read in its entirety, does not in fact identify him as \u201cpaid\u201d for purposes of the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition and the Commission Rules. Appellant notes that his leave was effectively \u201cunpaid\u201d under Commission Rule 103.11(b) because, ultimately, the Association reimbursed DOC for all costs of his employment for the duration of his leave of absence to work full-time as an Association officer. Because he was \u201cunpaid,\u201d he qualified for the first exception articulated in Commission Rule 103.11(b), as a party on a \u201cregular leave of absence.\u201d\nThe Commission, conversely, argues that SERC \u00a7 5302 dictates that Appellant\u2019s status was \u201cpaid\u201d for the relevant purposes. It maintains that, by its terms, SERC \u00a7 5302 demands that a party seeking its benefit adopt \u201cpaid\u201d status. Further, the Commission emphasizes that Appellant affirmatively sought to have his status changed from \u201cunpaid\u201d to \u201cpaid\u201d in order to claim the retirement credit made available by SERC \u00a7 5302 and cannot now be heard to complain about the consequences of that choice. The Commission agrees with Appellant that the \u201cregular leave of absence\u201d exempted by Commission Rule 103.11(b) from the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition is \u201cunpaid,\u201d per Commission Rule 91.3, but disagrees with Appellant that the \u201cpass-through\u201d compensation arrangement changed the status of Appellant\u2019s leave of absence to \u201cunpaid.\u201d Rather, the Commission maintains that retirement seniority is tantamount to compensation, and Appellant\u2019s leave therefore was \u201cpaid\u201d both as a practical matter and as a matter of law. The Commission contends that Appellant\u2019s leave therefore qualified as \u201canother type of leave of absence\u201d under Commission Rule 103.11(b), and that he therefore was not entitled to the benefit of the exception to the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition afforded members of the classified service on regular leaves of absence and leaves of absence to take non-civil service employment. Thus, the Commission maintains that the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition applied and the Commonwealth Court did not err in so ruling.\nOur standard of review of Commission disciplinary decisions requires us to determine whether the Commission has violated a party\u2019s constitutional rights, erred as a matter of law, or relied on findings of fact unsupported by substantial evidence of record. See Pennsylvania Game Comm\u2019n v. State Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, 561 Pa. 19, 747 A.2d 887, 890-91 (2000). Appellant\u2019s principal challenge contests the propriety of the Commission\u2019s application of the law. As with all questions of law, our standard of review is de novo and the scope of our review is plenary. Craley v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 586 Pa. 484, 895 A.2d 530, 539 n. 14 (2006).\nIn interpreting statutes, our object is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. Id. at 539 (citing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a)). We construe every statute, where possible, to give effect to all of its provisions. Id. When the words of a statute are not clear, we may glean the intent of the legislature by consulting, inter alia, the occasion and necessity for the statute; the mischief to be remedied; the object to be attained; and the consequences of a particular interpretation. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c); see Commonwealth, Higher Ed. Assistance Agcy. v. Abington Mem. Hosp., 478 Pa. 514, 387 A.2d 440, 444 (1978) (Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court). We also presume that the legislature does not intend an absurd or unreasonable result, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1), and that it intends the entire statute to be effective and certain. Id. \u00a7 1922(2). Except for enumerated categories of statutes not implicated in this case, we must liberally construe statutes to effectuate their objects and promote justice. Id. \u00a7 1928(c). Another rule of construction evidently overlooked by the court below has particular bearing on this case. Section 1932, \u201cStatutes in pari materia,\u201d provides:\n(a) Statutes or parts of statutes are in pari materia when they relate to the same persons or things or to the same class of persons or things.\n(b) Statutes in pari materia shall be construed together, if possible, as one statute.\nId. \u00a7 1932; see Royal Indem. Co. v. Adams, 309 Pa.Super. 233, 455 A.2d 135, 141 (1983).\nThe difficulty we find in the parties\u2019 respective approaches to this issue is their unremitting focus on the paid-unpaid distinction, and their mutual and conspicuous failure to consider in any detail the second category of excepted parties under Commission Rule 103.11(b). Rule 103.11(b) explicitly exempts from the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition a party \u201con a leave of absence to take a non[-]civil service position,\u201d a category that, by its terms, appears far more applicable to the circumstances of the instant case than the competing provisions \u2014 \u201cregular leave of absence\u201d and \u201canother type of leave of absence\u201d \u2014 that the parties spend their energy discussing. Although generally we defer to an administering agency\u2019s interpretations of its own regulations, see Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare v. Forbes Health Sys., 492 Pa. 77, 422 A.2d 480, 482 (1980), here we would not so much be deferring to an interpretation as we would be deferring to the Commission\u2019s failure to interpret the relevant administrative language. Beginning with the Commission\u2019s Chief Counsel\u2019s advisory opinion, and at every stage of litigation since, the Commission simply has failed to explain why Appellant does not fit the exception provided for leaves of absence to take a non-civil service position.\nWe begin, however, with the relevant statutory law and what it reveals about the intent of the legislature. The only provision we face in this case that speaks directly to the instant pass-through arrangement is found neither in the CSA nor in its regulations, but in SERC \u00a7 5302, which provides for the continued accrual of retirement credit for \u201c[a]n active member on paid leave granted by an employer for purposes of serving as an elected full-time officer for a Statewide employee organization which is a collective bargaining representative under the ... Public Employe Relations Act\u201d provided, inter alia, \u201cthat the Statewide employee organization shall fully reimburse the employer for all expenses and costs of such paid leave.\u201d 71 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5302(b)(2). Thus, SERC \u00a7 5302 provides compelling evidence that the legislature intended to prevent adverse consequences from befalling individuals who opt to take a leave of absence to serve a term as an elected officer of a statewide employee organization by preserving the status quo for the duration of that term. Moreover, the plain language of SERC \u00a7 5302, in anticipating leave, full-time employment, and an outside source of compensation, reflects the legislature\u2019s understanding that the specified situation involves a temporary leave of absence from a civil service position \u201cto take a non-civil service position,\u201d which is excluded from the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition by Commission Rule 103.11.\nThis does not end our inquiry, however, because SERC does not speak directly to the application of the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition to parties who seek the benefit of the SERC provision. Because the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition and SERC \u00a7 5302 both appear under Title 71, \u201cState Government,\u201d and this case presents a circumstance at the nexus of the two statutes, we read them in pari materia as statutes affecting the same class of individuals (members of, or members on leave from, the classified service) as to the same subject matter (the mechanisms and consequences of leave to serve as an elected officer of a statewide employee organization). Cf. Shafer v. State Employes\u2019 Retirement Bd., 548 Pa. 320, 696 A.2d 1186, 1191 (1997).\nPennsylvania courts consistently have held that the Commission has a legitimate interest in regulating the conduct of its members to ensure the integrity of the classified service. See Duffy, 86 A. at 1078; Replogle v. State Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, 657 A.2d 60, 62 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995) (\u201cThe [Civil Service] Act\u2019s prohibitions on political activity ... reflect the state\u2019s interest in shielding its civil servants from potential insidious pressures.\u201d); Commonwealth v. Stauffer, 309 Pa.Super. 176, 454 A.2d 1140, 1144 (1982) (\u201c[T]he government may place restrictions on the political activities of its employees in order to maintain their integrity and impartiality and thereby promote efficiency in the civil service.\u201d); Wasniewski v. State Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, 7 Pa.Cmwlth. 166, 299 A.2d 676, 680 (1973) (\u201c[T]he holding of a public office depends on the favor of the people or the appointing power, which favor may be coupled with reasonable conditions for the public good.\u201d). None of these cases, however, involved the situation before us, in which a member of the classified service takes a leave of absence to assume a full-time position as an elected officer of an employee organization in an arrangement effectively blessed by the legislature in its protection of continuing retirement security and bargained for by the employer as evidenced in the corollary provision contained in the relevant Collective Bargaining Agreement. Indeed, none of the above cases involved the imposition of discipline on a civil service member on a leave of absence, whether paid or unpaid, for any purpose.\nWith these competing considerations in mind, to rule in favor of the Commission we must conclude that the legislature intended that one may serve temporarily as an officer of an employee organization while accruing credited service time for his pension, per SERC \u00a7 5302, and that the Association is free to take public positions on partisan political matters as conceded by the Commission, but that no officer of the Association who is on leave pursuant to the dispensation specifically carved out for that purpose by SERC \u00a7 5302, no matter how high in rank, may involve himself in the Association\u2019s political activity. In support of this tortuous inference, the Commission offers only a strained reading of its administrative language \u2014 Commission Rules 91.3, defining \u201cleave of absence\u201d exclusively as an unpaid leave, and 103.11(b), excluding from the political activity prohibition, a party who is on a \u201cregular leave of absence\u201d or a \u201cleave of absence to take a non[-]civil service position,\u201d which the Commission by and large ignores rather than distinguishing it from the facts at bar.\nThe problems with this approach are both textual and practical. Textually, Commission Rule 103.11(b) specifically excepts from the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition a member \u201cwho is on a regular leave of absence, or leave of absence to take a non[-]civil service position.\u201d 4 Pa.Code \u00a7 103.11(b). The Commission does not, and indeed cannot, maintain that the full-time employment Appellant took with the Association is other than a \u201cnon[-]civil service position.\u201d The Commission\u2019s failure to provide a basis for us to rule that this exception, which on its face appears to describe the instant situation, does not apply, or to provide any persuasive argument that we should instead construe Appellant\u2019s leave as \u201canother type of leave of absence\u201d and thus excluded from the Rule 103.11(b) exception, is nearly fatal to its argument.\nThe practical problems with the Commission\u2019s position are no less considerable. At the heart of the Commission\u2019s argument lies a highly problematic proposition: that Appellant qualified for the \u00a7 103.11(b) exception for parties on a \u201cregular leave of absence,\u201d but upon opting to enjoy the benefits of SERC \u00a7 5302 thereby so transformed his situation as to disqualify him from the exception. Indeed, the only functional difference between these statuses, by the Commission\u2019s own account, was who signed Appellant\u2019s checks, as it is undisputed that the Association ultimately paid all of Appellant\u2019s employment costs. Moreover, the Commission does not explain how the status change under the circumstances sub judice modified Appellant\u2019s conduct or otherwise threatened or reflected poorly on the integrity of the classified service. Absent such an explanation, the Commission\u2019s position is substantially a call for rote application of its interpretation of its own administrative rules to effectuate divergent results in materially indistinguishable circumstances. We will not answer that call.\nOn balance, we find it difficult to imagine that the legislature intended to free a member of the classified service to take a temporary leave to serve as an elected officer of an employee organization but did not intend him to be free to serve as a spokesman for that organization unfettered by the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition. Section 5302 of SERC bespeaks the legislature\u2019s intention that members of the civil service be free to pursue terms of employment as elected officers of labor unions without sacrificing tenure for purposes of retirement benefits, which above all suggests an intention not to discourage members from pursuing such employment. To permit someone to take such a position but impose a limitation on his speech broad enough to compel him to look over his shoulder and second-guess virtually every public act or statement he makes in that capacity would be absurd and would disserve the manifest intent of the legislature.\nAccordingly, in giving effect to all statutory and administrative provisions before us consistently with their terms, we take Commission Rule 103.11(b) at face value. We hold that Appellant falls within the exception provided for a party who takes a leave of absence, whether paid or unpaid, to serve as an Association Officer, which we find qualifies as \u201cfull-time employment in a non[-]civil service position.\u201d Thus, the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition did not apply to Appellant, and no impropriety could have attached to Appellant\u2019s endorsement, transmission, and posting to the Association website of a letter informing Governor Rendell of the Association\u2019s support of his gubernatorial candidacy.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nChief Justice CAPPY and Justice CASTILLE and EAKIN join the opinion.\nFormer Justice NIGRO did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nJustice SAYLOR concurs in the result.\nJustice NEWMAN files a dissenting opinion.\n. At all relevant times, the Association was the official bargaining unit representative of Commonwealth Corrections Officers.\n. Section 905b provides in relevant part:\n\u00a7 741.905b. Political activity\n(b) No person in the classified service shall take an active part in political management or in a political campaign. Activities prohibited by this subsection include, but are not limited to, the following activities:\n(7) Soliciting votes in support of or in opposition to a candidate for public office in a partisan election or a candidate for political party office.\n(10) Endorsing or opposing a candidate for public office in a partisan election or a candidate for political party office in a political advertisement, a broadcast, campaign, literature, or similar material.\n(f) A person in the classified service who violates this section shall be removed from employment and funds appropriated for the position from which removed thereafter may not be used to pay the employe or individual: Provided, That, the commission at its discretion may impose a penalty of suspension without pay of not more than one hundred twenty working days, if it finds that the violation does not warrant termination.\n71 P.S. \u00a7 741.905b.\n. This section provides for the accrual of retirement credit for members of the civil service as follows:\n\u00a7 5302. Credited State service\n* * * *\n(b) Creditable leaves of absence\n\u2021 \u2021 $\n(2) [a]n active member on paid leave granted by an employer for purposes of serving as an elected full-time officer for a Statewide employee organization which is a collective bargaining representative under the ... Public Employe Relations Act: Provided, That such leave shall not be for more than three consecutive terms of the same office; that the employer shall fully compensate the member, including, but not limited to, salary, wages, pension and retirement contributions and benefits, other benefits and seniority, as if he were in full-time active setvice; and that the Statewide employee organization shall fully reimburse the employer for all expenses and costs of such paid leave, including, but not limited to, contributions and payment in accordance with sections 5501, 5505.1 and 5507 [concerning employer responsibilities vis-a-vis retirement benefits], if the employee organization either directly pays, or reimburses the Commonwealth or other employer for contributions made in accordance with section 5507.\n71 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5302(b)(2) (emphasis added).\n. This case, in fact, encompasses consolidated cross-appeals, reflecting that each party claims aggrievement in the wake of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s disposition. Pinto is Appellant at 71 MAP 2005, challenging the Commonwealth Court's determination that the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition applies to a CO on \"paid\u201d leave to serve as an officer of the Association. The Commission, Appellee at 71 MAP 2005, is Appellant at 70 MAP 2005, challenging the Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding that, notwithstanding that Appellant is subject to the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition, the activity complained of in this case did not violate the prohibition. Our disposition of the first question in Pinto\u2019s favor renders moot the arguments asserted by the Commission at 70 MAP 2005. Accordingly, we refer exclusively to Pinto as Appellant and do not reach the Commission's cross-appeal.\n. Rule 103.11(b) of the Civil Service Commission Rules enumerates exceptions to the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition. It provides, in relevant part:\n\u00a7 103.11. Exception to prohibited political activities.\n(b) The provisions of the act which expressly prohibit certain political activities do not apply to the classified service employe who has been furloughed or who is on a regular leave of absence, or leave of absence to take a non[-]civil service position. An employe on another type of leave of absence shall continue to comply with the political activity restrictions while on leave.\n4 Pa.Code \u00a7 103.11. We refer to citations to Title 4 of die Administrative Code as \"Commission Rules\u201d or \"Rules\u201d in keeping with their designation under Part A of Title 4 as \u201cRules of the Civil Service Commission\u201d and to carefully distinguish them from the statutory provisions of the Civil Service Act.\n. But see Hetman v. State Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, 714 A.2d 532 (Pa.Cmwlth. 1998) (finding disciplined parties' lack of knowledge that their actions violated the political activity prohibition irrelevant).\n. Judges Leadbetter and Cohn Jubelirer noted their dissent without opinion.\nConcurring in the result, Judge Pellegrini opined that the majority erred in finding that the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition applied to Appellant. Judge Pellegrini noted first that, by its plain language, the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition applied exclusively to \"persons in the classified service.\u201d Next, he noted that CSA \u00a7 3(d)(4), 71 P.S. \u00a7 741.3(d)(4), defines the \"classified service\u201d to consist of \u201c[a]ll positions\u201d existing or created under the Commission. Pinto, 860 A.2d at 599 (Pellegrini, J., concurring). Then he turned to CSA \u00a7 3(f), which defines \"position\u201d as \"a group of current duties and responsibilities,\u201d and concluded that \u201cfor an employee to be part of the classified service, he or she must be performing current duties to be holding a position in the classified civil service.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original). Thus, Judge Pellegrini concluded, while on leave, whether paid or unpaid, an employee is not \"performing current duties\u201d and therefore does not hold a position in the classified service. Consequently, Appellant was not bound by the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition.\n. Commission Rule 91.3 (\u201cDefinitions'') defines terms like \u201cleave of absence\u201d to supplement the definitional section of the CSA, see 71 P.S. \u00a7 741.3. Commission Rule 91.3 expressly notes that \u201c[w]ords, terms and phrases, when used in this part, have the meaning\u201d assigned them in 741.3.\n. The Commission does not explicitly acknowledge that under the SERC arrangement all monetary expenses associated with Appellant's employment, not just direct compensation, are covered by the Association for the duration of his tenure with that organization, including retirement contributions. See 71 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5302(b)(2) (citing 71 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5501 (\u201cRegular member contributions for current service\"), 5505.1 (\"Additional member contributions\u201d), 5507 (\"Contributions by the Commonwealth and other employers\")).\nAlthough accrual of retirement seniority surely has abstract value to its beneficiary, we do not agree with the Commission that Appellant only would have sought the benefit of the SERC \u00a7 5302 were its benefit monetary. While the accrual of seniority might permit Appellant to retire sooner than he would have retired had he served a term with the Association without accrual of seniority, it would appear, with the Association covering employer\u2019s obligations vis-a-vis Appellant's retirement for the duration of that term, that tire Commission in fact benefited by being reimbursed for expenses that it otherwise would have carried had Appellant not served that term. Similarly, nothing about this arrangement would appear to encourage Appellant to retire sooner than he would have done had he not served as an Association officer.\n. Notably, in his advisory opinion to Association Lobbyist Fred McKillop, the Chief Counsel for the Commission, in quoting the relevant text of Commission Rule 103.11(b), emphasized the \"regular leave of absence\" and \u201canother type of leave of absence\u201d phrases in the rule, diminishing by comparison the \"non-civil service position\u201d exception. See Reproduced Record at 127a (\"The provisions of the act which expressly prohibit certain political activities do not apply to the classified service employe ... who is on a regular leave of absence, or leave of absence to take a non-civil service position. An employee on another type of leave of absence shall continue to comply with the political activity restrictions while on leave.\u201d (quoting 4 Pa.Code \u00a7 103.11(b); emphasis furnished by Chief Counsel Frederick Smith)).\n. Notably, this provision appears under \u00a7 5302(b), which is headed \"Creditable leaves of absence,\u201d which in turn appears under \u00a7 5302, entitled \"Credited state service.\u201d Our rules of statutory construction, although they deny statutory headings dispositive effect, note that they \"may be used to aid in the construction\u201d of the sections they describe. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1924.\n. As noted, the Commission argues that a \"regular leave of absence\u201d is identical to a \"leave of absence\u201d as defined in Commission Rule 91.3 and, therefore, by definition must be unpaid.\n. Notably, less than two months after the Commission\u2019s Chief Counsel indicated that a party on paid leave to serve as an Association officer was subject to the CSA \u00a7 905b political activity prohibition, the Association and the Human Resources and Management bureau of the Commonwealth\u2019s Executive Offices executed an agreement modifying the Collective Bargaining Agreement to permit Association Business Agents on \"unpaid\u201d leave pursuant to the agreement to accrue seniority credit during their leave. Although the mechanism by which this occurred does not bear on this case, it further illustrates the questionable logic underlying the Commission's position herein. Clearly, with regard to business agents, the Commonwealth detected no threat to the classified service\u2019s integrity by the continued accrual of retirement seniority by members on leave to serve as Association Business Agents.

        "text": "Justice NEWMAN,\nDissenting.\nThe Majority concludes that Roy C. Pinto (Pinto) was on \u201cleave of absence to take a non-civil service position\u201d and, therefore, was not subject to the political activity prohibition of Section 905b of the Civil Service Act, 71 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 905(b). I must respectfully disagree and, accordingly, I dissent.\nI believe that an analysis of the relevant statutes demonstrates that employees released from their regular state workplace for union activities, union business, or any other employee organizational purpose pursuant to a paid leave agreement are actually still active employees on active duty. The political activity prohibition should be applicable to active employees, such as Pinto, if: (1) they receive some benefit for the time spent on leave; (2) they would be performing duties at the usual job site if they were not on paid leave; and (3) the employee is permitted to leave for a specific purpose approved by the employer. In the case siib judice, Pinto received a benefit that he was not entitled to if on a non-paid leave of absence; he would have been performing his usual duties if not on paid leave; and he was permitted to work on paid leave status for a specific purpose, sanctioned by statute, upon agreement of his employer. Unlike the Majority, I essentially agree with both parties and the Commonwealth Court that Pinto\u2019s status as a paid or unpaid employee governs this appeal.\nEmployee Subject to Restrictions of the Act\nContrary to the conclusion of the Majority, I do not believe that Pinto is on leave of absence to take a non-civil service position. Pinto continues to serve the Commonwealth as a union employee, to the mutual benefit of both the Commonwealth and the union. The Majority errs in regard to both the statutory text and its underlying policy.\nPinto challenges the determinations made by the Commonwealth Court and the Commission that he is a civil service employee for purposes of Sections 905.2(b)(7) and (b)(10) of the Act. 71 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 741.905(b)(7), (10). Like the Majority, Pinto asserts that the Commonwealth Court incorrectly focused its scrutiny on whether he was on a paid or unpaid leave of absence. Pinto believes that the essential element is whether he remained in the classified service once he began his leave of absence and that, if he has shown that he is not in the classified service, his actions as Vice President of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association (PSCOA) cannot violate the Act.\nIn support of this contention, he notes that Section 3(d)(4) of the Act, 71 P.S. \u00a7 741.3(d)(4), defines \u201cclassified service\u201d to include \u201c[a]ll positions now existing or hereafter created under the State Civil Service ..Commission.\u201d He observes that subsection 3(f) defines \u201cposition\u201d as \u201ca group of current duties and responsibilities assigned or delegated by competent authority requiring the full-time or part-time employment of one person.\u201d 71 P.S. \u00a7 741.3(f). Pinto maintains that, without current duties, he does not hold a \u201cposition\u201d in the \u201cclassified service.\u201d He also argues that he is accountable solely to the union for his conduct and receives absolutely no compensation from the Commonwealth. Finally, Pinto contends that, because \u201cevery penny\u201d that he receives from the Commonwealth in remuneration is refunded to the Commonwealth by PSCOA, he is on an unpaid leave of absence and not subject to the restrictions. I cannot agree.\nThe first flaw in Pinto\u2019s argument is that he has no current duties. It is clear that the Department of Corrections (DOC) assigned Pinto to work as an employee of the union, just as the DOC could assign Pinto to other duties. It is the DOC, as the employer, that controls the duties of its employees. Consistent with the authority of DOC to regulate job specifications, discipline, and job performance, it is clear that the union could not remove employees from their normal duties without the consent of the DOC. Rather, the union was required to request that DOC approve the assignment of Pinto from his normal duties for union leave because the DOC had the ability and authority to approve such an assignment. Further, while Pinto is on union leave, he is presumably still subject to discipline by DOC and the Commission. Therefore, Pinto\u2019s current duties are those assigned by DOC, which are to function as a union officer.\nUnion activities often provide mutual benefit to both the union and the employer. When utilized properly, union leave contributes to a peaceful and productive relationship between the state and its employees, in turn, providing a benefit to the state by improving state services. Mich. State AFL-CIO v. Mich. Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, 455 Mich. 720, 566 N.W.2d 258, 268 (1997) (Brickley, J., dissenting). Thus, the willingness of the DOC to assign its employees to union leave is consistent with the fact that the DOC reaps a benefit from union leave thereby making it a part of an employee\u2019s duties as a public employee.\nAn employee of the civil service who is on a paid leave of absence is still a civil service employee subject to the political restrictions of the Act. See Section 103.11(b) of the Pennsylvania Code, 4 Pa.Code \u00a7 103.11(b). Pinto is on a paid leave of absence even though he argues that the union reimburses the Commonwealth for his salary and benefits. Pursuant to the definition of reimbursement, the Commonwealth pays Pinto\u2019s salary. Reimbursement comes later, often weeks after the Commonwealth has paid Pinto. The arrangement for PSCOA to reimburse the DOC for Pinto\u2019s salary and benefits does not negate the fact that Pinto\u2019s status with the DOC is as an employee. Cf. Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd. v. BASF Wyandotte Corp., 798 F.2d 849 (5th Cir.1986); Commc\u2019ns Workers of Am. v. Bell Atl. Network Servs., Inc., 670 F.Supp. 416 (D.D.C. 1987). If this were not the case, Pinto would be ineligible for the pension benefit that he seeks. This benefit is unavailable to those on unpaid leaves of absence and could not be purchased by Pinto after his return to the DOC. Further, Section 5302(b)(2) explicitly indicates that Pinto is an \u201cactive member on paid leave\u201d for purposes of holding union office, while still recognizing that the union is to reimburse the Commonwealth for all salary and benefit expenses. 71 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5302(b)(2). Accordingly, I would affirm that portion of the decision of the Commonwealth Court that held that Pinto is a DOC employee and subject to the political restrictions of the Act.\nEndorsement as Political Activity\nPinto argues that, even if he is a civil service employee, he sent the endorsement letter to then gubernatorial candidate Rendell as part of the duties required by his position as an officer in the union and not in his individual capacity. He complains that, in return for the sole benefit of maintaining his status in the Commonwealth\u2019s retirement system, he is stripped of the free speech rights guaranteed to every other citizen of this Commonwealth. Further, he avers that he is prohibited from performing his essential job duties because political speech is characteristically intertwined with informative and dutiful union representation. Interestingly, he does concede that a strict application of Sections 905.2(b)(7) and (b)(10), regardless of the context surrounding the speech, means that \u201cany expression by [Pinto] to another person of the PSCOA\u2019s endorsement of Rendell would subject him to discipline under the Act.\u201d (Pinto\u2019s Brief at 27.)\nThese arguments are unavailing to me. The United States Supreme Court has held that the interests of the government in avoiding the appearance of bias and favoritism, the maintenance of a workforce in which performance is measured by occupational achievement rather than political activity, and the freedom of public employees from political pressures override the interests of government employees in engaging in overt political campaign activities. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973); U.S. Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 93 S.Ct. 2880, 37 L.Ed.2d 796 (1973); United Pub. Workers of Am. v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947). The endorsement of a political candidate is an overt political action.\nIt is Pinto\u2019s concurrent status as both a Vice President of PSCOA and a classified service employee that creates the necessity to restrict his, not the union\u2019s, right to comment publicly on partisan political matters. His interests as a union vice president do not outweigh the State\u2019s interests in preventing the classified service from becoming politicized and its employees from thereby losing their impartiality. I do not believe that Pinto is permitted to do what the remaining union members may not do, which is to engage in \u201chard core\u201d political activity on their behalf. Further, Pinto could have sent the letter signed by the union only, rather than from him personally as an officer of the union. Notably, Pinto commented on an issue with future implications when he stated, \u201cWe strongly oppose privatizing in our branch of public safety.\u201d This is exactly the type of behavior that Section 905.2(b) was meant to prohibit. Pinto chose to wear two hats \u2014 one of a PSCOA Vice President and the second, that of a civil service employee. If Pinto wished to engage in the political activity that he believes is essential to his position, then he needed to accept an unpaid leave of absence as provided for in the collective bargaining agreement. Otherwise, the union alone should have been the letter signatory or one of the other officers who was not on paid leave.\nPinto argues that, as the Act 195 representative for almost ten thousand Commonwealth employees, the PSCOA is statutorily obligated to further the interests of its membership. He posits that, inherent in this obligation, is the duty to monitor and, if necessary, participate in the legislative process as it inevitably affects the membership. However, participation in the legislative process does not require political activity such as that prohibited by the Act. Internal endorsements to the union membership as to those prospective candidates whose views are most consistent with the best interests of the union can fulfill the obligation of the representative to the rank and file. However, publishing those endorsements violates the intent and spirit of the Act and compromises the neutrality of a State employee.\nFinally, Pinto argues that his endorsement letter to Rendell did not affect the State\u2019s interests because, when he signed the letter, and it was posted on the PSCOA website, no one could have known that he was a civil service employee. However, it does not follow that, if a civil service employee violates the Act\u2019s political activity prohibitions, and no one knows about it, there is no violation. I believe that the decision here is clear. Pinto is a DOC employee and is subject to the restrictions of the Act. Pinto violated those restrictions by engaging in political activity. Accordingly, I would reverse this portion of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision and reinstate the five-day suspension.\nKnowing and Intentional Violation of the Act\nAlthough the Majority found it unnecessary to address this issue, I believe that, because Pinto is a civil service employee and violated the political prohibitions of Section 905(b), we must reach the issue of whether a violation of the Act requires a scienter element. The Commission contends that the decision of the Commonwealth Court is a significant departure from its other decisions in this area. Although the Commonwealth Court has addressed this issue on several previous occasions, this is an issue of first impression for this Court.\nIn its decision, the Commonwealth Court determined that Pinto did not engage in political activity because he sent the letter to then gubernatorial candidate Rendell solely for informational purposes and not as part of any official campaign activities. The court found it determinative that Pinto did not know that the letter was posted on the PSCOA website. However, it is my belief that a classified employee may not publish a letter in favor of or against a political candidate and that an employee who authors such an endorsement is responsible for any use that is made of it, whether or not he gives consent to such use.\nThe Commission argues that the holding of the Commonwealth Court ignores prior precedent that a violation of the Act\u2019s political activity prohibitions need not be knowing or intentional to be sanctioned. Further, the Commission chastises the Commonwealth Court for making its own finding of fact on this issue and rendering a determination as to Pinto\u2019s credibility.\nBeginning with Cardamone v. State Civil Service Commission, 58 Pa.Cmwlth. 637, 428 A.2d 757 (1981), the Commonwealth Court held that a violation of the Act need not be knowing or intentional to result in sanction. In Cardamone, a civil service worker defended his dismissal on the basis that he was unaware that his activity was political in nature. The court said that no scienter requirement is contained in the Act and his dismissal from employment was affirmed. It should be noted that originally the Act called for immediate dismissal when the civil service employee engaged in political activity. The Act was amended several times, reducing the punishment to a maximum suspension of one hundred twenty days. See also Hetman v. State Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, 714 A.2d 532 (Pa.Cmwlth.1998); DeMarco v. Pa. Liquor Control Bd., 657 A.2d 1359 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995); McCormick v. Pa. State Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, 77 Pa.Cmwlth. 498, 466 A.2d 273 (1983); Vaniscak v. State Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, 59 Pa.Cmwlth. 16, 428 A.2d 763 (1981);.\nHetman is most closely analogous to the instant matter. Hetman and one or two of her co-workers in a county mental health/mental retardation program were volunteer union mobilizers, whose primary union function was regular, lawful distribution of non-political union leaflets and printed informational material to fellow county co-workers. In late 1995, she received pamphlets from the Labor Council for distribution. She disseminated the material with another co-worker without reading it. The pamphlet contained anti-Republican material, clearly endorsing Democratic candidates. Again, the court held- that a finding regarding whether or not the union mobilizes were aware of the nature and contents of the pamphlets was unrelated to the ultimate legal determination that they violated the Act.\nThe Commonwealth Court, in the instant matter, failed to distinguish its current position from that it adopted in Cardamone, Vaniscak, McCormick, DeMarco, and Hetman. In all of those cases, the Commonwealth Court\u2019s analysis of political activity prohibitions stopped once the court determined that the employee engaged in prohibited political activity. Although the Majority is correct that none of these employees was on a leave of absence, their status was not determinative in deciding that they had violated the political prohibitions of the Act; only their forbidden political conduct was considered. I am reminded that this is, after all, merely a matter of civil discipline and sanctions can be imposed without proof of intent. Further, had the General Assembly intended that civil service employees must knowingly and intentionally engage in political activity before it would be actionable, it would have included such a requirement in the Act, which was most recently amended in 2002.\nThe political activity prohibition set forth in the Act does not provide an exception for unknowing or unintentional conduct and I would not require an element of intent when the General Assembly has clearly declined to include it in the statute. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court on this issue.\n. Although the Majority finds that the political activity prohibition does not apply to Pinto, it did not conclude that Pinto was beyond the disciplinary authority of the DOC.\n. Section 103.11(b) of the Pa.Code states in pertinent part as follows: The provisions of the act which expressly prohibit certain political activities do not apply to the classified service employee who has been furloughed or who is on a regular leave of absence, or leave of absence to take a noncivil service position. An employe on another type of leave of absence shall continue to comply with the political activity restrictions while on leave.\n. Section 5302(b)(2) provides:\n\u00a7 5302. Credited State service\n;K % % jjs\n(b) Creditable leaves of absence\n(2) An active member on paid leave granted by an employer for purposes of serving as an elected full-time officer for a Statewide employee organization which is a collective bargaining representative under the ... Public Employe Relations Act: Provided, That such leave shall not be for more than three consecutive terms of the same office; that the employer shall fully compensate the member, including, but not limited to, salary, wages, pension and retirement contributions and benefits, other benefits and seniority, as if he were in full-time active service; and that the Statewide employee organization shall fully reimburse the employer for all expenses and costs of such paid leave, including, but not limited to, contributions and payment in accordance with sections 5501, 5505.1 and 5507 [concerning employer responsibilities vis-\u00e1-vis retirement benefits], if the employee organization either directly pays, or reimburses the Commonwealth or other employer for, contributions made in accordance with section 5507.\n71 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5302(b)(2) (emphasis added) (internal footnote omitted).\n. The text of the letter was as follows:\nWe are writing on behalf of the members of PSCOA to inform you that we voted to endorse your candidacy for Governor of Pennsylvania.\nPSCOA proudly represent[s] over 9,500 correctional employees in the State of Pennsylvania[. I]t is our mission to promote the corrections officer profession and improve public safety, while still addressing the concerns of our membership. The PSCOA understands the high cost of operating our business to the point we are currently working with the House Appropriations committee to see how we can best save money in the department. We strongly oppose privatizing in our branch of public safety.\nOur membership is like no other in law enforcement, and considers it an honor to provide you with this endorsement due to your demonstrated commitment to our profession. We look forward to working together with you during the nextO four years.\nSincerely,\nRoy Pinto, VP PSCOA.\n(Reproduced Record at 129a.)\n. See, e.g., United States v. Genova, 333 F.3d 750, 759 (7th Cir.2003) (stating that employees are entitled to unpaid leave for political endeavors, not leave with corresponding benefit); State ex rel. Sowards v. County Comm'n of Lincoln County, 196 W.Va. 739, 474 S.E.2d 919 (1996) (sanctioning political activity by furloughed civil service employee and by civil service employee on unpaid leave of absence). I am unsure as to whether Pinto could engage in political activity even if he were on an unpaid leave of absence, but that is an issue outside the purview of this appeal. See, e.g., Alexander v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 165 F.3d 474 (6th Cir.1999) (holding that employee could be terminated for violating the Hatch Act prohibition on engaging in prohibited political activity even if he took an unpaid leave of absence); (Minnesota, Dep't of Jobs & Training v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 875 F.2d 179 (8th Cir.1989)) (finding that state employee violated proscription on political activity even though on leave of absence).\n. But in Burrus v. Vegliante, 336 F.3d 82, 87 (2d Cir.2003), the Second Circuit opined that union postings on bulletin boards constituted forbidden political activity because \"the bulletin boards are controlled by the [union], which is an agent of the active employees, and its use for \u2018political activity' must be deemed to be an act of those employees.\" Accord Kenner Police Dep\u2019t v. Kenner Mun. Fire & Police Civil Service Bd., 783 So.2d 392 (La.App.2001) (concluding that campaign contribution check signed by executive board of city police association was personal action taken by the officers individually, and not an action of the association, and as such, officers individually endorsed and contributed to political candidate in violation of statute prohibiting political activity by civil service employees; officers' conduct was not shielded by their status as members of the police union).\n. See, e.g., Biller v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 863 F.2d 1079 (2d Cir.1988) (determining that actions of government employees, while on extended leave as union presidents, in urging in union newspapers that union members contribute to unions\u2019 political action funds did not violate the Hatch Act, where the funds were not designated for any political campaign, party, committee or candidate at the time they were made); Blaylock v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 851 F.2d 1348 (11th Cir.1988) (finding that officer of union of government employees did not violate political activity prohibition by writing articles for union newspaper opposing re-election of President of the United States).\n. In DeMarco, the worker also argued that he did not know that his conduct was prohibited political activity. Once again the court stated that \u201cPetitioner\u2019s knowledge of this prohibition and hence his intent to violate the act is legally irrelevant.\u201d Id. at 1361.\n. In McCormick, a housing authority employee submitted a signed petition for placement of his name on a ballot for the position of township auditor. The court, quoting Cardamone, held that the \"assertion of unawareness of the prohibited nature of his conduct cannot relieve [an employee] of culpability therefor.\u201d Id. at 275(quoting Cardamone, 428 A.2d at 758).\n. In Vaniscak, the civil service worker signed a petition to run for office, which was circulated and filed by her husband. When informed that this was forbidden political activity, she immediately withdrew her candidacy. However, due to an oversight, her name remained on the ballot. She argued that her action was an unintentional, technical violation, but the court said that her behavior clearly went beyond personal expression and upheld her dismissal.",
