        "text": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nOn May 1, 2004, a police officer with the Phoenixville Police Department arrested appellant for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). The arresting officer took appellant to a hospital where he read appellant the warnings on the December 2003 version of the Implied Consent Form, form DL-26, and requested that appellant submit to a blood test. Appellant said nothing; the officer read the form again. Appellant then said he needed time to think it over. The officer read the form to appellant a third time, and appellant refused the test. By letter dated June 15, 2004, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing (Penn-DOT) advised appellant his operating privilege was suspended for 18 months for refusing a chemical test, a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1547. Appellant appealed the suspension, and in a September 2, 2004 order, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s appeal. On September 30, 2004, appellant filed a motion for supersedeas, which was granted to stay the suspension pending his appeal. Trial Court Order, 9/30/04.\nAppellant filed his appeal of the trial court\u2019s September 2, 2004 order to the Commonwealth Court, raising the issue of whether the implied consent warnings on form DL-26 satisfy the requirements of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1547(b)(2). In an unpublished decision, the Commonwealth Court affirmed and reinstated the suspension of appellant\u2019s operating privilege, determining form DL-26 satisfied \u00a7 1547(b)(2). The court stated it is not a police officer\u2019s duty to inform an arrestee of the various sanctions available so as to give the arrestee an opportunity to decide whether it is worth violating that law. Weaver, at 2. It further stated form DL-26 informs the arrestee that if he fails to accede to the officer\u2019s request for a chemical test, he will be in violation of the law and will be penalized for that violation, and this is sufficient information to decide whether to submit to the test. Id.\nWe granted allowance of appeal to determine whether the warnings on form DL-26 satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1547(b)(2)(h) of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1547. We hold the Commonwealth Court correctly determined form DL-26 satisfies such requirements.\n\u201cOur scope of review of a decision in a license suspension case is limited to determining whether the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by competent evidence and whether the trial court committed an error of law or an abuse of discretion in reaching its decision.\u201d Terraciano v. PennDOT, 562 Pa. 60, 753 A.2d 233, 236 (2000) (citation omitted). However, the question here is one of statutory construction, which is a question of law; \u201chence, this Court\u2019s review is plenary and we owe no deference to the lower courts\u2019 legal conclusions.\u201d Siekierda v. PennDOT, 580 Pa. 259, 860 A.2d 76, 81 (2004) (citation omitted).\nSection 1547 of the Vehicle Code provides:\nAny person who drives, operates or is in actual physical control of the movement of a vehicle in this Commonwealth shall be deemed to have given consent to one or more chemical tests of breath, blood or urine for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of blood or the presence of a controlled substance if a police officer has reasonable grounds to believe the person to have been driving, operating or in actual physical control of the movement of a vehicle ... in violation of section ... 3802 (relating to driving under influence of alcohol or controlled substance) ....\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1547(a)(1). Section 1547(b) of the Vehicle Code sets forth requirements that must be met before PennDOT can suspend a person\u2019s operating privilege for refusing a chemical test:\n(b) Suspension for refusal.\u2014\n(1) If any person placed under arrest for a violation of section 3802 is requested to submit to chemical testing and refuses to do so, the testing shall not be conducted but upon notice by the police officer, the department shall suspend the operating privilege of the person....\n* * =!=\n(2) It shall be the duty of the police officer to inform the person that:\n(i) The person\u2019s operating privilege will be suspended upon refusal to submit to chemical testing; and\n(ii) Upon conviction, plea or adjudication of delinquency for violating section 3802(a), the person will be subject to the penalties provided in section 3804(c) (relating to penalties).\nId., \u00a7 1547(b)(1), (2).\nAppellant argues PennDOT failed to meet its burden of proving the arresting officer complied with the requirements of \u00a7 1547(b)(2)(h) since the officer failed to enumerate the penalties set forth in \u00a7 3804(c). He contends \u00a7 1547(b)(2)(h) clearly and unambiguously requires the arresting officer to enumerate the penalties applicable for second, third, and subsequent offenses as set forth in \u00a7 3804(c). He contends the legislature\u2019s inclusion of the language \u201csubject to the penalties provided in section 3804(c)\u201d in subparagraph (ii) was a way of directing police to inform DUI arrestees of each of the penalties in \u00a7 3804(c) when requesting that a person submit to a chemical test. \u201cThe legislature simply cited the statute as a shorthand way of describing the duty of the police rather than restate all of the penalties a second time in the same legislation.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 9.\nThe prior version of \u00a7 1547(b)(2) provided: \u201cIt shall be the duty of the police officer to inform the person that the person\u2019s operating privilege will be suspended upon refusal to submit to chemical testing____\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1547(b)(2). It required the police to tell the arrestee of the consequences of refusing a chemical test so the arrestee could make a knowing and conscious choice. Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 13 (citing Penn DOT v. O\u2019Connell, 521 Pa. 242, 555 A.2d 873 (1989)). Appellant states \u201c[a] failure to provide the required warning meant there was no refusal upon which to base a suspension.\u201d Id., at 12. Appellant contends that under the version of \u00a7 1547 in effect at the time of his arrest, the legislature required the officer to inform the arrestee regarding suspension of operating privilege and all possible criminal consequences of a refusal before an arrestee can be penalized for refusing a chemical test. Appellant claims since the officer did not comply with the legislature\u2019s mandate under subparagraph (ii), \u201cthere can be no refusal and no basis for a suspension----\u201d Id., at 13.\nAppellant further argues that even if \u00a7 1547(b)(2)(h) is ambiguous, the rules of statutory construction require the warnings to include the enhanced penalties for second, third, and subsequent offenses. He asserts form DL-26\u2019s reference to \u201csection 3804(c)\u201d is \u201cmeaningless to anyone but vehicle code experts ... [and] it would be unreasonable and absurd to suggest that the legislature would require police to impart information to arrestees that would have no meaning to them.\u201d Id., at 15. He argues the inclusion of this clause lessens the impact of the warnings and fosters refusals since the clause minimizes the potential mandatory m\u00ednimums facing repeat offenders. Appellant contends, \u201c[r]epeat offenders would be much more likely to submit to the test if informed that the refusal and conviction would result in 90 days in prison and a $1,500 fine if it was a second offense and one year in jail and a $2,500 fine if it was a third or subsequent offense.\u201d Id., at 16.\nPennDOT argues the warnings on form DL-26 were sufficient to comply with the duty imposed on police officers by \u00a7 1547(b)(2). See Weaver. PennDOT argues these warnings satisfy \u00a7 1547(b)(2)(ii) since they inform the driver that upon conviction, plea, or adjudication of delinquency for violating \u00a7 3802(a), the driver will be subject to the more severe penalties set forth in \u00a7 3804(c). Appellee\u2019s Brief, at 8. It notes the Commonwealth Court has consistently denied similar challenges to the sufficiency of the form DL-26 warnings. Appellee\u2019s Brief, at 20 (citing Alexander v. PennDOT, 885 A.2d 651 (Pa.Cmwlth.2005); Witmer v. PennDOT, 880 A.2d 716 (Pa.Cmwlth.2005); Garner v. PennDOT, 879 A.2d 327 (Pa.Cmwlth.2005)).\nPennDOT contends the version of \u00a7 1547(b)(2) effective at the time of appellant\u2019s arrest is not complicated or ambiguous, and requires a police officer to provide only two specific pieces of information: first, that the arrestee\u2019s operating privilege will be suspended upon refusal to submit to chemical testing, and second, that if he refuses testing, and is later convicted of a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3802(a), he will be subject to the penalties in \u00a7 3804(c). PennDOT argues the plain language of \u00a7 1547(b)(2) requires the officer inform the arrestee of only these two points.\nPennDOT argues the second sentence of paragraph three of form DL-26 satisfies the duty imposed by subparagraph (ii) since that sentence provides all the information mandated by the legislature, as well as accurate information not required by the statute. It asserts subparagraph (ii) does not require an officer to specifically enumerate the various penalties set forth in \u00a7 3804(c). PennDOT further argues \u201c[t]he information [in the third paragraph of form DL-26] regarding the minimum penalties imposed under Section 3804(c) is not required by Section 1547(b)(2)(ii) and, while accurate, it is extraneous and gratuitous and should not affect the validity of the warning itself.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief, at 19. PennDOT urges this Court not to find the warnings insufficient based on its \u201cgratuitous\u201d inclusion of information that is not required by \u00a7 1547(b)(2)(H). Id., at 22.\nThe object of statutory interpretation is to determine the intent of the General Assembly. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). \u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, they are presumed to be the best indication of legislative intent.\u201d Hannaberry HVAC v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Snyder, Jr.), 575 Pa.66, 834 A.2d 524, 531 (2003) (citing Pennsylvania Financial Responsibility Assigned Claims Plan v. English, 541 Pa. 424, 664 A.2d 84, 87 (1995)). If the words of the statute are not explicit, the General Assembly\u2019s intent may be ascertained by considering:\n(1) The occasion and necessity for the statute.\n(2) The circumstances under which it was enacted.\n(3) The mischief to be remedied.\n(4) The object to be attained.\n(5) The former law, if any, including other statutes upon the same or similar subjects.\n(6) The consequences of a particular interpretation.\n(7) The contemporaneous legislative history.\n(8) Legislative and administrative interpretations of such statute.\n1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c). Moreover, in ascertaining the General Assembly\u2019s intent, we presume the General Assembly did not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution, or unreasonable. Id, \u00a7 1922(1).\nThe essence of appellant\u2019s argument is that \u00a7 1547(b)(2)(h) requires warnings beyond those provided in form DL-26. We disagree. Subparagraph (ii) commands police officers to inform an arrestee that \u201c(ii) upon conviction, plea or adjudication of delinquency for violating section 3802(a), the person will be subject to penalties provided in section 3804(c) (relating to penalties).\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1547(b)(2)(h). The words of this statute are clear and free from all ambiguity; thus, we will glean the legislative intent from those words. English, at 87 (\u201cWhere the words of a statute are clear and free from ambiguity the legislative intent is to be gleaned from those very words.\u201d). The plain language requires only that the officer inform the arrestee that if he is convicted of DUI, refusal will result in additional penalties; it does not require the officer to enumerate, all of the possible penalties, as appellant claims.\nWe reject appellant\u2019s claim that form DL-26\u2019s reference to \u00a7 3804(c) is meaningless to anyone save Vehicle Code experts and that it is unreasonable and absurd that the legislature would require police to give, an arrestee meaningless information. Form DL-26 gives an arrestee an easily understandable warning that if he refuses a chemical test and is convicted of DIJI, he will be subject to severe penalties because of his refusal. That which the legislature required the police to provide an arrestee is clear, and does not include the impractical complexity of explaining each of the three sections and eleven sub-subsections set forth in \u00a7 3804(c).\nWe also reject appellant\u2019s claim that form DL-26 did not satisfy \u00a7 1547(b)(2)(ii)\u2019s requirements. The form stated that if an arrestee refuses to submit to a chemical test, and he is convicted of DUI, because of his refusal, he will be subject to the penalties set forth in \u00a7 3804(c), \u201cwhich include a minimum of 72 hours in jail and a minimum fine of $1000.00.\u201d Form DL-26 (December 2003) (emphasis added). The clause included in form DL-26 is an accurate statement of the minimum penalties set forth in \u00a7 3804(c). This clause does not state the minimum penalties of 72 hours imprisonment and $1000 fine are exhaustive of the penalties set forth in \u00a7 3804(c); rather, it states the penalties set forth in \u00a7 3804(c) include these minimum penalties, which suggests other penalties are available. While some arrestees may be more willing to submit to a chemical test if provided with the most severe penalties to which they may be subject, this information is not necessary under the statute. As the Commonwealth Court succinctly noted, \u201cIt is not the duty of the police to explain the various sanctions available under a given law to an arrestee to give that individual an opportunity to decide whether it is worth it to violate that law.\u201d Weaver, at 2. This inclusion of accurate information concerning the minimum penalties, beyond what the legislature required, does not affect the validity of form DL-26 warnings. Indeed, it informs the arrestee that the penalties are concrete, and not inconsequential.\nAppellant also challenges the Commonwealth Court\u2019s filing of unpublished decisions. He asserts unpublished decisions harm our justice system by allowing courts to put inadequate thought and emphasis into the legal reasoning behind decisions, allowing result-driven decisions, and not benefiting the bench and bar with well-reasoned precedential decisions. Appellant urges this Court to nullify the internal operating procedures that permit use of per curiam memorandum decisions, thereby requiring the Commonwealth Court to publish all decisions. Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 17-19. Appellant asserts this case \u201cclearly illustrates the folly of allowing non-precedential opinions.\u201d Id., at 18.\nAppellant, however, fails to acknowledge the Commonwealth Court ordered publication of this decision. Moreover, Commonwealth Court IOP 412 sets forth clear and well-reasoned criteria for determining whether a decision should be reported. See 210 Pa.Code \u00a7 67.53. Suggesting that decisions not published beyond the parties are somehow inadequately considered by the appellate court is near scurrilous. There is no reason for this Court to disturb this practical and salient procedure.\nFor the reasons provided, we affirm the Commonwealth Court.\nOrder affirmed.\nChief Justice CAPPY, Justice CASTILLE, Justice NEWMAN and Justice SAYLOR join the opinion.\nJustice BAER files a dissenting opinion in which Justice BALDWIN joins.\n. The December 2003 version of form DL-26 provided:\n1. Please be advised that you are under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substance in violation of Section 3802 of the Vehicle Code.\n2. I am requesting that you submit to a chemical test of Blood.\n3. It is my duty as a police officer to inform you that if you refuse to submit to the chemical test, your operating privilege will be suspended for at least one year. In addition, if you refuse to submit to the chemical test, and you are convicted of, plead to, or adjudicated delinquent with respect to violating Section 3802(a) of the Vehicle Code, because of your refusal, you will be subject to the more severe penalties set forth in Section 3804(c) of the Vehicle Code, which include a minimum of 72 hours in jail and a minimum fine of $1000.00.\n4. It is also my duty as a police officer to inform you that you have no right to speak with an attorney or anyone else before deciding whether to submit to testing and any request to speak with an attorney or anyone else after being provided these warnings or remaining silent when asked to submit to chemical testing will constitute a refusal, resulting in the suspension of your operating privilege and other enhanced criminal sanctions if you are convicted of violating Section 3802(a) of the Vehicle Code.\nForm DL-26 (December 2003), Commonwealth's Exhibit No. C-l.\n. The Commonwealth Court ordered publication of this decision May 3, 2005. PennDOT v. Weaver, 873 A.2d 1 (Pa.Cmwlth.2005).\n. Section 1547(b)(2)(ii) has been amended since appellant was arrested; it now provides: \"if the person refuses to submit to chemical testing, upon conviction or plea for violating section 3802(a)(1), the person will be subject to the penalties provided in section 3804(c) (relating to penalties).\u201d P.L. 1369, No. 177, \u00a7 2, Effective November 29, 2004.\n. At the time of appellant's arrest, \u00a7 3804(c) provided:\nAn individual who violates section 3802(a)(1) and refused testing of blood or breath or an individual who violates section 3802(c) or (d) shall be sentenced as follows:\n(1) For a first offense, to:\n(1) undergo imprisonment of not less than 72 consecutive hours nor more than six months;\n(ii) pay a fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $5,000;\n(iii) attend an alcohol highway safety school approved by the department; and\n(iv) comply with all drug and alcohol treatment requirements imposed under sections 3814 and 3815.\n(2) For a second offense, to:\n(i) undergo imprisonment of not less than 90 days nor more than five years;\n(ii) pay a fine of not less than $1,500;\n(iii) attend an alcohol highway safety school approved by the department; and\n(iv) comply with all drug and alcohol treatment requirements imposed under sections 3814 and 3815.\n(3) For a third or subsequent offense, to:\n(i) undergo imprisonment of not less than one year nor more than five years;\n(ii) pay a fine of not less than $2,500; and\n(iii) comply with all drug and alcohol treatment requirements imposed under sections 3814 and 3815.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3804(c).",

        "text": "Justice BAER,\ndissenting.\nToday, the Majority holds that the legislature\u2019s directive requiring a police officer to inform one under arrest for driving under the influence of the consequences of failure to consent to chemical testing is met through the following text:\nIt is my duty as a police officer to inform you that if you refuse to submit to the chemical test, your operating privilege will be suspended for at least one year. In addition, if you refuse to submit to the chemical test, and you are convicted of, plead to, or adjudicated delinquent with respect to violating Section 3802(a) of the Vehicle Code, because of your refusal, you will be subject to the more severe penalties set forth in Section 3804(c) of the Vehicle Code, which include a minimum of 72 hours in jail and a minimum fine of $1000.00.\nForm DL-26 (December 2003).\nRespectfully, this is meaningless to all except those most involved in the intricacies of the law surrounding driving under the influence. Does anyone really question what the reaction of the United States Supreme Court would have been if in the aftermath of its decision in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), police would have been so presumptuous as to deliver Miranda warnings by informing arrestees: \u201cYou have rights as provided at 384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694\u201d? Indeed, while many arrestees might well be able to recite the procedural safeguards of constitutional rights required by Miranda from the countless times those warnings have been stated in movies and television depictions, few judges or lawyers and virtually no laypeople could discern the penalties provided merely by reference to \u201cSection 3804(c).\u201d\nAccordingly, I cannot join my colleagues in holding that the warnings provided by Form DL-26 satisfy the Legislature\u2019s directive pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1547(b)(2) and our requirement in Commonwealth v. O\u2019Connell, 521 Pa. 242, 555 A.2d 873 (1989), that police officers provide an arrestee with information regarding the consequences of refusing chemical testing sufficient to enable that arrestee to make an informed decision of whether to consent to the test.\nIn O\u2019Connell, we insisted that the arrestee be told not only of the civil consequences of refusing testing but also that the constitutional right to an attorney did not apply to the decision to refuse the chemical test. \u201cAn arrestee is entitled to this information so that his choice to take a [chemical] test can be knowing and conscious and we believe that requiring the police to qualify the extent of the right to counsel is neither onerous nor will it unnecessarily delay the taking of the test.\u201d 521 Pa. 253, 555 A.2d 878.\nThrough Section 1547(b)(2) (ii), the legislature imposed on police officers a duty to inform the arrestee that \u201c[t]he person\u2019s operating privileges will be suspended upon refusal to submit to chemical testing\u201d and that \u201c[u]pon conviction, plea or adjudication of delinquency for violating section 3802(a) [DUI], the person will be subject to the penalties provided in section 3804(c) (relating to penalties).\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1547(b)(ii). These penalties range from \u201cimprisonment of not less than 72 consecutive hours\u201d and \u201ca fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $5,000\u201d for first-time offenders to \u201cimprisonment of not less than one year\u201d and \u201ca fine of not less than $2,500\u201d for a third or subsequent offense. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3804(c). Clearly, the purpose of Section 1547(b)(ii) is to entitle arrestees to the information necessary to assess the dire consequences they face if they fail to consent to chemical testing, to ensure their choice in that regard is knowing and conscious, as we described in O\u2019Connell.\nMy colleagues hold that \u201c[t]he plain language [of Section 1547(b)(2)] requires only that the officer inform the arrestee that if he is convicted of DUI, refusal will result in additional penalties....\u201d Maj. at 196, 912 A.2d at 264. The Majority even suggests that PennDOT\u2019s provision of information regarding the minimum penalties of Section 3804(c) is, in fact, not required to fulfill an officer\u2019s informational duty pursuant to Section 1547(b)(2). Maj. at 197, 912 A.2d at 265 (\u201cThis inclusion of accurate information concerning the minimum penalties, beyond what the legislature required, does not affect the validity of form DL-26 warnings.\u201d (emphasis added)). I cannot conclude that the Legislature intended that the mere citation to a section number, as the Commonwealth suggests, or reference to \u201cadditional penalties,\u201d as the Majority opines, would provide the information necessary to allow arrestees to make a knowing choice. The section number is meaningless to most arrestees and the inclusion of merely the minimum sentence as provided in Form DL-26 does not provide information necessary for a knowing decision, and, given the severe consequences for repeat offenders, may well be misleading. See O\u2019Connell, 555 A.2d at 877 (\u201cThe law has always required that the police must tell the arrestee of the consequences of a refusal to take the test so that he can make a knowing and conscious choice.\u201d).\nI do not contend that an officer has a duty to recite every penalty provided in Section 3804(c). Instead, I believe the import of the penalties could be conveyed sufficiently by the addition of information regarding the maximum penalty. The additional information will not only provide the arrestee with the ability to make a knowing choice, but also will forward the purpose of the implied consent rule. The greater warning will likely entice more arrestees to submit to the test to avoid the greater penalty for refusing. More arrestees submitting to the test will garner better evidence for the Commonwealth and the courts in determining the proper punishment for those found in violation of Pennsylvania\u2019s laws.\nAccordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court and hold that the warnings provided by Form DL-26 do not meet the requirements of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1547(b)(2).\nJustice BALDWIN joins this opinion.\n. Miranda requires the police to inform an arrestee that: \"Prior to any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\u201d Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602.\n. I note that our decision in O\u2019Connell predated the provision imposing incarceration for refusal of testing and subsequent conviction of the underlying crime, and thus only contemplated the sufficiency of warnings for purposes of the civil collateral consequence of license suspension. I do not speak to whether the same analysis would apply following the addition of penalties involving imprisonment as that issue has not been fully briefed or argued before this Court.\n. For example, rather than informing the arrestee that if he refuses and is convicted, he \u201cwill be subject to the more sevei'e penalties set forth in Section 3804(c) of the Vehicle Code, which include a minimum of 72 hours in jail and a minimum fine of $ 1,000,\" the officer could provide a fuller warning by adding \u201cand, if you have been convicted of DUI in the past, you may be subject to imprisonment of not less than one year and a fine of not less than $2,500.\"",
