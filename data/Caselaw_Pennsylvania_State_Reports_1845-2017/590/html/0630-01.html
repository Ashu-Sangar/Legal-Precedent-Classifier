A second municipality, Narberth Borough (Narberth), whose border abutted the land to be developed, opposed the project. The Township provisionally approved the first step in the development process. It communicated this decision first by announcing it in an open hearing, and then by mailing a formal written decision. The Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), 53 P.S. §§ 10101, <em>et seq.,</em>

      <em> </em>requires that appeals be lodged in the appropriate trial court within thirty days of a municipality’s decision. Narberth appealed within thirty days of Township’s written decision, but more than thirty days after the earlier verbal announcement. Merloc moved to dismiss Narberth’s appeal as untimely, arguing that Narberth had failed to file the appeal within thirty days of the verbal announcement. The trial court denied that motion, but, on appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed. Accordingly, we granted <em>allocatur </em>to decide whether the applicable thirty-day appeal period runs from the verbal announcement of a municipality’s decision or the subsequent written communication formalizing that decision. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the Commonwealth Court, concluding that the appeal period runs from the mailing of the written decision.</p>

Narberth’s Solicitor immediately noted Narberth’s opposition to the decision and its intention to file a land use appeal.

Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court concluded that Narberth’s Notice of Appeal filed on April 26, 2002, was untimely because more than thirty days had passed since the Board announced its decision at the March 20, 2002, meeting. Thus, the Commonwealth Court held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal on the merits, effectively reinstating the Board’s approval of Merloc’s tentative sketch plan.

In effect, Narberth argues that even the tentative sketch plan that the trial court found to be missing mandatory submissions under the Code prompted the Board to impose forty-four distinct conditions to be satisfied with the preliminary plan. Those conditions, of course, were imposed following review of the incomplete materials submitted in conjunction with the tentative sketch plan.</p>

Because the Board did not have that opportunity, its approval of Merloc’s preliminary plan, which was necessarily responsive only to the concerns raised by the forty-four conditions imposed in conjunction with approval of the tentative sketch plan, could not moot a challenge based on Merloc’s failure to furnish the Board with all of the materials required by the Code in connection with the tentative sketch plan process, which might have spawned additional conditions.</p>

Thus, the preliminary plan application “was premised upon a valid tentative sketch plan approval,” Reply Brief for Appellant at 19, and ostensibly is invalid to the extent the tentative sketch plan was, as found by the trial court, missing mandatory documentation. Narberth hastens to add that the only judicial forum that reviewed the Board’s approval of Merloc’s tentative sketch plan on its merits found the approval legally infirm on this basis, and reversed the approval.</p>

Specifically, § 135~16B(16) of the Code requires submission, with a tentative sketch plan, of a conservation plan inventory satisfying the requirements of Code § 101-14A. The preliminary plan requirements, on the other hand, make no mention of § 101-14A.

The parties do not dispute that Narberth filed its Notice of Appeal within thirty days of the Township’s mailing of its March 28, 2002 written decision-in this case, both to Merloc and to Narberth, although it was required by statute to serve that decision only upon Merloc.

Thus, we next must determine what the statute reveals about the legislature’s intended meaning for that phrase. MPC 1002-A and 508(1) furnish the answer. While, speaking generally, § 508(1) could be clearer,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> it unequivocally requires that a “decision” for purposes of this case <em>“shall be in uniting and shall be communicated to the applicant personally or mailed to him </em>at his last known address not later than 15 days following the decision.” 53 P.S. § 10508(l)(emphasis added). By its terms, then, § 508 requires reduction of the Board’s disposition to a writing that is mailed, handed, emailed, faxed, or otherwise transmitted in written form to the applicant.

We acknowledge that certain matters encompassed within the tentative sketch plan in accord with § 101-14A appear to correspond to requirements in the preliminary plan as well. <em>See, e.g., </em>§ 101— 14A(l)(requiring submission of "Property base map" that also is encompassed in a preliminary plan by §§ 135 — 17A(1)—(3), (6)); § 101— 14A(3)(g)(requiring information pertaining to vegetation and woodland information that is also required in a preliminary plan by § 135— 17B(4)). As we take up in more detail at the end of this Opinion, we are confident that the Commonwealth Court will fashion any necessary relief with sensitivity to the considerable work Merloc already has done to satisfy the Code’s requirements, while also taking into account the importance of the Code’s mandatory requirements and Narberth’s right to judicial scrutiny of the Board's decisions.</p>

MPC § 508 arguably uses "decision” in two distinct ways, treating it both as the act of decision (the approval at the time the Board determines to do so) and the creation and transmission of same. Be that as it may, § 508 clearly anticipates the "communication” of a writing to the applicant as a necessary occurrence, 53 P.S. § 10508(1), and provides for deemed approval in the event that such “communication” does not occur, without regard to whether the decision-making authority announces its disposition at a public meeting. Id. § 10508(3).</p>

      <p id="b870-6" data-blocks='[["BL_870.6",870,[319,2138,1157,231]]]'>. This last point is critical: even assuming the definition of "decision” is ambiguous for present purposes, "entry of decision,” which is the triggering event for the thirty-day window to appeal under MPC § 1002-A, unambiguously refers to reduction to writing and transmission to the applicant of the disposition of the application. Thus, any such ambiguity does not affect the inquiry at hand.</p>

We will not speculate as to the disposition of a case where a decision is "entered" by mailing to an applicant, and an objector subsequently <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>argues that it neither knew nor could have known of that mailing.

This in itself does not necessarily vitiate any deficiencies in Merloc's tentative sketch plan. We think it prudent, however, to emphasize that this Court does not intend to suggest that the land use process must begin anew if the tentative sketch plan was, indeed, deficient in any of the regards alleged. We trust the Commonwealth and trial courts to fashion appropriate relief as they deem necessary.</p>

      <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>At issue in this ease is the identity of the triggering mechanism that starts the time period for filing an appeal in a land-use case under the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (hereinafter “MPC”). The majority quite correctly reads the MPC as identifying that trigger as the mailing of a written decision, which starts the 30-day appellate clock for all appeals under the MPC. 53 P.S. § 11002-A. With that conclusion, I cannot quibble. What is not revealed in that straightforward legal conclusion is its practical impact.</p>
    <p id="b874-4" data-blocks='[["BL_874.4",874,[318,822,1166,1014]]]'>In this case, as in many land use cases, the interested parties often extend beyond the landowner and the political subdivision. The MPC does not require the delivery of written notice of its decisions to anyone other than the applicant in a land use case. 53 P.S. § 10908. An objector, like the appellant herein, would not have a reliable means to ascertain the triggering date for bringing an appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Normally, the objectors receive notice of the Board’s decision orally at the public meeting. Recognizing this differing treatment of applicants and objectors, and how this distinction would affect appellate time limitations, the Commonwealth Court attempted to create a two-tiered time system for bringing an appeal. <em>See Peterson v. Amity Twp. Bd. of Supervisors, </em><a href="/a2d/804/0723-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="804 A.2d 723" data-case-ids="11421728" data-case-paths="/a2d/804/0723-01">804 A.2d 723</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2002). This attempt by the Commonwealth Court was laudatory; it acknowledged the reality of the land use process and attempted to preserve the due process rights of all interested parties to bring a timely appeal. Although well intended, this two-tiered system does not reflect the clear language of the MPC.</p>
