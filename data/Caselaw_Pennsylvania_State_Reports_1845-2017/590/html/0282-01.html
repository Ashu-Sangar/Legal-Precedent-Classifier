The Church had a small congregation at the time, only registering twenty-five members. Because contributions were meager, Church members performed the majority of the necessary Church maintenance. In fact, the Church Constitution designated the Board of Trustees as the persons responsible for: “Maintenance and Protection of Church Building, Grounds, Furnishings and Equipment; Operational Supervision; Building Improvements; [and] Plans for Future Building Needs of the Church.” Constitution of the Brookhaven Baptist Church 8 (effective May 8, 1963, <em>as amended </em>December 1, 1975). These duties were carried out on a voluntary basis. The single exception to the obligations of the Board of Trustees was that the Church paid to have the grass cut on the approximately 1.5-acre Church property. For some years prior to 1989, the Church employed John Coppock (Mr. Coppock), a local student, to cut <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>the grass. The Trustees completed all other grounds maintenance, such as edging the gardens, planting flowers, and pruning the shrubs and trees.</p>
    <p id="b512-4" data-blocks='[["BL_512.4",512,[314,505,1161,421]]]'>Beginning in the Spring of 1989, following Mr. Coppock’s departure for school, Decedent agreed to cut the grass for twenty-five dollars per week.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Church supplied the tractor-mower and the gasoline to operate it. Decedent determined whether the grass needed to be cut and when he would cut the grass. His usual custom, according to Mrs. Halvorson, was to mow half of the grassy area on one day and the remaining half on another day.</p>
    <p id="b512-5" data-blocks='[["BL_512.5",512,[314,953,1161,581]]]'>The Halvorsons became members of the Church in October of 1989. Decedent was appointed a Church Trustee in January of 1990. As a Trustee, Decedent performed various maintenance duties for the Church such as painting the men’s bathroom, changing light bulbs, vacuuming rugs, washing windows, cleaning restrooms, and other chores. He also continued to run the Church tractor to cut the grass for twenty-five dollars per week. Decedent and the other Trustees routinely came to the Church on Friday mornings throughout the year to fulfill their Church maintenance obligations.</p>

Unbeknownst to her, he also took his hedge cutting shears with him. Pearl Moore, a neighboring property owner, walked her new dog that morning and saw Decedent in the parking lot of the Church. When Mr. Geiger arrived at the Church at approximately 8:45 a.m., Decedent was trimming the <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>bushes beneath one of the Church windows. Mr. Geiger yelled a greeting and waived at Decedent, who hollered and waived back. Mr. Geiger went into the Church, checked the basement windows for break-ins, and got out the vacuum cleaner, preparing to vacuum the Church hallway. He heard a loud noise, saw a cloud of black smoke, and observed Decedent emerge from the black smoke engulfed in flames. Apparently, Decedent had gathered up the shrub clippings, piled them on the grass in the far corner of the Church driveway, and set fire to them using a can of gasoline. The fire department and an ambulance were called, with the fire chief, Gary Thompson (Thompson) arriving only moments later. Decedent was conscious and said to Thompson, “I think I screwed up” and “is my face burn[ed]?” (Thompson Deposition, October 17, 1996, p. 5.) Decedent died on July 1, 1991, nearly a month after suffering severe burns.</p>

The Church raised four issues before the court essentially challenging the absence of medical evidence linking Decedent’s death to the fire injuries, asserting in the alternative that Decedent was either a volunteer or an independent contractor, and arguing that the twenty-five dollars paid to Decedent was an honorarium rather than compensation.</p>

    <p id="b516-6" data-blocks='[["BL_516.6",516,[320,848,1162,844]]]'>The Church contends that Decedent was a “volunteer” and that the money that he received for cutting the grass was a “nominal honorarium.” The Church argues that Decedent was not cutting the grass when he sustained the fatal injury, but was performing volunteer services for the Church by trimming the bushes. Thus, the Church complains, Decedent’s efforts to trim the bushes, which led to his injury, were uncompensated trustee duties. However, at the hearing, Mr. Geiger, another member of the Board of Trustees, testified that Decedent was employed by the Church to cut the grass once per week for which he was paid twenty-five dollars, and that the equipment used for this purpose was owned by the Church. Various other witnesses testified to the fact that Decedent had been hired to cut the grass, and that the Church had paid Mr. Coppock, the previous grass cutter, the same amount.</p>

Three specific elements of this definition are key to the present analysis and must be addressed in order to support a finding that Decedent was an employee of the Church. These elements are: (1) the presence of valuable consideration; (2) whether the employment was casual in character; and (3) whether the employment was in the regular course of employer’s business.

Although Mrs. Halvorson asserts that Decedent was not compensated in this life for the majority of the tasks he performed, the witnesses generally agreed that Decedent was being paid by either an honorarium or an actual fee to cut the <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>grass. Ordinarily, if services are performed for the payor directly, the presumption is that the amount received is for the service and it is not a gift or honorarium.

Wood, R. Wood Deposition dated October 17, 1996, p. 26.) This negotiation for payment indicates that the weekly payment amount was not truly in the form of an honorarium but in the form of wages. An honorarium, in common understanding, means a voluntary reward for a service for which no remuneration could be collected by law. Thus, an honorarium is given to one who performed services for little or nothing and its tender is decided by the one for whom the services were performed without an obligation to give it. <em>See, e.g., Bogardus. </em>Here, the amount to be paid was clearly the subject of some discussion between the Church and Decedent. The fact that Decedent received twenty-five dollars every week for cutting the grass, even though the checks were issued approximately every four weeks, clearly constitutes wages as well as valuable consideration. The Church supplied the mower and the gasoline so that Decedent had little in the way of expenses to diminish the consideration he was receiving. Cf<em>. Wolf v. Workers’ Comp. Appeal Bd.

While descending a ladder, Williams fell and sustained serious injuries to his head and spine. The Superior Court concluded that Williams was not eligible for workers’ compensation benefits because his employment was casual and not in the regular course of the business of the church. The court observed that Williams was hired only sporadically whenever projects required his special abilities. It found it significant that Williams was working on income property owned by the church that was not directly associated with the work of the church.</p>

He negotiated the wage and utilized the materials and equipment supplied by his employer, the Church. The employment was not irregular, sporadic, or incidental and was, therefore, not casual in nature. Decedent is more properly a seasonal employee rather than a casual employee. Further, Decedent had been employed by the Church for nearly three years to perform the same task, the same way, and during the same time period. Thus, we agree with the determination of the Commonwealth Court that Decedent was an employee of the Church for purposes of cutting the grass.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

(WCJ Opinion dated June 7, 2001 at 2.) The Board affirmed this determination, also concluding that trimming the bushes was incidental to Decedent’s employment. The Commonwealth Court agreed.

He wore several “hats” during the years of his Church membership for he was not only a member, he also served as a Trustee as well as a seasonal employee. The duties of a Trustee included building and grounds maintenance. Several <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>witnesses testified as to the various activities of the Trustees in this regard, but they were unanimous in stating that the only paid position was for running the tractor to cut the grass. In fact, Mr. Geiger testified that he, not Decedent, usually completed the hand mowing in those areas that could not be reached with the tractor, and for which Mr. Geiger received no compensation. (Notes of Testimony dated April 18, 1996, p. 22.) We believe that the WCJ overlooked one important factor. This was the fact that no trimming of bushes and overhanging tree limbs, no edging, picking up sticks, hand mowing, or garden work, all of which are necessary to maintain the grounds of the Church, were ever included in the fee to cut the grass. (Thompson, Haines, D. Wood, R. Wood Deposition dated October 17, 1996, testimony of R. Wood, p. 51.) As Mr. Geiger testified, the Church paid an individual for running the tractor to cut the grass. When Mr. Coppock was paid to mow the grass, prior to the employment of Decedent, the Trustees were responsible for all other tasks included in grounds maintenance. <em><a href="/ariz/136/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="136 Ariz. 158" data-case-ids="713872" data-case-paths="/ariz/136/0158-01">Id.</a> </em>There is no testimony to indicate that the scope of Decedent’s employment was increased over that of Mr. Coppock, especially as Decedent was paid the same amount for the same job.
