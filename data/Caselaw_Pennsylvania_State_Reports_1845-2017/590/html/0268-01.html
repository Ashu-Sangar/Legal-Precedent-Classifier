Trial Court op. at 5. The court did not cite to any procedural rule which would permit it to join Petitioner as a party on its own motion, and without service of process.

Husband’s counsel thereafter submitted a letter stating that Husband lacks the financial means to formally respond to the present Application, as he is a debtor in bankruptcy proceedings pending in federal court. The letter stated that Husband — who was incarcerated in August 2005 after having been found in civil contempt for failure to pay ordered support, and remains incarcerated with a purge factor of $3,000,000 — opposes the Application and “desires full disclosure of any information that will enable [Wife] and the trial court to understand that he simply does not have the present financial ability to comply with the present Orders that exist against him.” Reply Letter of July 7, 2006. Wife filed a substantive response rehearsing at length the history of the underling litigation and arguing that Petitioner waived any objection to personal jurisdiction by attending one or more court proceedings and entering into an “agreed order” to sell her interest in the assets frozen by the court with the proceeds to be paid over into an escrow account. Wife maintains that the central issue raised by the present Application is limited to whether Petitioner consented to the trial court’s authority to determine the ownership and distribution of such proceeds, and thereby waived any objection to <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Answer of Respondent (Wife) at 10.</p>

Ordinarily, when an additional defendant is joined in civil litigation, the party seeking joinder must comply with Rules of Civil Procedure 2251-2255, which require the filing of a praecipe for a writ or a complaint, <em>see </em>Pa.R.C.P. 2252(b), and specify that “[t]he procedure, including pleadings, between the party joining an additional defendant and the additional defen<a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>dant shall be the same as though the party joining the additional defendant were a plaintiff and the additional defendant were a defendant.” Pa.R.C.P. 2255(a); <em>see also </em>Pa. R.C.P. 2231(d) (providing that “the joinder of parties in any action shall not affect the procedural rights which each party would have if suing or sued separately”). Thus, a party cannot be made an additional defendant in a case unless the appropriate form of original process is served upon such party. <em>See generally </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1007 (requiring the filing of a complaint or a praecipe for a writ of summons in order to commence an action); Pa.R.C.P. 2252(b) (mandating the filing of a complaint or a praecipe for a writ in order to join a non-party as an additional defendant). This gives the party sought to be joined notice of, <em>inter alia, </em>the fact of court proceedings potentially affecting his or her rights, the factual averments that underlie the claims for relief, the amount in controversy, and the relief requested. The party then has an opportunity to object preliminarily so as to challenge the court’s subject-matter or personal jurisdiction and test the legal sufficiency and/or specificity of the pleadings, among other things. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1028 (relating to preliminary objections). Through responsive pleadings, the party may also dispute the complaint’s factual allegations, <em>see </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1029, introduce new matter, <em>see </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1030, assert counterclaims, <em>see </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1031, and preserve any available objections and defenses, <em>see </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1032; <em>cf.

In <em>sua sponte </em>joining Petitioner as an additional defendant without any process or service, the trial court appears to have viewed the rules of civil procedure adopted by this Court, as well as any constitutionally-imposed due process restrictions, as optional so long as the court is earnestly attempting to “effectuate economic justice.” In spite of Petitioner’s objections, the court determined to continue exercising jurisdiction over Petitioner and her assets. The court acknowledged that its actions may have violated due process, but failed to certify its joinder order as raising a substantial jurisdictional issue. As Petitioner has been unable to obtain either merits review of that issue, <em>see supra </em>note 1, or a stay of proceedings, Petitioner plainly has no adequate legal remedy.
