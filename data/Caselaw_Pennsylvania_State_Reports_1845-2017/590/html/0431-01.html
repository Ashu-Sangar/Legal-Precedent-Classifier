Subsequently, in February of 1989, the Commission unanimously voted to certify the Federal North area (“the Redevelopment Area”) as blighted. The Commission then convened the Federal North Task Force (“Task Force”). The Task Force included representatives from the community, the URA, and the Pittsburgh Department of City Planning. Over six years, the Task Force worked to create a redevelopment plan for the area. In 1992, the Task Force presented a Redevelopment Area Plan (“the Redevelopment Plan”) and a supporting “Redevelopment Proposal for the Federal North Redevelopment Area” (“the Redevelopment Proposal”). The Redevelopment Plan and the Redevelopment Proposal recommended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the URA acquire all property located within three contiguous blocks. Multiple uses were proposed for the redevelopment of these three blocks. An office/research facility as well as a parking garage were to be constructed. On one block, all eleven existing buildings were to be reused and converted into performing arts, cultural and community activities venues as well as commercial space; the Property is located on this block.</p>

Judge Friedman interpreted <em>Arcara </em>as exempting government action from First Amendment scrutiny only when the government was moving against unlawful activity.

It contends that the proposed condemnation of the Property is driven by the URA’s desire to rid the Federal North neighborhood of adult entertainment. Appellant presents several different arguments in support of this claim. First, it asserts that the content-based purpose of the URA’s action is conclusively established by the fact that following redevelopment, the Property will be used as an entertainment venue. Appellant states that the only thing which will change following the proposed redevelopment is that the nature of the expression will no longer be erotic in nature. Appellant declares that the inescapable conclusion is that the URA seeks <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>the Property only because it seeks to suppress the erotic message presently being conveyed there.</p>

In support of this argument, the URA notes that it introduced evidence before the trial court that there were excellent, content-neutral reasons to take the Property and yet utilize it post-redevelopment for entertainment other than the showing of adult movies; namely, such a proposed use for the Property would reinvigorate the economy of the Federal North area in a fashion that would not occur if the Garden Theatre continued its operation. Pursuant to the Redevelopment Plan, the Property would be the venue for a variety of cultural events which would be much broader in scope and appeal than the entertainment presently offered by the Garden Theatre. It reasons that employing the Property in such a fashion would significantly increase the number of people who frequent the Federal North area which in turn would improve the economic condition of the neighborhood. The URA’s argument is sound and effectively guts Appellant’s claim that the Redevelopment Plan’s proposed reuse for the Property ineluctably leads to the conclusion that the proposed taking is content-based.</p>

The fact that some segments of the public dislike erotic expression does not mean that all individuals and entities are united in an attempt to stymie this type of communication. Furthermore, we note that Appellant had the opportunity to present this argument to the trial court, and the trial court, after holding hearings and sifting through this staggeringly large record, clearly rejected Appellant’s viewpoint as it explicitly found that the URA’s proposed taking was content-neutral.

Rather, it shows that Appellant, unlike the 46 other property owners, was unable to come to an amicable understanding with the URA. To put it bluntly, Appellant was the sole target of condemnation proceedings not because the URA singled out Appellant; rather, Appellant singled itself out. Furthermore, we note that adoption of Appellant’s reasoning would have the ironic effect of rendering the <em>Arcara </em>rule internally inconsistent.

In <em>Pap’s II, </em>the ordinance at issue was content-based, designed to suppress expression. We have the opposite situation here. As noted by the trial court, the URA’s action in seeking condemnation was content-neutral and unrelated to the suppression of freedom of expression. Furthermore, unlike the <em>Pap’s </em>matter, there is no silent, content-based reason that is “inextricably linked” to the content-neutral reason of urban redevelopment. In the <em>Pap’s </em>matter, the government viewed the negative secondary effects as being caused by the erotic message of nude dancing; thus, it could not logically be stated that an ordinance designed to combat negative secondary effects was distinct from suppressing the erotic message of the dance. Here, we have no such link. Similarly, <em>Pap’s II </em>alternative “complete ban” analysis is not implicated in this case because the URA’s taking of Appellant’s property does not resemble the regulation in <em>Pap’s II, </em>which effectuated a categorical ban on public nudity and thus the expressive act of nude dancing.

Additionally, whereas in <em>Arcara </em>the activities that formed the basis of the governmental action (prostitution, lewdness, etc.) were unrelated to any expressive conduct, here, the basis for the government’s action relative to the Theatre is centered on controlling the speech itself. Thus, while the URA may legitimately desire to enhance the economic and social conditions extant in the neighborhood, it is the content of the speech that concerns the URA in light of its judgment that, unless such speech is altered in conformance with its overall plan, the economic goals in question will not come to fruition.

As to reasonable alternative avenues of communication, neither the trial court nor the Commonwealth Court resolved whether Appellant could relocate the Theatre. The trial court likewise did not determine whether the type of speech at issue would be entirely eliminated in the City of Pittsburgh, while the Commonwealth Court stated that “reasonable alternatives of communication” would not be eliminated because the city has video booths for individual movie viewing as well as adult movie rental outlets. <em>See In re Condemnation by Urban Redevelopment Auth. of Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/a2d/823/1086-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="823 A.2d 1086" data-case-ids="9125502" data-case-paths="/a2d/823/1086-01">823 A.2d 1086</a>, 1096 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003) <em>(“URA </em>”).

For example, the Conditions Report that formed the basis for the revitalization plan noted that the presence of an adult theater adds to the “negative image” of the area. <em>See In re Condemnation by Urban Redevelopment Auth. of Pittsburgh, </em>No. GD 97-7170, <em>slip op. </em>at 3 (CCP Allegheny County, April 18, 2002).

Indeed, neither the Commonwealth Court nor the trial court indicated that the URA considered the feasibility of an alternative plan which would allow the Theatre to continue in its present usage, or otherwise showed that redevelopment could not be accomplished without acquisition of the property. Further, certain trial testimony indicates that the URA never considered such an alternative or sought the Theatre's participation in redevelopment activities. For instance, when a URA official was asked whether the URA had made "any effort at all to learn of anybody who would have redeveloped that block with the adult theater in place," he admitted that it had not. N.T. April 3, 2000, at 634. The same official stated that one reason the URA decided to condemn the Theatre was that it was not an economic generator in the neighborhood; he admitted, however, that the URA had not undertaken any efforts to assess the Theatre’s economic contributions. <em>See id. </em>at 476, <a href="/pa/571/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="138" data-cite="812 A.2d 591" data-case-ids="1070140,11367121" data-case-paths="/pa/571/0375-01,/a2d/812/0591-01">812 A.2d 591</a>.</p>
