Shenk read Appellant the criminal complaint and the affidavit of probable cause. Investigator Shenk explained to Appellant that since he was in custody, he would have to be informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Investigator Shenk then asked Appellant if he wanted to discuss the pending charges, and again stated he would have to give Appellant <em>Miranda </em>warnings since he was under arrest. In reply, Appellant stated, “Off the record, I can get you the gun back, but you have got to make a deal <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>with me.” N.T., Pre-trial hearing, 2/4/2004, at 41.

    <p id="b406-5" data-blocks='[["BL_406.4",406,[308,789,1165,793]]]'>The principles surrounding <em>Miranda </em>warnings are also well settled. The prosecution may not use statements stemming from a custodial interrogation of a defendant unless it demonstrates that he was apprised of his right against self-incrimination and his right to counsel. <em>Dejesus, </em><a href="/pa/567/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="787 A.2d 394" data-case-ids="404481,9454620" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0415-01,/a2d/787/0394-01">787 A.2d at 401</a>. Thus, <em>Miranda </em>warnings are necessary any time a defendant is subject to a custodial interrogation. As the United States Supreme Court explained, “the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent.” <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em><a href="/us/446/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="446 U.S. 291" data-case-ids="6182222" data-case-paths="/us/446/0291-01">446 U.S. 291</a>, <a href="/us/446/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="446 U.S. 291" data-case-ids="6182222" data-case-paths="/us/446/0291-01">100 S.Ct. 1682</a>, <a href="/us/446/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="446 U.S. 291" data-case-ids="6182222" data-case-paths="/us/446/0291-01">64 L.Ed.2d 297</a> (1980). Moreover, in evaluating whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings were necessary, a court must consider the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/537/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="537 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="775574" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0001-01">537 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/pa/537/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="640 A.2d 1251" data-case-ids="775574,7872109" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0001-01,/a2d/640/1251-01">640 A.2d 1251</a>, 1259 (1994).</p>
    <p id="b406-6" data-blocks='[["BL_406.5",406,[308,1617,1164,525]]]'>In conducting the inquiry, we must also keep in mind that not every statement made by an individual during a police encounter amounts to an interrogation. Volunteered or spontaneous utterances by an individual are admissible even without <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Baez, </em><a href="/pa/554/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="554 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="765941" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0066-01">554 Pa. 66</a>, <a href="/a2d/720/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="720 A.2d 711" data-case-ids="11806067,765941" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0711-01,/pa/554/0066-01">720 A.2d 711</a>, 720 (1998).

    <blockquote id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[351,764,1122,1168]]]'>[T]he <em>Miranda </em>safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent. That is to say, the term “interrogation” under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect. The latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police. This focus reflects the fact that the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody with an added measure of protection against coercive police practices, without regard to objective proof of the underlying intent of the police. A practice that the police should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect thus amounts to interrogation. But, since the police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they <em>should have known </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.</blockquote>

Accordingly, the High Court announced a supposed objective test, rather than a subjective test, for the “functional equivalent” of express questioning— <em>i.e., </em>whether the police <em>should have known </em>that their conduct was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.

    <p id="b411-5" data-blocks='[["BL_411.4",411,[155,599,1160,1777]]]'>In reaching the ultimate conclusion that Investigator Shenk breached appellant’s constitutional rights by not providing him <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to the imputed interrogation that produced the incriminating statement, the Majority relies on unsupported and irrelevant speculations. First, the Majority asserts that, because Investigator Shenk informed appellant on two occasions that he would have to give him <em>Miranda </em>warnings because he was in custody, this is clear evidence that Investigator Shenk believed that he was interrogating appellant. Maj. at 182, 912 A.2d at 256 (“Clearly, Investigator Shenk was aware that he needed to give Appellant <em>Miranda </em>warnings before Appellant said anything, indicating his belief that Appellant was subject to an interrogation.”). The Majority’s subjective determination that Investigator Shenk “clearly” believed that he was conducting an interrogation of appellant is not supported by any fact-finding below and, in any event, any would-be appellate “fact-finding” along these lines is irrelevant under <em>Innis/DeJesus. </em>Similarly, the Majority asserts that “the totality of the circumstances indicates that Investigator Shenk <em>almost certainly knew </em>that his conduct was likely to evoke a response from Appellant based upon his repeated acknowledgements that he would have to give Appellant <em>Miranda </em>warnings.” <em>Id. </em>at 182, 912 A.2d at 256 (emphasis added). Again, this is both pure speculation and irrelevant under <em>Innis/DeJesus. </em>We have no idea of just what the Investigator knew as there is no evidence of record pertinent thereto. What is at issue is what the <em>Innis </em>fiction requires us to attribute to the officer. And, on that question, I join Justice Eakin’s dissent. As noted above, the definition of “the functional equivalent of express questioning” as announced by the <em>Innis </em>Court is whether the police should have known that their conduct was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response; “almost certainly knew” is not the proper standard.</p>

In that case, the police arrested DeJesus and took him to a police administration building where he was placed in an interview room. There, over about a three-hour period, a detective informed him of the charges against him and told him that others also charged with the crimes made statements incriminating him. <em>DeJesus, </em>at 400-01. DeJesus then made an incriminating statement without <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Id., </em>at 401. This Court determined that when the detective informed DeJesus he had been implicated in the shootings and told him of the content of the co-conspirators’ statements concerning his involvement, the detective should have known his comments were reasonably likely to evoke a defensive response from DeJesus in which he would have provided his own version of his involvement in the case. <em>See id., </em>at 403. Thus, providing DeJesus with the implicative statements of the co-conspirators was found to rise to the level of an interrogation, and the detective should have provided <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Id., </em>at 404.</p>

The facts of the instant case share similarities with <em>DeJesus. </em>Here, Investigator Shenk did not provide appellant with <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and after informing appellant of the charges against him, he proceeded to read the affidavit of probable cause, which contained the incriminating statement by Burns.</p>

Further, after Investigator Shenk read the complaint and affidavit, he explained that, since appellant was in custody, he would have to read appellant his <em>Miranda, </em>rights. Investigator Shenk then merely asked appellant if he wanted to discuss the charges, and again stated he would give appellant <em>Miranda </em>warnings before discussing it further.

Learning the obvious fact that you are under arrest because the victim accuses you is qualitatively different than learning your co-conspirators are shifting blame to you. Unlike <em>Dejesus, </em>appellant did not make his incriminating statement in immediate response to learning Burns incriminated him; appellant made the response after Investigator Shenk informed him he was in custody and asked if he wanted to discuss the charges; if so, he would have to receive his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. This is not conduct that this Court should condemn as unconstitutional. Reading the charging documents, copies of which must be given to the accused anyhow, does not comprise interrogation.
