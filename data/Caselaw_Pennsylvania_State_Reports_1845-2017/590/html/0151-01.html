Carl Kohl, a landowner (“Landowner”), and PNC Bank (“Bank”), which eventually became Landowner’s tenant, to consider the test applied by the Superior Court in its determination that Landowner did not breach the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by pursuing litigation against Bank. The Superior Court concluded that “a suit by a landlord which substantially impairs a tenant’s possessory interest in a leasehold, brought in bad faith, maliciously, or otherwise without probable cause and primarily for a purpose unrelated to seeking legal redress, constitutes a breach of the landlord’s <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>covenant of quiet enjoyment.” <em>Kohl v.

Applying that test to the instant case and concluding that the record did not support the trial court’s determination of a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, the Superior Court reversed the judgment entered in favor of Bank and remanded for entry of judgment in favor of Landowner and assessment of damages. After review, we adopt the test espoused by the Superior Court but reverse the court’s holding that the record did not support the determination of a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment based on bad faith litigation. Instead, we remand to the trial court to allow the parties to develop the record regarding the issue of bad faith litigation and for further proceedings based upon the trial court’s determination of that issue.</p>

(1993 Litigation) The case turned on whether Landowner’s default judgment against the Lessees was valid despite Landowner’s failure to join Bank. If the Lessees’ failure to pay taxes automatically terminated the lease prior to Bank’s taking possession, then Landowner did not have to join Bank because Bank could never have taken possession of the land.

In the new action, Landowner sought ejectment against Bank (and the Lessees) for continuously failing to pay taxes notwithstanding thirty days’ notice from Landowner, the declaration of bankruptcy by the Lessees, and abandonment of the property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The complaint also asserted breach of the contract for failure to pay taxes.

At the time of the trial in the 1998 Litigation, the property had not been leased for nearly seven years, had deteriorated, and had been vandalized. As a result, it allegedly had no rental value. Moreover, property taxes had not been paid since 1993, with a total delinquency in 2001 of $262,011. The property had been scheduled for a tax sale, but the property received no bids.

Consequently, the court found in favor of Landowner on the ejectment count. The court found in favor of Bank on the breach of contract claim (non-payment of taxes), concluding that Landowner “continually breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment of the premises by his persistent litigation which precluded [Bank] from marketing the property.” Trial Ct. Slip Op., 12/4/02, at 6-7. The court continued, “A <em>lis pendens </em>indexed against a commercial property is an- effective death knell. Therefore we decline to reward [Landowner] for his litigious interference with [Bank’s] equity by awarding damages for unpaid taxes.” <em>Id. </em>at 7.

In its opinion in response to the post-trial motions, the trial court noted that it found credible the testimony of Bank’s officer regarding the impact of the 1993 Litigation. The officer averred that no one “in their right mind” would consider purchasing either the property or the leasehold interest when the property was subject to a lawsuit that threatened to extinguish the mortgage and leasehold, effectively leaving Bank’s interest unsecured and consequently unmarketable. Tr. Ct. Slip. Op., 4/16/03, at 5 (citing Notes of Testimony (N.T.), 10/28/02, at 125-26). Moreover, the court “determined that banks are generally in the business of selling their interests in leaseholds, and the litigation impaired this right.” Trial Ct. Slip Op., 4/16/03, at 5. Although the court acknowledged that “the effect on the bank’s <em>physical </em>possession was slight,” it concluded that “the litigation paralyzed the bank’s <em>constructive </em>possession.” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Concluding that Landowner acted in bad faith, the court rejected Landowner’s assertion that he had a right to bring the litigation following the Bank’s failure to pay taxes and abandonment of the property:</p>

Also, the judgment of the Superior Court in prior litigation between the parties plainly states that [Landowner] was seeking declaratory judgment for a determination that [Bank’s] lease was void because it was terminated prior to the Bank’s succession. In view of the fact that the litigation was incessant, unrelated to the Bank’s performance, and virtually meritless, <em>we think it is reasonable to infer bad faith on the part of [Landowner] </em>and thus, a wrongful act.

Bank urges us to view the term broadly to include any litigation that is “wrong,” — i.e., any litigation seeking a remedy not supported by the lease or the factual situation. This interpretation fits prior cases considering actions by landowners resulting in structural alterations or other overt impediments to occupancy or enjoyment of the leased premises, where the inquiry need not reach the tenor of the conduct of the landowner. <em>See, e.g., Kelly, </em><a href="/citations/?q=94%20A.%201055" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="94 A. 1055">94 A. 1055</a>; <em>2401 Pennsylvania Ave. Corp., </em>489 A.2d at 739. Conversely, Landowner urges us to adopt the Superior Court’s test limiting the term to the subset of such cases, embodied by <em>Raker, </em>where a landowner pursues a “wrong” remedy with full knowledge of the litigation’s lack of merit merely to harass the tenant.</p>

The certified record in this case does not provide all the details relevant to the court's decision. While some documents included in the reproduced record suggest that Bank was not the party in possession at the time of the filing of the complaint and that Bank had notice of Lessee's default, there is no debate that Landowner failed to include bank as a party, which the trial court found to be required by paragraph H of the Nondisturbance and Attornment Agreement, set forth above.

Given the termination of the ground lease, the court determined that the property interest in the ground lease merged with Kohl's fee simple interest in a greater piece of property that consisted of nine acres and included the lesser area covered by the ground lease. On appeal to the Superior Court, Nations First contested the trial court’s conclusion that Kohl had a fee simple ownership interest in the whole property and the conclusion that Nations First could not recover any monies for improvements to the property. The Superior Court affirmed in an unpublished decision, 2040 E.D.A. 2005.

In brief, <em>Raker </em>involved a landowner who secured a mortgage from a third party bank prior to leasing a property to a tenant. Upon their inheritance of the property, the landowner’s heirs attempted to circumvent the lease and evict the tenant by acquiring the mortgage, foreclosing upon it while it remained in their father’s estate, buying the property at a sheriff's sale incident to the foreclosure, and then claiming their rights were paramount to those of the lessee based upon the mortgage’s priority in time. <em>Id. </em>at 19-20.</p>

As this appeal arises from a non-jury trial, "the Court is bound by the trial judge’s findings of fact unless those findings are not based on competent evidence.
