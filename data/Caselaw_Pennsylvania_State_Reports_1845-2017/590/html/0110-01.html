Loop noted that appellee had displayed an ongoing sexual interest in both of his minor victims while, at the same time, displaying no sexual interest in their mother; and that he threatened the younger child that he would harm her mother if she reported the assaults. Loop concluded that appellee had a mental abnormality or personality disorder, <em>ie., </em>pedophilia, as evidenced by his sustained sexual attraction to the child victims and his acting upon that attraction. With respect to the statutory question of predatory behavior, Loop noted that appellee appeared to maintain his relationship with the children in order to assault them sexually, which supported a finding of predatory behavior.</p>

Loop’s report and testimony also concluded that appellee met the profile for the mental abnormality of pedophilia. Loop also testified that appellee’s actions were predatory in nature in that he formed and maintained a relationship with the mother of the victims in order to maintain contact with and to exploit the children sexually, and appellee had ceased having sexual relations with the mother, preferring instead to assault the children. Loop testified that his opinions that appellee had a mental abnormality or personality disorder and had engaged in predatory behavior were rendered to a reasonable degree of professional certainty.

During cross-examination, Loop noted that one important factor in the SVP determination is the risk of re-offense and that appellee’s pedophilia was significant because “pedophilia is highly related to a risk to reoffend.” While acknowledging that treatment of pedophilia could reduce the risk of re-offense, Loop explained that it still would not make the offender less of a risk than the general population and that <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>“is why they’re at greater risk to reoffend.” N.T. 2/28/2002, 23.

In a published opinion, a divided panel found merit in appellee’s argument. The panel majority relied heavily upon the Superior Court’s <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Krouse, </em><a href="/a2d/799/0835-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="799 A.2d 835" data-case-ids="9415004" data-case-paths="/a2d/799/0835-01">799 A.2d 835</a> (Pa.Super.2002), which it characterized as follows. The Commonwealth’s expert in <em>Krouse </em>concluded that the defendant there had a personality disorder and was likely to reoffend, basing his opinion on published studies finding that persons who engaged in conduct similar to that of the defendant were likely to repeat it. The <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>
      <em>Krouse </em>court held that the expert’s finding of a personality disorder was flawed because he assumed certain facts which were not supported in the evidence, he did not meet with the defendant, the defense expert’s diagnostic tests did not indicate that the defendant had a personality disorder, and the evidence did not support the Commonwealth expert’s conclusion that the defendant had engaged in “grooming behavior,” <em>ie., </em>establishing a relationship with the child for the purpose of sexually exploiting him. In addition to finding a lack of evidentiary support for the Commonwealth expert’s SVP finding, the <em>Krouse </em>court noted its belief that some of the statutory factors “weighed against” a finding that the defendant was an SVP, particularly that the offense did not involve multiple victims or force or cruelty, it was the defendant’s first sexual offense, the offense did not involve alcohol or illicit drugs, and there was no evidence in the record of prior mental health problems or deviant sexual behavior. <em>Commonwealth v.

Nevertheless, the majority ultimately concluded that the Commonwealth’s case “suffers from many of the same deficiencies specified in <em>Krouse.” </em>First, the majority opined that many of the Section 9795.4 factors “weighed against” an SVP determination, citing the trial court’s findings that appellee had no history of committing sexual offenses, he had not acted in an unusually cruel manner, he did not exceed “the means necessary to commit the offenses” and he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the offenses. The majority also questioned the strength of Mr. Loop’s “diagnosis of pedophilia” which, in the majority’s view, “seem[ed] based entirely on the age of the victims.” Citing <em>Krouse, </em>the majority opined: “SVP status does not automatically apply to persons who commit sexual offenses against children” and that, if it did, it would amount to an “unconstitutional presumption.” After repeating its view that “many of the § 9795.4 factors weigh <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>against SVP status in this case,” the majority concluded that the Commonwealth failed to “meet its burden of proof as set forth in <em>Krouse. </em>” <em>Meals, </em><a href="/a2d/842/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="842 A.2d 448" data-case-ids="9287099" data-case-paths="/a2d/842/0448-01">842 A.2d at 453-54</a>.

The Commonwealth also argues that the majority’s reliance on <em>Krouse </em>was misplaced because, in that case, the trial court failed to articulate specific findings of fact on the record, a circumstance which led the <em>Krouse </em>court to hold that its review was not limited to a determination of whether the sentencing court’s factual findings were supported by the record, but instead, its review encompassed the entire record.

Where the sentencing court provides such specific factual findings, the Commonwealth argues, an appellate court cannot second-guess the conclusions of the expert witness whose testimony was accepted below.

Appellee argues that this statement, coupled with the evidence that appellee sexually assaulted one of the girls for two months in 1999 and the other in August of 2000, but with no evidence of any assaults in the nine intervening months, does not support a finding of pedophilia. Appellee also argues that the trial court’s analysis was deficient because it considered only those factors weighing in favor of SVP status, and failed to weigh countervailing factors. Thus, in appellee’s view, the Superior Court properly concluded that the Commonwealth’s evidence was deficient.

The basis for the majority’s dismissal of the expert’s diagnosis is flawed as a matter of fact and as a matter of law. As a matter of fact, Loop cited to more than the age of the victims in support of his opinion that appellee was a pedophile; he stressed also that multiple child victims were involved and that the offenses were committed over a period of time.. The facts fully supported these points. The majority’s discounting of the finding of pedophilia is also troubling because it ignores that Loop’s expert opinion — that, to a reasonable degree of professional certainty, appellee was a pedophile — itself was evidence. To the extent appellee felt that the expert’s “diagnosis” was not fully explained, did not square with accepted analyses of the disorder, or was simply erroneous, he certainly was free to introduce evidence to that effect and/or to argue to the factfinder that the Commonwealth’s expert’s conclusions should be discounted or ignored.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> But that argument would affect the weight, and not the sufficiency, of the expert’s evidence. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

The majority justified its added burden by stating that an “unconstitutional presumption” of SVP status otherwise would arise. But, this conclusion is flawed for two reasons. First, the conclusion misconstrues the operation of the statute. The statute: (a) affords the Commonwealth no presumption, but instead places a burden upon it to prove SVP status to the trial court by clear and convincing evidence; (b) allows the defense to challenge the Commonwealth’s evidence and to present its own evidence; and (c) permits the trial court to reject the Commonwealth’s evidence. Second, proof of a mental abnormality or personality disorder is not sufficient in itself to prove SVP status, much less a presumption of SVP status. Instead, there must also be proof concerning predatory behavior. Thus, in addition to improperly “weighing” “absent” statutory factors against those found by the trial court to upset an SVP determination, the panel majority erred in diminishing the effect of the evidence produced by the Commonwealth and relied upon by the trial court, by insisting upon a higher standard not required by the statute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

However, Loop did not specifically state that he relied upon the manual in making his assessment in this case and, as appellee accurately notes, the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia listed in the DSM-IV were not referred to in the record below. We need not decide, and hence do not decide, the relevance of the DSM-IV criteria in determining the required proof, or sufficiency of proof, of a diagnosis of pedophilia in determining SVP status. <em>But cf.
