Appellant claims that the prosecutor withheld evidence that appellant could have used to impeach Mr. Burton at trial and he disputes the Commonwealth’s argument that Mr. Burton had no motive to lie. First, appellant alleges that Mr. Burton had a 1992 drug conviction under his alias, John Smith, and was sentenced to one year of probation. Appellant asserts that this sentence had not been completed at the time of trial and, as a result of the non-disclosure, appellant was unaware that Mr. Burton had a potential motive to testify favorably for the Commonwealth. Moreover, appellant asserts that he should have been informed that Mr. Burton had an unregistered weapon on the night of the murder, that he was never prosecuted for carrying that weapon, that he did not supply his business records to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and that he was in the United States illegally.

While the Commonwealth does not specifically respond to appellant’s allegation that appellant should have been told of Mr. Burton’s 1992 conviction under an alias, it argues that the jury probably did not believe a drug dealer such as Mr. Burton would file his taxes or register his firearm. The PCRA court found that appellant did not demonstrate that the Commonwealth knew of Mr. Burton’s drug conviction under his alias and could not <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>be responsible for producing an INS file that had not yet been created.</p>

As to Mr. Burton’s immigration status, appellant offers an INS record from 2000, which would not have been available at trial given that it was made five years after appellant was found guilty. <em>See </em>INS Record of Ramon Burton. Any immigration records that existed in 1995 for Mr. Burton were not in the exclusive possession of the prosecution. Respecting Mr. Burton’s drug conviction, under an alias, appellant has not shown that the Commonwealth knew of that conviction, or that it was in a better position than he to uncover it. Instantly, appellant has not demonstrated that any of the evidence of purported impeachment material on Mr. Burton was in the exclusive knowledge and possession of the Commonwealth. Equally importantly, he has not shown that the outcome of the trial would have differed if only this mere impeachment material had been introduced.

On cross-examination, the prosecutor attempted several times to question Mr. Powell about his motives for interjecting his opinion on Ms. Beverly’s sobriety, but Mr. Powell once answered “[bjecause she was high” and then responded “[t]hat was in my mind.” <em>Id. </em>at 12. Given this context, respecting the first set of questioning appellant cites, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in seeking a more pointed explanation for Mr. Powell.</p>

The trial court’s intervention ended this line of unproductive questioning, but also made it clear to the jury that the police did not simply arrest everyone at the scene. Moreover, appellant’s accusations that the trial court wanted to help the prosecution are belied by the court’s admonishments of the prosecutor.

For instance, Mr. Powell’s prior uninterrupted answer included the following statements: “giving me feedback, feedback, crazy questions.

Respectfully, the analysis is not so certain, as the concurrence would have it, to second-guess counsel, <em>Christy </em>was decided by a six-Justice court, with only three Justices joining the majority opinion. Additionally, as the concurrence recognizes, the issue in <em>Christy </em>was whether the rule announced in <em>Simmons </em>applied retroactively, and not the extent to which <em>Simmons </em>established grounds to object to various aspects of a prosecutor's penalty phase argument.</p>

Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court itself recognized the'difficulty in ascertaining the reach of <em>Simmons </em>three years after it was decided: “[t]he array of views expressed in <em>Simmons </em>itself suggests that the rule announced there was, in light of this Court’s precedent, 'susceptible to debate among reasonable minds.'” <em>O’Dell v.

If no reasonable attorney at the time of appellant's trial would have acquiesced to argument concerning the (d)(9) aggravator on the ground that it raised an inference of future dangerousness, as the concurrence suggests, then one must conclude that the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Kelly </em>was superfluous.</p>

Nevertheless, I fail to see how prejudice necessarily resulted from trial counsel’s failure to request the instruction in this case.

      <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 592, 913 A.2d at 273. To the contrary, <em>May </em>was not a case that addressed the question before us in the instant matter, because the Appellant in <em>May </em>failed to challenge, or even identify, specific language used by the prosecutor that placed his future dangerousness at issue. We held that no <em>Simmons </em>
      <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>instruction was required. Stated otherwise, although we rejected the “future dangerousness” argument in <em>May </em>as “meritless,” that determination resulted from the legal argument presented in that case. May contended that simply arguing the aggravating circumstance of a significant history of violent felony convictions necessarily injected future dangerousness of a criminal defendant into the case. <em>Id. </em>at 291, 710 A.2d at 47. We did not hold, nor infer, however, that language used while arguing that specific aggravating factor could never amount to placing a defendant’s future dangerousness at issue. Thus, <em>May </em>is not dispositive of the matter <em>sub judice. </em>If that were the case, a prosecutor could essentially place future dangerousness at issue, but couch it in an argument pertaining to his history of felony convictions, and do so with impunity. <em>May </em>requires no such result.</p>

The use of the phrase, “[w]e are not going to let anymore people be injured,” coupled with an argument regarding Appellant’s prior, felonies can only be interpreted to mean that Appellant has committed violent felonies in the past, and unless he is executed, he will continue to commit violent felonies. Together with the use of the words “enough is enough,” and “... you had your chance,” the undeniable effect of the prosecutor’s closing argument was to place Appellant’s future dangerousness before the sentencing jury. While the prosecutor did not specifically state that Appellant would be a danger if he was not executed, such language is not required to warrant the instruction. <em>See Commonwealth v.

South Carolina, </em><a href="/us/532/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="462" data-cite="532 U.S. 36" data-case-ids="9300632" data-case-paths="/us/532/0036-01">532 U.S. 36</a>, 49 n. 4, <a href="/us/532/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="463" data-cite="532 U.S. 36" data-case-ids="9300632" data-case-paths="/us/532/0036-01">121 S.Ct. 1263</a>, 1271 n. 4, <a href="/us/532/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="464" data-cite="532 U.S. 36" data-case-ids="9300632" data-case-paths="/us/532/0036-01">149 L.Ed.2d 178</a> (2001). Pennsylvania’s status remains unchanged. Lastly, it is not <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>only reasonable, but also likely, that whether a capital defendant will be released on parole if given life imprisonment will enter into the minds of deliberating juries. I see no reason to hide the fact that life imprisonment, in Pennsylvania, means life without parole. I cannot accept the premise that the prosecution would be prejudiced by this simple, relevant truth. Hiding the truth is antithetical to our system of justice. This is of the utmost concern in capital cases.</p>

Notably, Appellant’s post-conviction evidentiary proffer includes a declaration from his trial counsel indicating that counsel failed to attempt to locate a material witness and to pursue available avenues for impeachment of the testimony of critical Commonwealth witnesses. In his declaration, counsel further indicates that he had no strategic or tactical reasons for such failures. In light of such a proffer, it is my position that it is appropriate for the PCRA court, in the first instance, to hear the relevant testimony and issue appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law on a developed record.</p>

Further, relative to these fact-sensitive inquiries, I believe that a fact-finder (here, the PCRA court) should determine which, if any, of the instances of asserted ineffectiveness are true in light of the post-conviction evidence before the collective impact of any deficient stewardship upon the fairness of the trial proceedings can be reasonably evaluated.</p>
