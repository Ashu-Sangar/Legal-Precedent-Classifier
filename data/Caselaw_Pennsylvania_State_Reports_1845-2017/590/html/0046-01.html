Testimony revealed that Decedent was apprehensive about driving this type of truck, but nonetheless, he took the assignment. While Trumbull contends that Decedent drove off the road to avoid an on-coming grader despite having sufficient room to pass, Plaintiff asserts that the haul road collapsed because of the instability in the hill caused by coal seams.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Alternatively, Plaintiff alleged that the <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>haul road did not comply with necessary safety measures given, <em>inter alia, </em>an insufficient berm, the width and grade of the road, and the icy weather conditions.

Plaintiff alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that PTC, as owner of the worksite, breached its common law duty to make the premises reasonably safe for the employees of the contractors, to furnish a work area free of recognized and observable hazards, to take necessary action to support and stabilize the haul road, and to require that the haul road be constructed, graded, maintained, and inspected properly. Plaintiff specifically alleged that the haul road should have been equipped with various safety features such as flaggers to direct traffic, barricades, or radio contact for the truck drivers.

While the theories underlying the alleged duty tend to overlap and blend in the parties’ arguments and the lower courts’ discussions, we nonetheless distill three potential bases for the duty asserted by Plaintiff. For ease of discussion, we refer to each theory by reference to the related section of the Restatement (Second) of Torts: (1) Section 343, Dangerous Conditions Known To or Discoverable By Possessor; (2) Section 414, Negligence in Exercising Control Retained By Employer; and (3) Sections 416 and 427, collectively referred to as the Peculiar Risk Doctrine.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Conversely, PTC argued that even a landowner not subject to sovereign immunity would be shielded from liability under established Pennsylvania law, which generally does not impose a duty on a landowner employing an independent contractor, absent certain exceptions.</p>

Without fully considering the first potential theory of duty related to Section 343 (Dangerous Conditions), the court concluded that Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that PTC retained the control over the job site necessary to establish a duty under Section 414 (Retention of Control). The court focused on the language of the contract between NESL and PTC, under which NESL agreed to assume responsibility for all injuries to its employees. Likewise, regarding the third potential source of duty pursuant to Section 416 or 427, the court concluded that the facts of the case, as a matter of law, <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>failed to establish the presence of a peculiar risk, where Decedent merely drove a dump truck on a haul road, a routine method of transporting material around a highway construction site.</p>

Although that court’s decision focused primarily on issues relating to Trumbull, the Commonwealth Court briefly addressed the merits of PTC’s motion for summary judgment. While the court concluded that Plaintiff stated a claim of injury due to a “defective condition of the land” sufficient to satisfy the requirement for the real estate exception to sovereign immunity under subsection (b)(4) of Section 8522,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> it did not specifically address Plaintiffs argument regarding dangerous conditions in the land in relation to subsection (a), where Plaintiff asserted that a common law cause of action could arise from a breach of a duty to protect Decedent from a non-obvious dangerous condition inherent in the land, <em>see </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts § 343. Instead, the court determined that Plaintiff satisfied Section 8522(a) by demonstrating that it exerted sufficient control over the worksite, after considering caselaw related to Section 414. The court based its finding of sufficient control on a safety videotape shown to workers, <em>see infra </em>at 14 n. 11, and PTC’s appointment of on-site safety inspectors. Additionally, the court concluded that PTC “was charged with the same degree of control as Trumbull exercised,” because Trumbull was PTC’s “agent” in performing safety checks.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Based on the factual issue of control pursuant <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>to Plaintiffs Section 414 (Retention of Control) claim, the Commonwealth Court reversed the trial court’s grant of summary judgment to PTC, concluding that Plaintiff avoided the application of sovereign immunity.</p>

We address the parties’ arguments on the potential application of each assertion of duty of a non-Commonwealth landowner to an employee of an independent contractor under the facts of this case, keeping in mind that our finding of an applicable duty would allow Plaintiff to assert a common law cause of action in negligence necessary to satisfy Section 8522(a)’s requirements for an exception to sovereign immunity, and thus prevent a grant of summary judgment in favor of PTC.</p>

Deposition testimony, at least for purposes of summary judgment, can be read to support Plaintiffs position that the area contained coal seams, which she alleges could have caused the haul road to collapse given that coal seams provide insufficient support for roadways. Accordingly, Plaintiff argues that she would have a common-law cause of action sounding in negligence against a non-Commonwealth landowner based on its breach of a duty to protect Decedent from the inherent and non-obvious danger of the instability of the hillside upon which NESL built the haul road.</p>

Additionally, the duty to warn the contractor, according to PTC, is only triggered if the owner has superior knowledge to the contractor regarding the relevant danger or risk. In this ease, PTC argues that NESL was well aware of the danger presented by the alleged coal seams because it was the party responsible for excavating the seams adjacent to the haul road.

These cases consider whether and to what extent the owner or general contractor has delegated responsibility for the work on the property to a subcontractor. In contrast, the case at bar does not involve the delegation of responsibility from Trumbull to NESL, but rather the assumption of responsibilities. Trumbull and NESL did not have a contractual relationship; instead, each had contractual obligations to PTC.

Indeed, the dissenting justices in <em>Marshall </em>would have found a duty to protect third parties from negligent performance of the applicable contract in <em>Marshall, </em>despite the firm’s passive safety duties.</p>

      <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>Accordingly, we reject Trumbull’s suggestion that Section 324A cannot apply to negligent performance of a contractual inspection obligation because it would require this Court to overturn the longstanding precedent in <em>Otis Elevator. </em>Moreover, the plain language of Section 324A merely requires an undertaking to “render services to another,” which we find to encompass the rendering of inspection services. As in <em>Otis Elevator, </em>we conclude that it was foreseeable that a failure to perform properly the active safety role assumed by Trumbull under its contract with PTC could result in injuries to the workers on the site. Accordingly, we hold that Trumbull owed a duty to perform its safety obligations under its contract with PTC so as not to injure Decedent.</p>

As these issues are obviously not appropriate for summary judgment, we affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court reversing the trial court’s grant of summary judgment to Trumbull, and remand to the trial court for further proceedings. As stated above, we reverse the Commonwealth Court as to PTC’s motion for summary judgment and reinstate that portion of the trial court’s order.</p>

The Court specifically declined to hear issues relating to proximate cause and whether the real estate exception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(b)(4), would apply to PTC. We nevertheless acknowledge that the language of Section 8522 presents some conceptual questions. Generally, sovereign immunity provides a bar against the assertion of any claim, thus preventing courts from reaching issues of duty or liability. However, Section 8522(a) grants an exception to sovereign immunity when “damages would be recoverable under the common law ... if the injury were caused by a person not having available the defense of sovereign immunity.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(a). Thus, the statute invokes questions of duty and liability inherent in any question of recovery of damages under common law <em>prior </em>to a determination of the application of sovereign immunity. However, given the holdings of the courts below and the arguments of the parties on the issues granted review, we decline to speak to the mechanics of Section 8522. Instead, we limit our discussion of the procedural history and our analysis to the issues granted.</p>

As the parties discussed the issue ably, we recognize that the true question raised is whether Plaintiff has presented a cause of action against PTC with regard to either obvious or non-obvious dangers, sufficient to meet the requirements for exemption to sovereign immunity set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(a). <em>See infra </em>at 7.</p>

(b). Therefore, I believe that Appellee succeeded in overcoming the general presumption against a duty on the part of a landowner toward the employees of a general contractor. Accordingly, I would hold that the Commonwealth Court did not err in reversing the determination of the trial court that PTC did not owe Decedent and other NESL employees a duty to ensure their safety while traveling upon the haul roads located on the Section 52H construction site.</p>

      <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>As for Part II of the Majority Opinion, I agree that Appellee has met her burden of showing that Trumbull owed Decedent a duty of care to protect him and other NESL employees from harm on the haul roads upon which they drove. When viewed in the light most favorable to Appellee as the non-moving party, the evidence <em>sub judice </em>compels the conclusion that Trumbull undertook to inspect the haul roads. Pursuant to the Trumbull-PTC Agreement, Trumbull specifically agreed to “monitor the contractors’ compliance with O.S.H.A. and other applicable regulations at all work operations.” (R.R. at 259a.) The haul roads were subject to these inspections. (R.R. at 503a.)</p>
    <p id="b312-4" data-blocks='[["BL_312.4",312,[312,984,1165,1274]]]'>Moreover, I join the Majority in “declining] to provide a rigid definition of a construction manager or impose a correspondingly static duty on all construction managers.” (Majority at 76, 911 A.2d at 1282.) In doing so, I recognize that, in granting allowance of appeal with respect to the instant claim, we framed the issue broadly in terms of the scope of a construction manager’s duty toward the employee of a contractor. The Brief of Appellants, however, is essentially fact-dependent and fails to present a colorable argument in support of the recognition of a special rule applicable to the duties of construction managers. <em>(See </em>Brief of Appellants at 17 (“This case calls for a review of the role of a construction manager. Construction management has been defined as the process of professional management applied to a construction program from conception to completion for the purpose of controlling time, costs and quality.... This description of the role of a construction manager is consistent with the facts of this case as they relate to the relationship between [PTC] and Trumbull.”) (internal quotation marks and internal citations omitted).) In the absence of such an argument, we must assume that a construction manager’s duty, like that of any other construction professional, arises from its contract; therefore, the Majority properly declines to impose a special rule with respect thereto.</p>

Ultimately, the majority holds that no duty of care is placed on the owner relative to the independent contractor’s employees, so long as the owner does not assume control of the work. <em>See id. </em>at 64-65, 911 A.2d at 1275. For public policy reasons, the majority further indicates that the retention of a construction manager and/or the monitoring of construction-site safety does not represent an assertion of control such as would support the imposition of a duty of care running to third parties. <em>See id. </em>As noted, I support the majority’s reasoning and holding in these regards.</p>
    <p id="b313-7" data-blocks='[["BL_313.8",313,[153,1571,1155,522]]]'>The majority’s approach, however, takes a different turn with respect to the owner’s delegated entitlement to coordinate and monitor work performance and safety at a construction site when considering the obligations of its construction manager. In a number of respects the majority suggests that, by acting as the owner’s representative in this sort of coordination and monitoring, a construction manager is invested with a duty to third-party employees of an independent contractor that was not owed by the owner in the first instance. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 76, 911 A.2d at 1282.</p>

Particularly given the sophisticated nature of <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>modern, large-scale construction, owners reasonably should be permitted to delegate their entitlement to coordinate and monitor various aspects of the work among multiple contractors and facilitate overall safety without creating new duties in their representatives. Further, I believe that this should hold true so long as no actual control is assumed over the methods of work and/or operative details beyond that which is inherent in coordination, compliance monitoring, and advancing overall safety consistent with the obligations of the independent contractors that are otherwise in force. As Appellants highlight, such an approach would be in line with that of a number of other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., Buccini v. 1568 Broadway Assoc., </em><a href="/ad2d/250/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="250 A.D.2d 466" data-case-ids="721815" data-case-paths="/ad2d/250/0466-01">250 A.D.2d 466</a>, <a href="/ad2d/250/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="250 A.D.2d 466" data-case-ids="721815" data-case-paths="/ad2d/250/0466-01">673 N.Y.S.2d 398</a>, 401 (N.Y.App.Div.1998) (affirming an award of summary judgment in favor of a construction manager and stating that “[t]he general duty to supervise the work and ensure compliance with safety regulations does not amount to supervision and control of the worksite such that the supervisory entity would be liable for the negligence of the contractor who performs the day-to-day operations” (citation omitted)).</p>

Rather, I regard them as consistent with an owner’s residual prerogatives relative to its property, particularly where, as here, the independent contractor in control of the work has accepted full responsibility for job-site safety.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Again, since I do not believe that these <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>activities would create duties in the owner running to third parties, it is my position that they should also not be deemed to create such obligations in the owner’s representative retained to accomplish them.</p>
