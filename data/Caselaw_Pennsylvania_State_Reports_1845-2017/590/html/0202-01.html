He demanded that Wright stop selling drugs in that location and took $200.00 from Wright. Williams later spoke with Isaiah Givens (“Givens”), who assured Williams that there would be no acts of reprisal from himself, Jones, or Portie Robertson <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>(“Robertson”). Nevertheless, on the following day, Jones, accompanied by Givens and Robertson, entered the courtyard; each of the three men then began to fire their weapons at Williams who was near the steps of a building that fronted the courtyard. In total, the perpetrators fired approximately twenty shots towards Williams. Numerous people were also in the courtyard; two of them were killed by the gunshots,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and six others were seriously wounded.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Williams was not hit.

This argument fails. The very purpose of the transferred intent instruction is to permit appropriate inferences of malice and specific intent to flow to an unintended victim. Thus, the only question before us is whether the inference described by the trial court in the instant case met the requirements of due process. The trial court specifically stated that the jurors “may” draw an inference and that an intent to kill “may” be transferred. The instructions clearly permitted the jury to reach these conclusions, but nothing in the language used demanded or in any other way required the jury to make this finding. The instructions, therefore, were proper because they were in the nature of a “permissive inference.”</p>

Majority Opinion at 217, 912 A.2d at 277. Indeed, <em>Collins </em>determined that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised on post-conviction review by their very nature are to be treated as distinct from underlying claims raised on direct appeal. <em>See Collins, </em><a href="/pa/585/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="198" data-cite="585 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="2471490" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0045-01">585 Pa. at 61</a>, <a href="/pa/585/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="199" data-cite="888 A.2d 564" data-case-ids="2471490,8997420" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0045-01,/a2d/888/0564-01">888 A.2d at 573</a>. There is no indication in <em>Collins </em>that, with respect to such distinct claims, post-conviction petitioners are required to attack the Court’s reasoning and/or holding on direct appeal. For example, it seems to me that a claim that appellate counsel’s performance in presenting an issue impeded or foreclosed a favorable disposition of a meritorious claim would be wholly cognizable upon post-conviction review under <em>Collins </em>as it is written, but would not be under the new interpretation of that decision that the majority advances here.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Further, concerning the majority’s discussion of waiver, I cross-reference my comments from <em>Commonwealth v.

In the first instance, I recognize Appellant’s argument that, given the Commonwealth’s reliance <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>on a theory of transferred <em>intent </em>— i.e., that a specific intention to kill others can be transferred to the killing of unintended victims — the usual instruction concerning circumstantial evidence of specific intent arising from the use of a deadly weapon on vital parts of the victims’ bodies lacked any rational underpinning in the case. However, although the Commonwealth certainly advanced transferred intent as a theory to explain the killings, the prosecutor also argued, in the alternative, that the killings of the victims was the intended result. <em>See </em>N.T., at 5852 (reflecting the district attorney’s argument that “it is our contention that the [killings were] willful, deliberate, and premeditated, in that there was a time to select the weapon, there was a time chosen to do the deed, and there was an opportunity to decide what portion of the body to use the gun on”); <em>see also id. </em>at 5854 (describing the killings as directed and “efficient” and arguing transferred intent in the alternative). Moreover, the relevant circumstantial-evidence instruction expressly authorized a permissive, but did not require a mandatory, inference. <em>See id. </em>at 6028. Finally, in connection with this instruction, the jurors also were admonished as follows: “Note well that you are not to infer this intent to kill if the facts and circumstances indicate a contrary intent.” <em>Id. </em>When considering that direct and transferred intent theories were presented to the jury in the alternative by the trial court and the prosecutor, it is my position that there is no logical incongruity, and Appellant’s argument may be rejected for that reason.</p>

My esteemed colleague addressed this concern in <em>Gorby, </em>where the defendant’s trial occurred in 1985, and the PCRA court held appellate counsel was ineffective in 1990 for failing to raise trial counsel’s failure to present mitigating evidence:</p>
    <blockquote id="b479-5" data-blocks='[["BL_479.4",479,[204,614,1113,360]]]'>The law apparently is changing in this area, and what used to be viewed as reasonable attorney performance at trial is now labeled, in hindsight, unreasonable as a matter of law.

    <blockquote id="b479-7" data-blocks='[["BL_479.6",479,[201,1063,1114,681]]]'>Moreover, to prove counsel incompetent, in 1990, for failing to raise this sort of ineffectiveness claim, one must consult the <em>then-existing </em>legal landscape. The fact that later decisions of this Court and the U.S. Supreme Court have faulted the penalty phase investigations of certain trial lawyers, under certain facts, does not necessarily prove that all reasonable appellate lawyers were required to raise such claims in 1989-90, which is when appellant’s direct appeal was briefed and argued by counsel. In my view, appellant has not discharged his affirmative burden of rebutting the presumption that appellate counsel’s performance nearly two decades ago was reasonable under the law prevailing at the time.</blockquote>
