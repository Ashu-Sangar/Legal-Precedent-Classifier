When Wellons went inside, she discovered that her previously locked back door was open. As she investigated further, she found her second floor bedroom light was turned on and her wallet was lying on her bed with the money removed. Upon hearing noises on the third floor, she phoned the police and shouted up the stairs that she had done so. She then heard someone trying to break through her third floor bathroom window and she began to climb the stairs, when she saw appellant, her next-door neighbor, in the bathroom.

He also argues that his sentences merge under the test set forth in <em>Commonwealth v. Comer, </em><a href="/pa/552/0527-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="552 Pa. 527" data-case-ids="559332" data-case-paths="/pa/552/0527-01">552 Pa. 527</a>, <a href="/a2d/716/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="716 A.2d 593" data-case-ids="11702953,559332" data-case-paths="/a2d/716/0593-01,/pa/552/0527-01">716 A.2d 593</a> (1998), where this Court held that sentences should merge where one set of facts supports the elements of two offenses. Appellant acknowledges that it is reasonable for the Commonwealth to charge a defendant with both criminal trespass and burglary where the Commonwealth is uncertain it is able to prove a defendant’s intent to commit a crime at entry, but asserts that there is no logical justification for subjecting a defendant to multiple and consecutive terms of imprisonment when the act of burglary is proven at trial.</p>

      <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>The Commonwealth counters by arguing that merger is a question of legislative intent, and 42 Pa.C.S. § 9765 states that offenses merge only where “all of the statutory elements of one offense are included in the statutory elements of the other offense” and the crimes arise from a single criminal act. Moreover, the Commonwealth argues that this Court has consistently held that crimes do not merge unless they are lesser and greater included offenses. In the Commonwealth’s view, departures from that doctrine, notably in <em>Gatling, </em>are nonbinding <em>dicta. </em>The crimes that appellant was convicted of <em>sub judice </em>are not lesser and greater included offenses, according to the Commonwealth, because each crime includes an element that the other crime does not. Burglary requires the intent to commit a crime within a building at entry, while criminal trespass does not. Criminal trespass requires a breaking into a structure, while burglary requires only entry into a building. Therefore, the Commonwealth argues, it is possible to commit one offense without committing the other.</p>

LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure 576 (2d ed.1999). First, the “statutory elements test” limits a court to comparing the elements of the crimes, without reference to how the crimes were committed in a particular case, to determine whether in committing one offense the defendant has also committed a lesser offense. <em><a href="/a2d/716/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="716 A.2d 593" data-case-ids="11702953,559332" data-case-paths="/a2d/716/0593-01,/pa/552/0527-01">Id.</a> </em>The primary criticism of this test is that it is too inflexible, frequently ignoring the true nature of criminal conduct by excluding a lesser included offense; but the test is praised for its consistency which promotes judicial efficiency. <em>Id. </em>at 578. Second, the “cognate-pleadings” approach does not require that all of the elements of a lesser included offense be subsumed within the higher offense, and instead instructs a court to assess the relationship between crimes by looking at the pleadings in a case. <em>Id. </em>at 579-80. Third, the “evidentiary” approach allows a court to analyze the actual proof submitted at trial, rather than only the pleadings, to examine the relationship between the crimes committed. <em>Id. </em>at 581. Critics of this approach <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>complain that it leads to too many crimes being deemed lesser included offenses and places both parties at a disadvantage in preparing for trial, while proponents of the method counter that all of the prosecution’s proof is known from the start of a case. <em>Id. </em>at 583. As detailed below, this Court’s own analysis of lesser and greater included offenses has evolved over time, in the sentencing merger context, from a strict statutory elements test to a hybrid of both the statutory elements and cognate-pleadings approaches. This development perhaps corroborates Justice Holmes’ observation that, “[t]he life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.” Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., The Common Law 1 (1881).</p>

With Justice Roberts (later Chief Justice) writing for the majority, this Court reasoned that criminal trespass is not a lesser included offense of burglary because the statutory definition of criminal trespass has a scienter requirement absent from the definition of the more sevére offense.</p>

      <em> </em>Although that dissent is not binding, and <em>Carter </em>remains valid precedent for the due process issue there decided, it is significant that the dissent anticipated the more practical, hybrid approach that has emerged in Pennsylvania sentencing merger law, and it did so in a case involving burglary and criminal trespass, the crimes at issue here. Justice Pomeroy, who was joined by Justice O’Brien, would have held that criminal trespass is a lesser included offense of burglary. Justice Pomeroy stressed the factual realities of the Commonwealth’s prosecution in a case such as this one. The criminal trespass statute requires that a defendant have affirmative knowledge of his lack of privilege to enter a building, whereas a plain reading of the <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>burglary statute requires the Commonwealth to show volitional entry (with the intent to commit a crime) into a building and allows a defendant’s license or privilege to enter a building to operate as an affirmative defense to the crime. Justice Pomeroy viewed criminal trespass as a lesser included offense of burglary because the burden of production on the Commonwealth is functionally identical for each crime, as the Commonwealth must essentially prove entry without legal justification in each case. <em>Carter, </em><a href="/pa/482/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="482 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1749595" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0274-01">393 A.2d at 666</a>. Justice Pomeroy opined that, although the burglary statute suggests that privilege is an affirmative defense to the crime, as opposed to a mandatory element that the Commonwealth must prove to establish criminal trespass, the very availability of the defense necessarily requires any competent prosecutor to establish knowledge of lack of privilege in his case in chief to thwart a potential defense argument or evidence respecting license or privilege. <em><a href="/pa/482/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="482 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1749595" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0274-01">Id.</a> </em>Justice Pomeroy’s exploration of the practicalities and the interplay of these particular crimes is persuasive, particularly considering how merger analysis has evolved in this Court.</p>

This Court has evaluated whether crimes are lesser and greater included offenses in cases concerning sentencing merger, double jeopardy, and due process, but the concerns arising under due process are different from those attending the former two types of cases. The fact that this Court employs the same analysis in double jeopardy and sentencing merger cases is a function of the Double Jeopardy Clause’s prohibition that no person “shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb,” which protects against both successive punishments and successive prosecutions for the same offense. <em>United States v. Dixon, </em><a href="/citations/?q=509%20U.S.%20688" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="509 U.S. 688">509 U.S. 688</a>, 695-96, <a href="/citations/?q=113%20S.%20Ct.%202849" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="113 S.

The due process concern in <em>Carter, </em>in contrast, had to do with notice and fairness, <em>i.e., </em>whether a defendant could be convicted of a charge that he was not indicted on and, <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>therefore, had no notice to defend. <em>Carter, </em><a href="/pa/482/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="482 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1749595" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0274-01">393 A.2d at 661-62</a>. Where due process and notice are at issue, it is prudent to primarily focus the analysis on the statutory elements of a crime to determine whether crimes are lesser and greater included offenses because due process protects “an accused against any unfair advantage.” <em>Commonwealth v. Bryant, </em><a href="/pa/367/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="367 Pa. 135" data-case-ids="1228360" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0135-01">367 Pa. 135</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20A.2d%20193" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="79 A.2d 193">79 A.2d 193</a>, 198 (1951).

Subsection (i) of the criminal trespass statute makes mere entry into a building without privilege unlawful and subsection (ii) prohibits breaking into a building without privilege. 18 Pa.C.S. § 3503(a). The burglary stat<a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>ute, likewise, punishes unlicensed entry into a building to commit a crime therein where the defendant has gained access through both mere entry into a building and entry into a “separately secured” portion of a building, which implies a breaking. 18 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a). The Commonwealth charged appellant under both subsections (i) and (ii) of the criminal trespass statute, as well as generally under the burglary statute. When the trial court convicted appellant of criminal trespass, it did not make a specific finding respecting which section of the statute was violated and, therefore, it was possible for appellant to have been convicted under subsection (i), which does not require a defendant to break into a structure as separately defined under the statute. <em>See Anderson, </em><a href="/a2d/650/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="650 A.2d 20" data-case-ids="11311697,475550" data-case-paths="/a2d/650/0020-01,/pa/538/0574-01">650 A.2d at </a>24 n. 3. Although Ms. Wellons testified that appellant entered her home through a locked door, the Commonwealth alleged only that appellant entered her home in its criminal complaint. Therefore, since breaking into a structure is not always an indispensable element of criminal trespass, and the Commonwealth did not have to prove, and did not necessarily prove, that appellant broke into Ms. Wellons’s home in order to secure convictions of burglary and criminal trespass, the Commonwealth was not obligated to prove an additional breaking element to establish appellant’s conviction for criminal trespass. In any event, even if the Commonwealth could be said to have proved a breaking, in light of the reality that the very same narrow facts charged proved both crimes, we believe they must merge.</p>

However, I agree with Madame Justice Newman that the Legislature has now evinced an intent in Section 9765 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9765, to require a pure statutory elements approach to sentencing merger. Since, however, the enactment of Section 9765 postdates Appellant’s offenses in this case, I do not believe that it need necessarily be applied here. Thus, I am able to join in the result of the majority opinion.</p>
