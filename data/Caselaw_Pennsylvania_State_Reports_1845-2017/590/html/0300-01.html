Additionally, in a footnote, the common pleas court questioned whether any challenge to the procedure used in promulgating the ordinance was time-barred under Section 5571(c)(5) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 5571(c)(5), which prescribes, <em>inter alia, </em>that “questions relating to an alleged defect in the process of enactment or adoption of any ordinance ... shall be raised by appeal or challenge commenced within 30 days after the intended effective date of the ordinance[.]” Moreover, the court apparently interlineated its reservations concerning the timeliness of the Township’s challenge into its holding. <em>See Napp, </em>No. 04-0007, <em>slip op. </em>at 6 (“Based upon the legal authority referenced and discussed above, we conclude that the Township is <em>procedurally and </em>substantively precluded from challenging the validity of Ordinance 4-97 and, alternatively, precluded from abolishing the medical benefits due to Defendants.” (emphasis added)).</p>

The court grounded its reasoning on a passage of Section 606(c) of the Second Class Township Code which provides: “supervisors <em>while in office or while in the employ of the township </em>may be eligible for inclusion in township-paid insurance plans.” <em><a href="/a2d/874/1258-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="874 A.2d 1258" data-case-ids="8960989" data-case-paths="/a2d/874/1258-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/874/1258-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="874 A.2d 1258" data-case-ids="8960989" data-case-paths="/a2d/874/1258-01">at 1261</a> (quoting 53 P.S. § 65606(c)) (emphasis in original).

The Township counters that Section 606 was crafted carefully by the legislature to minimize the potential for, and impact of, conflicts of interests arising out of the decision making authority of municipal supervisors. More specifically, the Township believes that Section 606 protects against the circumstances that underlie this appeal, which it characterizes as an eve-of-retirement vote by self-interested Second Class Township supervisors to provide themselves with an unauthorized lifetime benefit.</p>
    <p id="b532-6" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[313,1306,1162,1052]],["BL_533.1",533,[150,321,1152,367]]]'>On review of Section 606, it is evident that the Township is correct that the statute was in fact designed to curtail decision making by local supervisors on matters affecting their own self-interest. In this regard, its provisions expressly limit the amount a supervisor may receive as compensation as established by ordinance, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 65606(a); shift the responsibility to determine the compensation of supervisors, when serving in other capacities as township employees, to the board of auditors, <em>see id.; </em>forbid supervisors from being compensated as employees for attending meetings of the board of supervisors, <em>see id.; </em>prescribe that any change in salary, compensation, or emoluments of the elected office become effective at the beginning of the next term of the supervisor, <em>see id.; </em>delineate specific parameters for supervisor participation in employee pension plans, including provisions requiring auditor approval, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 65606(b); and control supervisor participation in township-paid insurance plans, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 65606(c). In light of such provisions, the legislative intent to limit self-interested decision making by supervisors is, again, manifest. Therefore, although Appel<a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>lants are correct that no portion of Section 606 expressly forbids supervisors from receiving post-retirement medical insurance benefits in their capacity as former employees, we do not believe that this is wholly dispositive of the Township’s challenge. Rather, the Township more broadly has challenged the manner in which the benefits were authorized, by interested supervisors.</p>
    <p id="b533-5" data-blocks='[["BL_533.4",533,[149,732,1158,1170]]]'>In this regard, as noted, the common pleas court found that Section 606 permitted self-interested supervisors to confer post-retirement medical insurance benefits upon themselves under Section 606(c), which provides for the inclusion of supervisors within township-paid insurance plans. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 65606(c). As the Township emphasizes, however, Section 606(c) by its terms pertains only to the inclusion of supervisors in such plans “while in office or while in the employ of the township.” 53 P.S. § 65606(c); <em>accord Summers, </em>128 Pa.Cmwlth. at 523-24, <a href="/pa-commw/128/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="563 A.2d 1295" data-case-ids="1393426" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/128/0520-01">563 A.2d at 1296-97</a> (holding that the provision of life and health insurance coverage to <em>current </em>supervisor-employees did not require auditor approval). Indeed, Appellants’ argument to address this express limitation is that the passage is permissive but not restrictive, or, in other words, it allows for pre-retirement medical insurance benefits but does not curtail post-retirement benefits that might otherwise be conferred as a form of deferred compensation. Since, however, it is clear that Section 606(c) does not operate to control the conferral of post-retirement medical insurance benefits, contrary to the common pleas court’s reasoning, it cannot serve as a basis for relief from auditor involvement relative to such benefits.</p>

Certainly, Section 606 may contain some facial ambiguity in terms of just how post-retirement medical insurance benefits should be administered to the extent that they may be available as deferred compensation. For instance, Section 606(a)’s authorization for auditor-directed compensation to supervisors acting as employees is framed in terms of “hourly, daily, weekly, semi-monthly or monthly” payments, <em>see </em>53 P.S. 65606(a), and thus, one way to read the provision is to conclude that it is directed solely at wage determinations. However, in light of the overall design of the legislation as previously discussed, which specifically injects a requirement of auditor involvement into compensation and pension determinations, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 65606(a), (b), and removes such requirement only for certain insurance benefit allowances afforded to supervisors “while in office or while in the employ of the township,” 53 P.S. § 65606(c), it seems clear that the Legislature did not intend any decision involving <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>compensation (direct or deferred) to be relegated solely to supervisors benefiting from it.</p>

We also recognize that the Township did not specifically allege in its complaint the absence of auditor involvement as a basis for relief. Nevertheless, the Township did aver that the benefits were conferred by interested supervisors without statutory authorization, and we believe that this allegation is sufficient to subsume a possibility of relief based upon the understanding that the statute in fact relegates the final decision exclusively to other officials. <em>Cf.
