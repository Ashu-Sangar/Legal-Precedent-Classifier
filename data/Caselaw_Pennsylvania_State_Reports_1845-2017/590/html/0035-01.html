The deed of trust is the original agreement between the Hersheys, the Hershey Trust Company as Trustee, and the Managers of the Trust. The deed, as amended in 1976, provides that the Trust Company and the Board of Managers (which consists of members of the Board of Directors of the Trust Company), are to administer the Trust and have responsibility for all aspects of running the School and for managing the Trust’s assets. The deed also states, “[a]ll children shall leave the institution and cease to be the recipients of its benefits upon the completion of the full course of secondary education being offered at the School.” <em>In re Milton Hershey School, </em><a href="/a2d/867/0674-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="867 A.2d 674" data-case-ids="9027020" data-case-paths="/a2d/867/0674-01">867 A.2d 674</a>, 678 (Pa.Cmwlth. 2005) (quoting Deed of Trust, November 15, 1909, at 12-13).</p>

      <em>In re Francis Edward McGillick Foundation </em>is distinguishable from the instant case on one key point; the Hershey Trust does not provide the Association with any decision-making power or administration over it. The trust in <em>In re Francis Edward McGillick Foundation </em>specifically directed the Bishop and his advisors to select scholarship recipients that were funded through the trust; thus, the diocese was directly involved in the trust’s administration. Here, the Trust does not mention the Association and excludes those who would be members of the Association from benefiting from the Trust.</p>

There, the Washington Memorial Chapel sought to evict the Valley Forge Historical Society from its property. Dr. W.

The <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>Society sought declaratory and injunctive relief; the Chapel argued the Society lacked standing to bring its action.

      <em>Valley Forge Historical Society </em>is instructive, but distinguishable from the instant case. <em>Valley Forge </em>involved a settlor creating two foundations which shared the same building since 1918; we found a trust relationship existed. Here, the Hersheys created the Trust in 1909, but the Association was not created until 20 years later. If the Hersheys intended for the Association to have direct input on Trust affairs, they could have altered the Trust, but did not do so. The Trust has not been so amended.</p>

The Association is not mentioned in the Trust, and the bulk of the Association’s members are specifically excluded from receiving the benefits of the Trust. To give the Association “special interest” standing where the settlors of the Trust specifically denied beneficiary status to its members, would surely contravene the settlors’ intent expressed through their written trust. <em>See In re Milton Hershey School, </em>at 691 (Colins, P.J., dissenting).</p>

Nothing in this litigation would affect the Association itself; it loses nothing and gains nothing. The Association’s intensity of concern is real and commendable, but it is not a substitute for an actual interest.

The Trust did not contemplate the Association, or anyone else, to be a “shadow board” of graduates with standing to challenge actions the Board takes. <em>See In re Francis Edward McGillick Foundation, </em>at 469 (grave doubt as to standing of stranger to object to waste of trust assets).</p>

Current law allowed the Association, an outside group, to urge the Attorney General to enforce the Trust. However, the Association’s disagreement with the Attorney General’s decision to modify the 2002 agreement does not vest the Association with standing to challenge that decision in court. Ultimately, the Association’s dismay is more properly directed at the Attorney General’s actions and decisions; it is insufficient to establish standing here.</p>
