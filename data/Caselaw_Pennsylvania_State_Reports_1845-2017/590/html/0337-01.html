At the time of his arrest, the students residing in the cottage had left for their daily activities. As a Youth Development Counselor at the Center, Woods’ duties included the direction and development of treatment programs for the students in his care, assisting in individual and group counseling sessions, regularly evaluating and reviewing each student’s progress, writing monthly court reports, and aiding in the overall operation of the cottage to which he was assigned.</p>

Finding that Woods’ job duties placed him in a position of care and responsibility of students at the facility, and that Woods was employed in a sensitive position requiring the avoidance of even the appearance of impropriety, the Commission reasoned that Woods’ arrest, and the felony charge in particular, provided just cause to warrant his removal.

In the instant case, there was no evidence presented at the hearing showing that the students witnessed or heard about the arrest. <em>Woods v. State Civil Service Comm’n (New Castle Youth Dev.

The Center contends that the highly sensitive nature of his employment required Woods to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, citing a string of cases wherein the appearance of wrongdoing by an employee in a sensitive position was found to compromise that employees ability to perform his duties. <em>See e.g. Dep’t of Justice, Bureau of Corrections v.

While the Center observes that Woods occupied a position requiring trust and integrity, his arrest alone, albeit on <em>crimen falsi </em>charges, failed to demonstrate that his trustworthiness or integrity had been compromised. The Center raises concerns about the damage to the reputation and credibility of the institution occasioned by Woods’ arrest. However, just cause for removal must be related to the employee’s competency and ability to perform his job, or arise from conduct rendering him unfit for the position he occupies. Injury to the reputation of the institution does not meet these criteria.

While these cases are not binding on this Court, I cite them to show that public employers expect their employees in highly sensitive positions to have an untarnished reputation.</p>
    <p id="b581-4" data-blocks='[["BL_581.4",581,[145,1078,1157,955]]]'>Admittedly, some of these cases dealt with convictions on criminal charges, but an arrest alone was sufficient in <em>Roche, Davis, </em>and <em>Grant. </em>In the matter <em>sub judice, </em>Petitioner was arrested on perjury and false swearing charges and pled guilty to criminal mischief in exchange for the dismissal of these charges. The Commonwealth Court relied on <em>Davis </em>to conclude that the Center lacked just cause because there was no evidence that the students were aware of the charges. In <em>Davis, </em>the court held that “the commission’s findings regarding the sensitivity of Mr. Davis’ position as a houseparent and the student body’s awareness of his criminal charges support the commission’s order upholding Mr. Davis’ employment termination for just cause.” <em>Davis, </em><a href="/pa-commw/96/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="507 A.2d 915" data-case-ids="1346119" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/96/0337-01">507 A.2d at 917</a>. By applying the holding of <em>Davis </em>strictly, the Commonwealth Court believed that there must be evidence that the students were aware of the arrest and criminal charges. I do not agree that the lack of awareness on the part of the students should be the determining factor.</p>

Instead, public employers must decide these matters on a case-by-case basis. As long as their decision is rationally and logically related to the competency of the employee to perform his or her duties, it should be upheld. In this case, the nature of the charges involved, the publicity generated <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>from the charges, and the awareness on the part of the families of the students demonstrate that Woods’ ability to work, as a counselor was impaired. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>
