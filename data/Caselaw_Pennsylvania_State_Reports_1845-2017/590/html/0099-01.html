Thereafter, on November 4, 1997, Employer filed a petition to suspend Claimant’s benefits arguing that Claimant was capable of performing light-duty work, but refused, in bad faith, to accept a then open light-duty position, which was commensurate with his abilities.

The Employer, however, did not <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>submit evidence of a then-open light-duty position.

Such was the situation in <em>Spinabelli v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Bd.

As the board states in its decision, claimant’s loss of earning power is not due to his disability, but due to his lack of good faith in pursuing work made available to him, which was within his physical limitations. In order to receive a reinstatement of total disability benefits, claimant must prove a change in his condition such that he could no longer perform the jobs previously offered to him.</blockquote>

One’s disability status, however, is not considered static under the Workers’ Compensation Act. Rather, the Act contemplates a claimant’s changing circumstances, particularly with regard to disability status, and therefore permits modification, reinstatement, suspension or termination at any time. <em>See Dillon v.
