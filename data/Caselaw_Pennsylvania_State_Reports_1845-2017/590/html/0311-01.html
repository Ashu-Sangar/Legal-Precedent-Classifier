Appellant, a CO, was elected Vice President of the Association’s Eastern Region and took a leave of absence to work full-time in that capacity beginning on June 1, 2001. Pursuant to the applicable collective bargaining agreement, DOC granted certain specified officers of the Association, including Appellant, “leave without pay for the maximum term of office [in the Association], not to exceed three years.” <em>Pinto, </em><a href="/a2d/860/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="860 A.2d 593" data-case-ids="9147410" data-case-paths="/a2d/860/0593-01">860 A.2d at 595</a> (quoting Collective Bargaining Agreement).

The Association also requested that the five officials receive retirement seniority retroactive to the start dates of their respective periods of leave. The Department agreed to both requests. Under their modified status and pursuant to SERC § 5302, DOC paid Appellant the salary and benefits to which he was entitled as a CO, and the Association made up the difference in Appellant’s compensation. DOC, in turn, submitted to the Association a quarterly bill reflecting all expenses incurred on Appellant’s behalf, and the Association reimbursed DOC in full. Accordingly, Appellant effectively “was carried as a DOC employee for retirement seniority purposes,” <em>Pinto, </em><a href="/a2d/860/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="860 A.2d 593" data-case-ids="9147410" data-case-paths="/a2d/860/0593-01">860 A.2d at 595</a>, but as a practical matter <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>the Association was bound to pay all costs DOC incurred on Appellant’s behalf.</p>

The Chief Counsel responded that a CO on paid leave to serve as an Association officer generally is not exempt from the CSA § 905b political activity prohibition because the exceptions provided by Commission Rule 103.11(b)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> do not apply to COs on paid leave. The Chief Counsel noted, however, that “classified service employees who are on a regular leave of absence, or leave of absence to take a non-eivil service position, are exempt from the political activity restrictions.” <em>Pinto, </em><a href="/a2d/860/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="860 A.2d 593" data-case-ids="9147410" data-case-paths="/a2d/860/0593-01">860 A.2d at 595</a>. Thus, in effect, the Chief Counsel determined that the leaves of absence subject to the Commission Rule 103.11 exception are mutually exclusive of any “paid” leave of absence. Notably, the Chief Counsel did not elaborate, however, on how Appellant’s status differed from a “leave of absence to take a non[-]civil service position.”</p>

The Commission determined that only employees on <em>unpaid </em>leave are exempt from the CSA § 905b political activity prohibition, and ruled that Appellant, by electing “paid” leave status to protect his retirement seniority under SERC § 5302, remained subject to the prohibition.

The characterization of the Appellant’s leave, the parties appear to agree, controls whether Commission Rule 108.11(b) applies to Appellant in this case. As noted, Commission Rule 103.11(b) excepts from the CSA § 905b political activity prohibition “the classified service employe ... who is on a regular leave of absence, or leave of absence to take a non[-]civil service position,” but explicitly does not except “[a]n employe on another type of leave of absence.” 4 Pa.Code § 103.11(b). There appears to be no dispute that “regular leave of absence,” as used in Rule 103.11(b), shares a definition with “leave of absence” pursuant to Commission Rule 91.3, which defines “leave of absence” as “[a] temporary interruption of employment for which the <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>employe is given a specified period of leave <em>without pay </em>for purposes such as illness, school attendance, cyclical employment, military duty or training or employment in a non[-]civil service position.” 4 Pa.Code § 91.3 (emphasis added).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Appellant argues that SERC § 5302, read in its entirety, does not in fact identify him as “paid” for purposes of the CSA § 905b political activity prohibition and the Commission Rules. Appellant notes that his leave was effectively “unpaid” under Commission Rule 103.11(b) because, ultimately, the Association reimbursed DOC for all costs of his employment for the duration of his leave of absence to work full-time as an Association officer. Because he was “unpaid,” he qualified for the first exception articulated in Commission Rule 103.11(b), as a party on a “regular leave of absence.”</p>

It maintains that, by its terms, SERC § 5302 demands that a party seeking its benefit adopt “paid” status. Further, the Commission emphasizes that Appellant affirmatively sought to have his status changed from “unpaid” to “paid” in order to claim the retirement credit made available by SERC § 5302 and cannot now be heard to complain about the consequences of that choice. The Commission agrees with Appellant that the “regular leave of absence” exempted by Commission Rule 103.11(b) from the CSA § 905b political activity prohibition is “unpaid,” per Commission Rule 91.3, but disagrees with Appellant that the “pass-through” compensa<a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>tion arrangement changed the status of Appellant’s leave of absence to “unpaid.” Rather, the Commission maintains that retirement seniority is tantamount to compensation, and Appellant’s leave therefore was “paid” both as a practical matter and as a matter of law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The Commission contends that Appellant’s leave therefore qualified as “another type of leave of absence” under Commission Rule 103.11(b), and that he therefore was not entitled to the benefit of the exception to the CSA § 905b political activity prohibition afforded members of the classified service on regular leaves of absence and leaves of absence to take non-civil service employment. Thus, the Commission maintains that the CSA § 905b political activity prohibition applied and the Commonwealth Court did not err in so ruling.</p>

Public Employe Relations Act” provided, <em>inter alia, </em>“that the Statewide employee organization shall fully reimburse the employer for all expenses and costs of such paid leave.” 71 Pa.C.S. § 5302(b)(2).

In support of this tortuous inference, the Commission offers only a strained reading of its administrative language — Commission Rules 91.3, defining “leave of absence” exclusively as an unpaid leave, and 103.11(b), excluding from the political activity prohibition, a party who is on a “regular leave of absence”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> or a “leave of absence to take a non[-]civil <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>service position,” which the Commission by and large ignores rather than distinguishing it from the facts at bar.</p>

The Commission does not, and indeed cannot, maintain that the full-time employment Appellant took with the Association is other than a “non[-]civil service position.” The Commission’s failure to provide a basis for us to rule that this exception, which on its face appears to describe the instant situation, does not apply, or to provide any persuasive argument that we should instead construe Appellant’s leave as “another type of leave of absence” and thus excluded from the Rule 103.11(b) exception, is nearly fatal to its argument.</p>

Indeed, the only functional difference between these statuses, by the Commission’s own account, was who signed Appellant’s checks, as it is undisputed that the Association ultimately paid all of Appellant’s employment costs. Moreover, the Commission does not explain how the status change under the circumstances <em>sub judice </em>modified Appellant’s conduct or otherwise threatened or reflected poorly on the integrity of the classified service. Absent such an explanation, the Commission’s position is substantially a call for rote application of its interpretation of its own administrative rules to effectuate divergent results in materially indistinguishable circumstances.

Section 5302 of SERC bespeaks the legislature’s intention that members of the civil service be free to pursue terms of employment as elected officers of labor unions without sacrificing tenure for purposes of retirement benefits, which above all suggests an intention not to discourage members from pursuing such employment. To permit someone to take such a position but impose a limitation on his speech broad enough to compel him to look over his shoulder and second-guess virtually every public act or statement he makes in that capacity would be absurd and would disserve the manifest intent of the legislature.</p>

In the case <em>siib judice, </em>Pinto received a benefit that he was not entitled to if on a non-paid leave of absence; he would have been performing his usual duties if not on paid leave; and he was permitted to work on paid leave status for a specific purpose, sanctioned by statute, upon agreement of his employer.

Like the Majority, Pinto asserts that the Commonwealth Court incorrectly focused its scrutiny on whether he was on a paid or unpaid leave of absence. Pinto believes that the essential element is whether he remained in the classified service once he began his leave of absence and that, if he has shown that he is not in the classified service, his actions as Vice President of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association (PSCOA) cannot violate the Act.</p>

Pinto maintains that, without current duties, he does not hold a “position” in the “classified service.” He also argues that he is accountable solely to the union for his conduct and receives absolutely no compensation from the Commonwealth.

It is clear that the Department of Corrections (DOC) assigned Pinto to work as an employee of the union, just as the DOC could assign Pinto to other duties. It is the DOC, as the employer, that controls the duties of its employees. Consistent with the authority of DOC to regulate job specifications, discipline, and job performance, it is clear that the union <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>could not remove employees from their normal duties without the consent of the DOC. Rather, the union was required to request that DOC approve the assignment of Pinto from his normal duties for union leave because the DOC had the ability and authority to approve such an assignment. Further, while Pinto is on union leave, he is presumably still subject to discipline by DOC and the Commission.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Therefore, Pinto’s current duties are those assigned by DOC, which are to function as a union officer.</p>

      <em>Hetman </em>is most closely analogous to the instant matter. Hetman and one or two of her co-workers in a county mental health/mental retardation program were volunteer union mobilizers, whose primary union function was regular, lawful distribution of non-political union leaflets and printed informational material to fellow county co-workers. In late 1995, she received pamphlets from the Labor Council for distribution. She disseminated the material with another co-worker without reading it. The pamphlet contained anti-Republican material, clearly endorsing Democratic candidates. Again, the court <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>held- that a finding regarding whether or not the union mobilizes were aware of the nature and contents of the pamphlets was unrelated to the ultimate legal determination that they violated the Act.</p>
    <p id="b562-4" data-blocks='[["BL_562.4",562,[312,571,1165,911]]]'>The Commonwealth Court, in the instant matter, failed to distinguish its current position from that it adopted in <em>Cardamone, Vaniscak, McCormick, DeMarco, </em>and <em>Hetman. </em>In all of those cases, the Commonwealth Court’s analysis of political activity prohibitions stopped once the court determined that the employee engaged in prohibited political activity. Although the Majority is correct that none of these employees was on a leave of absence, their status was not determinative in deciding that they had violated the political prohibitions of the Act; only their forbidden political conduct was considered. I am reminded that this is, after all, merely a matter of civil discipline and sanctions can be imposed without proof of intent. Further, had the General Assembly intended that civil service employees must knowingly and intentionally engage in political activity before it would be actionable, it would have included such a requirement in the Act, which was most recently amended in 2002.</p>
    <p id="b562-5" data-blocks='[["BL_562.5",562,[313,1523,1160,305]]]'>The political activity prohibition set forth in the Act does not provide an exception for unknowing or unintentional conduct and I would not require an element of intent when the General Assembly has clearly declined to include it in the statute.
