That hearing was twice continued at appellee’s request and ultimately was held on January 5, 2004 at SCIGraterford. Appellee, who was represented by counsel, forwarded no objection to the timeliness of the revocation hearing, and thus the hearing examiner heard no evidence on that point. Appellee also did not dispute that he violated his parole nor did he dispute the evidence against him, except to question whether his new conviction was considered “like a summary offense.” By order recorded April 13, 2004, the Board recommitted appellee to a state correctional institution <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>as a technical parole violator to serve twelve months of backtime.

A divided panel vacated and remanded in an unpublished opinion.

In the dissent’s view, appellee waived the timeliness issue because he did not raise it at the revocation hearing. The dissent opined that raising the timeliness issue for the first time in an administrative appeal is insufficient because “1) resolving this issue requires the development of a factual record, which occurs <em>only </em>at the hearing stage and not at the Board review level, and 2) where this issue is raised, the burden shifts to the Board to show that the hearing was timely.” Slip op., at 2.

After noting other examples where the Commonwealth Court had applied the waiver rule in the administrative setting, the dissent saw no reason why the waiver rule should not apply in the parole revocation context as well. In contrast, the dissent concluded, the panel majority’s ruling disregarded <em>Wing, </em>“discounted the concept of finality,” “disregarded the notion that the Board should have been given an opportunity to correct any errors ‘as early as possible,’ ” and “excused pre-hearing preparation that was less than diligent.” Slip op., at 4.</p>

In the Board’s view, the Commonwealth Court “had no power” to approach the question of administrative waiver in a manner that “conflicts with” <em>Dilliplaine. </em>The Board notes that the appellant in <em>Dilliplaine </em>failed to object at trial (to an alleged error in jury instructions), first raised his issue in a motion for a new trial, and this Court held that such belated action was insufficient to preserve the issue. The Board analogizes the administrative appeal procedure for parole revocation decisions to the trial/post-trial paradigm in court proceedings. Thus, the Board argues, the purpose of post-trial motions is to permit the trial court to correct an error before appellate review commences, while the purpose of the Board’s administrative appeal is to review administrative decisions and correct any errors before the parties appeal to the courts. The Board maintains that <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>neither the post-verdict motion process nor the administrative appeal process is designed to allow an appellant to “void a waiver of a claim.” Brief for Appellant, at 14. The Board also notes that, in the analogous context of non-administrative appeals from probation revocation decisions made by trial courts in the first instance, the Superior Court has held that objections to the speediness of the revocation hearing have to be contemporaneously forwarded, and waivers of such objections cannot be undone by belated presentations in motions for reconsideration. <em>See Commonwealth v. Marchesano, </em><a href="/pa-super/348/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="348 Pa.

    <p id="b365-4" data-blocks='[["BL_365.4",365,[154,1028,1155,1220]]]'>The Board adds that the panel majority’s overlooking the waiver in the parole revocation setting is “unprecedented” and “profoundly misconstrues the purpose of [the] regulatory scheme for administrative appeals.” That scheme, the Board argues, is designed to provide for agency review and correction of alleged record-based errors made at the revocation hearing, before judicial review may commence. The scheme is not designed to provide a parolee a “safety net” or “second chance” to raise claims he could have raised at the revocation hearing, but did not. Indeed, the Board maintains, allowing a claim to be raised for the first time upon administrative appeal converts the revocation proceeding into a mere “dress rehearsal” and also overlooks the fact that such new claims cannot be adequately reviewed on appeal, since there will be no relevant record. The Commonwealth Court’s mandated administrative review paradigm, the Board argues, will “require the Board to squander its resources by holding another hearing” on a claim that could have been raised at the first hearing. Indeed, the Board notes, if a claim may be raised for the first time upon administrative appeal, the administrative process could go on <em>ad infinitum: i.e., </em>hearing, appeal with a new claim, remand to hear the new claim, appeal with a new claim, remand for a hearing, <em>etc.</em>

The Board submits that it is “impossible to apply this scope of review” to a claim that the revocation hearing was untimely if the claim was not forwarded below.</p>

Appellee also argues that the Board’s reliance upon the <em>Dilliplaine </em>line of cases is “fundamentally misplaced” because those cases involve issue preservation at jury trials, and not the comparatively informal administrative proceeding at issue here. Turning to the Board’s reliance upon the issue preservation doctrine in judicial probation revocation cases, appellee argues that administrative parole revocation is different because the Board’s regulations set forth specific time requirements, prejudice resulting from untimely parole revocation hearings is presumed, and the Board has an “affirmative duty and burden” to prove that the hearing was timely once a timebness challenge has been raised.</p>

In appellee’s view, the record contains all of the necessary dates <em>(i.e., </em>the date of the detainer and the dates of all continuances) for the Board to determine whether <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>the hearing was held within the requisite 120 days.

The diligent and prepared trial lawyer — and his client — are penalized when an entire case is retried because an appellate court reverses on the basis of an error opposing counsel failed to call to the trial court’s attention.

It is true that a revocation proceeding is not a full-blown trial; but that fact hardly means that the Board cannot adopt a procedure to focus and streamline revocation matters. Likewise, the fact that prejudice may be presumed in a case where a hearing is untimely through no fault of the parolee, as well as the alleged fact that the Board has available to it the raw record dates that would form the basis for a claim that the hearing was untimely, hardly excuses a failure to forward a timeliness claim at the first opportunity. Indeed, the basic and fundamental error doctrine abrogated in the <em>Dilliplaine </em>line of cases also involved issues that were claimed to be apparent from the face of the record. Part of the point, at least, for requiring contemporaneous objection is to ensure a prompt, trial level resolution of cases, and to thereby avoid the time and cost of unnecessary appeals. Moreover, appellee’s argument is flawed as a factual matter because the Board’s obligation to prove timeliness attaches only after a timeliness challenge has actually been forwarded. <em>See Johnson v.

The Board’s argument is that <em>Dilliplaine </em>itself requires such a rule and that the Commonwealth Court lacked “power” to hold otherwise. This is not so. <em>Dilliplaine </em>did not delve into the administrative law arena, and the issue preservation rule this Court adopted in the <em>Dilliplaine </em>line was a function of our rulemaking authority for the judicial system. It is one thing to say that an administrative agency may adopt an internal issue preservation requirement, and quite another to say that a judicial doctrine requires that such a procedural rule be adopted or employed by an agency. In short, <em>Dilliplaine </em>and its progeny do not independently require that a defendant raise any and all issues at the parole revocation hearing level. That requirement, if there is to be any, is for the Board to determine, at least as an initial matter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>
