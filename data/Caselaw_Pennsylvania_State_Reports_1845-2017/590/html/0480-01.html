Although the Act contains a separate exemption for voluntary abortion, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 2608(a)(1), because of the mother’s unique connection to the fetus there are various situations even outside of the abortion context (such as those pertaining to drug addiction or attempted suicide) in which she alone might bear an increased risk of criminal prosecution were it not for the (a)(3) exception.

The Commonwealth counters that the charge must be read as a whole, and that the judge had previously defined gross negligence. Therefore, according to the Commonwealth, the judge’s overall instructions accurately reflected the law. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee at 19. While the judge did define gross negligence, <em>see </em>N.T. October 20, 2003 at 895, this definition was provided as part of the charge on the homicide of the mother, and not the unborn child. The Commonwealth’s suggestion that the jury must have understood the same definition to apply to mere negligence, a distinct term recited as an element of a different offense, is not well taken.

This Court need not presently opine regarding the legal propriety of a hypothetical criminal prosecution of the mother in such circumstances. The relevant point here is that the classification is not arbitrary, but is based on the Legislature’s recognition that the mother is differently situated from everyone else in relation to her unborn child.</p>

We note that the Act’s general definition of criminal homicide of an unborn child indicates that that the offense includes the <em>mens reas </em>of intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, and negligently, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 2603(a), whereas the specific definition of voluntary manslaughter of an unborn child clarifies that an accidental cause of death suffices so long as the actor endeavored to kill the mother. <em>See <a href="/sc/282/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="282 S.C. 444" data-case-ids="8716326" data-case-paths="/sc/282/0444-01">id.,</a> </em>§ 2605(a)(1). There is no conflict between these two provisions, however, because Section 2603 does not preclude liability where the death of the unborn child is accidental. Furthermore, even if a conflict were deemed to exist, the particular definition of voluntary manslaughter would control. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1933 (providing that, in statutory construction, specific provisions prevail over general ones where a conflict exists).</p>

The legislature was, therefore, within its prerogative in enacting the Crimes Against the Unborn Child Act (the “Act”), 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 2601-2609, in furtherance of that interest. In doing so, the legislature sought to criminalize certain acts that would result in the cessation of the gestational process. As aptly noted by the Majority, however, the legislature’s effort in this regard, “does not purport to define the concept of personhood or establish when life as a human being begins and ends; rather, it imposes criminal liability for the destruction of a human embryo or fetus that is biologically alive.” Maj. at 489, 913 A.2d at 212-13 (citing <em>State v.
