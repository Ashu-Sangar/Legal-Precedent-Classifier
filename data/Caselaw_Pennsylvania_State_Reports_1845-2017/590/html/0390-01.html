On this night, Sigma Pi fraternity ... opened their fraternity house to the public for a party by selling tickets for admission. The tickets were required to be presented before a person could gain entry to the party, and allowed students to purchase alcoholic beverages once inside the fraternity house. The undercover LCE officers, who were dressed in plain clothing, obtained their tickets from the West Chester Police Department a few days before the <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>party. The Department had obtained them from a student. The LCE officers were able to enter the party with relative ease. Upon entry, the LCE officers presented their tickets to a person seated behind a table who then checked the tickets against a list. The person seated behind the desk then marked the officers’ hands, and allowed them to enter the party. The LCE officers then made their way to the basement of the fraternity house where they observed a makeshift bar where people who appeared to be students were being served and were consuming alcoholic beverages. From their observations, the LCE officers generally gathered that many of the students, who seemed youthful in appearance, were under the age of 21. The LCE officers had not procured a search warrant before entering the fraternity house.</blockquote>

The WCP were uniformed police officers, and they did not procure a search warrant before entering the fraternity house. When the WCP arrived, the LCE officers stopped the party and began to “card” each student by checking their drivers’ licenses for identification. Based on their ages, LCE officers divided the students into two groups: those that were over the age of 21, and those that were under the age of 21. Those who were over the age of 21 were told that they were free to leave, and the under 21s were further detained. Upon detention of the students under the age of 21, the WCP and the LCE officers administered PBTs,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">[1]</a> and began to question students concerning whether or not they had been drinking. Based on the PBT information, students’ admissions that they had been drinking, and LCE officers’ observations, LCE officers issued under-age drinking citations to 56 students.</blockquote>

The suppression court in the instant matter noted that, according to the reasoning in <em>Wood, </em>the Commonwealth had the burden of proving that each particular student was present at the fraternity house and had given some indicia that he or she had been drinking. <em>Commonwealth v. Mistler, </em>Nos. 3284, 4108, 3119, 3416, 3417, 3405, 3413, 3315 M.D.2003, at 5 (C.P. Chester May 28, 2004) (hereinafter “May Supp. ct. Op.”). It noted that it “would have considered it sufficient to prove identification if the Commonwealth had presented evidence ... that each [student] had been identified as one of those detained at the fraternity house ... because he or she was under the age of 21.” <em><a href="/us/531/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="531 U.S. 32" data-case-ids="9505377" data-case-paths="/us/531/0032-01">Id.</a> </em>Specifically, the suppression court suggested that it would have been reasonable for the Commonwealth to demonstrate that the officers used a driver’s license or other identification to prepare the citation issued to the particular student. Noting that the Commonwealth failed to present any such evidence, the suppression court concluded that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the person stopped was involved in the activity of underage drinking, as required by <em>Wood.

Second, the alleged “expectation” assumed by the Majority has to be diminished by the reality of the situation. No person committing a crime in a place held open to the public can harbor a “reasonable expectation” that authorities will allow him to “leave at will.” Any person at this fraternity-keg party who was underage knew he was committing a crime and could have no expectation of immunity from discovery or consequence. Even those few students who were of-age needed only to consult their senses to know that they were in a place, and a circumstance, where police discovery of the unlawful activity might impede their ability to “leave at will.”</p>

Majority at 402, 912 A.2d at 1272. The practical implications of the Majority’s opinion impeaches this analysis. Although the Majority makes an unsupported assertion that there are more “effective” means for LCE officers to employ to stop underage drinking, <em>id. </em>at 402, 912 A.2d at 1272, the Majority glaringly fails to suggest any such alternative approach, much less a more effective one.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Alcohol on college campuses is a <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>reality and a concern, particularly because most college students are under the age of 21. Fraternity drinking parties or other “keg” parties present a very real danger to the health and safety of our youth, many of whom lack the sophistication and experience to realize the danger posed to themselves and others. The most effective way to combat this real-world danger is by going to the source — here, literally, the source of the alcohol. The real choice here is between allowing a reasonable, brief detention of the partygoers at the fraternity for police to ascertain which drinkers are underage or, as the Majority would seem to require, consigning the officers to the toothless path of questioning individuals one-on-one, thereby permitting other unquestioned partygoers to realize the officers’ identity and to flee before being cited for illegal activity. Permitting exclusion, as Judge Easterbrook recently put it, “comes at such high cost to the administration of the criminal justice system that its application might sensibly be confined to violations of the reasonableness requirement.” <em>United States v. Elder, </em><a href="/f3d/466/1090-01" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="466 F.3d 1090" data-case-ids="3775063" data-case-paths="/f3d/466/1090-01">466 F.3d 1090</a>, 1091 (7th Cir.2006).

Even aside from the youthful appearance of the drinkers, assuming that a fair cross-section of the college student community was present, that is, individuals from every class year, the LCE officers had ample reason to believe that a fair number of the party participants were <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>under the legal consumption age of 21. As the party swelled, however, it became a practical impossibility for the LCE officers, who were far fewer in number, to evaluate the actions of every student in the fraternity house, much less to recall at a suppression hearing months later whether they had witnessed a particular appellee drinking. The facts undeniably provided the LCE officers with probable cause to believe that widespread underage drinking was occurring at the fraternity party, but the circumstances prevented them from isolating and developing individualized suspicion for each of the fifty-six underage drinkers, interspersed between sober underage partygoers and those 21 or older. In this instance, I see no constitutional violation in permitting a minimally intrusive, wholesale investigatory detention of the partygoers.</p>

The trial court granted appellees’ motion to suppress because, it found, “there was no evidence whatsoever presented at the April 7, 2004 hearing to demonstrate that the [appellees] on the list were the same students who had been charged with under-age drinking on April 3, 2003 .... [t]he Commonwealth gave me nothing to show that the [appellees] named in the caption to this case were the people who were present in the fraternity house that evening.” <em>Commonwealth v. Mistler, </em>No. 3147-03, slip op. at 6 (Pa.C.C.P. May 28, 2004). In so ruling, the court cited a Superior Court decision, <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, it appears, the reason for the trial court’s grant of appellees’ suppression motion was not based on any Fourth Amendment violation, but rather was grounded in a dispute over proof that the named defendants were the same students cited for underage drinking at the party. It is not clear to me how difficulties of proof the Commonwealth may face at trial are relevant to determining the constitutionality of the search and seizure in this case and the propriety of the grant of suppression relief. <em>See Commonwealth v.

When the officers arrived, no one was asking for identification or proof of age; they observed people “youthful in appearance,” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a> the majority of whom were holding cups or cans of beer, the only beverage being served.
