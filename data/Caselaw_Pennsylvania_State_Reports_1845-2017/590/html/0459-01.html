In 1996-97, the County assessed the subject property at approximately $5,800,000 as part of a countywide reassessment in which all real estate was assessed at 100% of its fair market value, effective January 1, 1998.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>March 1999, Lionville Station S.C.

The School District appealed the $5,800,000 assessment, and the County’s Board of Assessment Appeals increased the assessment for tax year 2000 to $6,500,000, or $77.86 per square foot. The School District again appealed, seeking to have the assessment further increased to $8,500,000, or $101.81 per square foot.</p>

The County’s chief assessor testified that the average assessment for shopping centers similar to the subject property was $64.29 per square foot, and that the $77.86-per-square-foot figure for the subject property was arrived at in an effort to achieve uniformity with such other commercial properties, adjusting for age, location, construction, and demographic factors. Appellant also presented the expert testimony of commercial real estate appraiser Scott Eiffes, who had performed an analysis comparing the subject property with seven other shopping centers in the County which he deemed comparable. In his analysis, Eiffes determined that the assessments for the comparables ranged from $47.87 to $89.62 per square foot, and that the ratio of the assessed value to actual value for the comparables was in the range of 34% to 69%. Accordingly, Appellant opposed the School District’s requested relief, arguing that an increased assessment would result in a violation of the constitutional requirement of tax uniformity. <em>See </em>Pa. Const, art. VIII, § 1 (“All taxes shall be uniform, upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and shall be levied and collected under general laws.”).</p>

The trial court nonetheless declined to apply the CLR and instead granted the School District’s requested relief by assessing the subject property at the EPR of 100% of fair market value, or $8,500,000. <em>See Downingtown Area Sch.

Because the CLR varied from the EPR by less than fifteen percent of the EPR, the majority concluded that the trial court’s decision to assess the subject property at 100% of its fair market value was consistent with statutory requirements, thus rendering Appellant’s uniformity challenge meritless. <em>See id. </em>at 620.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Judge Friedman therefore concluded that the trial court had erred in refusing to consider Appellant’s evidence that the comparable properties had all been assessed at between 34% and 69% of their fair market value. She also opined that, to the extent the General Assembly has made the fifteen-percent rule of Section 8(d.2) of the Assessments Law <em>(see supra </em>note 4) the exclusive test for tax uniformity, it has usurped the judicial function of interpreting the Pennsylvania Constitution. She indicated, moreover, that the fifteen-percent rule “actually defeats uniformity” by allowing assessment-to-value variances of up to 30 percent (fifteen percent above and below the EPR), whereas courts have interpreted Article VIII, Section 1 as embodying a requirement that taxing authorities assess all property at the same percentage of value. <em>See id. </em>at 624.</p>

The School District counters that the 1982 amendments to the Assessments Law provide a statutory means of assuring constitutional uniformity within a taxing district, and relieve the taxpayer of the onerous task of compiling voluminous data and presenting expert testimony in order to raise a claim of non-uniformity. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee (School District) at 13-14. The Board of Assessment Appeals, by contrast, maintains that, for the sake of uniformity and clarity, the STEB-calculated CLR should be applied to the subject property’s fair market value in all assessment appeals, notwithstanding the statutory directive that this only be done where there is a fifteen-percent differential between the CLR and the EPR. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee (Board of Assessment Appeals) at 17.</p>

Rather, in application, the EPR is treated as a fixed number that merely fractionalizes assessments and which is generally held constant pending county-wide reassessments. <em>See </em>Goodman, Assessment Law &amp; Procedure at 258 (describing the EPR as "an arbitrary number selected by the government”); Bright, 27 Summ. Pa. Jur.2d Taxation § 15:12 ("It is unclear why Pennsylvania has institutionalized the practice of fractional assessment, since it does not appear to serve a useful purpose.”).</p>

The majority springboards off of Judge Friedman’s dissent in <em>Vees </em>and produces an argument asserting that the methodology used for valuing properties following an appeal filed by a taxing authority differs from that employed in other assessments; the majority also states that because of this differing methodology, properties which are subject to an appeal filed by a taxing authority are taxed more heavily than other properties. M.O. at 471-75, 913 A.2d at 202-05. The majority concludes that the Legislature has thus effectively “carved out a class of taxpayers who are subjected to an unfairly high tax burden — namely, those whose assessment is appealed by any taxing district in which the property is located.” M.O. at 475, 913 A.2d at 204-05.

In my opinion, the <em>Deitch </em>method of computing the common level ratio is unsatisfactory. For example, the <em>Deitch </em>method of computing the common level ratio allows a taxpayer to adduce only evidence relative to properties which are <em>similar </em>to the one he owns. The Uniformity Clause, however, requires that all types of property must be taxed at the same rate. <em>See Keebler Co. v.

The STEB utilizes the records of all real property transfers in each county for a given calendar year, examining both residential and commercial property transfers. It considers only arm’s-length sales and excludes transfers it considers “questionable” in an effort to ensure that its statistics are as accurate as possible. 61 Pa.Code § 603.31(b) and (d). The STEB also “[periodically ... compare[s selling prices] with market values on the same properties, as appraised by independent appraisers when available.” 61 Pa.Code § 603.31(e).</p>

The STEB method arrives at a common level ratio only after considering the bulk of all arm’s-length property sales — whether these sales are of residential or commercial property — in a county. The <em>Deitch </em>method, on the other hand, permits a landowner to establish the common level ratio by looking only to a single class of property; it also permits a landowner to establish his case via a fairly scant amount of evidence. It is apparent that such a methodology would be prone to gross distortions. The STEB method of adducing the common level ratio, on the other hand, is far more likely to arrive at an accurate common level ratio as it is a broad ranging study of a county. Thus, contrary to the position taken by the majority, I believe that we should reject the <em>Deitch </em>method of valuation and embrace the STEB’s method of computing the common level ratio.</p>
