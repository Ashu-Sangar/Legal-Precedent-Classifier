Mr. Ñolas also suggests that my impartiality might reasonably be questioned based upon his first three allegations. He separately alleges that my impartiality might reasonably be questioned based on his fourth and fifth factual allegations.</p>
    <p id="b485-4" data-blocks='[["BL_485.4",485,[155,825,1158,838]]]'>The Commonwealth responds by arguing, first, that Canon 3 creates no “right” in a party to have a judge or justice recused, but merely provides standards by which judges should exercise their discretion in ruling upon recusal requests. The Commonwealth further notes that, in <em>Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth argues that my involvement as a prosecutor in appellant’s case was no greater than in any other case where the Commonwealth sought the death penalty during my tenure. With specific respect to the role of the elected District Attorney in the decision to seek the death penalty, the Commonwealth describes the office policy respecting such decisions as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b485-5" data-blocks='[["BL_485.5",485,[197,1688,1112,687]]]'>[T]he decision to seek the death penalty is initially approved by the Chief of the Homicide Unit, after reviewing a memorandum prepared by the trial prosecutor. The recommendation to seek the death penalty is then referred to the Deputy District Attorney for the Trial Division and subsequently to the First Assistant District Attorney. If both the Trial Deputy and First Assistant concur in the recommendation, it is submitted to the District Attorney for final authorization. The District Attorney’s authorization constitutes a concurrence in the judgments of the First Assistant, Trial Deputy and the Chief of the Homicide Unit that the trial prosecutor has demonstrated a statutory basis for seeking the death penalty.</blockquote>

      <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>The Commonwealth concludes this point by noting that, aside from concurring in the judgment of my assistants concerning the facial applicability of the death penalty statute, and serving in a formal role (such that my name appeared upon pleadings, <em>etc.), </em>there is no showing, or claim, that I actually directed, oversaw, or participated in the prosecution of this-matter, a matter which went to trial long after I left the District Attorney’s Office.</p>

As I noted there, because of my position as District Attorney, my signature was affixed onto every indictment and complaint as an administrative formality. I believe my name was also listed on many, if not all, motions filed by my assistants, again as an administrative formality. I was not personally involved in every charging decision made by my assistants, nor did I actively participate in routine decisions involving, <em>inter alia, </em>whether to seek a joint trial for co-conspirators. To the best of my knowledge and recollection, I was not personally involved in any pre-trial investigation of appellant, the charging decisions that were made in his case, or the decision to seek to try him jointly with his codefendant. I have no special knowledge of any facts regarding whatever pre-trial proceedings occurred during my tenure as District Attorney; indeed, my only familiarity with this case is that which I have gleaned from the pleadings filed with this Court and the opinions published in appellant’s prior appeals. Moreover, Mr. Ñolas has pointed to nothing in the record that demonstrates otherwise. Thus, for example, Mr. Nolas’s assertion, as if it were a historical fact, that I “decided to try [ajppellant jointly with [the] codefendant,” an assertion unsupported by any citation to the record, is simply false. In short, the first and third factual assertions made by Mr. Ñolas, which at best relate to my formal role as the elected District Attorney, establish no basis for recusal. I have no doubt as to my “ability to preside impartially.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Although Mr. Ñolas is vague and his argument peremptory, the “decision” he presumably refers to is the written “Notice of Aggravating Circumstances” that this Court’s Rules of Criminal Procedure require the Commonwealth’s attorney to file and serve upon the defendant very early in a capital prosecution, <em>ie., </em>at or before the time of arraignment. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 802 (formerly Rule 352).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The purpose of this notice Rule is to give the defendant sufficient time and information to prepare for the penalty hearing, should there be one. <em>See <a href="/pa/501/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="501 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="1782483" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0015-01">id.</a> </em>Comment; <em>see also Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth’s account of office policy respecting such preliminary decisions to seek the death penalty is an accurate description of the manner in which such decisions were made during my tenure. My formal approval of such recommendations from my assistants, recommendations approved at all levels in the chain of command, simply represented a concurrence in their judgment that the death penalty statute applied, <em>ie., </em>that one or more of the statutory aggravating circumstances set forth in the Sentencing Code, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d), existed, and nothing more.</p>

Moreover, appellant did not challenge the notice pretrial — thus, the propriety and adequacy of the notice was never an issue in controversy. Nor is there any issue raised on this collateral appeal concerning the notice. In addition, even if some such challenge were belatedly forwarded now, the fact would remain that a jury of appellant’s peers unanimously found the aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt following a trial which was conducted after I left the District Attorney’s Office, and this Court determined on direct appeal that the jury’s finding “was clearly supported by the evidence.” <em>Rainey, </em><a href="/pa/540/0220-02" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="656 A.2d 1326" data-case-ids="472140,472154,472212,7888891,7888960,7889121" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0220-02,/pa/540/0219-01,/pa/540/0220-01,/a2d/656/1326-01,/a2d/656/1326-02,/a2d/656/1326-03">656 A.2d at 1335</a>.

Instead, as support for these <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>“factual” averments, Mr. Ñolas cites only to the McMahon tape and to what he calls, “notes from jury selection training lecture.” He does not indicate where in the record these materials may be found, nor does he append them to his Motion. Upon reviewing the appellate briefs, it appears that appellant did not raise the underlying substantive claim in his PCRA petition, there was no hearing on the claim below, and the PCRA court never passed upon it. It is safe to assume, then, that there is no record support for what Mr. Ñolas blindly poses as if it were “fact.”</p>

In addition, I note that in his appellate Brief, Mr. Ñolas takes his reckless disregard one step further and declares rather scurrilously that his non-record materials prove “the deliberate policy of [the District Attorney’s] Office to strike jurors based on race and to make certain that new prosecutors entering the office would be properly coached in the manner and method of excluding such jurors while evading the check of the Constitution.” Brief for Appellant, 40.</p>

In point of fact, as the duly-elected District Attorney of Philadelphia County I never “authorized” or encouraged any of my assistants to teach racially discriminatory jury selection methods in violation of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em><a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">476 U.S. 79</a>, <a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">106 S.Ct. 1712</a>, <a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">90 L.Ed.2d 69</a> (1986). Indeed, I neither authorized nor encouraged my assistants to violate any governing statute, case, or rule, including those same ethical rules which bind Mr. Ñolas. I took an Oath of Office as District Attorney which, like the oath I no less <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>proudly swore upon being admitted to the bar of this Court, represented my promise to support, obey and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of this Commonwealth, and to discharge my duties with fidelity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The notion of pledging to discharge one’s constitutional duties with fidelity is not an abstraction for me.</p>
    <p id="b491-5" data-blocks='[["BL_491.4",491,[155,656,1156,624]]]'>Leaving aside the content, purpose, and significance of the two “training lectures” cited by Mr. Ñolas — specifics that the Commonwealth contests — I do not recall having any specific foreknowledge of the lecture by ADA McMahon or the lecture by ADA Sagel, much less did I review or authorize their specific content. That my name appeared on the cover of the McMahon videotape was a simple function of the fact that it was a tape produced within the Office during my tenure as the elected District Attorney. The notion that everything produced in the Office was personally reviewed, much less approved, by me, and represented established office “policy,” is patently absurd.</p>
    <p id="b491-6" data-blocks='[["BL_491.5",491,[154,1307,1160,682]],["BL_492.1",492,[319,326,1163,974]]]'>The District Attorney’s Office during my tenure consisted of approximately 225 attorneys, handling an average yearly caseload of 30,000 summary and misdemeanor cases, 15,000 felony cases, 10,000 juvenile cases, and thousands of appeals. In an office of such size, by necessity, the responsibility for training and informational lectures is delegated to assistants. I did not — indeed, given the size of the Office and the scope of my responsibilities, I could not — micromanage what every assistant district attorney said. It was physically impossible for me to review and pre-approve what more senior prosecutors might say to newer ones, whether in a formal or informal setting. When prosecutors come to the bar of this Court, like all defenders, they take an oath to uphold and defend the <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>Constitution. In addition, prosecutors take an oath of office. As the Philadelphia Defender well knows, assistant district attorneys in Philadelphia County, like their counterparts in the Defender’s Office, of necessity are delegated a great deal of individual responsibility. Any head of any such large legal organization must necessarily be able to trust in the power of the oath and the professionalism of the lawyers under his or her command to abide by their obligation of constitutional fidelity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> It bears repeating: lawyers are professionals. The fact that one attorney interprets a new case in one way does not mean that another attorney, learned in the law, agrees with that interpretation and will act upon it. And it certainly does not mean that what one subordinate attorney says is etched in stone as if it were gospel from the mouth of the public official in charge of that Office. I certainly hope that the Chief Defender did not personally review and approve as a “policy” matter the falsehoods that are the basis for Mr. Nolas’s argument contained herein.</p>
    <p id="b492-5" data-blocks='[["BL_492.4",492,[319,1343,1162,369]]]'>In short, it was never a policy of the District Attorney’s Office during my watch to violate <em>Batson, </em>to engage in discriminatory practices of any kind, or to violate any other governing precept of law. Mr. Nolas’s allegations are as bereft of factual support as they are distressingly unmindful of his own sworn duties as a lawyer and officer of this Court. <em>See </em>R.P.C. 3.3(a)(1), RPC 8.2(a), RPC 8.4(c).</p>

In <em>Bond v. Beard, </em><a href="/citations/?q=2006%20WL%201117862" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="2006 WL 1117862">2006 WL 1117862</a>, at 3-4 (E.D.Pa. April 24, 2006) (unpublished decision), the learned Senior Judge John P. Fullam reasoned as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b493-4" data-blocks='[["BL_493.3",493,[195,319,1112,525]]]'>
      <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>At the hearing in this court, petitioner’s counsel presented additional evidence of other training sessions conducted by-other assistant district attorneys on the subject of jury-selection. On behalf of petitioner, it is argued that the evidence as a whole demonstrates an official position on behalf of the District Attorney’s Office as to the proper way to select a jury in a criminal case. I agree that this is a reasonable inference, but I do not conclude that it was the policy of the District Attorney’s Office to discriminate on racial grounds in the process of selecting juries.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b493-5" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[193,860,1113,1276]]]'>After all, it would be impossible to discuss the implications of the <em>Batson </em>decision, and the correct way to select juries in the wake of that decision, without mentioning the subject of race. The evidence makes clear that assistant district attorneys were urged to try to obtain juries which would be willing to convict, and to avoid jurors believed to be too favorable to the defense side of the case. It was important for assistant district attorneys to adhere to <em>Bat-son’s </em>requirements, so as not to jeopardize convictions. It was equally important for assistant district attorneys to avoid being falsely accused of <em>Batson </em>error. The evidence shows that, at times, it was suggested to assistant district attorneys that, if they intended to challenge a prospective juror who was black, they should make sure that valid reasons were noted, in the event of a <em>Batson </em>challenge by the defense. While such instructions could conceivably be viewed as coaching assistant district attorneys to conceal violations of <em>Batson, </em>I believe the more reasonable interpretation is that all concerned were attempting to guard against false accusations of racial discrimination. In sum, I conclude that the “official policy” evidence is of minimal assistance to petitioner’s contention, and that the issue must be resolved on the basis of what actually occurred at petitioner’s trial.</blockquote>

It is also significant that, in the <em>Bond </em>hearing held in December 2005 (nearly three <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>months before Mr. Ñolas filed this Motion), the habeas petitioner’s claim of a “policy” of discrimination was specifically disputed by the trial ADA whose notes from ADA Sagel’s lecture formed the basis of the claim in <em>Bond </em>and are also a basis for the recusal motion here: “I was never instructed to strike people because of race, and, in fact, it says it right there [referring to notes], never strike because someone is Black.” <em>Bond v.
