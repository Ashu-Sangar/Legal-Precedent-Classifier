The arresting officer took appellant to a hospital where he read appellant the warnings on the December 2003 version of the Implied Consent Form, form DL-26,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and requested that appellant submit to a blood test. Appellant said nothing; the officer read the form again. Appellant then said he needed time to think it over. The officer read the form to appellant a third time, and appellant refused the test. By letter dated June 15, 2004, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing (Penn-DOT) advised appellant his operating privilege was suspended for 18 months for refusing a chemical test, a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547. Appellant appealed the suspension, and in a September 2, 2004 order, the trial court denied appellant’s appeal. On September 30, 2004, appellant filed a motion for supersedeas, which was granted to stay the suspension pending his appeal. Trial Court Order, 9/30/04.</p>

[and] it would be unreasonable and absurd to suggest that the legislature would require police to impart information to arrestees that would have no meaning to them.” <em>Id., </em>at 15.

The clause included in form DL-26 is an accurate statement of the minimum penalties set forth in § 3804(c). This clause does not state the minimum penalties of 72 hours imprisonment and $1000 fine are exhaustive of the penalties set forth in § 3804(c); rather, it states the penalties set forth in § 3804(c) <em>include </em>these minimum penalties, which suggests other penalties are available. While some arrestees may be more willing to submit to a chemical test if provided with the most severe penalties to which they may be subject, this information is not necessary under the statute. As the Commonwealth Court succinctly noted, “It is not the duty of the police to explain the various sanctions available under a given law to an arrestee to give that individual an opportunity to decide whether it is worth it to violate that law.” <em>Weaver, </em>at 2. This inclusion of accurate information concerning the minimum penalties, beyond what the legislature required, does not affect the validity of form DL-26 warnings. Indeed, it informs the arrestee that the penalties are concrete, and not inconsequential.</p>
