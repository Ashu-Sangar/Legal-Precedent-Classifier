The Act of 1927, however, sets forth the procedure to be followed, see e. g., Section 6 of the Act, 5 P.S. § 166, and provides further that the court of common pleas may adopt rules of procedure and practice to be followed to the extent that the rules adopted are not inconsistent with the Act of 1927, see § 5 of the Act of 1927, 5 P.S. § 165. Although both Section 903 of PERA and Section 4 of the Act of 1927, 5 P.
