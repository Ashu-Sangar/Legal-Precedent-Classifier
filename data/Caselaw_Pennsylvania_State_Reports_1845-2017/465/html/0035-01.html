James Morris, a friend of Butts who lived nearby and was visiting him, suffered a gunshot wound of the neck in the same incident. The appellant, Robert James Cooley, was convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree for the death of Butts and of assault with intent to murder for the shooting of Morris. His post trial motions were denied and a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> This direct appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Shortly thereafter Cooley, who lived in the adjacent first floor rear apartment, knocked at the front door. He was admitted by Morris who had seen appellant at Butts’ residence on prior occasions and knew him as “Jim Dandy”. Butts, an invalid, was seated on his bed and remained immobile during the entire episode which followed. Seconds after entering, appellant drew a pistol and commenced firing. The first two shots struck neither Butts nor Morris despite the close proximity of the three men in the room. A third shot discharged errantly as Morris knocked the gun from the appellant’s hand. Appellant then retrieved the gun and shot Morris in the neck. Morris, although retaining consciousness, collapsed on the floor. In consequence, he did <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>not see the fifth shot fired, but he heard it and heard the door to the apartment close a few moments later. By the time Morris was able to get to his feet, appellant had departed and Butts was lying wounded on the floor. Butts hollered: “Get some help, get somebody, get somebody.” Morris hastened to his cousin’s nearby apartment and telephoned to the police.</p>

    <p id="b87-4" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[112,759,1151,920]]]'>McCormick offers two basic requirements for admission of such a declaration under the excited utterance exception : “First, there must be some occurrence or event sufficiently startling to render normal reflective thought processes of an observer inoperative. Second, the statement of the declarant must have been a spontaneous reaction to the occurrence or event and not the result of reflective thought.” McCormick, <em>Evidence, </em>§ 297 at 704 (2d ed. 1972). Here, there can be no doubt that the declarant’s having been shot was an event which is sufficiently startling to satisfy the first element. See <em>Commonwealth v. Noble, </em><a href="/pa/371/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="371 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1237062" data-case-paths="/pa/371/0138-01">371 Pa. 138</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.2d%20760" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="88 A.2d 760">88 A.2d 760</a> (1952).

We disagree.</p>

It is true, of course, that in some instances the time lapse may be so long or the question and answer exchange so unhurried and reflective as to require a finding of nonspontaneity, but such was not the case here. The declarant had been shot only 15 or 20 minutes before making the statement; he had not moved from the spot where he had fallen; he was alone until the arrival of the police and was bleeding and moaning; and the man he named as his assailant lived in an adjacent apartment and could have returned at any time during the 15-20 minute interlude.
