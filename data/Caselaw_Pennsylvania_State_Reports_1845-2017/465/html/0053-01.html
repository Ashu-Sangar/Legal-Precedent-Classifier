On or about May 18, 1973, his two sons, as executors, filed the Pennsylvania inheritance tax return for the estate. On November 14, 1973, the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue submitted to the executors, appellees herein, its Notice of Filing Appraisement. The appraiser for the Commonwealth increased the valuation of two items which were included on the inheritance tax return, and included a third item which the executors had omitted. The first item reappraised was the decedent’s undistributed share of partnership profits from his law firm. The Commonwealth’s appraisement was $35,501.54. Appellees assert that the true value of the asset for Pennsylvania inheritance tax purposes is $22,799.00. The difference in valuation accurately reflects the amount of federal and state income tax which was properly paid on this item by the Estate since the item was “income in respect of a decedent,” which had accrued to the decedent, but on which no income tax had been paid by the decedent because the decedent was a cash basis taxpayer.</p>
    <p id="b104-4" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[202,1402,1147,475]]]'>The second item reappraised was the decedent’s right to receive proceeds from the sale of 200 shares of common stock of Joy Manufacturing Company from the brokerage house of Parker/Hunter, Inc., which proceeds were also stipulated as “income in respect of a decedent.” The executors valued this item at $12,734.85 and the Commonwealth appraised the item át $14,083.86.

The opinion and the order below relied on the decision in <em>Tench Estate, </em>23 Fiduc.Rep. 478 (C.P.Allegheny, 1973) <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> which was never appealed by the Commonwealth. In <em>Tench, </em>the decedent owned a one-third interest in a partnership through which the payments on accounts receivable flowed.

The <em>Tench </em>court reasoned that the asset contained in built-in encumbrance so that if the Pennsylvania inheritance tax value were the full present worth of the receivable, the result would be the imposition of Pennsylvania inheritance tax upon federal income taxes. The only substantial difference between <em>Tench </em>and the present case is that appellees here received a devaluation for the amount of Pennsylvania income taxes paid as well as for federal income taxes.</p>

Under the heading of “Method of computation of tax; residents,” this section states that “. . . the tax shall be computed upon the value of the property, in excess of the deductions hereinafter specified, at the rates in effect at the transferor’s death.” Appellees readily concede that deductions for income taxes imposed after the decedent’s death are not provided for in the Act and that deductions not specifically enumerated are not allowable.

This is so, it argues, because if the executors put the two assets on the auction block, no willing buyer would feel obliged to discount his offer by the amount of income tax due because the buyer would take the items free of any claims for income taxes, since absent a lien, the buyer would not be obligated to pay the income taxes.</p>

Thus two deferred receipt items of, say $1,000 each, which under a will are bequeathed to two different legatees will not only be valued at some lesser amount than $1,000, but at <em>differing </em>lesser amounts depending on the differing brackets of the two beneficiaries.

The Court states that the payment of accumulated dividends and post-mortem dividends and the return of unearned premiums in respect of the decedent’s policies may be “contingent upon criteria which are severable under the terms of the contract from the insurance risk” [opinion of the Court, ante at 120], but nowhere does the opinion indicate how one is to determine these criteria or effectuate a severance. The introduction of these uncertain concepts into what has heretofore been an accepted and uniform pattern of exempting all insurance payments from inheritance tax computation, seems to me unnecessary and confusing. Moreover, while I have no readily available statistics, there are many who die leaving life insurance proceeds as the sole or principal asset transferred to surviving members of their families. The opinion of the Court will require that henceforth each such policy be scrutinized to determine whether there exist “criteria which are severable” from the risk insured against, and file an inheritance tax return accordingly. In light of the relatively small sums usually involved in such dividend and return premium payments, the attempted distinction becomes almost a quibble.</p>

The problems in the federal tax law which the Court is now borrowing are not confined to identifying the kinds of property interests which are embraced within the term “income in respect of a decedent;” they also extend to ascertaining the appropriate deductions which are applicable to such income under section 691(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. See 2 Mertens, <em>Law of Federal Income Taxation, </em>§ 12.102d pp. 419 <em>et seq.; </em>Ferguson, <em>supra </em>n. 5, at 134-148. In those estates where a federal estate tax is payable, the further deduction for a portion of that tax under Sec. 691(c) will become a factor in the determination of the amount of income tax for which the recipient of deferred income items is obligated. The propriety and accuracy of such deductions will, it would appear, now become a concern of the inheritance tax appraiser.</p>

Prior to 1942, as the majority opinion notes, earned but unpaid income items were included in the final returns of a decedent and taxed as part of his income in the tax year ending with his death; the payment of the tax was, of course, an obligation the estate had to defray and the clear value of the estate for Pennsylvania inheritance tax purposes was reduced accordingly. In order to eliminate this “bunching” in the final return of the decedent, the income tax law was changed to impose the income tax on the income to which the decedent was entitled on those persons who received it by reason of his death.

The legislature has never seen fit to make provision for valuing these income items in any way other than ordinary receivables are valued. Nor could the legislature create an inheritance tax deduction with respect to income taxes paid on income with respect to a decedent, for they are no longer debts of the decedent; they only become an estate obligation if the estate happens to be the recipient, in which event the tax is the estate obligation as a separate taxable entity. Contrary to the view expressed by Mr. Justice ROBERTS in his concurring opinion, it seems to me clear that neither of the two sections of the Pennsylvania Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961 which allow a deduction for taxes can be applied to this type of tax obligation. Under Sec. 621 the taxes must have been owing prior to decedent’s death to be taxable; income taxes on income in respect of a decedent are not so owing. Under Sec. 622 a deduction is allowed for death taxes (other than federal estate tax) paid to other states or taxing jurisdictions outside the United States. The taxes we are here concerned with are not death taxes nor are they paid to any other state or to a foreign taxing jurisdiction.</p>

The federal government, when it enacted i 691 of the Internal Revenue Code, did seek to mitigate the effect of a recipient of income in respect of a decedent having to pay both income tax and an estate tax on such property. Thus § 691(c) allows the recipient of such income an offsetting income tax deduction for the portion of any federal estate tax attributable to the inclusion of such items in the decedent’s gross estate. <em>See </em>Income Tax Regulations § 1.691(c)(1). This provision does not, however, eliminate double taxation by the federal government, as the majority opinion seems to suggest. Opinion of the Court, <em>supra, </em>n. 3. It merely allows a portion of the federal estate tax to be taken as an income tax deduction. Thus if the income in respect of a decedent were $25,000 and the estate tax attributable thereto were $5,000, the latter figure would be a deduction from taxable income. Income tax would still be payable on $20,000, and estate tax on $25,000. Sec. 691(c) does not provide for a similar deduction with respect to state death taxes which are based in part on income assets.</p>
