      <blockquote id="Abl" data-blocks='[["BL_471.8",471,[204,1689,1072,482]]]'>“Dilatory practices by lawyers cannot be countenanced. Nor can lawyers be permitted to disrupt the orderly process of disposition of litigation by the sheer weight of the number of cases which they are engaged to try. But it must always be borne in mind that lawsu'ts are more than numbers or punches in computer cards. Individual cases are, of course, of great importance to the litigants involved, and courts must not overreach in their zeal to move cases to such an extent as to allow for no deviations from strict and literal adherence to policies justifiably laid down to improve the condition of the courts. We believe that the instant case is just such a case as requires the tempering of the strict trial policy in order that justice be done.”</blockquote>

The trial began, but upon the appearance of retained counsel, the trial court offered to continue it through the weekend to permit him to enter the case.

On the day trial was to commence, July 6, 1972, appellant was still represented by the Public Defender (although through a different lawyer attached to that office), who on that day appeared with appellant and requested a continuance so that appellant could retain “private” counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a>

    <p id="b476-6" data-blocks='[["BL_476.7",476,[265,1209,1150,691]]]'>The trial court determined, and I agree, that a continuance for that purpose was not warranted. As the Superior Court has well observed, “although a defendant has an absolute right to counsel, he has no absolute right to a particular counsel and so a request for additional time to secure a particular counsel may, in the court’s discretion, be denied.” <em>Com. v. Simpson, </em><a href="/pa-super/222/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="222 Pa. Super. 296" data-case-ids="801861" data-case-paths="/pa-super/222/0296-01">222 Pa.

Merely to order the inexperienced new lawyer to sit with the defendant through the trial to render such assistance as might be requested was, in these circumstances, not adequate.</p>
