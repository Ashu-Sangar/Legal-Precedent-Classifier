We reviewed the arbitration clause and concluded that its broad provision that “[a] 11. claims, disputes and other matters in question arising out of, or relating to, this Contract or the breach thereof . . . shall be decided by arbitration . .” should.be interpreted to extend to any dispute arising from the contractual relationship.</p>

Here, the partners agreed to arbitrate any dispute arising from the winding-up of the partnership affairs. Section 37 cannot be read to allow any partner to withdraw from such an agreement at will. The court’s role in the winding-up of a partnership is to provide an impartial tribunal to resolve disputes which cannot be settled by private means. Arbitration serves this function. Thus, when the partners have validly agreed to arbitrate disputes arising from the winding-up of the partnership, a partner attempting to avoid arbitration cannot meet the statutory requirement of “cause shown” to justify court intervention prior to arbitration. Our interpretation of section 37 is consistent with the policy favoring arbitration. <em>Mendelson v. Shrager, </em>supra; <em>Flightways Corp. v.

    <p id="b78-6" data-blocks='[["BL_78.6",78,[239,947,1147,740]]]'>Appellee argues that section 37 of the Uniform Partnership Act allows a partner of a dissolved partnership to obtain the appointment of a receiver to effect the winding-up and liquidation of the partnership. However, section 37 makes no provision for the appointment of a receiver, nor does any other section of the Act. The power of a court to appoint a receiver in cases arising under section 37 stems not from the statute but from the courts’ equitable powers to appoint a receiver as an ancillary remedy in an action for another form of relief. <em>McDougall v.
