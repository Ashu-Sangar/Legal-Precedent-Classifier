In March, 1964, the parties orally agreed to form a partnership to begin on June <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>1, 1964, whose purpose was the selling and servicing of customer accounts in the industrial control field. The terms of the agreement were that both appellant and appellee would be full-time sales representatives with equal authority as to the operation of the business and with identical compensation plans of $1,000 a month, plus fifty percent of the net profits. Appellee Stotsenburg agreed to pay appellant Frost $5,000 at the commencement of the new venture; however, appellee, being unable to meet this commitment, paid appellant two $1,000 payments, and now owes appellant $3,000, plus six percent interest. During the three and one-half years of business, both appellant and appellee contributed $1,500 each to Autotrols, Inc., when the corporate entity through which all business was conducted was in need of operating capital. In addition to equal management rights, the chancellor also found both parties had equal shares of the profit and loss, the equal right to act for the business and that each party had made contributions of either capital or services to the business. Our review of the record reveals sufficient facts upon which the chancellor could well have found a partnership between appellant Frost and appellee Stotsenburg.

Until the award is reduced to a judgment, there is no basis for appeal. <em>Shellem v. Springfield School District, </em>6 Pa. <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>Cmwlth.Ct. 527, <a href="/citations/?q=297%20A.2d%20179" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="297 A.2d 179">297 A.2d 179</a> (1972); <em>Roy v. North Braddock School District, </em>4 Pa.Cmwlth.Ct. 237, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20A.2d%20550" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="285 A.2d 550">285 A.2d 550</a> (1971) (per Manderino, J). Indeed, had appellants brought this appeal prior to the entry of judgment, this appeal would have been quashed as premature. <em>Rissi v. Levan, </em><a href="/pa/430/0376-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="430 Pa. 376" data-case-ids="1915695" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0376-01">430 Pa. 376</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=243%20A.2d%20353" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="243 A.2d 353">243 A.2d 353</a> (1968). Since appellants filed their appeal within 30 days of the entry of judgment, their appeal is timely and should be considered. The merits of this appeal therefore should be reached.</p>
    <p id="b243-4" data-blocks='[["BL_243.4",243,[102,805,1151,470]]]'>Appellee filed exceptions to the post-accounting adjudication in which he asked the court to make Autotrols, Inc., and three other shareholders of that corporation jointly and severally liable for the judgment against Richard Frost. The court en banc dismissed the exception. However the court failed to make clear in its decree that judgment was against only Richard Frost. Accordingly appellee entered judgment against all appellants.</p>
    <p id="b243-5" data-blocks='[["BL_243.5",243,[100,1314,1152,359]]]'>Appellants ask us to remand this case to the court en banc so that its decree can be made to conform with the dismissal of exceptions and the judgment against all parties other than Richard Frost stricken Appellants are clearly entitled to this and I would grant them the requested relief. Since the majority fails to do so, I dissent.</p>
    <p id="b243-6" data-blocks='[["BL_243.6",243,[101,1704,1149,88]]]'>I also dissent from the majority’s resolution of appeal No. 138.</p>
