Aaron was first employed by Sidco at will, under an oral contract, in 1967 when he was seventeen years of age. His initial salary was $60.00 per week. Following a two-year apprenticeship, during which he was exposed to all aspects of Sidco’s business and was trained by Sidco salesmen, Aaron executed a written employment contract with Sidco which contained the restrictive covenant at issue here. This contract provided for a term of employment of one year with automatic renewal from year to year, subject to termination by either party upon sixty days’ written notice. The covenant provided:</p>
    <blockquote id="b635-4" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[161,1017,1105,748]]]'>“7. That the Employee agrees during the term of this contract, and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, that he will not be engaged in the same or similar type of business as the Employer is engaged in, in any area of which Richmond, Virginia, is the southern point, Pittsburgh, Pa., the western point, and Boston, Massachusetts, the northern point, and should he do so, the Employer shall be entitled to an injunction to be issued by any Court of competent jurisdiction enjoining and restraining the Employee and each and every other person, firm, associates or corporations concerned therein from the continuance of such employment, service, or other acts in aid of the business of such rival company or concern.”</blockquote>

      <em>Reading Aviation Service </em>is distinguishable from the present case. There the covenant had no territorial limitation, although the nature of the business involved (the operation of an airport) was such that the relevant geographical area could have been readily specified at the time the contract was formed.

An employer who extracts a covenant in furtherance of such a purpose comes to the court of equity with unclean hands and is, therefore, not entitled to equitable enforcement of the covenant. Here, on the other hand, the covenant was limited to the territory in which Sidco operated. While it was known that Aaron would not cover the entire territory, it was not known when the contract was formed precisely what territory he would cover, so that it was impossible to define in advance any narrower territory which would insure full protection for Sidco.</p>

      <em>Service </em>is distinguishable on its facts, as Mr. Justice Roberts’ opinion points out. There, the covenant was without limitation in both time and space. Here, on the other hand the covenant was limited to a period of two years following the termination of Aaron’s employment, and was limited in space to Sidco’s trade territory. In this respect, this case is substantially the same as <em>Bettinger v. Carl Berke Associates, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/455/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="455 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="581988" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0243-01">455 Pa. 243</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%20296" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="314 A.2d 296">314 A.2d 296</a> (1974), where we affirmed an injunctive decree partially enforcing a restrictive covenant against a former sales employee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

It is also worth noting that Sidco did not seek the covenant until after Aaron had completed a two-year apprenticeship., during which he had been systematically exposed to all aspects of Sidco’s business and accompanied more experienced salesmen on their rounds. Sidco contends that it has a protectible interest in the knowledge and skills acquired by Aaron during this period. If this contention is correct, then the chancellor might have been justified in enforcing the covenant according to its original terms, for Aaron may use his sales training to Sidco’s disadvantage in any area where Sidco does business. As we observed in <em>Morgan’s Home Equipment Corp. v. Martucci, </em><a href="/pa/390/0618-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="390 Pa. 618" data-case-ids="1275672" data-case-paths="/pa/390/0618-01">390 Pa. 618</a>, 631, <a href="/citations/?q=136%20A.2d%20838" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="136 A.2d 838">136 A.2d 838</a>, 846 (1957), an employer is entitled to protection from the use of special training imparted to his employees not only in the solicitation and servicing of former customers, but also “in competition for the patronage of the public at large.” Even if Sid-co’s contention is ultimately rejected, it cannot be said that Sidco’s belief that it has a protectible interest in Aaron’s sales training is so unreasonable as to warrant stripping the company of whatever other protection it may legitimately claim.</p>

In both cases, the covenant was reasonably limited in time, and was limited in space to the employer’s trade territory; in both cases, the employer sought to enforce the covenant only in the area actually serviced by the employee.

    <p id="b658-4" data-blocks='[["BL_658.4",658,[306,835,1147,1175]]]'>Whether a restrictive covenant is an illegal restraint of trade must be determined both at the time the covenant is made and also at the time it <em>is to be enforced. </em>If the covenant is unreasonable when made, the illegal restraint begins immediately not when the employee ceases employment. Such a covenant perpetually hovers over the employee, who must act at his peril when considering termination of employment because he does not know whether he will be faced with a law suit challenging his right to obtain new employment, and if challenged by a law suit, whether he will suffer economic harm because a court determines <em>ex post facto </em>that he violated a covenant, the limitations of which were not clearly spelled out until after a burdensome and costly law suit. Thus, an employee faced with a covenant barring him from competing anywhere with a former employer lives under a constant threat that if he finds new employment, even in an area not covered by his present employer, he will be faced with litigation. A covenant that is unreasonable <em>when made </em>has the effect of illegally restraining trade from that moment, for it is then that it begins its coercive effect on the employee’s freedom of choice.</p>
    <p id="b658-5" data-blocks='[["BL_658.5",658,[305,2046,1142,310]]]'>The covenant in this case not only prohibited solicitation of the employer’s customers, <em>see Bettinger v. C. Berke Assoc., Inc., </em><a href="/pa/455/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="455 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="582171" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0100-01">455 Pa. 100</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%20296" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="314 A.2d 296">314 A.2d 296</a> (1974), but also prohibited the employee from soliciting entirely new customers in geographic locations where he had never worked for the employer.</p>

      <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>How was the appellant to know the breadth of the freedom of choice which he had during the term of his employment with the appellee before the handing down of the majority’s opinion?</p>
    <p id="b659-4" data-blocks='[["BL_659.4",659,[116,548,1150,1243]]]'>The majority says that an employer should be allowed to write a covenant covering its entire territory because it may not know where the employee will be assigned during the term of his employment. The majority implies that the employer is helpless to do otherwise under such circumstances. That argument simply doesn’t hold water. All that an employer need do is write a covenant specifying that the employee will not be permitted to compete by soliciting any of the employer’s former customers, or perhaps, that the employee will not be permitted to compete in any city, or specific area, in which the employee has worked for the employer. Drawing such a covenant is not a difficult matter. The employee then, <em>during the course of his employment, </em>would know exactly what limitations have been placed on his freedom of choice should he decide to terminate his employment. In the present case, had the covenant been written to prohibit the employee from soliciting former customers, or from competing in the cities or areas where he had worked, the employee would have known that he was free to terminate his employment and engage “in the same or similar types of business” in many places which were illegally included in the present covenant.</p>
    <p id="b659-5" data-blocks='[["BL_659.5",659,[121,1827,1149,532]],["BL_660.1",660,[265,296,1144,202]]]'>The view I have taken presents no unrealistic burden on employers, yet at the same time avoids illegal restraints of trade when covenants are made and when enforcement is sought. If an employer is truly concerned only about protecting its interest, there is no threat to it in writing a covenant that is reasonable when made. The covenant in this case contained restrictions not necessary for the protection of the employer. Restrictions prohibiting the employee from engaging in business in certain territories, whether or not the employee ever did <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>business in those territories, or whether or not he ever came in contact with customers of his present employer, were not necessary for the protection of the employer. The covenant therefore was an illegal restraint of trade.</p>
    <p id="b660-4" data-blocks='[["BL_660.4",660,[260,522,1151,912]]]'>Furthermore, a restrictive covenant, even if reasonable when made, would not be entitled to enforcement if at the time enforcement is sought, it would be unreasonable to give effect to the covenant. Circumstances may change during the employee’s term of employment. The employee’s work territory may have been reduced during the term of his employment. The employer’s need for protection may have diminished. Thus, a restrictive covenant might be reasonable in time and territory at the time executed, but unreasonable when enforced. It could well be that under such circumstances enforcement of the original covenant serves no protective purpose for the employer. A covenant, <em>unreasonable when made, </em>however, cannot be cured by changed circumstances because to do so would sanction the illegal restraint of trade limiting the employee’s freedom of choice during the term of his employment.</p>
