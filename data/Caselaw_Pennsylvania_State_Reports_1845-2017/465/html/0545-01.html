    <p id="b593-8" data-blocks='[["BL_593.9",593,[155,1623,1147,420]],["BL_594.1",594,[289,341,1150,1169]]]'>The nature of Mazzacaro’s challenged practice may be briefly stated. As part of his casualty adjustment practice, Mazzacaro has solicited the claims of injured parties against alleged tort-feasors who are insured, or their insurers. For a contingent fee of ten to twenty per cent of any resultant settlement, Mazzacaro investigates the accident, estimates the, dollar amount of damages sustained, writes a demand letter to the party from whom <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>recovery is sought and attempts to negotiate a settlement. Mazzacaro insists that this representation is undertaken on the assumption that liability exists and that all that is at stake is agreement on the amount of damages; he states that when the alleged tort-feasor or insurer contests liability, he voluntarily withdraws his services and recommends that a lawyer be consulted. Significantly, when such withdrawal occurs, Mazzacaro receives no compensation from the claimant. Mazzacaro contends that his representation of third-party claimants under the above-described circumstances is authorized by his public adjuster’s license, issued pursuant to the Public Adjuster Act, Act of 1921, <em>supra, </em>40 P.S. §§ 301, 302. In the alternative, he asserts that since his representation of the injured person is predicated on the assumption of liability by the person against whom the claim is made, it does not involve the exercise of legal judgments or the practice of law. Lastly, appellant urges that we reverse the decree below on the ground that the statute proscribing the unauthorized practice of law is unconstitutionally vague, and therefore, unenforceable. We find no merit in these contentions.</p>

Public Adjuster Act, <em>supra, </em>§ 3, 40 P.S. § 302. The scope of his authority under this license is controlled by the definition of “public adjuster” as set forth in Section 301 of the statute:</p>
    <blockquote id="b594-6" data-blocks='[["BL_594.6",594,[333,2004,1099,367]],["BL_595.1",595,[186,287,1104,522]]]'>“The term, ‘public adjuster,’ as used in this act, shall include every person, co-partnership, association, and corporation advertising, soliciting business, or holding himself or itself out to the public, as an adjuster of claims for losses or damages arising out of policies of insurance, surety, or indemnity upon property, persons, or insurable business interests within <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>this Commonwealth, and receiving any compensation or reward for the giving of advice or assistance to the assured in the adjustment of claims for such losses, or who for compensation or reward, whether by way of salary or commission or otherwise, directly or indirectly, solicit business, investigate or adjust losses, or advise the assured with reference to claims for losses, on behalf of any other person, partnership, association, or corporation engaged in the business of adjusting losses.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b595-4" data-blocks='[["BL_595.4",595,[142,848,1151,583]]]'>Appellant reads this provision as defining two types of public adjusters — (1) those who adjust “claims for losses or damages arising out of policies of insurance . upon property [or] persons . . and (2) those who for compensation give “advice or assistance to the <em>assured </em>in the adjustment of claims . . .” (emphasis supplied). Because third-party claimants seek to recover claims arising out of policies of insurance, appellant urges that the definition in the first numbered clause confers authority under his license to undertake third-party representation.</p>
    <p id="b595-7" data-blocks='[["BL_595.5",595,[143,1485,1148,474]]]'>Appellant’s argument, however, ignores the grammatical construction of Section 301. The two clauses which he attempts to isolate are connected by the conjunctive “and”, not by the disjunctive “or”. We read this section as describing and defining but one type of public adjuster, the definition containing several distinct, but necessary, elements. Thus we reject the view that clause (1) in the preceding paragraph confers authority to represent third persons.</p>

There is however, <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>no merit to this construction. The term “assured” is generally considered to be synonymous with the term “insured,” viz., the person who is subject to the risk of loss which the policy of insurance has been issued to protect against.

The threads of legal consequences often weave their way through even casual contemporary interactions. There are times, of course, when it is clearly within the ken of lay persons to appreciate the legal problems and consequences involved in a given situation and the factors which should influence necessary decisions. No public interest would be advanced by requiring these lay judgments to be made exclusively by lawyers. Where, however, a judgment requires the abstract understanding of legal principles and a refined skill for their concrete application, the exercise of legal judgment is called for. <em>Shortz v. Farrell, </em><a href="/pa/327/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="327 Pa. 81" data-case-ids="1176738" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0081-01">327 Pa. 81</a>, 85, <a href="/citations/?q=193%20A.%2020" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="193 A. 20">193 A. 20</a>, 21 (1937). While at times the line between lay and legal judgments may be a fine one, it is nevertheless discernible. Each given case must turn on a careful analysis of the particular judgment involved and the expertise that must be brought to bear on its exercise.

Even when liability is not technically “contested”, an assessment of the likelihood that liability can be established in a court of law is a crucial factor in weighing the strength of one’s bargaining position. A negotiator cannot possibly know how large a settlement he can exact unless he can probe the degree of unwillingness of the other side to go to court. Such an assessment, however, involves an understanding of the applicable tort principles (including the elements of negligence and contributory negligence), a grasp of the rules of evidence, and an ability to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the client’s case vis a vis that of the adversary. The acquisition of such knowledge is not within the ability of lay persons, but rather involves the application of abstract legal principles to the concrete facts of the given claim. As a consequence, it is inescapable that lay adjusters who undertake to negotiate settlements of the claims of third-party claimants must exercise legal judgments in so doing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> It has been well said that</p>

Such a claim is misplaced. Mazzacaro is <em>not </em>here being criminally prosecuted under the statute for his prior conduct. Rather, he is being <em>prospectively </em>restrained from engaging in a clearly specified type of conduct — representation of third-party claimants. The injunction has been issued, not as a punishment for Mazzacaro’s past practices, but to restrain his continuing practice in order to protect against future harm to the public welfare. The injunction provides Mazzacaro with a sufficiently definite notice of the standard to which his conduct must <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>conform in the future.

Mazzacaro is not bound by a reviewable code of professional ethics designed to deter him from the temptations of self-interest which can frequently arise in the course of legal representation. Yet, such temptations clearly inhere in Mazzacaro’s contingent fee arrangement with claimants. Mazzacaro receives compensation only if <em>he </em>effects a settlement. As a consequence he can reject an unfair settlement offer and recommend litigation only at the expense of his own fee. Unlike a lawyer, however, he is not subject to disciplinary sanctions designed to protect the public from the dangers inherent in such temptations.

Appellant argues that, by logical implication, a holding such as we make today invalidates the long-standing use of lay adjusters by insurance companies in negotiating settlements with third-party claimants. We are not persuaded that such a result follows. The insurance company adjuster is an agent of the company hired to investigate and evaluate claims being made against the company. He does not hold himself out to the public as competent to represent their interests and indeed, only deals with the public from a plainly adversary posture. In his dealings with his employer he works as an adjunct to a legal department or a lawyer representing the insurer and as a consequence is not required by the nature of his undertaking to exercise any independent legal judgments. Courts which have been called upon to do so have drawn the distinction we suggest. Thus the Supreme Court of Missouri has said:</p>
