He then rested until 3:05 A.M., during which time defendant was offered but declined any food. Questioning resumed at 3:05 A.M. At 4:10 A.M. defendant was given water.

The appellant, however, after conferring with counsel who had an opportunity to read the confession, reaffirmed, on the advice of counsel, his willingness to make the statement by signing the statement in the presence of counsel. Psychologically coercive influences may have affected the appellant prior to his consultation with counsel, but it cannot be said that the signing of the statement after consultation with counsel was a product of those factors. Counsel had not been subjected to those factors and after being informed of the statement advised his client to sign the statement. Appellant was obviously following the advice of counsel. Had counsel advised otherwise, any statement made or signed by the appellant prior to the appearance of counsel would present an entirely different question. Under these circumstances, however, <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>we cannot conclude that the prosecution failed to meet its burden of proving the voluntariness of the confession by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

Until the corpus delicti is established, introduction of the accused’s statements is inadmissible. <em>Commonwealth v. May, </em><a href="/pa/451/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="451 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="1948610" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0031-01">451 Pa. 31</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20368" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="301 A.2d 368">301 A.2d 368</a> (1973); <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b466-5" data-blocks='[["BL_466.5",466,[279,1055,1148,1289]]]'>To sustain a conviction for arson, the prosecution must establish that there was a fire, that it was of incendiary origin, and that the accused was the guilty party.

To establish the corpus delicti, the Commonwealth must show proof of death resulting from a fire of incendiary origin. <em>Commonwealth v. May, supra. </em>Since the prosecution need not affirmatively exclude the possibility of accident or suicide when proving the corpus delicti, the prosecution “has met its burden of establishing a corpus delicti for the purpose of introducing appellant’s extra-judicial statements when it has established that the fire causing death resulted from human intervention even though the evidence is consistent with both accidental and criminal conduct.” <em>Commonwealth v. May, supra, </em><a href="/pa/451/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="451 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="1948610" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0031-01">451 Pa. at 33</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20368" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="301 A.2d 368">301 A.2d at 370</a>. The prosecution presented an expert witness who testified that, in his opinion, the fire which destroyed the Quattlebaum house was started by an accelerant such as gasoline or kerosene, and two other witnesses who testified that they had smelled gasoline while investigating the fire. From this we find that the prosecution met its burden of establishing the corpus delicti of arson. Thus, appellant’s confession was properly admitted into evidence.</p>
