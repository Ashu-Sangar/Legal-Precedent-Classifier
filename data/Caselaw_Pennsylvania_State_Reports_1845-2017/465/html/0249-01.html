The legislature apparently felt that such seriousness could best be connoted by inclusion of the term “complete”. However, while utilizing the term “complete” to distinguish a Section 306(c) loss of hearing from a “partial” loss of hearing which, under Section 306(b), is compensable only upon a showing of economic disability, the legislature did not intend that the term “complete loss of hearing” be read in a literal and absolute sense. To insist upon a literal and absolute interpretation would require, as the Board noted, “that a person . . . stand beside the mouth of an erupting cannon and hear absolutely nothing in either ear before his hearing loss could be described as ‘complete’ ”. Such <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>an interpretation would be inconsistent with the test applicable to the other specific losses enumerated within Section 306(c) and would effectively frustrate the remedial purposes behind our workmen’s compensation legislation.</p>
