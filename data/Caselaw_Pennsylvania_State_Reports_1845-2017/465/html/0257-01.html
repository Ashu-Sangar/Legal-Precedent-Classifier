    <p id="b307-6" data-blocks='[["BL_307.6",307,[101,1318,1150,633]]]'>From the outset the defense was handicapped because appellant claimed he had no recollection of the occurrence. This inability to recall the circumstances surrounding the incident was attributed to his heavy consumption of alcoholic beverages during that period. The only known living witness to the event was appellant’s wife who was also a victim. Equally significant, appellant has never seriously questioned the Commonwealth’s assertion that he fired the shots that wounded his wife and caused the death of his son. There was also competent evidence that strongly suggested appellant had no remorse for his acts.</p>

It is asserted that <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>counsel was derelict in failing to insist upon a degree of guilt hearing which is mandated under Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 319A. This, claim arises because trial counsel attempted to persuade the court that there was no necessity to hear the testimony of the Commonwealth’s witnesses since the prosector’s agreement to a finding of murder in the second degree had been secured.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> A reading of the record reveals this course of action was probably inspired by a realization that the evidence might well have caused the court serious question as to the appropriateness of a certification that the offense rose no higher than second degree. In any event, the court did receive the testimony and the evidence unquestionably established that appellant was guilty of <em>at least </em>murder in the second degree.</p>

The obvious response to this contention is that there was no evidence of provocation or passion. Mrs. Skurkis’ version eliminated any possible theory of a killing in passion. Although she was not in the room at the moment the son was shot, she had just left her husband and son seconds before and there was no evidence of any argument which might have precipitated the occurrence. To the contrary other testimony suggested that appellant’s acts resulted from a long standing dissatisfaction the father held towards his son. To accept appellant’s position would require a finding that counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a nonexistent theory. See, <em>Commonwealth v. Boone, </em><a href="/pa/450/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="450 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="1947052" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0357-01">450 Pa. 357</a>, 359, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20699" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="301 A.2d 699">301 A.2d 699</a>, 700 (1973); <em>Commonwealth v.

Moreover, it is clear that this complaint is also without merit. Appellant has failed to indicate specifically the objectionable statements to which he refers in this argument or to designate the witness or witnesses who allegedly offered this testimony. A reading of the transcript of the sentencing hearing reflects that the entire proceeding was devoted to witnesses called by appellant to supply the court with that information which the defense wished the court apprised before the imposition of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b309-5" data-blocks='[["BL_309.5",309,[102,1436,1150,675]]]'>Finally, appellant urges us to find that former counsel was incompetent because he did not advise him that the court would appoint counsel to prosecute an appeal if appellant did not have the financial resources to continue to retain private counsel. Here again this issue does not relate to the quality of representation at the time of the entry of the plea. This assertion touches upon whether appellant has been denied his right to an appeal and if substantiated would only justify the allowance of an appeal as though timely filed. It would not support appellant’s request that the plea of guilt be invalidated.</p>
