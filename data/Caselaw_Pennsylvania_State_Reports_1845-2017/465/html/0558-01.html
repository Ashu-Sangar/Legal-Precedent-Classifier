Toward the end of March, 1970, Mrs. Stauffer became suspicious that her husband had become involved with another woman, and on March 26 she consulted an attorney for advice about her domestic situation. Shortly thereafter, she confronted her husband with her suspicions, and he admitted to her not only that he had been engaged in an adulterous relationship, but that the “other woman” was Mrs. Stauffer’s own sister, Victoria Gavin. Subsequently, Edward Gavin, the husband of Victoria, came to the Stauffer home, and in the presence of Mrs. Stauffer and Mr. Gavin, Mr. Stauffer wrote out a “confession” in which he detailed his involvement with Mrs. Gavin.</p>

Appellant herein contests each of these conclusions.</p>

The test in either case is whether the findings are adequately supported by the record. The chancellor’s findings are entitled to particular weight in a case in which the credibility of the witnesses must be carefully evaluated, because he has had the opportunity to hear them and to observe their demeanor on the stand. <em>Charles v.

Appellant is mistaken, however, in assuming both that the chancellor found a confidential relationship in this case and that he needed to do so in order to impose a constructive trust.</p>
    <p id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.5",615,[130,1339,1155,1022]],["BL_616.1",616,[266,319,1149,311]]]'>The chancellor’s determination was based not on the abuse of a confidential relationship, but on his conclusion that the transfer was “fraudulently induced by threats and misrepresentations of the Defendant.” It is well-established that “Where the owner of property transfers it, being induced by fraud, duress or undue influence of the transferee, the transferee holds the property upon a constructive trust for the transferor,” Restatement of Restitution § 166 (1937), and that where the transfer is so induced, a constructive trust will be imposed without proof of a confidential relationship. See <em>Chambers v. Chambers, </em>supra; <em>Christy v. Sill, </em><a href="/pa/95/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="95 Pa. 380" data-case-ids="492974" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0380-01">95 Pa. 380</a> (1880). Whether or not a confidential relationship exists in a given case is usually a question of fact to be determined by no inflexible rule but by a weighing of the particular factors present in that case. The mere finding of such a relationship does not in itself cause a constructive trust to be imposed; its effect is simply to impose a burden upon the party benefiting from the trans<a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>action of proving that he took no unfair advantage of his relationship with the other. By the same token, absent a finding of confidential relationship, the complaining party may still prove unjust enrichment. See generally Note, Confidential Relationships in Pennsylvania Law, 97 Pa.L.Rev. 712 (1949).</p>
    <p id="b616-4" data-blocks='[["BL_616.4",616,[258,686,1156,1663]],["BL_617.1",617,[143,293,1146,94]]]'>But although the chancellor’s conclusion in this case did not depend upon a finding of confidential relationship, we must still examine the actual relationship between the parties to determine whether or not the requisite unjust enrichment was present. In doing so, we must focus on the relationship between the parties at the time of the transaction in question. <em>Hamberg v. Barshy, </em><a href="/pa/355/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="355 Pa. 462" data-case-ids="468954" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0462-01">355 Pa. 462</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.2d%20345" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="50 A.2d 345">50 A.2d 345</a> (1947). Therefore, although it is a pertinent factor, it is not necessarily a controlling one that the chancellor found “at all times during their marriage, the Plaintiff had made any important financial decisions, upon which the Defendant relied.” Mr. Stauffer’s decision to turn over to his wife, without meaningful consideration, his share of what the record indicates was by fair his largest asset, was not an ordinary “important financial decision” and can only be interpreted in relation to the unique situation in which he found himself at that time. Furthermore, even if the relationship between the parties was not the sort in which our courts have traditionally found a confidential relationship sufficient to shift the burden of proof, we do not have to regard the transaction as merely an arm’s-length one. Human relationships are frequently too complex to be classified simply as either “confidential” or “arm’s-length”; a relationship can have elements of confidentiality without being strictly a “confidential relationship,” and less diligence is required of a plaintiff who relies to his detriment on the closeness of his relationship to the defendant than of one who deals on a genuinely arm’s-length basis.

We can also infer that she was particularly distressed that the woman her husband had become involved with was her own sister.

The fact remains, however, that he was mistaken in his assumption that his entireties property jointly held with his wife could have been reached by a creditor of him alone; property owned by tenants by the entireties is not subject to the debts of either spouse, and they may alien it without infringing upon the rights of their individual creditors. <em>Murphey v.

The considerations pertinent to the criminal law, however, are not necessarily those pertinent in a court of equity.

The lawyer testified by deposition that Mrs. Stauffer had said nothing to him about an impending lawsuit, and that his understanding from her was that the parties had agreed upon the transfer as a means of securing the wife and children “in the eventuality there was a break-up of the marriage.” Mr. Stauffer’s testimony, however, indicates that he connected his wife’s urging that he save the house by making the conveyance with the advice she was receiving from the attorney.</p>

In his discussion the chancellor stated that the “total abatement” of marital relations followed “immediately” after the transfer, while his finding of fact was that it occurred “shortly after the conveyance.” Mr. Stauffer actually testified that his wife moved out of their bedroom and became completely estranged from him on the third day after the conveyance. While the legal conclusion of fraud and misrepresentation would have been more strongly supported had the record indicated that the termination of marital relations was immediate rather than a few days later, we cannot find as a matter of law that the chancellor’s conclusion was incorrect, since there is no requirement that the subsequent conduct that will justify an inference of fraudulent intent be immediate.</p>

There the husband abandoned his wife and home and maintained adulterous relationships for three and one-half years. During this period his wife, daughter, and son-in-law paid all tax, insurance, and repair expenses in connection with the home. Finding a court order to support his wife too onerous, he finally threatened to move back into the house unless his wife released him from the order. When she refused, he tried to force his way into the -house, and when he was ejected, he brought an action in equity against his wife, son-in-law, and daughter seeking an injunction compelling them to cease interfering with his right of <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>peaceful possession in the entireties property. In the course of the hearing, his wife testified that she would admit him into the home if he stopped his philandering and resumed the marital relationship, but he candidly a’dmitted that he had no intention of doing so and only brought the action in order to force his wife to release him from the support order. Confronted with this continuing course of opprobrious conduct toward the defendant, far in excess of the original adultery, the chancellor applied the clean hands doctrine and barred him from equitable relief.</p>

The majority relies on events which occurred subsequent to the transfer, including the “total abatement” of marital relations either the day after or three days after the transfer. This does not support, by “clear, explicit and unequivocal” evidence, appellant’s intent to defraud her husband. Numerous other possible explanations exist for this behavior.
