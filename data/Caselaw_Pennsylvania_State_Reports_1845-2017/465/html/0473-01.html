During the year in question, 1970, it was determined that every twenty-third registered voter in Delaware County would have to receive a juror qualification questionnaire in order to obtain enough jurors for the year. Therefore, one jury commissioner pulled a slip from a basket containing the names of the forty-nine municipalities comprising Delaware County. The other jury commissioner pulled a slip from a basket containing twenty-three slips, with each slip numbered from one to- twenty-three. Springfield Township was the name drawn and the number eleven was drawn. Starting with the eleventh voter on the voter registration list of Springfield Township every twenty-third name on the total voter registration list was then selected by the computer to receive a juror qualification questionnaire.</p>

Although the voter registration form does contain a designation for the registrant’s race, such designation is not a factor in the juror selection process. Rather, this designation is used only to fully identify the registered voter and Jones does not contend that blacks are denied the opportunity to register to vote. The voter registration form is considered only in arriving at the names of qualified voters whose names are then placed on the IBM computer cards. Most importantly, the juror qualification questionnaires which are sent to prospective jurors contain no designation as to race.</p>

The majority states that, even though blacks register to vote in a proportion smaller than the proportion of blacks in the general population, the defendant was not denied his right to an impartial jury because (1) “a group of persons who have failed to register to vote has never been considered to constitute a ‘cognizable group’ ” and (2) the nonregistration was voluntary in the sense that no one had affirmatively barred their registration. <em>This defies logic! </em>If blacks (and probably other minorities and young people) are less likely to register to vote, then any jury pool that uses voter registration lists as a source of jurors cannot possibly represent a cross section of the community and <em>whether the nonregistration is voluntary or coerced is irrelevant.
