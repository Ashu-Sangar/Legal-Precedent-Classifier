Soon thereafter, Martinez became embroiled in an altercation with Herbert “Junior” Pennington over the operation of the bar’s cigarette vending machine in which Martinez had apparently lost some money. Before any blows were exchanged, however, the bartender separated the potential combatants and each took up a seat at opposite sides of the bar; Pennington rejoining his companions Clenzo West, Albert Brown, Ray McClendon and the appellant, Harold Roux. At this point, Roux said to Pennington, “Be cool ‘June’, be cool ‘June’; that is a head.” Pennington interpreted this admonition to mean that Martinez was a potential robbery victim.</p>

During this period of time, Roux and McClendon was seen passing a black-handled knife, the eventual murder weapon, between themselves while they sat at the bar. When Martinez left the bar he was followed, shortly thereafter, by Roux, Mc-Clendon, Pennington, West and Brown. These five individuals came upon Martinez in the street outside the bar and commenced beating him with their fists and various implements. This beating lasted for approximately two or three minutes during which Martinez was forced to the ground. The last two assailants beating Martinez were Roux and McClendon, the three other confederates having crossed the street to a nearby corner. McClendon then took the aforementioned black-handled knife from Roux and, while Roux was walking away, McClendon stabbed Martinez three times. Everybody then fled the scene with Roux taking the murder weapon and hiding it <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>at the home of his girl friend.

However, in <em>Wilson, </em>unlike the instant situation, the evidence indicated that the fight which resulted in the victim’s death was spontaneous rather than planned. And, whereas Roux was clearly aware of the presence of the murder weapon, the defendant in <em>Wilson </em>did not encourage, nor was he even aware of, the use of the knife. <em>Commonwealth v.
