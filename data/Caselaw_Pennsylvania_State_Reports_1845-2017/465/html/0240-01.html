Hirt, President and Manager of the Erie Insurance Exchange [Exchange], discharged Sanford Dunson, a black man, from his employment with the Exchange. On June 14, 1971, Dunson filed a formal complaint with the Erie Human Relations Commission [Commission] alleging unlawful racial discrimination in his discharge. Subsequently, on March 6, 1972, after two informal investigatory hearings revealed that probable cause did exist for crediting Dunson’s allegations, a formal public hearing on the charge was held. On April 14, 1972, the Commission determined that the Exchange was guilty of unlawful racial discrimination in the discharge of Dunson. The Commission ordered the Ex<a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>change to reinstate Dunson to the position he had formerly held and to recompense Dunson for back pay from the date of his discharge. The Exchange received notice of this adjudication on April 15, 1972. However, it failed to comply with the Commission’s directives; nor did it appeal the Commission’s findings.</p>
    <p id="b289-4" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[116,632,1148,801]]]'>Failing to obtain compliance with its order the Commission, on October 16, 1972, filed a complaint in equity with the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County seeking a mandatory injunction to compel compliance with its prior order. Annexed to the complaint was a copy of the Commission’s findings and order. The Exchange then filed preliminary .objections in the nature of a demurrer on the grounds that the Commission, in its complaint, had failed to sufficiently allege unlawful racial discrimination and had failed to adequately identify the reason for Dunson’s discharge. The court, after a review of the record, sustained the Exchange’s preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint. The court found that the Commission had improperly concluded there was unlawful racial discrimination in Dunson’s discharge.</p>

The Commonwealth Court, therefore, determined that it was improper for the Court of Common Pleas to pass upon the merits of the Commission’s adjudication that unlawful racial discrimination had precipitated Dunson’s discharge.

However, the considerations which led this Court in <em>Price </em>to permit such an attack upon the merits of the Commission’s adjudication are not present here. It must be noted that the decision in <em>Price </em>predated both the Constitutional Amendments of 1968 and the enactment of the Local Agency Law. Further, in <em>Price </em>this Court first considered whether there was any right available to directly appeal the Commission’s adjudication. Then, having determined that no right of direct appeal existed, the Court stated at <a href="/citations/?q=419%20Pa.%20569" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="419 Pa. 569">419 Pa. 569</a>-570, <a href="/citations/?q=215%20A.2d%20661" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="215 A.2d 661">215 A.2d at 664</a>; “For the reasons listed above, defendants had no right of <em>direct appeal </em>to either the Common Pleas Courts of Philadelphia or to this Court; consequently, in the enforcement proceeding, they cannot be deemed to have waived, by failing to exercise a non-existent right, the opportunity to attack the order of the Commission.” If in <em>Price </em>there existed the right to directly appeal the Commission’s adjudication, a different result would have been necessary.</p>

However, if the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission seeks a court’s assistance in enforcement of an order, the court may “make and enter, upon the pleadings, testimony and proceedings set forth in such transcript, an order or decree enforcing, modifying and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside, in whole or in part, the order of the Commission.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The Exchange contends that, due to this difference in the powers granted to the court of enforcement, the supremacy clause, outlined above, mandates the enforcement proceedings of the state act be deemed applicable to the Erie Human Relations Ordinance which, implicitly, would give the Exchange the right to contest the merits of the Commission’s adjudication in the enforcement proceeding.</p>

These two provisions are in clear language and, while the <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>procedures outlined therein are not the same, it is not the “interpretation” of these provisions which is different.
