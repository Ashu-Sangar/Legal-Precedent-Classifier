    <p id="b383-4" data-blocks='[["BL_383.4",383,[106,660,1151,960]]]'>On August 23, 1973, appellant was arrested and charged with murder, robbery, burglary, conspiracy, and a violation of the Uniform Firearms Act in connection with the shooting of James T. Hogan during the armed robbery of Czartoryski’s Cafe in Erie. On September 13, 1974, after the jury was sworn and the district attorney had completed his opening remarks, appellant entered his guilty plea to a general charge of murder, with the remaining indictments being nolle prossed by the Commonwealth, pursuant to a plea bargain. The murder indictment was clearly based upon the felony-murder rule, with appellant’s felony being that of robbery. Appellant argues that the on-the-record colloquy failed to disclose the elements of the underlying felony of robbery which was the basis of the murder indictment and, therefore, the colloquy did not meet this court’s requirements as enunciated in <em>Ingram. </em>We agree with appellant’s contention.</p>

In order to demonstrate that a defendant possesses such understanding, he certainly must be told more than just that he has been charged with murder or robbery, for example. While such terms clearly connote some meaning to the layman, this meaning does not always embrace the basic legal elements of the crime. If this were not the case, there would be no need for instructions to a jury on such points, for certainly, an average defendant cannot be presumed to understand more than an average juror. Thus, for an examination to demonstrate a defendant’s understanding of the charge, the record must disclose that the elements of the crime or crimes charged where outlined in understandable terms.

Jackson, </em><a href="/pa/450/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="450 Pa. 417" data-case-ids="1947021" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0417-01">450 Pa. 417</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=299%20A.2d%20209" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="299 A.2d 209">299 A.2d 209</a> (1973), both of which dealt with extensive colloquys <em>on this point, imply </em>that such examination is mandatory.
