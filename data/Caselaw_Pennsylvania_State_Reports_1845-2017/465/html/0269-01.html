Under appellant’s proposed construction the statutory procedure would be usable only in isolated cases of prosecutorial inability or unwillingness. It would be useless in the far more pernicious situation created by failure to take action against a pervasive system of official corruption such as that which the June 1972 Grand Jury and the Pennsylvania Crime Commission found to exist in Philadelphia.

To allow an impairment of the powers of a public officer by such a device would permit the General Assembly to circumvent the constitutional requirement of gubernatorial approval of all legislation except that passed over his veto.

Appellant, raising what he denominates a Tenth Amendment claim, asserts that the federal government cannot authorize a state official to do that which he lacks authority to do under state law. But the federal government does not purport to confer upon the Attorney General the power to supersede the district attorney and appoint a special attorney. As we have already indicated, the Attorney General’s action was authorized by state law. The United States surely may, if it wishes to do so, provide funds to facilitate his exercise of the powers conferred by state law.</p>
