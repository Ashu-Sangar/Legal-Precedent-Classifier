The reason given for continued adherence to that interpretation of the constitution is that sovereign immunity, because of its historical roots, is somehow the touchstone in interpreting that section. The passage of time has shown, however, that the doctrine is no longer based in reason or necessity. Once this historical basis is rejected, such interpretation of that section is indefensible.</p>

Stare decisis does not shackle us to the past. It is only a principle which admonishes us to be as consistent as justice will allow. When the passage of time makes consistency the perpetrator of injustice, stare decisis yields to the greater duty of the courts to serve the present needs of society. Moreover, it is of no moment that the desired break with the past involves an interpre<a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>tation of a constitutional section. Justice Cardozo aptly stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b630-5" data-blocks='[["BL_630.4",630,[312,441,1107,802]]]'>“I think that when a rule, after it has been duly tested by experience, has been found to be inconsistent with the sense of justice or with the social welfare, there should be less hesitation in frank avowal and full abandonment. We have had to do this sometimes in the field of constitutional law. Perhaps we should do so oftener in fields of private law where considerations of social utility are not so aggressive and insistent. There should be greater readiness to abandon an untenable position when the rule to be discarded may not reasonably be supposed to have determined the conduct of the litigants, and particularly when in its origin it was the product of institutions or conditions which have gained a new significance or development with the progress of the years.”</blockquote>

It is thus great writers upon the common law have discovered the source and method of its growth, and in its growth found its health and life. It is not and it should not be stationary. Change of this character should not left to the legislature.’ If judges have woefully misinterpreted the mores of their day, or if the mores of their day are no longer those of <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>ours, they ought not to tie, in helpless submission, the hands of their successors.”</blockquote>
