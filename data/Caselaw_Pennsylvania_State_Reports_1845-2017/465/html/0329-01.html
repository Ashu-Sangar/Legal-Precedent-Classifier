Within seconds she looked out her window and saw appellant running from the area where she observed Mr. Mealy, the victim. She watched as Mr. Mealy clutched his stomach, staggered and fell to the sidewalk.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The witness then observed appellant, holding a gun in his left hand, run back across the street past the deceased, enter his car which had been parked with the door opened and the motor running, and drive off. Ms. Hayes further testified that the street was well lighted, her view unobstructed, and that no one else was seen on either side of the street as these events transpired. The identification of appellant by Ms. Hayes was further strengthened by the fact that she knew appellant who lived in one of the homes across the street from her residence.</p>

Subsequent efforts to locate Tinsley at his residence, his place of employment and his brother’s home proved unsuccessful. Five days after the shooting, appellant, accompanied by his attorney surrendered to police.

Immediately after the incident and for a period of five days thereafter, he abandoned his normal pattern of living and could not be located at those places where his regular pursuits would place him. Contacts at his residence, place of employment and the home of his brother, were to no avail. Without any explanation whatsoever for this absence, we believe these circumstances raise a permissible inference that appellant was aware that he was being sought by the police and attempted to conceal his whereabouts to avoid apprehension for this crime.</p>
