Further, they challenge the court en banc’s interpretation of the covenant not to compete. In addition, the appellants urge that even if we find that they violated the covenant, we should hold the covenant unenforceable on the ground that it is not reasonably limited in space, time and scope, and that it would impose an undue hardship on the franchisee. <em>Morgan’s Home Equipment Corp., supra; </em>Restatement of Contracts § 516(f) (1932).</p>

The remaining five stores, which are not within thirty miles of appellee’s store, come within the one year provision of the covenant. These five stores were originally operated under the Piercing Pagoda franchise and then terminated to take on independent identities as Earring Pagodas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> As the covenant applies to these five stores, it restricts the appellant from operating an ear piercing business at the particular franchise site where a Piercing Pagoda originally operated for a one year period.

It applies only to that thirty mile area around appellee’s Plymouth Meeting Mall store and those five additional store sites which the appellants originally operated under the franchise arrangement with the appellee. This is not a covenant which restricts the ability of the appellants to pursue their business interests in areas other than that limited area around appellee’s existing Piercing Pagoda operation and the five franchise sites given to the appellant under the original franchise agreement, and its subsequent modifications. This is hardly a covenant which can be classified as without geographic limitation. The covenant in this case is reasonably limited since it is within such territory and during such time as may be reasonably necessary for the protection of the franchisor without imposing undue hardship on the franchisee. <em>See </em>Restatement of Contracts, § 516(f) (1932); <em>Morgan, supra.</em>

In setting forth the appellee’s cause of action he named those five stores which were in operation at the time the appellee filed his complaint. He failed to name the King of Prussia operation because it came into existence after the complaint was filed. However, the appellee’s complaint did not set forth those five operations as exclusive of any violations of the covenant which might occur after the filing of the complaint but <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>merely as examples of the violations of the covenant by the appellant.
