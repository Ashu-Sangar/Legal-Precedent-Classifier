He was taken into custody by police officers at 4:10 p.m. on May 7, 1970. At 6:05 p.m. appellant was removed from the district police station to Homicide Division Headquarters for questioning in connection with a murder, which occurred the preceding day one block from where appellant and three friends were arrested (the youths having been originally picked up in a vacant house with goods commonly associated with the deceased victim’s business). Appellant was given his Miranda<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> warnings upon arrival at Homicide Headquarters. He waived his rights thereunder and answered questions, at first denying participation in the death of the deceased. Approximately four and one-half hours (at 10:45 p.m.) after the questioning began, however, appellant made a full oral confession.</p>

These two separate issues, although overlapping in nature, demand distinct appraisals. Unfortunately they have often been treated as but one issue. The delineation of these two distinguishable inquiries was best expressed by Justice Eagen in his dissenting opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Roane, </em><a href="/pa/459/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="459 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="481058" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0389-01">459 Pa. 389</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="459 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="481058" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0389-01">329 A.2d 286</a> (1974) :</p>

Because of the result reached, it becomes unnecessary to determine whether or not Riggs knowingly and intelligently waived his rights in the first instance. Upon reviewing the facts and circumstances surrounding that oral confession, the following factors must be noted: Appellant <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>was fifteen years old; his education assumed to be that of a youth of like age;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> police questioning lasted over four and one-half hours before the boy admitted any involvement in the crimes charged; and, during this period of questioning, no interested adult intervened to offer guidance to the appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> The voluntariness of Riggs’ oral confession, its trustworthiness, is not simply judged against the backdrop that it was made prior to the time he had opportunity to consult with his mother. Rather, his age, the lengthy custodial interrogation, the fact that he denied any part in the crimes charged for so long a period of time, plus the absence of interested-adult support combine to draw a total composite picture.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

      <em>Commonwealth v.
