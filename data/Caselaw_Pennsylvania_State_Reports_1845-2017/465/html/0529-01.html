Appellant was brought to trial before a jury and was convicted of murder in the first degree. Sentence was set at death. Melton’s motion for a new trial was granted by the court of common pleas and the Commonwealth’s appeal from the new trial order was dismissed. <a href="/pa/402/0628-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="402 Pa. 628" data-case-ids="1296585" data-case-paths="/pa/402/0628-01">402 Pa. 628</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=168%20A.2d%20328" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="168 A.2d 328">168 A.2d 328</a> (1961). On retrial the appellant pleaded guilty to murder generally and after a degree of guilt hearing the court en banc determined that the killing rose to murder in the first degree and the death penalty was again imposed. Appellant thereupon exhausted his direct appeal and habeas corpus remedies. The instant proceeding under the P.C.H.A. followed.</p>

The same issues are pressed on appeal. First, Melton claims that he lacked sufficient mental capacity to make an intelligent guilty plea; second, he alleges that his guilty plea was primarily motivated by an involuntary confession; and third, appellant maintains that his guilty plea was induced by his fear that the death penalty would be imposed upon him if he chose to be tried by a jury because of the allegedly unconstitutional jury selection procedure prevailing at the time of the entry of the plea. After careful consider<a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>ation, we have concluded that all of these arguments are without merit.</p>

Melton claims that, because there was evidence that his own I.Q. was approximately 69 and that he too had the mentality of an 8 or 9 year old, his guilty plea, like that of Harris, must be considered a nullity. Appellant misreads our holding in <em>Harris. </em>We did not there establish a <em>per se </em>rule invalidating every guilty plea made by a defendant who was in some way mentally deficient. Instead, we reiterated that “‘[t]he test to be applied in determining the legal sufficiency of [a defendant’s] mental capacity to- stand trial, or enter a plea at the time involved, is not the <em>M’Naghten </em>“right or wrong” test, but rather <em>his ability to comprehend his position as one accused of murder and to cooperate with his counsel in making a rational defense.’ ” </em><a href="/pa/431/0114-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="431 Pa. 114" data-case-ids="1917398" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0114-01">431 Pa. at 116-17</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=243%20A.2d%20408" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="243 A.2d 408">243 A.2d at 409</a>.

Unlike the record in <em>Harris, </em>there- is nothing here to establish that Melton lacked the “ability ‘to think intellectually in any degree.’ ” Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary. At the degree of guilt hearing following appellant’s plea, Dr. John G. Torney, a court-appointed psychiatrist, testified that appellant was mentally competent. At the P. C.H.A. hearing, appellant’s counsel at the time of the entry of the plea, James McCort, Esq., testified that none of the doctors who had examined Melton had concluded <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>that he was incompetent to stand trial or discuss the case with his attorneys. Furthermore, Mr. McCort testified that, observing the defendant testify at his first trial, McCort was struck by the fact that “that man was the most articulate 69 I.Q. man that I heard on the witness stand.” He was so impressed by Melton’s articulateness that he added, “when he got on the stand to testify so help me God 1 thought it [sic] was a Harvard graduate.” Such an appraisal by the appellant’s own trial lawyer directly refutes appellant’s present claim of incompetence. We cannot say that the hearing judge abused his discretion in not crediting that claim.</p>

In the present case the P.C.H.A. court, following the evidentiary hearing, concluded that “[t]he defendant has failed utterly to establish any of these criteria.” Because we have decided that appellant has failed to establish that his confession was in fact involuntary, we need not consider whether the other criteria have been met.</p>
