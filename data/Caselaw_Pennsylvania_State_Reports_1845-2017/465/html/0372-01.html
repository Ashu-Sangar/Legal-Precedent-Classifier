    <p id="b421-4" data-blocks='[["BL_421.4",421,[142,551,1155,1351]]]'>The Commonwealth Court interpreted § 1806(b) as empowering the Department to condemn land for park use either for the purpose of promoting healthful outdoor recreation and education or in order to make available for such use areas of unusual scenic beauty. Appellants’ main contention is that such an interpretation does violence to the plain meaning of the words of the statute. Claiming that the purpose clause of the statute is clearly cast in the singular, they argue that a plurality of purposes may not be created by the courts under the guise of statutory construction. They insist that the Department’s authority to condemn is limited strictly to lands of unusual scenic beauty which would serve to promote outdoor recreation and education. As further support for their interpretation, they point to the strict construction which is due statutes conferring the power of eminent domain. See Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b) (4) (Pamphlet 1973). Because the evidence established that their farm property is not of “unusual scenic beauty”, appellants conclude that the Department is powerless to condemn it under § 1806(b), notwithstanding that the property, according to uncontradicted testimony, has a number of “interesting features that would lend themselves to the Department’s program for state park development” (N.T.150a).</p>

When statutory language is unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning, resort to the rules of statutory construction is unnecessary. When, however, the statutory language is unclear or susceptible of more than one reasonable construction (which we think is the case here), our attention must turn to other considerations. Primary among such considerations in this case are the object of the legislation, and the consequences of the two possible interpretations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

    <p id="b422-4" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[272,811,1150,910]],["BL_423.1",423,[121,313,1152,1298]]]'>We find appellants’ reading of the statute unduly restrictive and inconsonant with what we discern as the legislative intent underlying § 1806(b). By the terms of § 1806,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the Department, since its inception, has been charged with responsibility for the creation, maintenance and operation of our state park system. As an indispensable aid to the creation of a park system, the Department was authorized by § 1806(b) to acquire land suitable for park use. Without doubt, lands of unusual scenic beauty containing unique and interesting natural features of the sort mentioned in the section are conducive to activities long associated with park use. But not all, or even most, of the activities customarily conducted on park lands are dependent upon the presence of “water falls, gorges, creeks, [or] caves.” Open fields, sloping valleys, tree covered hillsides and streams possessed of no singularly distinguishing characteristics are nonetheless particular<a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>ly well-suited to common healthful outdoor recreational and educational pursuits such as outdoor games and sports, hiking, camping and picnicking. While these activities may, on occasion, be enhanced by the unusual scenic beauty of the place where they are conducted, restriction of them to such sites would undoubtedly curtail the frequency, and often the possibility, of their enjoyment. “Strict construction does not require . . . that a statute be construed as narrowly as possible, or that it be construed so literally and without common sense that its obvious intent is frustrated.” <em>Pittsburgh School District Condemnation Case, </em><a href="/pa/430/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="430 Pa. 566" data-case-ids="1915765" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0566-01">430 Pa. 566</a>, 570, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%2042" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="244 A.2d 42">244 A.2d 42</a>, 44 (1968). It seems obvious that the restrictive reading of the statute for which appellants contend would retard rather than promote the development and use of state parks, and we cannot attribute to the legislature an intention to limit the types of sites that may be acquired to those possessing “unusual scenic beauty”. We agree with the Commonwealth Court that a condemnation pursuant to § 1806(b) may be undertaken for either of the two purposes which we find in that provision, viz., to promote healthful outdoor recreation and education and to make available for such use land of unusual scenic beauty.</p>
