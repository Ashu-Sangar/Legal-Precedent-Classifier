    <p class="author" id="b357-11" data-blocks='[["BL_357.11",357,[199,1808,373,38]]]'>O’BRIEN, Justice:</p>
    <p id="b357-12" data-blocks='[["BL_357.12",357,[149,1873,1150,477]]]'>Appellant, Johnnie Smith, age fifteen, was tried before a judge and jury and found guilty of murder in the second degree and two counts of aggravated robbery for the stabbing death of David Merrone. Post-trial motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to five to twenty years for the second-degree murder conviction and ten years’ probation on one of the aggravated robbery indictments; sentence was suspended on the second aggravated robbery indictment. This appeal followed.</p>

      <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>Appellant argues his confession must be suppressed in that police interrogation had commenced without first allowing him, a fifteen-year-old juvenile, the opportunity to consult with a parent or interested adult. We agree.</p>
    <p id="b358-4" data-blocks='[["BL_358.4",358,[265,549,1151,642]]]'>The facts surrounding appellant’s confession are as follows. On March 23, 1972, at approximately 10:45 p.m., appellant arrived at the Philadelphia Police Administration Building for questioning concerning the stabbing death of David Merrone. At 11:00 p.m., appellant was warned of his rights and interrogated. In his initial statement, appellant denied any involvement or knowledge of the stabbing incident. He was interrogated a second time at 12:50 a.m. and confronted with differences between his story and the stories of other eo-defendants. At 11:00 a.m., appellant was rewarned of his rights and a third interrogation was conducted.</p>
    <p id="b358-5" data-blocks='[["BL_358.5",358,[260,1226,1151,747]]]'>A summary of the third interrogation reveals a complete reversal of appellant’s initial statement. He incriminated himself by admitting to being with a group of friends who were fighting with the decedent and his friend. Appellant further stated that a co-defendant, Andre Gay, admitted stabbing the Merrone youth and disposing of the knife after the fight. At 3:20 a.m. on March 24, 1972, appellant’s mother arrived and was with her son until 8:18 a.m. She was informed of the nature of the incident and charges involving her son, but she was never informed of her son’s <em>Miranda </em>rights. In addition, appellant’s mother consented to a polygraph examination. Appellant’s formal statement began at 10:01 a.m. and was signed at 11:40 a.m. on March 24, 1972.</p>

In addition, according to a police chronology, even after appellant’s mother arrived at the Police Administration Building, while she was given an opportunity to meet and talk with her son, she was never warned of her son’s <em>Miranda </em>rights.
