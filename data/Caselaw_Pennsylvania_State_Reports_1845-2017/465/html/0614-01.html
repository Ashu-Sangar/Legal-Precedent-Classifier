At one time this wooded area was used as a pasture, but such use ended approximately twenty-five years ago.

In August of 1973, appellant stayed at the farmhouse for almost two weeks while his motorcycle was being repaired at a nearby service station. Again, he did not pay rent but contributed money towards groceries and gasoline.</p>

Very briefly, Mrs. Gilkey’s testimony at trial was that the Ohio “Breed” Chapter held a meeting at her house on the weekend of October 12, 1974. Chancellor was present seeking initiation to the club. Appellant was present as well as was Mrs. Gilkey’s husband, John, Frank “Hillbilly” Howell, “Dirty” Gary Faust, and others. Mary Gilkey had been sent to the store to purchase bullets for appellant’s .38 caliber pistol. He was the only member with a .38. Although Mrs. Gilkey and the other women and children present on the day of October 13 were not permitted in the kitchen, Mrs. Gilkey testified that she overheard the club members arguing with Chancellor in the kitchen and at one point went into the kitchen following a crashing sound and saw Chancellor lying on the floor, bleeding about the face and head, and she saw a broken chair nearby. Shortly afterwards, she again came into the kitchen and saw Chancellor on the ground outside the back door. She testified that one of the club members said to Chancellor, “You are as good as dead” and challengingly questioned the club president, appellant Treftz, “What are you going to do about it.” She saw appellant, gun in hand, follow out to the back porch and moments later heard a shot and then several more shots. She testified that she never saw Chancellor again. The victim’s body was recovered October 26, 1974, and one of the things uncovered by the autopsy was a .38 caliber bullet. No other bullets were found remaining in the body although the victim had been shot several times.</p>
