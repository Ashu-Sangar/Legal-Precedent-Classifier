However, on June 2, 1967, appellant was found incompetent to stand trial and was committed to Farview State Hospital.</p>

The court, on November 21, 1973, and again on April 15, 1974, without ruling on this petition, ordered psychiatric examinations of defendant to redetermine his competency to stand trial. The examining physicians reported that appellant remained incompetent to stand trial and that there was little hope he would ever become competent.</p>

Appellant offered no evidence and made no argument concerning his initial claim that the indictments should be dismissed with prejudice. The court ordered appellant’s continued commitment under section 408 until he either becomes competent or ceases to be dangerous to himself or others.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
