He expressed this anxiety to James “Country” Robinson, a gang-control worker. Robinson telephoned the Honorable Paul A.

He argues that, in view of his apprehensions and Judge Dandridge’s instructions, it was improper for the police to conduct the uncounselled interrogation. Thus, the determinative question is whether appellant made “an intentional relinquishment or abandonment” of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent. See <em>Johnson v.

Further, Deputy Chief Branche clearly pointed out to Judge Dandridge that the police would not consider themselves bound to follow his instructions and that he should advise Bullard to exercise his rights.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> The Judge so advised Bullard.

Despite this advantage, Bullard clearly waived his rights. When the police first warned Bullard after he was taken to the Police Administration Building, Bullard’s responses clearly indicated a waiver. Moreover, the responses to warnings were followed shortly by responses to other questions. On the record, the first and only time Bullard expressed <em>his </em>desire to exercise or not to exercise his rights, Bullard chose the latter. What, in fact, exists “in the record” to show that Bullard expressed a clear desire to anyone not to be questioned is not pointed out by the majority.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Indeed, it could not be pointed out because it quite simply is not present in the record.</p>

Here Bullard was not only properly advised of his rights by the police, he was advised by a Judge of the Municipal Court, and further advised by that Judge that it would be to his advantage to exercise those rights. The opinion of the suppression court states that Bullard enlisted the aid of Judge Dandridge to insure he would not be subject to physical abuse. Nothing <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>indicates Bullard enlisted the aid of Judge Dandridge to act as an intermediary in exercising his constitutional rights.

But Bullard did not indicate that he did not want to be questioned until such counsel was obtained. This Court has ruled that a person who has already retained counsel may in the absence of counsel waive his right to have counsel present during questioning. <em>Commonwealth v.

But this is not a silent record. Moreover, in the sentence immediately preceding the pas<a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>sage quoted by the majority, the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>

    <p id="b401-6" data-blocks='[["BL_401.6",401,[140,742,1150,856]]]'>In response to police questions prior to interrogation, Bullard expressly stated that he understood he did not have to say anything, that anything he said could and would be used against him, that he did not want to remain silent, that he understood he had a right to talk to a lawyer before being questioned, that the lawyer would be provided free of charge if he could not afford one, that he did not want to talk to a lawyer, that he did not want to have a lawyer present while he was asked questions, and that he was willing to answer questions of his own free will, without fear or force, or without any threats or promises having been made to him. Shortly thereafter, Bullard provided the police with a statement. Thus, Bullard clearly waived his rights in a manner specifically approved by <em>Miranda </em>and the interrogation was permissible.</p>
    <p id="b401-7" data-blocks='[["BL_401.7",401,[138,1631,1149,258]]]'>Since the facts do not support an exercise of constitutional rights by Bullard at any time, and since his actions and statements constitute a waiver of his constitutional rights, I cannot subscribe to the opinion of the majority.</p>
    <p id="b401-8" data-blocks='[["BL_401.8",401,[187,1923,181,32]]]'>I dissent.</p>

How this response, both candid and correct, since the Judge had no authority to control the actions of police and since nothing indicates Bullard had expressed to anyone a desire to exercise his rights, can be considered an “alarming disregard” for Bullard’s rights defies comprehension.</p>

Clearly, a judge learned in the law, could convey a clearer indication to the police officer that Bullard expressed a desire to exercise his constitutional rights, if that were in fact the situation. This is particularly true in light of the Judge’s response when told by the police officer that Bullard would be questioned despite the Judge’s instructions. It is inconceivable that had Bullard at any time expressed a desire to exercise his constitutional rights, Judge Dandridge would not have clarified his instructions to indicate this to the police officer after the officer’s statement that the Judge’s instructions would not be followed.</p>
