Later, when Mrs. Gilkey returned she saw Messer’s face was bloody, bruised and swollen. She also saw Messer being beaten by Roman, Gilkey, Zillgitt and Howell. She also saw Roman use his revolver to fire a series of bullets into the wall behind Messer, outlining his head, and into the floor near Messer’s feet.

She then heard Zillgitt say, “You’re the President of the Ohio Chapter, what are you going to do about it?” When she was leaving the kitchen, she heard Zillgitt say, “You’re as good as dead.” Shortly thereafter, <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>she heard a shot, then a volley of shots.

After producing a frenzy and imposing his will on the others, his continued presence was a cause of the death of the prospect Chancellor, who was reluctant to join. In effect, the Commonwealth’s theory is that Roman calculated the shooting at Capuzzi’s Bar, the beating of John Messer and the calf rustling to induce the other members to do whatever was necessary to preserve and further the interests of the club, including killing a non-conforming or reluctant member.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b571-4" data-blocks='[["BL_571.4",571,[140,379,1150,1664]]]'>The first inquiry here is whether this incident tends to establish defendant’s intent or motive to predispose the group to murder, if necessary. While the defendant’s conduct at Capuzzi’s Bar shows him to be prone to violence and, as such, capable of a murderous assault, there is very little here to show an intent or motive to predispose the group. To be relevant to the Commonwealth’s theory, it would be necessary that some element of control or manipulation of the group was present in Roman’s behavior at Capuzzi’s Bar. On the contrary, this act appears to be unrelated not only to the Commonwealth’s theory but also to the victim, Chancellor. What the incident shows is Roman’s violent response to an argument with a stranger. It does not appear in the record, nor does an inference naturally arise, that Roman concocted, planned or used the incident to instruct the group on how to deal with persons who do not comport with club rules. Further, there appears little relationship between this incident and Chancellor’s death. Roman did not know of Chancellor at this time nor is the incident useful to determine any plan that Roman may have had to deal with unacceptable prospects. This incident, in short, tends to establish Roman’s violent nature without showing malice toward an unknown prospect, intent to reorganize the local chapter or motive to predispose the group to murder. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa-super/230/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="230 Pa.

The Commonwealth argues that from the beating of a derelict member, an inference may arise <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>that Roman planned the incident to warn and instruct the group on how other derelict members or prospects would be handled. This inference would not only tend to support an element of the Commonwealth’s theory but also display Roman’s role as an enforcer. However, there must be some relationship between the beating of Messer and the death of Chancellor. According to the Commonwealth’s theory, Chancellor’s death grew out of this incident because the beating had a predisposing effect on the group to kill an unknown, reluctant, unacceptable prospect. However, the difficulty here is that the prosecution’s theory of the killing in this case is all encompassing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Therefore, the question of relevancy here is whether the inference is too indefinite or conjectural in its indications of Roman’s plan or motive to have probative value. The record reveals that members who did pot attend the meetings and functions of The Breed were subject to disciplinary action while a prospect, not a full member, was free to abandon his attempt to join without disciplinary reprisal. Therefore, it does not appear that an inference from Roman’s behavior in the beating of a member could be directly applied to the death of a prospect.</p>

However, the Commonwealth has not established Roman to be an “enforcer” with the attendant connotations of that word. There is testimony that he was the Sergeant-at-Arms of the governing chapter but there has been no evidence that Roman instigated this incident or took any leadership role in Mercer County. Nor does this incident supply the <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>jury with the concept that Roman was the leader of the gang or used this incident for later purposes. In fact, the beating was administered not only by Roman but also by Gilkey, president of the local chapter, Zillgitt from New York, and Howell. The Commonwealth leaves to conjecture whether Roman or one of the others, notably one with an office in the organization, instigated the beating. Further, after the beating, Messer was taken to Treftz, president of all Ohio chapters, an action that an enforcer would not be required to take. The inferences the Commonwealth advocates would be conjectural. See <em>Commonwealth v. Schwartz, </em>supra. The evidence fails to prove what it was offered to prove and it was error to admit it.</p>

    <p id="b573-5" data-blocks='[["BL_573.5",573,[152,1169,1147,740]]]'>This incident appears to be totally unrelated to either Roman’s position as an enforcer or to any plan to predispose the group to murder. The incident shows Roman stealing two calves and punching one of the animals barehanded. The proffered testimony does not show Roman as an enforcer nor is it probative of any motive or plan to predispose the club. Further, no direct connection can be drawn between calf rustling and the death of Chancellor. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.
