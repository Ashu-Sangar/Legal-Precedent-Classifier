The matter proceeded to trial before a jury and a verdict was returned in favor of Miller and against the appellants and Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania in the sum of $11,860.55. Thereafter, the trial court entered an order granting a judgment n. o. v. to Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania and denied appellants’ post-trial motions. The Superior Court affirmed per curiam. We granted allocatur to review the propriety of the grant of judgment n. o. v. <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>in favor of Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania.

The telephone wire was not of uniform height but was lower at the Cancer Building than at the service pole.</p>

Due to the obstruction, two vehicles had come to a stop in the middle of the roadway. However, a third vehicle, a taxicab operated by appellant Pacheco, veered around the other cars and did not halt until the wire was resting on the hood of the cab. Mr. Miller motioned for Pacheco to back up- and called the instruction to him several times. The cab driver failed to comply but rather moved forward several car lengths. The wire which had now become entangled around Miller’s feet was pulled taut, flipping him into the air and causing him to fall on <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>his head. After the accident, it was asertained that the wire was still lying across the hood of the taxi, stuck in the windshield wiper. ■</p>
    <p id="b132-4" data-blocks='[["BL_132.4",132,[222,486,1149,902]]]'>The allegation of negligence against Bell Telephone Company was predicated upon two factors. Initially, it is argued that Bell Telephone should have been on notice that trucks had previously come in contact with this low-hanging wire. The record indicates that- on November 20, 1968; January 9, 1969; January 16, 1969; and again approximately six months before the incident in question, this particular wire had been similarly knocked down. It was therefore charged that despite these prior experiences, Bell Telephone failed to correct the condition in such a manner as to avoid repeated occurrences. Furthermore, the testimony revealed that a period of one to two hours had elapsed between the time that the Company was notified of this broken wire and the time of Mr. Miller’s accident. Thus, it was also contended that the telephone company negligently failed to make repairs within a reasonable time.</p>
