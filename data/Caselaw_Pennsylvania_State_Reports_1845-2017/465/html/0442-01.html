During the conversation the witness said to Thomas, “When you go home your old lady is going to get you. She won’t like you laying out at night.” Appellant then responded, “She mess with me and my old lady will get this” and pulled from his pocket the .22 calibre gun later identified as the murder weapon.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The witnesses stated that almost immediately they heard loud voices and shouting emanating from the bedroom, but could not ascertain the actual words. After several minutes passed, gun shots rang out and appellant came down the stairs. Rushing up to the bedroom they discovered the victim lying on the floor.</p>

The evidence was sufficient to establish that the killing was “willful, deliberate and premeditated,” and, therefore, the majority was correct in sustaining appellant’s conviction of murder in the first degree. <em>See </em>Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, § 701, as amended, 18 P.S. § 4701. The majority, however, incorrectly states that use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the body infers the specific intent to kill neces<a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>sary for murder in the first degree. Under the laws of this jurisdiction, the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the body does not by itself infer that the killing was “willful, deliberate and premeditated”; it infers malice and is sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction of murder in the second degree. <em>Commonwealth v.
