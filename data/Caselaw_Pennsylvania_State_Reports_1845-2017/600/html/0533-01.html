The Attorney General sought to challenge the validity of the Township’s Zoning Ordinance No. 4-2001 (Ordinance) on the grounds that it conflicts with and is preempted by a number of state statutes. In response to preliminary objections filed by the Township, the Commonwealth Court found that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the Attorney General’s action, and granted the Township’s preliminary objection asserting that there was no justiciable controversy ripe for adjudication. Consequently, the Commonwealth Court dismissed the Attor<a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>ney General’s petition for review with prejudice. Both parties cross-appealed from the Commonwealth Court’s order, which we affirm in part and reverse in part. We conclude that the Commonwealth Court properly overruled the Township’s preliminary objection to the court’s subject matter jurisdiction. However, we find that the Commonwealth Court erred in regard to the justiciability issue, and that the Attorney General’s petition for review did, in fact, present a case and controversy ripe for adjudication in accord with the terms of ACRE.</p>

The Township further contended that to the extent ACRE vests the Commonwealth Court with jurisdiction to review land-use ordinances, such jurisdiction would be concurrent with the ZHB’s jurisdiction, and the rules of statutory construction would require the court to decline jurisdiction because ACRE’S grant of general jurisdiction conflicts with the particular and exclusive jurisdiction vested in the ZHB by the MPC.</p>

The Township does not argue that the Attorney General is a landowner for purposes of the MPC.

This position misconstrues the nature of the Attorney General’s action.

If the Attorney General decides to exercise its discretion and mount a challenge to an ordinance in the Commonwealth Court, it is not acting on behalf of the landowner; rather, it is acting in its own right, as the official charged with administering the program established by Chapter three, in order to defend and maintain the Commonwealth’s interest in limiting local regulation of agriculture. Because the Attorney General is not a landowner or a person aggrieved by the Township’s ordinance, it fits into neither category provided by the MPC in 53 P.S. § 10916.1, and, therefore could not have brought this action before the ZHB.</p>

The Attorney General asserts that this case falls squarely within the paradigm described by <em>Arsenal Coal, </em>and there is nothing in Chapter three of ACRE that indicates that the General Assembly intended to change the long-standing law which allows preenforcement actions or to impose upon the Attorney General a uniquely truncated version of standing.</p>

Rather, Section 314(b) vests discretion with the Attorney General to decide whether to bring an action under Section 315(a) once such a request has been made, without limiting the Attorney General’s discretion in terms of whether the local government has attempted to enforce the ordinance.

This right of action contemplates two scenarios: first, an action to invalidate the unauthorized local ordinance, and, second, an action to enjoin the enforcement of the unauthorized local ordinance.

Respectfully, this position would frustrate the Act’s purpose by relegating to local farmers the same unsatisfactory alternatives described in <em>Arsenal Coal: </em>the farmer could either absorb the cost of complying with the local ordinance, which the farmer believes to be invalid, or refuse to comply and take his chances with the "penalties and impediments" which follow. <em>Arsenal Coal, </em><a href="/pa/505/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="505 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1788892" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0198-01">477 A.2d at 1340</a>.

In other words, where an unauthorized ordinance predates the enactment of Chapter 3, the AG may proceed under Chapter 3 only if the local government is <em>enforcing </em>the unauthorized ordinance. 3 Pa.

The Majority appears to rely heavily on section headings for disposition, contrary to well-established rules of statutory construction. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1924. Thus, the Majority argues that Section 313 simply restrains the actions of local government while Sections 314 and 315 empower the AG to investigate the actions of the local government and bring legal action. On this basis, the Majority holds that the language of Section 313 is not binding in the interpretation of Sections 314 and 315. In my opinion, this holding distorts not only the purpose of Chapter 3 (to create a procedure for challenging well-defined local ordinances) but also the language of Section 313, which, to reiterate, states:</p>

In other words, the procedure described in Sections 314 through 318 is available only in the circumstances defined in Section 313(b). The Majority, however, reads Chapter 3 too broadly to create standing for the AG in circumstances other than those described with particularity by the General Assembly. Respectfully, I believe that if the General Assembly had intended to allow the AG to challenge unauthorized local ordinances predating the adoption of Chapter 3 that local governments do not try to enforce, the General Assembly would have said so. Instead, the General Assembly gave the AG power to act only when a local government <em>seeks to enforce </em>a local ordinance predating the enactment of Chapter 3.</p>

However, the Majority would nonetheless allow the AG to challenge not only this prohibited enforcement <em>but also the mere existence on the ledgers </em>of an unauthorized ordinance predating Chapter 3.

The General Assembly clearly did not intend to create incentives for the AG to seek out townships with unauthorized local ordinances predating the effective date of Title 3 and sue them. <em>See </em>3 Pa.C.S. § 314(a).

      <p id="b666-12" data-blocks='[["BL_666.2",666,[258,1665,1145,697]]]'>. Respectfully, this Court’s decision in <em>Arsenal Coal </em>is inapposite. Under <em>Arsenal Coal, </em>a Locust Township farmer would be able to challenge Locust Township’s unauthorized local ordinance and obtain an injunction. <em>Arsenal Coal, <a href="/pa/505/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="505 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1788892" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0198-01">477 </a></em><a href="/pa/505/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="505 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1788892" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0198-01">A.2d at 1339</a>; 3 Pa.C.S. § 315(b). According to that decision, even an ordinance that is not enforced may present an <em>immediate </em>harm to a party that is <em>directly </em>injured. <em>Arsenal Coal, All </em>A.2d at 1339. Here, however, we have a different procedural posture. Here, the AG does not claim that he is facing a direct or immediate harm. Thus, unlike in <em>Arsenal Coal, </em>the question before us does not require the Court to interpret what constitutes “immediate” harm under general standing principles. Instead, the question before us is simply whether the General Assembly, in creating standing for the AG by legislative fiat, intended the AG to be able to challenge unauthorized local ordinances predating Chapter 3 that the adopting municipality does not seek to enforce. For this reason, any reliance on this Court’s previous decisions regarding common law standing principles is misplaced. Here, we address standing derived solely from a Pennsylvania statute.</p>
