Trial courts in Erie and Fayette County determined that the plain language of the relevant PCCA provisions allowed municipalities to employ third-party agencies to perform all the inspections necessary for PCCA compliance, and thereby exclude other construction code officials from PCCA compliance inspections. The Commonwealth Court reversed the Fayette County trial court in a published decision and the Erie County court in an unpublished memorandum, concluding that the trial court decisions were inconsistent with a section of the PCCA that prohibited municipalities from preventing any construction code official from conducting inspections. We conclude that the plain language of the PCCA, as currently enacted, permits municipalities to employ a third-party agency to conduct all PCCA compliance inspections to the exclusion of other construction code officials. We observe, however, that the other construction code officials are not prevented from conducting inspections for purposes other than PCCA compliance.</p>

Finally, a municipality could enter into an agreement with the Department of Labor and Industry to provide plan review, inspections, and enforcement of certain buildings. Conversely, a municipality could opt-out of the administration and enforcement of the PCCA so long as it notified an applicant for a construction permit of the statutory procedures for obtaining the necessary plan review and inspection services. 35 P.S. § 7210.501(e).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Municipalities had <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>to choose an option within ninety days of the adoption of the regulations by the Department, pursuant to 35 P.S. § 7210.501(a)(2).</p>
    <p id="b361-4" data-blocks='[["BL_361.5",361,[241,506,1153,892]]]'>The question raised by this case is whether a municipality that opts to enforce and administer the PCCA through the Third-Party Agency Subsection can enter into a contract providing authority for a third-party agency to perform all PCCA compliance inspections, and thus to refuse to accept inspections for PCCA compliance purposes performed by construction code officials not working for or through the contracted-with third-party agency. The Commonwealth Court concluded that municipalities were prohibited from contracting with one third-party agency to the exclusion of all other construction code officials due to the PCCA’s provision that “[njothing in this act shall allow a municipality to prohibit a construction code official who meets the requirements of Chapter 7 and remains in good standing from performing inspections in the municipality.” 35 P.S. § 7210.501(d), (hereinafter referenced by its title “Registration Subsection,” see <em>infra </em>at 888 for full text).</p>
    <p id="b361-5" data-blocks='[["BL_361.6",361,[240,1423,1151,627]]]'>In the cases at bar, the municipalities chose to contract with third-party agencies to administer and enforce the PCCA. In the Fayette County case, North Union Township enacted an ordinance adopting the UCC and, on July 14, 2004, entered into a contract with K2 Engineering, one of the Appellants herein, to administer and enforce the PCCA. Pursuant to the contract, the township specified that it would only recognize, for purposes of PCCA compliance, those inspections performed by K2 and not by other construction code officials, such as those employed by Appellees Allegheny Inspection Services, Inc. and Steel City Inspection Agency, Inc., hereinafter, “Fayette County Plaintiffs.”</p>
    <p id="b361-6" data-blocks='[["BL_361.7",361,[239,2074,1149,307]],["BL_362.1",362,[257,333,1149,894]]]'>Fayette County Plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment action in the Fayette County Court of Common Pleas seeking a declaration that the Registration Subsection forbids municipalities from excluding any construction code official from performing PCCA compliance inspections. The court bifurcated the liability and damages phases of the trial, and the parties <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>submitted a joint stipulation of fact and then presented argument before the trial judge pertinent only to the liability phase. The trial court observed that the Third-Party Agency Administration Subsection specifically and unambiguously permits municipalities to retain “one or more construction code officials or third-party agencies to act on behalf of the municipality for administration and enforcement of this act.” 35 P.S. § 7210.501(b)(2). Thus, the court opined that the words of the statute were clear and free from ambiguity and allowed the township to employ one third-party agency to administer and enforce the act, and concomitant thereto, to conduct all inspections incident to code compliance. Further, the court concluded that the agreement between the municipality and the third-party agency did not violate the Registration Subsection because the construction code officials, including the Fayette County Plaintiffs, could still perform inspections, just not inspections for purposes of code compliance.</p>

In April 2004, the townships requested proposals for the position of third-party agency to perform PCCA plan review, inspection, and administration and enforcement services for the townships. Both Building Inspection Underwriters of Pennsylvania, Inc. (BIU) and Allied Building Inspectors submitted proposals to be the third-party agency for the townships. In the summer of 2004, the townships enacted ordinances to adopt the UCC and indicate their intent to enforce and administer the PCCA through the use of a third-party agency.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Additionally, the townships chose BIU as their <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>third-party agency No challenges were filed against the ordinances despite provisions affording the opportunity to challenge, 35 P.S. § 7210.503(j)(1).</p>
    <p id="b363-4" data-blocks='[["BL_363.7",363,[225,530,1150,951]]]'>Nevertheless, in November 2004, the losing agency, Allied Building (hereinafter, “Erie County Plaintiff’), filed a declaratory judgment action against Millcreek Township and BIU in the Erie County Court of Common Pleas seeking the same relief as the Fayette County Plaintiffs sought in Fayette County. Harborcreek and Fairview Township sought and were granted intervention as parties to the contract. The Townships and BIU then filed motions for summary judgment. The Erie County trial court, like the Fayette County trial court, concluded that the language of Third-Party Agency Administration Subsection clearly provided for the employment of a single third-party agency for administration and enforcement services that necessarily included inspections for code compliance, and that the provision did not conflict with the Registration Subsection because other construction code officials could perform other types of inspections. The court accordingly granted summary judgment to the Townships and to BIU.</p>

Focusing on the word “or,” the Commonwealth Court noted that the PCCA provides that a “third-party agency” may “perform plan review of construction documents, inspect construction <em>or </em>administer and enforce codes and regulations under this act.” 35 P.S. § 7210.103 (emphasis added). The Commonwealth Court then observed that the Third-Party Agency Administration Subsection, granting the municipality the authority to hire a third-party agency, provided that the third-party agency could perform administration and enforcement, without mention of inspection. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court rejected the conclusions of the trial court that “administration and enforcement” in Third-Party Agency Administration Subsection necessarily included the performance of compliance inspections.</p>

The Townships and Third-Party Agencies contend that their interpretation furthers the purpose of providing safe construction across the Commonwealth, whereas under the Commonwealth Court’s interpretation, safety might be sacrificed if the third-party agency had to accept and “rubber-stamp” any inspections performed by independent construction code officials. Appellants allege that the Commonwealth Court’s analysis would result in inspectors being on the payroll of the builder rather than the municipality, which would create the potential for biased inspectors and <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>dangerous construction. It contends that prior to the passage of the PCCA, the building inspectors employed by the municipality were public employees subject to the State Ethics Act, which prevented building inspectors from inspecting work performed by the inspector individually or the inspector’s family or where the inspector and builder have a similar relationship. <em>See </em>65 Pa.C.S. §§ 1102, 1103. The same ethical requirements, however, do not bind independent construction code officials, and under the Commonwealth Court’s interpretation, a third-party agency would be forced to accept potentially biased inspections. Conversely, under the Townships and Third-Party Agencies’ interpretation, the third-party agency would have supervisory control over its own inspectors, thus reducing the likelihood of biased inspections and thereby insuring the public’s safety.</p>
    <p id="b369-4" data-blocks='[["BL_369.5",369,[237,1149,1153,846]]]'>The Townships and Third-Party Agencies also note that 35 P.S. § 7210.503 allows municipalities to adopt more stringent standards, so long as they meet or exceed the standards set by the PCCA. Therefore, to enforce the higher standards that a municipality may require, it makes sense that the municipality would not accept any state certified construction code official, but instead would only accept inspections performed by its chosen inspectors who have been trained in the municipality’s code. It cannot be, they argue, that a state licensed inspector with no knowledge of the enhanced local construction code should be allowed to inspect for code compliance and that the municipality be forced to accept it. Accordingly, the Townships and Third-Party Agencies assert that the Commonwealth Court erred in concluding that the Registration Subsection prevented a third-party agency from performing all code compliance inspections for a municipality.</p>

Instead, Plaintiffs <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>assert that the terms administration and enforcement implies the supervision of inspectors, but not the conducting of inspections themselves.</p>

By default, the Registration Subsection therefore applies to subsection (2), the Third-Party Agency Administration Subsection, and subsection (5), the use of the Department of Labor for plan review, inspection, and enforcement. Accordingly, Plaintiffs argue that while the three exempted methods of municipal administration could <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>allow for the exclusion of construction code officials from performing compliance inspections, the Registration Subsection prohibits municipalities who have contracted with a third-party agency from preventing construction code officials from performing code compliance inspections.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

Thus, they assert that municipalities have no power to regulate private business absent statutory authorization. They argue that a municipality’s authority to prohibit all inspections (rather than merely inspections for code compliance) would result in the regulation of the inspection industry. As regulation of business is already prohibited under municipal law generally, the Plaintiffs assert that interpreting the Registration Subsection to mean the same thing would be mere surplusage, and thus the interpretation is contrary to the rules of statutory construction requiring courts to give effect to all the provisions of a statute.</p>

[b]y the retention of one or more construction code officials or third-party agencies to act on behalf of the municipality for administration <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>and enforcement of this act.” 35 P.S. § 7210.501(b)(2). Moreover, we conclude that the performance of PCCA compliance inspections is encompassed by the term enforcement, and thus provides the third-party agency the exclusive authority to perform PCCA compliance inspections as an integral aspect of their enforcement authority. As noted by the Erie and Fayette County trial courts, the PCCA cannot be enforced without the performance of inspections. Common sense dictates that an entity charged with the enforcement of the specific requirements of a construction code cannot fulfill those duties without physically observing whether the requirements have been met. Although the generic definitions of the terms enforcement, administration, and inspection could be read as distinct one from the other, in the application of the PCCA, they are so intertwined that enforcement simply must encompass inspection. Accordingly, the grant of sole authority in the Third-party Agency Administration Subsection to administer and enforce the PCCA for a municipality gives the third-party agency the authority to decide whether to perform all inspections itself or to accept the inspections performed by unaffiliated construction code officials.</p>

In the extensive briefs, the Townships, the Third-Party Agencies, and their <em>amici </em>present additional arguments that the Department’s regulations and legislative history suggest that inspection is integral to enforcement. They also assert that the Commonwealth Court’s interpretation of the statute would obviate the distinction between opt-in and opt-out municipalities and the incentive for entities to bid to become third-party agencies. Additionally, they rebut the Plaintiffs’ suggestion that their interpretation of the statute will lead to monopolistic third-party agencies that will increase construction costs through lack of competition.

Regardless of the legislative reasons for exempting certain forms of administration from the Registration Subsection, and thus arguably allowing those exempted municipalities to establish criteria that might prohibit a construction code official from performing any inspections, we conclude that the plain language of the section does not restrict municipalities in regard to inspections for compliance purposes. Instead, unlike the language in the proposed amendment, discussed <em>supra </em>at 14, the current language only forbids municipalities from prohibiting construction code officials from performing inspections generally, and does not speak to whether the third party agency must accept the inspections in administering and enforcing the PCCA. As the language is plain, we cannot resort to statutory construction in an attempt to divine the legislative intent. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921 ("When the words of a statute are clear and free of ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.”).</p>

In this regard, I agree with the majority’s conclusion that the terms "administration and enforcement" and "inspection,” as employed in the PCCA, overlap. I differ, however, with the majority’s interpretation that "inspections” as used in Section 501(d) means only inspections other than those performed for purposes of PCCA administration and enforcement. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 264-66, 964 A.2d at 890-91. Significantly, in every other instance of the use of the term within the PCCA, the terms "inspect” and “inspection” implicates the opposite, namely, inspections performed for administration and enforcement purposes. <em>See, e.g., </em>35 P.S. §§ 7210.103 (definitions of "construction code official,” "municipal code official,” and "third-party agency”), 7210.501(e) (discussing conduct of "the plan review and inspections” in the context of non-municipal administration). Indeed, one of the express purposes of the PCCA is ”[t]o eliminate unnecessary duplication of effort and fees related to the review of construction plans and the inspection of construction projects.” 35 P.S. § 7210.102(5). An interpretation contemplating unnecessary, advisory, or superfluous inspections runs contrary to this objective. Moreover, under the majority’s reading, which assigns a very limited role to Section 501(d), there would appear to be little reason for exceptions specified there, pertaining to employment of a municipal code official, joint enforcement with another municipality, or usage of the administration and enforcement mechanism of another municipality. <em>See </em>35 P.S. § 7210.501(d) ("This section does not alter the power and duties given to municipalities under subsections (b)(1), (3) and (4).”).</p>
