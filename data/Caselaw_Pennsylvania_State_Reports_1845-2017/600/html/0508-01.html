Allocatur is DENIED as to all remaining issues. The issue, rephrased for clarity, is:</p>
    <blockquote id="b617-15" data-blocks='[["BL_617.14",617,[257,1892,1108,202]]]'>Whether the Superior Court departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, in failing to adjudicate rescission claims, thus violating the parties’ due process rights.</blockquote>

The trial court awarded petitioners summary judgment and dismissed their rescission counterclaim as moot. <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>On appeal, the Superior Court reversed the trial court, and awarded summary judgment to Aetna. Following the reversal, the rescission counterclaims are no longer moot. “That an action is ‘moot’ suggests that there is a legal issue involved in a case, but because of the circumstances surrounding the case, the issue has become an academic one and will not be resolved. What ‘mootness’ does <em>not </em>suggest is that an issue was fully considered and a final judgment entered.” <em>Consolidation Coal Company v.

Rather than remand for a hearing on those counterclaims, the Superior Court did not address them. The revival of Lloyd’s, RLI’s, and ERSIC’s rescission counterclaims requires remand for consideration of the underlying facts concerning those claims. Jurisdiction relinquished.</p>
