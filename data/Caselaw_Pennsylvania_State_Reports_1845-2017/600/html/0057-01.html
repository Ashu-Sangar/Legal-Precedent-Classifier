In the meanwhile, the Gburs contended, Mr. Gbur reasonably did not understand that the severe pain he suffered in his jaw was due to the metastasis, since he was unaware of the results of the bone scan. Thus, the plaintiffs alleged, Mr. Gbur underwent an unnecessary course of dental procedures (including multiple root canals) and suffered needless pain, when his symptoms would have been appropriately addressed (and ultimately were addressed) by irradiation, had Mr. Gbur apprehended earlier that he suffered from metastasis.</p>

In this connection, he explained that radiation oncologists regularly read radiographic films and reports. Further, he indicated that he has special education and training in brachytherapy. Dr. Sanford also indicated that ten to twenty percent of his patients have prostate cancer. In response to a question concerning whether the standards for the staging and treatment of prostate cancer are national in character, Dr. Sanford replied, “I would say that is a national standard.

Dr. Sanford noted that Appellant nevertheless had noted in Mr. Gbur’s medical records that the “bone scan [was] negative,” which Dr. Sanford found absolutely to contradict the report.

They testified that they believed that Appellant’s treatment plan was made in consultation with a radiologist, was reasonable under the circumstances, and was within the appropriate standard of medical care, particularly as metastasis to the mandible is a relatively rare occurrence. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 672.

The court observed that, in his practice, Dr. Sanford examines patients like Mr. Gbur on a regular basis and is knowledgeable as to their diagnosis, treatment, and care.

With regard to the MCAR.E Act’s requirements, the Superior Court initially indicated that Appellant relied primarily upon Section 512(d), the care-outside-subspecialty waiver provision attaching to the same-subspecialty requirement.

Indeed, we agree with Appellees that the term “related fields of medicine” must mean more than fields of medicine which are “related” in the most generic sense of the word, since Section 512(e) serves as a component of reform legislation designed to meaningfully enhance the standards governing the admissibility of expert testimony in medical professional liability cases. It would not be reasonable, therefore, to conclude that the Legislature intended the Section 512(e) exception merely to operate along the lines of the previously existing common-law standard, thus depriving the enhanced standards of force. <em>See generally </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922 (codifying the presumption that the Legislature did not intend an absurd or unreasonable result).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> Rath<a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>er, as Appellant and his <em>amicus </em>contend, the statute should be read to require a close enough relation between the overall training, experience, and practices of the expert and that of the defendant-physician to assure the witness’s expertise would necessarily extend to standards of care pertaining in the defendant-physician’s field. Contrary to Justice Greenspan’s perspective, we find the mere fact that two physicians may treat the same condition to be insufficient, in and of itself, to establish such a relation among their fields of medicine. While, in light of our conclusion concerning issue preservation we need not apply Section 512(e) in the present case, we would venture to say those practicing radiation oncology and urology might be surprised to learn of a judicial pronouncement— offered without reference to relevant supporting testimony from those practicing in the respective subspecialties beyond a discussion of a single area of treatment overlap — that their disciplines represent related fields of medicine for purposes of reform legislation.</p>

Moreover, had the trial court not been fully aware of a challenge under Section 512(c)(3) before or during trial (as Justice Saylor suggests), given Appellant’s reference to that provision in his post-trial motion, it almost certainly would have noted Appellant’s previous failure to specify his objection.

A proffered expert’s failure to satisfy either the same subspecialty or same approved board requirements creates a <em>presumption </em>that the expert is not competent to testify. However, it is within the sound discretion of the trial court whether or not to waive those requirements when an expert, testifying to a physician’s standard of care, possesses sufficient training, experience, and knowledge consistent with the other terms of Section 512(e). In this regard, the legislature attempted to strike a balance between raising standards for medical expert competency and preserving our appellate courts’ “historical deference to trial courts’ discretion in deciding whether to admit evidence at trial.” <em>Herbert v.

Those requirements, in which the legislature <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>strictly mandates that a proffered expert’s subspecialty and board certification be either the “same,” “similar,” or “substantially similar,” can be waived if the trial court determines the expert has “sufficient training, experience, and knowledge” from “active involvement” in “the applicable subspecialty” or a “related field of medicine.” Section 512(e), which uses nontechnical language that is less stringent than the same subspecialty and same approved board requirements, must be given effect distinct from those requirements. Therefore, in my view, the General Assembly indeed raised the standards for expert witnesses testifying to a physician’s standard of care when it created a presumption that an expert cannot testify unless he or she both practices in the same subspecialty, or in a subspecialty with a substantially similar standard of care, and is also certified by the same or similar approved board as a defendant physician. Additionally, this Court should not ignore that the legislature also expressly granted discretion to trial courts to consider broader qualifications than those required in Section 512(c)(2) &amp; (3).</p>

Alternatively, to the extent that the record demonstrates that both radiation oncologists and urologists diagnose and treat prostate cancer, these two fields of medicine are certainly “related” in the common and approved sense of the word, and therefore Dr. Sanford also comes within that aspect of the statutory provision. Consequently, there is no need to reach the issue of whether Dr. Sanford would be competent under the same subspecialty and same approved board requirements.</p>

The OAJC focuses on the fact that Appellant provided a "broad quotation of the statute [Section 512] as a whole.” Majority Op. at 454 n. 11. It is important to note, however, that only two of the quoted provisions are not relevant to Appellant’s pre-trial and trial objection to Dr. Sanford’s testimony regarding Appellant's standard of care on the basis that Dr. Sanford was not a urologist. In my view, Appellant’s surplusage was too minimal to distract Appellee and the trial, court from the challenges he raised.</p>

I share Justice Saylor's view that trial court rulings under Section 512 should be made on a developed record and that the trial court should make specific findings regarding the particular requirements in dispute prior to admitting the expert’s testimony. In this case, the issue of whether the record of voir dire was sufficient to permit Dr. Sanford’s testimony at the time of his admission need not be reached, however, because Dr. Sanford’s testimony more than revealed his fitness as an expert. Therefore, the trial court’s possible failure to make supported findings on Dr. Sanford’s qualifications prior to accepting him as an expert would merely be harmless error. <em>See McAdoo Borough v.
