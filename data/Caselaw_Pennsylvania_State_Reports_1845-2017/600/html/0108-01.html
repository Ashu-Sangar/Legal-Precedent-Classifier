The majority noted that Section 2(1) of the LTEA opens by prohibiting taxes on the “transfer of real property” under certain circumstances. Based on the canon of statutory construction <em>ejusdem generis, </em>or “of the same kind or class,” the court concluded this introductory clause applied to every succeeding clause in Section 2(1). The court then held that the residential lease transactions in question do not constitute “transfer^] of real property.” Accordingly, the court determined the Ordinance did not violate the LTEA, and thus that summary judgment was appropriately granted in favor of Millersville. <em>Lynnebrook &amp; Woodbrook Assoc. v.

By contrast, where we determine whether a person or property fits under a statutory provision enumerating exemptions from such taxing authority, we consider whether a tax exemption exists, and the presumption is in favor of the taxation authority. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1928(b)(5).

The [LTEA] as amended authorizes the municipalities therein designated to impose taxes on certain persons, property and subjects <em>except </em>that they <em>shall not have authority </em>to impose a tax on goods and articles there manufactured, or on any privilege, act or transaction related to the business of manufacturing.

      <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>As we discussed above, Lynnebrook offers that we should parse the statute to forbid local authorities “To levy, assess, and collect ... any tax on[:] ... leases.” This construction would preclude the Ordinance. Millersville, on the other hand, contends we should parse the statute to forbid local authorities “To levy, assess, and collect ... any tax on the transfer of real property when the transfer is by[:] ... leases.” Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the leases at issue in this case are not “transferís] of real property” under the Act, this parsing would permit the Ordinance. However, while both proffered interpretations are plausible, neither leads to a fully grammatical result when applied to the other clauses in the statute, since those clauses each include introductory language of their own (beginning “or on a transfer between” or “or on a conveyance to,” etc.). The “leases” clause, lacking any other language at all, is <em>mi generis, </em>and thus a parsing of Section 2(l)’s introductory text which renders the clause immediately under consideration comprehensible will, if applied to other clauses, render those other clauses incomprehensible.</p>

Here, as we noted in <em>Fischer, </em>Section 2(1) of the LTEA was enacted to restrict the grant of taxation authority in Section 2. Thus, considering the necessity for the section (restricting the grant of authority), the object to be attained (restricting municipal taxation authority) and the mischief to be remedied (overweening municipal authorities imposing taxes beyond the LTEA’s authorization) supports an interpretation that most restricts the taxing authority — that is, the broadest interpretation of the lease exception: an unqualified prohibition on the taxation of leases. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(c)(1), (3), (4). Moreover, interpreting the lease <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>exception narrowly — prohibiting only leases transferring real property — as Millersville would have us do, would potentially expose the thousands of residential lease transactions consummated in the Commonwealth every year to hitherto unanticipated tax liability. This consequence is deeply inconsistent with the restrictive purpose of Section 2(1). <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(c)(6).
