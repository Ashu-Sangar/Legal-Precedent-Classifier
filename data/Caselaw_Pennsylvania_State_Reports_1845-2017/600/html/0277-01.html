The PPA also assumed responsibility for on-street parking in 1983. At that time, and until 2001, parking authorities throughout the Commonwealth had similar organizational structures, powers, and duties, as outlined in the original Parking Authorities Law. 53 P.S. §§ 344-356. The law drew no distinctions between parking authorities in cities of the first class (Philadelphia) and those in other municipalities. 53 P.S. §§ 341-356. For example, each parking authority throughout the state was managed by its own Governing Board whose five members were appointed by the local mayor. 53 P.S. § 348. Parking authorities regulated only on and off-street parking. 53 P.S. § 345. They maintained independent budgets and issued bonds to raise capital. 53 P.S. § 345.</p>

In addition, the PPA assumed control of taxicab and limousine operations in and around Philadelphia. 53 Pa.C.S. § 5505(d)(23), (24). Previously, regulation of taxicabs and limousines in Philadelphia was a function of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). Under the amendment, these services are now regulated by the PPA, whose power extends to persons or corporations providing these services between points in Philadelphia, from any point in Philadelphia to any point in the Commonwealth or outside, and from any point in the Commonwealth to any point in Philadelphia. 53 Pa.C.S. § 5714(c). The General Assembly supervises and controls in part the distribution of funds from the PPA’s budget. 53 Pa.C.S. § 5707.

Subsequently, the PPA issued citations to various taxi drivers and companies based on alleged violations of the Regulations. Appellants sought to challenge the Regulations and, in April 2006, they sued the PPA in the Commonwealth Court. Appellants alleged that the PPA improperly adopted and enforced its Regulations, thereby harming them. Appellants claimed that, as a Commonwealth agency, the PPA should have followed the procedure outlined in the Commonwealth Documents Law<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> when it adopted the Regulations.

Specifically, the court held that Appellants had not shown that they would be irreparably harmed if the PPA continued to enforce the Regulations. <em>See Summit Towne Ctr., Inc. v.

The court also raised the issue of jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>and held it for briefing and consideration <em>en banc. </em>Finally, in March 2007, the Commonwealth Court held that it did not have original jurisdiction over the matter and transferred the case to the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas for resolution on the merits.

The dissent discusses at length the language in the Parking Authority Law that indicates that the PPA is a local agency. Dissenting Op. at 237-41. That discussion suggests that the "local agency” language in the law is dispositive of the jurisdictional issue despite equally persuasive language to the contrary. <em>See, e.g., </em>53 Pa.C.S. § 5505.

The dissent points to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) and argues that SEPTA also travels across county lines and that jurisdiction over actions against SEPTA has nonetheless traditionally rested in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. Dissenting Op. at 236-37, 242. First, this is only one of three arguments supporting our holding that court decisions in PPA cases have a statewide impact. Second, the SEPTA-enabling statute is substantially different from the Parking Authority Law. <em>See, e.g., </em>74 Pa.C.S. §§ 1752 (budget), 1711 (creation of SEPTA), 1712 (appointment of board members). Thus, although this Court has not spoken on the jurisdictional issue in SEPTA's case, and we will not do so here because the issue is not before us, we nonetheless observe that SEPTA's organizational and financial structure contains more indicators that it is a local agency than does PPA’s structure.</p>

According to the dissent, the shift to PPA of control over taxicabs in the Philadelphia area indicates the General Assembly’s intent to depart from statewide control over taxicabs. Dissenting Op. at 301-04, 965 A.2d at 242. This argument is unpersuasive, however, because the General Assembly, in giving control of taxicab regulations to the PPA, also transferred PPA control from local to state officials. Thus, a more likely explanation is that the General Assembly perceived a need to relieve PUC of its high volume Philadelphia taxicab-related duties and so it transferred these to an existing authority, the PPA. This intent may also be gleaned from the imperative that the PPA keep the taxicab, limousine, and parking budgets separate. 53 Pa.C.S. § 5707(b)-(c).</blockquote>

Section 5508.1(q.1)(5) specifically places jurisdiction over disputes between the PPA and the City of Philadelphia concerning the administration of on-street parking and the direction of the PPA’s revenues in the Commonwealth Court. If the PPA were now the Commonwealth government as a result of Act 22 and/or Act 94, original jurisdiction in the courts of common pleas would not lie, and the Parking Authorities Law would not have to specifically state that the Commonwealth Court had original jurisdiction over specific, narrowly described legal disputes. Had the legislature, in all of its sweeping changes to the PPA in Acts 22 and 94, intended that the PPA be the Commonwealth government and that all civil actions against it accordingly now be tried in the Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction, as opposed to former practice, it could have so stated. It did not.

Further, Section 5508.3 of the Parking Authorities Law specifically provides that a first-class city authority (the PPA) "shall be subject to <em>and treated as a Commonwealth agency </em>for purposes of the act ... referred to as the Right-to-Know Law,” which shall apply to such authority. 53 Pa.C.S. § 5508.3(a)(2) (emphasis added). Additionally, Section 5508.3 provides that PPA employees shall be treated as Commonwealth employees, and PPA officers and board members shall be <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>regarded as public officials of the Commonwealth, in the mandatory application of ethics, disclosure, and conflicts laws that are, by this section, made applicable to the authority. 53 Pa.C.S. § 5508.3(a)(1).

I must respectfully disagree with the majority’s overly-broad contention that "the SEPTA enabling statute is substantially different from the Parking Authorit[ies] Law” (op. at 232 n. 12). As the majority notes, the Commonwealth has a statutory role in the <em>creation </em>and <em>governance </em>of metropolitan transportation authorities, including SEPTA. Further, the Commonwealth must receive a yearly financial report from such authorities, contrary to the majority’s assertions of purely local oversight of the authorities’ budgets. <em>See </em>74 Pa.C.S. § 1752. By contrast, the PPA is an entirely <em>local </em>creation of the City of Philadelphia <em>(see </em>majority op. at 227-28), and while its board members are appointed by the Commonwealth, all board members <em>must </em>be Philadelphia residents. 53 Pa.C.S. § 5508.1(d). Accordingly, I cannot agree with the majority that for purposes of the jurisdiction question before us, the legislation creating metropolitan transportation authorities is "substantially” different from those provisions of the Parking Authorities Law that concern the PPA.</p>
