Normally the allocatur stage is reserved for making the threshold determination of whether or not to grant discretionary review. <em>See </em>Supreme Court IOP § 5C. While the outcome of certain cases may be so apparent to justify a <em>per curiam </em>disposition on the merits at the allocatur stage, particularly where a decision of this Court is clearly aligned with the case under review, I do not construe <em>Office of Attorney General </em>as having such an impact on the present factual circumstances. To the contrary, our Internal Operating Procedures suggest against the use of a <em>per curiam </em>order to apply an established rule of law to a novel factual situation. <em>See <a href="/pa/577/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="844 A.2d 1217" data-case-ids="91691,9272804" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0257-01,/a2d/844/1217-01">id.</a> </em>§ 3B(5)(1)(c).</p>

The arbitrator, although finding that the employee had engaged in the misconduct, concluded that his actions did not provide just cause for his termination under the collective bargaining agreement, which contained a general just cause provision. <em>See Office of Attorney General, </em><a href="/pa/577/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="844 A.2d 1217" data-case-ids="91691,9272804" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0257-01,/a2d/844/1217-01">844 A.2d at 1223</a> (“Employer shall not demote, suspend, discharge, or take any disciplinary action against an employe without just cause.”). In applying the essence test and determining that the arbitrator’s award rationally derived from the collective bargaining agreement, the Court noted the absence of a definition of just cause in the agreement and, because the <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>concept was not capable of an easy and concrete definition in the labor relations context, delineated several factors that could be evaluated by the arbitrator to determine whether there was just cause for the discharge or discipline. <em>See <a href="/pa/577/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="844 A.2d 1217" data-case-ids="91691,9272804" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0257-01,/a2d/844/1217-01">id. </a></em><a href="/pa/577/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="844 A.2d 1217" data-case-ids="91691,9272804" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0257-01,/a2d/844/1217-01">at 1224</a>. Ultimately, the Court held that the arbitrator rationally interpreted the just cause provision by considering such mitigating circumstances as the treatment of similarly situated employees and the discharged employee’s subsequent ameliorative conduct. <em>See <a href="/pa/577/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="844 A.2d 1217" data-case-ids="91691,9272804" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0257-01,/a2d/844/1217-01">id.</a></em>

    <p id="b238-4" data-blocks='[["BL_238.5",238,[256,825,1149,305]]]'>By contrast, although the collective bargaining agreement in the present matter contains a general, undefined just cause provision, it also expressly dictates the consequences of a corrections officer’s failure to qualify for weapons certification. More specifically, Section 33.2C of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b238-5" data-blocks='[["BL_238.6",238,[297,1145,1107,306]]]'>All employees covered under this agreement will be required to qualify semi-annually. Employees who fail to qualify will be suspended without pay and given four (4) opportunities to qualify within one (1) week. If [an] employee fails to qualify after four (4) attempts in one (1) week they [sic] will be terminated.</blockquote>
    <p id="b238-6" data-blocks='[["BL_238.7",238,[253,1472,1151,625]]]'>The Commonwealth Court construed this provision, which is the result an interest arbitration award, as reflecting the interest arbitration panel’s determination that just cause exists to impose disciplinary action for failing to qualify for weapons use. It is thus arguable that the directive of Section 33.2C imposes a limitation upon the just cause analysis in the grievance arbitration context. On the other hand, the arbitrator reasoned that, despite the language of Section 33.2C, the County’s modification of the weapons training and practice procedure after the interest arbitration award impacted the just cause analysis such that Section 33.2C does not <em>per se </em>support the propriety of the suspensions.</p>
