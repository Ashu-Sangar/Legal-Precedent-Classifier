DePaul claims that the ban is unconstitutional, both facially and as applied to him, because it is an overly broad and unlawfully discriminatory infringement of the rights to free expression and association guaranteed by Article I, Sections 7, 20, and 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. For the reasons that follow, we agree with DePaul’s essential premise. Accordingly, we hold that Section 1513 is unconstitutional under Article I, Section 7, to the extent that it prohibits political contributions of any amount by specified individuals involved in the gaming industry, and we enjoin the enforcement of this unconstitutional provision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

DePaul further claims that Section 1513 is overly broad because it prohibits contributions to candidates for office even where there is no connection between the candidate and licensed gaming. DePaul cites as an example of the disconnection his contribution to a candidate for the Philadelphia Register of Wills, which he characterizes as “a political office without the least remote connection to the regulation of licensed gambling in the Commonwealth.” Verified Petition, ¶ 41.

DePaul claims that Section 1513’s ban on political contributions is far broader than the contribution limitation upheld in <em>Buckley, </em>which merely restricted the amount of an individual’s contribution, without barring contributions entirely.

This is so because <em>Pap’s II </em>suggests that this Court should apply a strict scrutiny standard where the restriction (here, a statute) is on expressive conduct. In <em>Pap’s II, </em>this Court applied strict scrutiny to an ordinance which totally banned nudity in the City of Erie in any public place, holding that restrictions on expression or expressive conduct are subject to strict scrutiny when challenged under Article I, Section 7. Even if <em>Pap’s II </em>did not explicitly establish that strict scrutiny applies to restrictions on political contributions, De Paul notes that the Court in that case certainly declined to apply an intermediate level of scrutiny to an Article I, Section 7 challenge due, in part, to the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court had been unable to reach a majority consensus respecting the level of scrutiny to be applied in similar federal challenges. Likewise, DePaul claims, the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Buckley </em>resulted in disagreement over the level of scrutiny that should apply to cases involving limitations on campaign contributions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Given the similarity in circum<a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>stances, DePaul argues, this Court should reach the same conclusion that it reached in <em>Pap’s II, </em>which is that strict scrutiny applies to Article I, Section 7 challenges to restrictions on political expression.</p>

Thus, he concludes, there is no legislative record to support a compelling state interest in preventing actual corruption or the appearance of corruption arising from any and all political contributions. DePaul also takes issue with the Commonwealth’s suggestion in its answer to the verified petition that the General Assembly could rely on the reported experience of other states with legalized gambling rather than creating a record of its own to support Pennsylvania’s outright ban on political contributions. Specifically, DePaul points to the nineteen states other than Pennsylvania that have some form of legalized gaming or “racinos,” only five of which have sought to ban political contributions from individuals involved in the gaming industry.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>, <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

Specifically, DePaul argues that there are less intrusive means of serving the identified governmental interest of preventing corruption, given that Section 1513’s ban is absolute and applies to all contributions regardless of the amount or whether the contributor is the licensee. DePaul suggests that there are obvious, less intrusive alternatives, such as imposing a limit on the amount of contributions, that would further the legislative intent while preserving the affected citizen’s right to participate in political activity. In contrast, DePaul maintains, Section 1513 entirely deprives an individual involved in the gaming industry of the freedom of political association. Further, DePaul argues that Section 1513’s ban is overly broad because it prohibits contributions even where there is no connection between the recipient political candidate or association and the gaming industry.</p>
    <p id="b693-5" data-blocks='[["BL_693.5",693,[217,1360,1154,888]]]'>For similar reasons, DePaul claims that Section 1513 violates the equal protection and non-discrimination clauses of the Pennsylvania Constitution (Article I, Sections 1 and 26) because it impinges on the fundamental right of freedom of expression. As such, DePaul urges this Court to apply strict scrutiny, a test which Section 1513 cannot survive because it is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. Finally, DePaul argues that, even if this Court were to apply intermediate or heightened scrutiny, Section 1513 does not serve “important governmental interests” and “the discriminatory means employed” via the total ban are not “substantially related to the achievement of those objectives,” citing <em>Nevada Department of Human Resources v.

Before considering those decisions, we note that the New Jersey ban would not apply to a person such as DePaul, who is neither the licensee, nor a casino officer, director, holding company or subsidiary, nor a key or principal employee of a casino, holding company or subsidiary.

Thus, under <em>Buckley </em>and its progeny, we find that the campaign contribution restrictions on the riverboat and land-based casino gaming industries are closely drawn to match a sufficiently important interest in that they focus precisely on the problem of campaign contributions by the gaming industry — the narrow aspect of political association where the actuality and potential for corruption have been identified — while leaving such persons free to engage in independent political expression, to associate actively through volunteering their services, and to assist to a substantial extent in supporting candidates and committees by making independent expenditures. Therefore, we find that the provisions of La.

And what is notable about that regulatory <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>scheme is that, although the General Assembly did not produce the sort of legislative record DePaul believes it should have in order to establish a compelling governmental interest, the Legislature did include a detailed provision addressing “Legislative intent” in the Gaming Act, and that provision directly addressed the issue of the corrupting influence of campaign contributions. Thus, Section 1102 begins by stating, “The General Assembly recognizes the following public policy purposes and declares that the following objectives of the Commonwealth are to be served by this part.” 4 Pa.C.S. § 1102. A list of eleven objectives then follows, the first and last of which are relevant here:</p>
    <blockquote id="b707-5" data-blocks='[["BL_707.5",707,[249,982,1106,202]]]'>(I) The primary objective of this part to which all other objectives and purposes are secondary is to protect the public through the regulation and policing of all activities involving gaming and practices that continue to be unlawful.</blockquote>

This statement of intent and purpose articulates a more narrow governmental interest than was at issue in <em>Foster </em>and <em>Soto </em>and requires that this Court engage in a correspondingly more precise measure of the means adopted to advance the identified interest.

DePaul argues that Section 1513 is not narrowly tailored to further that interest because there are practicable, less intrusive means. Specifically, DePaul notes, a limit on the amount of contributions (such as was at issue in Buckley) would precisely forward the identified interest, and would preserve the citizen contributor’s right to participate in political activities through the expressive and associative conduct represented by donations. DePaul maintains that Section 1513 cannot survive constitutional scrutiny because it entirely deprives an individual involved in the gaming industry of this form of political association and expression, irrespective of whether a large contribution is at issue — and even where there is no connection between a candidate and the gaming industry.</p>
    <p id="b708-4" data-blocks='[["BL_708.5",708,[267,1134,1150,895]]]'>We agree. While the ban on political contributions does further the compelling state interest in avoiding the appearance of corruption in the oversight of the gaming industry, Section 1513 is not narrowly tailored. A statute that limited the size of contributions, rather than absolutely prohibiting any contributions, would be more narrowly drawn to accomplish the stated goal. Banning all contributions is not a narrowly drawn means of furthering a policy of negating the corrupting effect and appearance of large contributions. It totally bans a protected form of political expression and association which is unrelated to the identified interest, and does so despite the availability of more narrowly tailored restrictions. The obvious disconnection between the articulated interest and the means chosen renders the ban constitutionally infirm under Article I, Section 7 as, in our judgment, it clearly, palpably and plainly violates that constitutional provision.</p>

These arguments, however, do not adequately come to terms with the specifics of this legislation. The General Assembly articulated a specific governing intention and purpose behind its decision to regulate campaign contributions, and the means it chose to effectuate that policy are not narrowly tailored to the interest expressed. The means chosen directly burden a constitutionally protected form of expression that is no less legitimate or important than other forms of expression. Our decisional task is not to determine if it is a better policy to ban all contributions Rather, we must accept the intention of the restriction as stated and apply the governing test; doing so, we are constrained to hold that the absolute ban on campaign contributions is unconstitutional.</p>

Moreover, the General Assembly indicated that its primary goal, to which all others are secondary, including the one concerning large campaign contributions, is “to protect the public through the regulation and policing of all activities involving gaming.” 4 Pa.C.S. § 1102(1).

Petitioner’s argument ignores the reality of party politics and the fungible nature of money. One need not contribute only to party leaders to achieve certain political goals or give rise to the appearance of corruption or favoritism. The same result may be achieved or arise if an individual spreads political contributions among a party’s slate of candidates for minor political posts. By contributing to “minor” political candidates, an individual still curries favor with the party and allows the party to more freely direct its thus enlarged larger pot of money toward the attainment of more significant elected offices. In other words, the contributed money could still benefit those with influence over the regulation of the gaming industry in this Commonwealth, even though initially directed to a candidate for, say, register of wills or local sheriff.</p>

The majority opinion never explored what the General Assembly meant by "large campaign contributions.” Because the majority holds that Section 1513 could be more narrowly tailored to permit "less than” large campaign contributions, it seems to regard the matter of large campaign contributions as one involving a single contribution from a single source, such as Petitioner herein. That is, a large campaign contribution is one that emanates from one gaming industry principal. However, the actual or apparent corrupting influence of large campaign contributions can also be viewed as being accomplished by the cumulative effect of many small contributions coming from the many gaming industry principals throughout the state. Indeed, this interpretation is suggested by Section 1513's explicit prohibition of many seemingly small contributions. <em>See infra </em>n. 6. Ultimately, even if there is a conflict in the Gaming Act under one possibility, we are required, whenever possible, to construe a statute in a manner that upholds its constitutionality, <em>i.e., </em>where another possibility supports the validity of the statute. <em>See In re William L., supra </em>at 1231.</p>
