The present appeals call for us to consider the constitutionality of Pennsylvania’s property assessment laws.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Presently, the assessment laws of the Commonwealth neither require nor do they prohibit periodic property reassessments, and thus they permit real estate taxes to be levied on property values that are based upon a stagnant “base year market value” for an indefinite period of time. Allegheny County has adopted such a base year system. In a thorough opinion and order, the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, per the Honorable R. Stanton Wettick, Jr., found that, because a base year assessment method that does not require periodic reassessments inherently causes significant disparities in the ratio of assessed value to fair market value, the Commonwealth’s property assessment laws were facially unconstitutional as they violate the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Pa. Const. art. VIII, § 1, which requires equality of taxation. In Judge Wettick’s view, the only option for the County was an annual reassessment. For the reasons that follow, we disagree with the trial court’s holding that the statutes are unconstitutional on their face. Nevertheless, for many of the same reasons cited by the trial court, we hold that the base year method of property valuation, as applied in Allegheny County, violates the Uniformity Clause. We therefore agree that a countywide <a id="p670" href="#p670" data-label="670" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*670</a>reassessment is required and we remand this matter to the trial court for implementation of that mandate consistent with this Opinion.</p>

Relevant to the present appeal, Pennsylvania’s property assessment laws are governed by both the General County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. §§ 5020-1 to-602, which contains provisions applying to all sixty-seven counties, and by statutes applicable to specific categories of counties, <em>e.g., </em>first-class counties, second-class counties, <em>etc. </em>Under this statutory regime, as with those preceding it, a county conducts property assessments in order to value a property and arrive at a basis for property taxation. Although based on a property’s “actual value,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the value estab<a id="p672" href="#p672" data-label="672" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*672</a>lished by the tax assessors is referred to as a property’s “assessed value.” <em>See </em>Black’s Law Dictionary 1586 (8th ed.2004) (defining assessed valuation as “[t]he value that a taxing authority gives to property and to which the tax rate is applied”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Under the Uniformity Clause, countywide assessments must be uniform so that all property in each county is uniformly assessed. <em>See </em>Pa. Const, art. VIII, § 1. Such uniformity is more easily achievable in counties where all real property is assessed at 100 percent of market value, resulting in assessed values that are the same as actual values. Disparities in uniformity often occur where a property is assessed at a higher percentage of fair market value than other properties in the taxing district, causing assessed values and actual, fair market values to differ, often dramatically.</p>

Allegheny County was the only county then permitted to conduct triennial assessments. In practice, however, most counties did not comply with the annual assessment requirement. In 1982, the assessment laws governing the different counties were amended so as to allow counties to utilize either a current market value method or to adopt a base year market value method in arriving at the <a id="p673" href="#p673" data-label="673" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*673</a>assessed value of each property in the county. 72 P.S. § 5020-402.

This is so because a county utilizing a base year method of valuation typically does not consider market fluctuations subsequent to the base year when assessing “current value,” or factor in variables such as improvements to a property that may increase its assessed value. If a building is constructed on a lot that was vacant during the base year, the property’s assessed value is determined by using either sales of comparable properties in the base year or base year construction schedules.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Prior to 2002, Allegheny County did not use a base year for calculating assessments. In the 1980s and 1990s, the County purportedly assessed property at its actual value in the current taxable year, but, in fact, did not conduct annual countywide reassessments. Instead, the County used a property’s assessed value from the prior year when assessing value in the current year, sometimes with a slight increase in neighborhoods where property values were increasing, and a slight decrease in neighborhoods where values were perceived as declining. Periodically, an entire area was reassessed, though the area may only have comprised a portion of a school district. When such a reassessment occurred, the reassessed property owners were paying more taxes proportionately than owners of properties in the school district that were not reassessed. Trial Ct.

Specifically, the trial court found that Section 502-402(a) of the General County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. § 5020-402(a), and Section 5452.4(a.2) of the Second Class County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. § 5452.4(a.2) violate the Uniformity Clause.

[The Uniformity Clause] provides that: “All taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and shall be levied and collected under general laws.” There is, perhaps, no other section of the Constitution upon which the courts above and below have been so frequently required to pass in the administration of their duties. The central thought running through all the opinions is that the principle of uniformity is a constitutional mandate to the courts, to the Legislature, and to the taxing authorities, in the levy and assessment of taxes which cannot be disregarded. The purpose of requiring all tax laws to be uniform is to produce equality of taxation. Absolute equality is difficult of attainment, and approximate equality is all that can reasonably be expected. Hence it has been held that where there is substantial uniformity the constitutional requirement has been met. But all these cases hold there must be substantial uniformity, which means as nearly uniform as practicable in view of the instrumentalities with which and subjects upon which tax laws operate. It is the duty of the courts in dealing with this subject to enforce as nearly as may be equality of burden and uniformity of method in determining what share of the burden each taxable subject must bear.</blockquote>

Moreover, the trial court’s facial conclusion failed to contemplate potentially valid applications of the base year provisions. It is true that the applicable statutory construct does not mandate periodic reassessments, much less periodic reassessments within a specified timeframe. Significantly, however, the statute does not prohibit a taxing authority from engaging in periodic reassessments to “update” the base year. It seems obvious that use of a base year system — with its attendant economies, stability, and predictability — would not implicate the Uniformity Clause if, for example, a county conducted adequate periodic reassessments, or if it could be shown that property values in a particular county remained relatively unchanged, or those values had virtually the same rate of change. It may well be true that a base year system, if unadjusted, will inevitably lead to taxing inequity. But those inequities, in a particular county, may take years to rise to the level of constitutional infirmity. The governing presumption of constitutionality, the high burden to show unconstitutionality in a facial challenge, and the flexibility the statutory scheme permits, combined with the fact that appellees’ facial challenge relies on evidence of the provisions’ inequitable application here, and the further fact that it appears there are circumstances where the base year provisions could be constitutionally applied, lead us to conclude that appellees’ facial challenge fails under even the more lenient “plainly legitimate sweep” standard.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_38" id="ref_footnote_1_38">38</a> Thus, we cannot affirm the trial court on its terms.

And, even if such a governmental interest were valid under these circumstances, the County fails to demonstrate how this classification (overburdened property owners with declining or stagnant property values) is rationally related to the governmental interests in stability and predictability. A valid classification must be rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. Accordingly, Allegheny County’s argument, that the non-uniformity resulting from its base year system is excusable, fails.</p>
    <p id="b822-5" data-blocks='[["BL_822.6",822,[253,1635,1151,728]]]'>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that, as applied in Allegheny County, the statutory base year system of taxation at issue, which approves the prolonged and potentially indefinite use of an outdated base year assessment to establish property tax liability, violates the Uniformity Clause of .the Pennsylvania Constitution. This conclusion is different and narrower than that of the trial court below, which found that the statutory base year provisions were facially unconstitutional, and accordingly deemed annual reassessment based on current market value as Allegheny County’s only remaining option. We find no ineluctable constitutional deficiency with use of a base year system; it is only through the passage of time that a base year assessment will become stale, and thus unconstitutional.</p>

The point at which an unadjusted base year system becomes constitutionally problematic thus may vary from county to county. We recognize the desirability of the base year system from the county perspective, and it may be that such a system might operate fairly for more tax cycles than the base year in certain counties. Thus, it may be that a county could ensure a constitutional base year method of assessment by requiring periodic reassessment through an ordinance or as a matter of practice. The difficulty — and the risk to an authority employing an unadjusted base year system — is in determining the point at which a base year deviates to an extent where reassessment would be required.</p>

Inexplicably deeming the "prospect of prompt legislative action" “unlikely,” Mr. Justice Baer's Concurring Opinion takes the Court to task for "refusing]” to act "to fill a void where the legislature has not acted.” Concurring at 719, 720-21, 969 A.2d at 1232, 1233 (emphasis added).

The base year assessment, however, obviously cannot capture and reflect market fluctuations that occur during years subsequent to the base year and preceding a reassessment. Nevertheless, as held by the Majority, the assessment laws permitting the use of a base year are not facially unconstitutional because use of a base year would not implicate the Uniformity Clause if, for example, a county conducted adequate periodic reassessments; if it could be shown that property values in a particular county <a id="p719" href="#p719" data-label="719" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*719</a>remained relatively unchanged; or if those values had virtually the same rate of change over the passage of time.

The consequence will be hundreds of thousands of taxpayers and the local governments of the sixty-seven counties of this Commonwealth being uncertain about whether the result of this Court’s decision means that their county has become unconstitutionally non-uniform and must therefore engage in a county-wide reassessment. Taxpayers and the groups that represent them will be unsure about whether to bring a lawsuit challenging their counties’ assessment system. The counties themselves will be unsure whether their current assessed values satisfy or violates the Uniformity Clause, as interpreted herein. These pervasive uncertainties will lead to endless litigation throughout the Commonwealth with regard to whether each county’s assessment scheme is unconstitutional, as applied. These lawsuits will result in inconsistent findings in the courts of common pleas as to the proper demarcation between constitutionality and unconstitutionality. Indeed, possibly premised upon substantially the same facts, some trial courts may find a county’s property tax assessment unconstitutional, as applied, leading to direct appeals to this Court, while other trial courts will find a county’s property tax assessment system constitutional, leading to appeals to the Commonwealth Court.

Accordingly, when the legislature has created a vacuum by failing to act, the courts must act where, as here, a potential constitutional violation is at issue. We should not, in the guise of judicial restraint, abdicate our fundamental responsibility to provide a proper framework for the assessment of actual constitutional violations. Thus, I now turn to an examination of how to determine uniformity in property taxation and how to determine whether a county’s property tax assessment scheme has become unconstitutional.</p>

The statistical data relied upon by the trial court and cited by the Majority establish that the use of an indefinite base year system in Allegheny County has failed to conform to our Constitution’s Uniformity Clause. As the Majority explains, inequity will rise at different rates in different taxing districts, depending upon the stability of property values in the municipality, the variety of real estate extant, and other market factors. Maj. at 715, 969 A.2d at 1229. Thus, it is not possible to predict the length of time <a id="p723" href="#p723" data-label="723" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*723</a>between reassessments which will result in a peculiar county’s assessment morphing from constitutional to unconstitutional. Rather, to permit counties and taxpayers alike to have guidance as to when such mutation from a constitutional to unconstitutional system is occurring, this Court should adopt one of the well-established, judicially addressed, state verified and generally accepted measures of equality and inequality, as described by the Majority.</p>
    <p id="b831-4" data-blocks='[["BL_831.5",831,[217,777,1152,1170]]]'>The standards cited by the Majority and established in the Standard on Ratio Studies issued by the International Association of Assessing Officers (IAAO) have been widely accepted as the criteria to judge the adequacy of an assessment. Specifically, the statistical indicator known as the coefficient of dispersion (COD) is the most widely accepted tool used to measure inequality in tax assessments, and is recognized as a suitable means of measuring inequality in property taxation in Pennsylvania.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> The IAAO has characterized the COD as the most generally useful measure of variability or uniformity. <em>See </em>R.R. 1374a. <em>See also </em>IAAO’s <em>Standard on Ratio Studies, </em>13 (2006). A COD of fifteen indicates a low level of variance, and thus general or substantial uniformity in property assessment. In a county with a COD of fifteen, approximately fifty percent of property owners are neither over-assessed nor under-assessed by more than fifteen percent of fair market value. <em>See </em>Trial Ct. Op. at ii. Of the remaining property owners, half are over-assessed by at least fifteen percent of fair market value and half are under-assessed by at least the same percentage. Conversely, a high COD such as forty indicates a substantial level of variance, and thus inequality, in property assessments. Trial Ct. Op. at iii.</p>

      <a id="p724" href="#p724" data-label="724" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*724</a>Because the COD is the most generally useful measure of uniformity, the IAAO has optimized its usage between establishing maximum acceptable CODs for various types of properties. <em>See </em>R.R. 1374a, <em>Standard on Ration </em>Studies, <em>supra. </em>According to the IAAO, the maximum COD for a single family residential property is ten percent for newer, more homogenous areas; fifteen percent for older, heterogeneous areas; and twenty percent for rural residential and seasonal properties. <em>See </em>Maj. at 1216-17; Trial Ct. Op. at 20. According to the testimony of the former executive director of the IAAO, which the trial court credited, the IAAO standards for acceptable CODs reflect a level of uniformity that is readily achievable. <em>See </em>Trial Ct. Op. at 20. These IAAO standards, which were first adopted in 1980, have never been readjusted and have withstood the test of time. T.C. Op. at 20, R.R. at 1383a-1384a. Further, these figures are easily obtained. Since 1988 the Pennsylvania State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) has published assessment statistics for each county in the Commonwealth, including the COD. The COD for each county in Pennsylvania is available over the internet to anyone. This availability limits the uncertainty regarding where a county’s COD is in relation to the IAAO standards.</p>
    <p id="b832-4" data-blocks='[["BL_832.5",832,[266,1517,1151,846]]]'>According to the COD standards established by the IAAO as discussed above, for counties where the current market value is the legal basis for assessment, a COD of twenty is the maximum COD envisioned by the IAAO before a county becomes generally non-uniform and should conduct a reassessment. Because a COD of twenty is the highest COD acceptable, once a county’s COD, as demonstrated by STEB, reaches this threshold, it seems appropriate that a presumption should arise that the county’s assessment scheme has become nonuniform and therefore unconstitutional in accord with the Uniformity Clause. Once this presumption arises, the county would have the choice to reassess, or await a lawsuit challenging its system. If such lawsuit was filed, the county would have the opportunity to rebut the arising presumption by demonstrating that its assessment system has not, in fact, become constitutionally infirm.</p>

Likewise, I would urge counties whose COD exceeds twenty to begin reassessment, or to stand ready to defend the lawsuit which will inevitably come. Conversely, I would urge taxpayers whose counties’ COD is less than twenty to recognize the unlikelihood of success in litigation, and to save themselves, their counties and the courts the massive resources that go into this type of litigation.</p>
