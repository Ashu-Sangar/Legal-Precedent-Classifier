Among other provisions, Article 8.4 of the Supplementary Conditions to the Contract contained a provision that obligated Lanmark to pay the School District liquidated damages for delay in completing the Contract work.</p>
    <p id="b554-8" data-blocks='[["BL_554.9",554,[262,1783,1149,312]]]'>Mid-State provided a performance bond for the Project that named Lanmark as the principal and the School District as the obligee (the “Bond”). Pursuant to Article 6 of the Bond, in the event of default by Lanmark, in exchange for payment of any remaining Contract balance, Mid-State agreed to assume responsibility to complete Lanmark’s work.</p>

The School District declared Lanmark to be in default, withheld final payment from Lanmark, and demanded that Mid-State assume responsibility for the remaining work. The <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>School District failed to remit the remaining Contract balance to Mid-State.</p>
    <p id="b555-4" data-blocks='[["BL_555.5",555,[234,463,1148,412]]]'>Lanmark initiated a civil action against the School District seeking payment of the Contract balance (the “Lanmark Matter”). The School District counterclaimed against Lanmark and joined Mid-State in the Lanmark Matter. The School District also filed a separate civil action against Lanmark and Mid-State (the “School District Matter”). The School District Matter was stayed pending the resolution of the Lanmark Matter.</p>
    <p id="b555-5" data-blocks='[["BL_555.6",555,[232,913,1149,312]]]'>On July 12, 2001, following settlement negotiations, the School District and Lanmark reached a settlement that was placed on the record before the Honorable Gary P. Caruso. The parties acknowledge that neither the School District nor Lanmark mentioned Mid-State during the negotiations. The terms of the settlement, as recorded that day, were as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="AHY" data-blocks='[["BL_555.7",555,[270,1246,1110,581]]]'>The Kiski Area School District shall pay to Lanmark, Incorporated, a sum of $430,000.

Lanmark and Mid-State requested that the release contain a proviso that the School District had released its claims against Mid-State. The School District repeatedly and emphatically refused to include this language. The School District argued that it had reserved its rights as against Mid-State. Because the parties were unable to reach an agreement on additional language, the School District and Lanmark executed a release that was limited to the <em>verbatim </em>terms of the July 12, 2001 proceeding <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>(the “Release”). The Release is silent as to the School District’s purported reservation of rights against Mid-State.</p>
    <p id="b556-4" data-blocks='[["BL_556.5",556,[280,458,1149,463]]]'>On September 23, 2005, Mid-State filed a motion for summary judgment in the School District matter, arguing that the Release discharged Mid-State and moreover that the School District’s final payment to Lanmark barred any claim on the Bond. Mid-State’s motion was granted on January 25, 2008. The trial court, citing <em>Metropolitan Nat’l Bank v. Merchants’ &amp; Mfrs’ Nat’l Bank, </em><a href="/pa/155/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="155 Pa. 20" data-case-ids="983309" data-case-paths="/pa/155/0020-01">155 Pa. 20</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20A.%20764" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="25 A. 764">25 A. 764</a> (1893), reasoned that the broad, open-ended release of Lanmark discharged Mid-State.</p>
    <p id="b556-5" data-blocks='[["BL_556.6",556,[280,957,1149,627]]]'>The School District appealed the trial court’s order to the Superior Court, which reversed. The Superior Court reasoned that there was a genuine issue of material fact relating to whether the School District reserved its rights against Mid-State. Although the Release contained no express reservation, the Superior Court adopted Section 39(b) of the Restatement of Suretyship and Guarantee (the “Restatement”) and held that a reservation might be inferred from extrinsic circumstances, including the School District’s repeated declaration that it would not release Mid-State.

    <p id="b557-4" data-blocks='[["BL_557.6",557,[246,423,1149,365]]]'>The School District argues that it released Lanmark from future performance but did not release Mid-State from the obligation to pay for Lanmark’s allegedly defective and delayed work. Therefore, because the School District believes that the Release did not fully resolve all issues relating to Lanmark’s default, the School District argues that it can maintain a claim against Mid-State.</p>
    <p id="b557-5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.7",557,[245,816,1151,800]]]'>Regarding the interpretation of the Release, the School District argues that this Court should adopt the totality of the circumstances approach set forth in Section 39(b)(ii) of the Restatement. In support thereof, the School District cites <em>Reliance Ins. Co. v.

In <em>Reliance, </em>this Court held that it would be appropriate to examine extrinsic evidence in order to discern the true meaning of a term in a bonding agreement that permitted subsequent increases in the bonded amount. <em><a href="/a2d/734/0833-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="734 A.2d 833" data-case-ids="11546474,56846" data-case-paths="/a2d/734/0833-01,/pa/557/0439-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/734/0833-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="734 A.2d 833" data-case-ids="11546474,56846" data-case-paths="/a2d/734/0833-01,/pa/557/0439-01">at 840</a>. The School District argues that, pursuant to the general rule in <em>Reliance, </em>the language of the Release must be evaluated in light of the School District’s repeated refusals to release its claims against Mid-State. The School District urges the Court to look beyond the Release’s terms to examine the circumstances underlying the Release.</p>
    <p id="b557-6" data-blocks='[["BL_557.8",557,[244,1644,1152,418]]]'>In contrast, Mid-State argues that it was discharged from all obligations once the School District and Lanmark reached the settlement of all claims relating to Lanmark’s Project work. According to Mid-State, because Mid-State stands in Lanmark’s shoes, Mid-State had no remaining liability once the School District settled with Lanmark. Mid-State further argues that the School District breached the Bond’s terms by making payment to Lanmark.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>Mid-State argues that the School District’s failure to reserve expressly its rights in the Release is fatal to the School District’s claim and that a reservation of rights must be expressly stated in a release. In support thereof, Mid-State cites <em>Keystone Bank v. Flooring Specialists, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/513/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="513 Pa. 103" data-case-ids="1802587" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0103-01">513 Pa. 103</a>, <a href="/pa/513/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="513 Pa. 103" data-case-ids="1802587" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0103-01">518 A.2d 1179</a> (1986). In Keystone <em>Bank, </em>this Court held that an obligee releases a surety unless the obligee expressly reserves its rights against the surety. <em>Id. </em>at 1185. Relying on <em>Keystone Bank, </em>Mid-State argues that the Release discharged Mid-State, because there is no express reservation of rights contained in the language of the Release. Mid-State also finds support for its argument in Section 39(c)(iii) of the Restatement, which provides that a release of performance by the principal releases the surety.</p>
    <p id="b558-4" data-blocks='[["BL_558.5",558,[264,1102,1149,406]]]'>This appeal raises fundamental questions relating to the nature of the surety relationship. The parties admit that the Release does not refer to Mid-State, and that prior to the execution thereof, the School District clearly communicated that it did not intend to release Mid-State.

    <p id="b559-4" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[230,571,1151,1209]]]'>If performance is only partial, the obligee may nonetheless choose to release the principal from any remaining performance. In <em>Keystone Bank, </em>this Court reiterated the well-established rule that the release of a principal releases the surety, to the same extent, unless either the surety consents to its own ongoing liability or the obligee expressly reserves its rights against the surety. <a href="/pa/513/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="513 Pa. 103" data-case-ids="1802587" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0103-01">518 A.2d at 1185</a>.

Such a rule provides predictability and reduces the need to litigate the multifaceted circumstances underlying a document that is clear on its face. The Release contains no mention of any reservation of rights against Mid-State. Both parties concede that Mid-State did not consent to ongoing liability. The School District, therefore, did not effectively reserve its right to seek damages from Mid-State.</p>
    <p id="b561-4" data-blocks='[["BL_561.5",561,[247,820,1151,610]]]'>The School District has not annunciated a sufficiently compelling basis to adopt a totality of the circumstances analysis in determining whether a surety is discharged by a release. This Court’s holding in <em>Reliance </em>does not authorize a departure from the bright-line rule set forth in <em>Keystone </em>and <em>Hagey, </em>as the facts of <em>Reliance </em>are inapposite. The bond in <em>Reliance </em>contained an ambiguous term relating to waiver of notice. Unlike the bond in <em>Reliance, </em>which contained an ambiguous term that would be illuminated by extrinsic evidence of the parties’ intent, the Release here was clear. The parties concede that the Release does not address Mid-State. Therefore, <em>Reliance </em>is not instructive.</p>

Section 39 of the Restatement codifies the general rule that the release of a contractor discharges the surety. In Section 39(b), the Restatement describes two methods by which an owner might preserve rights against the surety: consent or a reservation of rights. Although Section 39(b)(ii) suggests that the reservation might be inferred from the circumstances, that section also reiterates the general rule that a surety is discharged by a release of the contractor. Most importantly, notwithstanding the two methods described in Section 39(b), the Restatement states that there can be no reservation in certain circumstances. These circumstances are described in Section 39(c). In Section 39(c)(iii), the Restatement states that there can be no reservation where the owner releases the contractor from performance. In such a circumstance, regardless of any attempt to reserve rights, the surety is discharged. Section 39(c)(iii) applies squarely to the facts of this case.</p>

As Mid-State points out, Section 39(c)(iii) of the Restatement indicates that a surety is discharged when the principal is released from a duty other than the payment of money. Here, the School District released Lanmark from any performance relating to the project, and in so doing, released Mid-State pursuant to Section 39(c)(iii) of the Restatement. Given the language of the Restatement and the comments thereto that structure Section 39 as a series of interrelated clauses, it is untenable to read its sections as functioning independently. The Superior Court therefore erred in adopting Section 39(b)(ii) while ignoring Section 39(c)(iii).</p>

Notwithstanding direction to provide the remaining Contract balance to Mid-State, the School District retained these funds and ultimately paid them to Lanmark as part of the settlement between the School District and Lanmark. Although the School District argues that the remaining funds did not constitute a “final payment,” the semantics are irrelevant. The School District’s action impaired Mid-State’s ability to complete the Project work. The School District cannot have it both ways: either it retained the Contract funds and negotiated a full settlement with Lanmark that absolved Mid-State’s responsibility; or else the School District had to remit the funds and allow Mid-State to complete the Project and separately resolve any entitlement to payment by Lanmark. The School District is not now entitled to relief from Mid-State when the School District opted to retain the Contract balance and negotiate a settlement with Lanmark.</p>

However, immediately following the statement in <em>Hagey </em>quoted by the Majority, this Court acknowledged that “parol evidence might be given to show that an agreement, which would by itself operate to release the surety, was not to have that effect.” <em>Hagey, </em><a href="/pa/75/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="75 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1036804" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0108-01">75 Pa. at 112</a>.

It has been suggested that while “[p]arol evidence is inadmissible to show that a written agreement with the principal obligor releasing or giving the principal [an extension of] time was subject to a reservation of rights against the surety[,j when a settlement has been made by the creditor with the principal obligor otherwise than in writing, it may be shown by parol [evidence] that it was made subject to a reservation of rights against the surety.” 23 <em>Williston on Contracts, </em>§ 61:23 (4th ed.2008). As the Majority notes, the release executed between the School District and Lanmark was limited to the verbatim terms of an <em>oral </em>settlement agreement, reached following oral settlement negotiations, which was recorded on the record on July 12, 2001. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 369-70. Thus, the School District’s release of Lanmark arguably was "otherwise than in writing,” and, in my view, would warrant the admission and consideration of parol evidence to allow the School District an opportunity to demonstrate a reservation of rights against Mid-State.</p>
