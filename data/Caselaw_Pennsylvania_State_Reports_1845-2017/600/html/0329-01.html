The court granted relief premised upon a finding that trial counsel were ineffective in various respects relating to the investigation and presentation of the defense at both the guilt and penalty phases. In granting guilt phase relief, the PCRA court declined to pass on the credibility of appellee’s witnesses.

Appellee was charged with criminal homicide and related offenses, and, following a jury trial, was found guilty and ultimately sentenced to death on September 22, 2000. At trial, the Commonwealth presented eyewitness accounts identifying appellee as the killer. The testimony of Jackie Cook, the victim’s nephew, described the shooting and established appellee’s motive to kill the victim. Cook testified that he sold drugs with the victim and explained that the victim was concerned with a rival group that operated out of 437 Schuylkill Avenue and competed for area drug sales. According to Cook, on two consecutive days he and the victim confronted a suspected member of the rival group, Adrian Starks. On the second occasion, the afternoon of the killing, Cook stated that he demanded to speak with Starks’ supplier. Cook testified that Starks returned with appellee, and that appellee and the victim entered the breezeway next to 437 Schuylkill Avenue that led to a courtyard. Cook stated that, from where he was standing in front of the house, he could see down the breezeway, and saw appellee pull a gun from his waist and shoot the victim in the abdomen. Cook testified that he fled the scene <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>and, while fleeing, encountered another member of appellee’s group known as “Izod” in the vicinity.o Cook also admitted that he had repeatedly smoked marijuana on the day of the shooting, including immediately before the murder. Cook also testified that he later encountered appellee and Starks while the three were incarcerated in Berks County Prison, and that appellee and Starks threatened him and warned him not to testify against appellee at appellee’s murder trial.

Branford stated that, when the shooting occurred, he was sitting on the front stoop of 437 Schuylkill Avenue and Cook was standing in front of the house, closer to the breezeway. Branford also testified that he did not get a good look at the man who accompanied Starks to the house. <em>Id. </em>at 234-39.</p>

Ramsey stated that she sold illegal drugs on behalf of appellee and explained that appellee and Izod, whom she described as appellee’s “right-hand man,” had experienced problems with the victim for some time prior to the murder because appellee and Izod were selling drugs in the vicinity of the victim’s operation. <em>Id. </em>at 308-18. Ramsey testified that, while in her apartment on the day of the murder, appellee was carrying a firearm and expressed anger towards the victim. Ramsey also stated that, after the murder, Izod informed her that “we did them niggers. You didn’t think we would, but we did. There is not going to be a problem.” <em>Id. </em>at 322.</p>

Each alibi witness testified that on the evening of June 18,1996, the day the victim was murdered, she was with appellee at the home of Alice Jackson in Brooklyn, New York, and that in the <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>evening, appellee asked Crystal Johnson to marry him. When questioned by the prosecution, however, both witnesses testified that they believed June 18,1996 to be a Wednesday, when it was actually a Tuesday. Although trial counsel did not attempt to rehabilitate the alibi witnesses on redirect, in his closing statement, he acknowledged their “slight mistake” and stated that: “The point is, they were right on the date, the 18th. And they were right on the incident. How can they remember? The girl got engaged.” N.T., 9/20/00, at 494. Appellee did not testify himself.</p>

We held that the jury’s determination that appellee deliberately killed the victim was supported by sufficient evidence, and that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, and employing reasonable inferences, the evidence was sufficient to support the aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed as a consequence of a drug-sale-related rivalry. Recognizing that the Commonwealth’s case relied heavily on evidence obtained from admitted participants in the illegal drug trade, we stated that such concerns implicate the jury’s responsibility to resolve questions of credibility, and, absent extraordinary circumstances, an appellate court will not substitute its judgment for that of the fact-finder.

Appellee offered the testimony of, <em>inter alia, </em>trial counsel, Jackie Cook, Crystal Johnson, and three witnesses, Ronald George, Gerald Williams, and Jonathan Workman, whom appellee alleged trial counsel failed to interview and call at trial. After having been warned about the penalty for perjury, Cook, the Commonwealth’s primary witness at trial, testified that his trial testimony regarding what he saw the evening of the shooting was not true, and that, from where he was standing in front of the house, he could not see down the breezeway to where the shooting took place. At trial, Cook had testified that appellee, riding a bicycle, was the man accompanying Adrian Starks after Cook demanded to meet Starks’ supplier. At the PCRA hearing, however, Cook testified that appellee was not the man who shot the victim, and that the man on the bicycle had fairer skin than appellee and, unlike appellee, wore his hair in dreadlocks. Likewise, appellee introduced Cook’s pre-trial statement to the police, which was inconsistent with his trial testimony and consistent with his PCRA testimony, as it stated that he did not see the shooting. Cook also claimed that he provided his perjurious trial testimony, inculpating appellee, in exchange for both a pizza and sentencing consideration on a separate drug-related charge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

George claimed that he saw the shooter and then described someone who did not resemble appellee. George also stated that he had never seen appellee prior to the PCRA hearing. Contradicting Cook’s trial testimony, George claimed that no one looking down the breezeway could have seen the shooting. George further asserted that, even though he was an eyewitness to the shooting, he had lied to police and told them that he did not see anything.

Johnson did admit, however, that she had phone conversations with the defense investigator prior to trial and told him that appellee was with her in Brooklyn on June 18, 1996, and that that day was a Wednesday.

When pressed, however, trial counsel testified that he did not recall having specific conversations with Crystal or Shadena regarding the night of the week the get-together in Brooklyn occurred, and could not provide a clear answer when asked whether he knew “that Shadena Johnson was going to say that the party was on a Wednesday.” <em>Id. </em>at 444-47. When asked if “it would have been important to find out if your [alibi] witnesses thought they were talking about a Wednesday night [when the murder occurred on a Tuesday],” trial counsel invoked the “problems” he had with the alibi witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 443-44. Trial counsel also testified that he “would have had some reason to expect what she was going to say,” but that “what the witnesses say isn’t always what they told you.” <em>Id. </em>at 444.

Penalty phase counsel testified at the PCRA hearing that at some point he had spoken with appellee’s mother, though he did not investigate appellee’s social or educational history.

The court noted that, at the time, it had presumed that trial counsel had some legitimate reason for deciding not to do so.

We are left, then, with a situation where the witnesses either did not have alibi testimony to offer — in which case trial counsel should not have called them (and in which case, trial counsel properly could be concerned with avoiding the presentation of perjured testimony) — or trial counsel failed to prepare the witnesses to square the date with the correct day of the week. The prejudice would be more apparent, of course, if appellee had introduced evidence below that the alibi witnesses were mistaken about the day of the week, and correct about the date, and that evidence was deemed credible.</p>

Trial counsel’s effort in closing, however, was not evidence. At a minimum, it is clear that the alibi defense as presented was undermined to a substantial degree. Nevertheless, the finding of prejudice below would be more plausible if Crystal Johnson’s testimony clearly established appellee’s alibi, the PCRA court found her evidence credible, and there was some accounting for the absence of Shadena Johnson.</p>
