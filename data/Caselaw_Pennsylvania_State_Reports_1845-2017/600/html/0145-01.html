David’s life has been riddled with mental health problems, treatment, suicide attempts, continuous drug abuse, and poor social relationships. In 1979, David was hospitalized for depression, drug dependence, and adolescent adjustment reaction following a suicide attempt. From 1980 through 1999, the Halpers and David sought his birth mother’s medical records to facilitate treatment and insight into David’s problems.</p>

It was not produced for the plaintiffs until 1999.</p>

Furthermore, Justice Montemuro opined that under <em>Gibbs, </em>failure to disclose applies in the adoption context; thus, the Halpers were under no obligation to show it was foreseeable that David’s birth mother’s mental health problems might negatively impact David in order to establish the Agency had a duty to disclose information regarding her mental illness. <em>Id., </em>at 3-4.

Dr. Gur also testified it is often difficult to pinpoint a particular disorder, especially where major psychiatric disorders are concerned because they are often co-morbid. <em>Id., </em>at 122. Many times substance abuse co-exists with depression or schizophrenia, and the co-morbid nature of these disorders can affect a disease process and obscure a clinical picture. <em>Id., </em>at 122-23.

In viewing their complete testimony, the experts were in agreement regarding David’s past behaviors, suicide attempts, substance abuse, and overall scheme of mental illness. Those similarities suggest the difference in diagnosis was not fatal and was fit for jury submission. In fact, it is similar to the difference noted in <em>Braman. </em>Even though the ultimate diagnoses were different, those differences did not sufficiently compromise the expert testimony to remove the issue from the jury’s consideration, and we believe the Superior Court erred in its interpretation and application of <em>Braman. </em>The trial court was correct in finding this to be a matter for the jury to decide, because sufficient testimony was taken to allow such a determination, and the evidence was not so contrary as to be fatal. <em>See </em>N.T.

In my view, after an adoption has occurred, the <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>dynamics of the agency/adoptive-parent relationship differ somewhat from those obtaining in the pre-adoptive period, as the adoptive parents have already made and finalized their decision, the duration of the post-adoptive timeframe is much longer, and different legislative directives may apply. Thus, I would not find that <em>Gibbs </em>authorizes a negligent-failure-to-disclose claim in all post-ádoptive situations.</p>
    <p id="b267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[206,750,1151,751]]]'>Under the present facts, however, I am comfortable with the outcome for several reasons. First, the agency negligently failed to locate information about the birth mother’s medical history that it had in its possession when specific requests for such information were made in the post-adoptive timeframe.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Second, by the time such requests were made, the genetic basis for the mother’s mental illness was recognized in the medical community, thus undermining any contention that <em>Gibbs’ </em>foreseeability requirement was not met.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Finally, it seems evident (at least to me) that, any time a parent whose adopted child is experiencing mental difficulties contacts the adoption agency seeking information about the birth mother’s history of mental illness, failure to disclose relevant data that is on file at the agency may result in harm.</p>

Although Appellee argues that <em>Gibbs </em>interpreted a later adoption act than the one in effect at the time of the present adoption, the recognition of the duty to disclose was not based solely on the statute; it was predicated on the inherent nature of the relationship between the agency and the adoptive parents. <em>See id. </em>at 214-15, 647 A.2d at 892-93.</p>

It appears to have been assumed at the common pleas level that the Agency had a continuing duty to maintain indefinitely records of the type that it misplaced. As this supposition is not contradicted by the Agency, the issue is not before the Court; thus, I do not understand today’s holding to reflect the proposition that such a duty necessarily exists relative to all children whose adoption the agency has facilitated.</p>

The first post-adoptive request for information was made in 1980, and even the Agency effectively concedes that, by that time, a genetic predisposition relative to the disorder was widely recognized. For example, on cross-examination of one of the plaintiff's expert witnesses, counsel for the Agency elicited that a major study suggesting such a genetic component had been published in 1967, thirteen years before the first request for information. <em>See </em>N.T. Feb. 23, 2004 at 177-78; RR. at 104a. Additionally, in its brief to this Court, the Agency only contends that the prevailing view that such illnesses were caused by environmental factors persisted throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, <em>see </em>Brief for Appellee at 5 n. 2, but not the 1980s. <em>See also </em>N.T. Feb. 23, 2004 at 184; RR. at 105a (eliciting that, by 1980 at least nine major psychiatric studies had shown a substantially greater risk for schizophrenia in the close relatives of persons with schizophrenia than in the population at large).</p>
