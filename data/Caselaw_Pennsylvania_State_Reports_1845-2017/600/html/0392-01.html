Mr. Sementelli, an 83 year-old veteran, had suffered a brutal attack. He sustained over 60 wounds, 18 fractures, and 45 bruises to various parts of his body, many of them to his head, face, and neck. Mr. Sementelli’s left ear was nearly severed from his head. His nasal bone and skull were fractured and his right eye punctured. He had numerous defensive wounds on his arms and hands and multiple gaping chop wounds all over his body. The killer used a hatchet. •</p>

The investigation soon focused on Appellant Shonda Dee Walter, a young woman who lived with her mother in a house across the street from Mr. Sementelli.</p>

Appellant’s mother, Judith Walter, told police that her daughter had been out of the house on that evening, only to return later and leave again, taking the telephone with her. Mrs. Walter never saw her daughter again that night, but when she awoke the next morning she noticed that the phone had been returned and Appellant had left a note explaining that she was staying at her friend Michelle’s house.</p>

Gaines, who lived in Williamsport, knew Appellant through Michelle Mathis, a young woman who was allegedly a member of the Bloods street gang and lived on the same street as Gaines. According to Gaines, she was at Mathis’s home on the night of the murder, caring for Mathis’s child. Mathis had been involved in an altercation on the street earlier that evening and had been taken to the hospital for treatment. While Mathis was at the hospital, Appellant appeared at Mathis’s Williamsport residence. Appellant was driving Mr. Sementelli’s white Toyota. Gaines granted Appellant entrance to Mathis’s home and noticed that Appellant had blood on her forehead and was wearing rubber gloves that also had blood on them. Appellant promptly went upstairs to shower while Gaines waited downstairs. At some point Mathis returned. Ultimately, the three women left the house and traveled in Mr. Sementelli’s car to his house in Lock Haven. While en route, Appellant told Gaines and Mathis that she had killed the victim and described how she struck him repeatedly with the hatchet while she ignored his pleas that she call for help.</p>

According to Gaines, the purpose of the visit was to dispose of a cigarette that Appellant had left at the scene and to remove the body from the house. Gaines refused to assist Appellant and Mathis and quickly returned to the car. Appellant and Mathis soon joined her, with Appellant carrying a large plastic tub of quarters. Before leaving, Appellant ran into her mother’s house to leave a note and get a change of clothes. The women then drove to a grocery store and redeemed the coins, receiving a receipt for $510.25 from a coin machine.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The supermarket video camera recorded the women’s visit.

Appellant told Jones and others that the car belonged to her father, who had died, and she wanted to sell it because she had “bad memories” about it. When the sale was unsuccessful, the group returned to Williamsport and Appellant permitted Jones to drive the vehicle. Police stopped Jones while he was driving the car and Gaines feared that Jones, who knew nothing about Mr. Sementelli’s death, would be implicated in the crime. As a result, Gaines contacted police and told them everything she knew.</p>

Blood on the hatchet matched that of Mr. Sementelli. A friend of Appellant’s told police that a similar hatchet had been stolen from his parents’ house years earlier during a party that Appellant attended. The friend’s father confirmed that the murder weapon was the one he had owned. Another Williamsport resident told police that she had seen Appellant wearing a hatchet on her belt in the weeks before the murder. Appellant’s mother explained that when Appellant moved into her house with her young daughter in 2002, one of Appellant’s possessions was a hatchet, which she placed in a kitchen drawer. When Appellant was arrested, Mrs. Walter searched for the hatchet with police, but it was no longer in the drawer.</p>

Appellant <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>was bound over for trial in May 2003.

On the night of the murder, Appellant appeared at a friend’s house in Williamsport driving the victim’s car, with blood on her hands and forehead. She returned to the scene of the crime with witness Shanee Gaines, to whom Appellant described in detail the murder she committed that night. Multiple witnesses connected Appellant to the murder weapon, including her own mother. In addition to the evidence summarized above, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of two people Appellant confided in while in prison. Amanda Horner testified that Appellant admitted her guilt and described the manner in which she had committed the murder. Appellant explained to Horner that she had killed Mr. Sementelli because she wanted his car, which she intended to sell for money to pay off fines that she owed. Gaines and other witnesses testified that Appellant drove the Toyota to Philadelphia shortly after the murder in an effort to sell it. Both Horner and inmate/witness Coran Freeland testified that Appellant said she also killed the victim because she wanted to gain entry into the Bloods street gang.</p>

She asserts that the trial court erred in “failing to dismiss the aggravating circumstance ... wherein the Commonwealth failed to demonstrate that ... [she] had the intent to commit a felony during or prior to the course of the murder.” Appellant’s Brief at 2. At the preliminary hearing in this matter, the Commonwealth offered the testimony of Shanee Gaines, who testified that on the night of the murder, Mathis told her that Appellant intended to kill a man for his car and would be coming to Mathis’s home after the murder for help in hiding the body. Defense counsel objected to this testimony on the basis of hearsay. The Commonwealth <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>responded that Mathis’s statement constituted an exception to the hearsay rule in that it was a statement of a coconspirator. Defense counsel argued that admission on this basis was unfair because he had no notice of an alleged conspiracy. The trial court informed counsel that he intended to permit the testimony at that juncture, but that counsel was welcome to request a continuance for additional time in which to cross-examine Gaines. Counsel did not seek a continuance, Gaines’s testimony was admitted, and Appellant was bound over for a capital trial.</p>
    <p id="b507-5" data-blocks='[["BL_507.5",507,[226,886,1161,1379]]]'>Several months after the preliminary hearing, counsel filed a motion to dismiss the aggravating circumstance and a petition for writ of habeas corpus with respect to the theft charge. At the hearing on the two motions, the transcript from the preliminary hearing was incorporated into the record. The Commonwealth maintained that the statements made by Mathis to Gaines (regarding Appellant’s intention to kill the victim for his car) were admissible as statements of a coconspirator and, further, that those statements established Appellant killed the victim so that she could steal his car. Defense counsel did not object to the Commonwealth’s use of this testimony to satisfy its burden nor did counsel make any argument addressing the admissibility of the evidence. Instead, counsel sought to present the testimony of another witness, Frank Flippen. When asked for an offer of proof, counsel asserted that Flippen would testify that it was Mathis who killed Mr. Sementelli. The trial court ruled that such evidence was irrelevant to the issue before it, <em>ie., </em>whether the Commonwealth had presented any evidence in support of the aggravating circumstance. Again, counsel made no argument on the evidence the Commonwealth presented or the admissibility of that evidence. The trial court ultimately denied the motion to dismiss the aggravating circumstance.

This Court is required to affirm the sentence of death unless we determine that 1) it was “the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor”; or 2) “the evidence fails to support the finding of at least one aggravating circumstance.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3). Our review of the record does not <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>lead us to conclude that the jury’s verdict in this case was triggered by an improper factor. Further, we conclude that the evidence presented was sufficient to support the jury’s finding of a single aggravating circumstance, to wit, a murder committed while in the perpetration of a felony. Accordingly, we affirm the verdict and the sentence of death.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

The entirety of Appellant's argument on these claims is as follows: "It is suggest [sic] that Title 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711 et. seq. violates the prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment because of the mandatory nature of the act. It is further argued that Title 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711 is unconstitutional on its face in that it precludes the jury from exercising the historical right and function to dispense mercy. It was also argued as follows, that Title 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711 et. seq. is unconstitutional on its face because it does not require finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, and it places the burden of proof on the accused to prove mitigating circumstances. It is also argued that Title 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711 et. seq. is unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection of the law since the statute creates categories for which the penalty may be imposed which separate and rule out Defendants for which the penalty may not be imposed in a manner that is not rationally related to a legitimate objective. It is further argued that Title 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711 et. seq. is unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of the powers doctrine and that Title 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711 et. seq. is unconstitutional as it applies to the facts and circumstances of the case currently before this Court. Defendant argued that in general, the imposition of the death penalty was unconstitutional.” Appellant’s Brief at 8.</p>
