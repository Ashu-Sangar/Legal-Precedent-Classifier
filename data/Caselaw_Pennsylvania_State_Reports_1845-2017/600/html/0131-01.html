The field representative did not observe any health or safety hazards at the center; however, she determined it did not have a certificate of compliance. DPW regulations require all child day care centers providing care for seven or more children, like St. Elizabeth’s, to obtain a certificate of compliance before commencing operations. 55 Pa.Code § 3270.3(c); <em>id., </em>§ 3270.11(a). Because St. Elizabeth’s did not have a certificate, DPW ordered it to cease and desist operating the day care center. St. Elizabeth’s appealed to DPW’s Bureau of Hearings and Appeals, arguing DPW lacked statutory authority to promulgate regulations requiring certification of nonprofit child day care centers. St. Elizabeth’s also raised constitutional concerns regarding the regulations’ impact on religious liberty.</p>

      <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>Although I agree with the majority that the Department is to be accorded a fair amount of deference, and the longstanding tenure of the Department’s regulations is relevant, such factors are not insurmountable in the face of a clear legislative scheme. <em>See, e.g., Insurance Federation of Pa. v. Commonwealth Dep’t of Ins., </em><a href="/pa/585/0630-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="585 Pa. 630" data-case-ids="2472515" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0630-01">585 Pa. 630</a>, <a href="/pa/585/0630-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="889 A.2d 550" data-case-ids="2472515,8993635" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0630-01,/a2d/889/0550-01">889 A.2d 550</a> (2005) (invalidating forty-year-old regulations of the Department of Insurance which required mandatory arbitration of underinsured and underinsured motorist coverage disputes). Here, I believe that the clear implication of the statute should control. I also do not believe that the decision in <em>Hospital Association of Pennsylvania v. MacLeod, </em><a href="/pa/487/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="487 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="1759059" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0516-01">487 Pa. 516</a>, <a href="/pa/487/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="487 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="1759059" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0516-01">410 A.2d 731</a> (1980), is controlling, as that case concerned the extent of powers expressly invested in the Department and not bounded by the Legislature in the manner of the licensure requirement.</p>

Section 1002 of the governing statute mandates, "No person shall maintain, operate or conduct any <em>facility, </em>as defined herein, without having a license therefore issued by the department.” 62 P.S. § 1002 (emphasis added). Section 1001 clarifies that the term "facility” includes a "child day care center,” defined as "any premises operated <em>for profit </em>in which child day care is provided ...” but not including those "supervised” by DPW. 62 P.S. § 1001 (emphasis added). There is no dispute in this case that Appellee's non-profit child day care center is a supervised entity, and thus, is not a "facility” subject to the statutory licensure requirement.</p>

The Department’s regulations define a certificate of compliance as: A document issued by the Department to a legal entity permitting the entity to operate a specific type of facility at a specific location for a specific period of time according to applicable Department regulations. A certificate of compliance <em>approves the operation of a facility subject to Article IX </em>of the act (62 P.S. §§ 901-922) <em>or licenses the operation of a facility subject to Article X </em>of the act (62 P.S. §§ 1001-1087).</p>

The Department’s authority to visit and inspect supervised entities is expressly prescribed in the Public Welfare Code, as is its ability to seek enforcement via the Department of Justice (now the Office of Attorney General). <em>See </em>62 P.S. §§ 911, 921(e). I believe that, pursuant to this authority, the Department could ensure the identification of entities subject to supervision by implementing a simple registration requirement, and certainly it could continue to maintain records of the results of its inspections and the compliance history of supervised entities.</p>
