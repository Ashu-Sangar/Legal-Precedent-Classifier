Specifically, Judge Colins first agreed with the Commissioner that policyholders with claims for losses are “creditors” under Section 221.30 and that the payments at issue were for antecedent debt. Judge Colins held, however, that the debt arose at the first effective date of the insurance policy, not at the time of the filing of the Claim and Proof of Loss or at the time each Policyholder executed its Certifications and Release Agreement. Thus, according to Judge Colins, the payments were not preferences under the statute because the antecedent debts arose outside the one-year preference period.

    <p id="b424-4" data-blocks='[["BL_424.5",424,[276,770,1150,1378]]]'>The Commissioner offers various arguments as to why the decision of the Commonwealth Court should be reversed. First, the Commissioner maintains the payments at issue in this appeal satisfy all of the requirements of Section 221.30— the payments were made by Reliance less than one year before its rehabilitation, and they were made to creditors, the Policyholders, for an antecedent debt. Buttressing this contention, the Commissioner notes the Commonwealth Court found the Policyholders were creditors and the payments were for an antecedent debt, as Reliance paid claims for which the Policyholders submitted proofs of loss months earlier. Moreover, the payments were received by the Policyholders in the one-year period before the petition for rehabilitation was filed. Second, the Commissioner asserts the Commonwealth Court’s ruling that the payments were not preferences because the “debt” was outside of the preference period is inconsistent with the statute and against the underlying policies of the Act, as Section 221.30 only requires that the transfer, i.e., the payment, be within the preference period, not that the debt should arise within the preference period. According to the Commissioner, it is the date of payment, not the age of the antecedent debt, that is the focus of the statute. Finally, the Commissioner contends that Section 221.30 does not provide for an ordinary course of business defense, and thus it should not be recognized as an exemption from the definition of preference.</p>

As Reliance paid each of the Policyholders substantially contemporaneously with their satisfaction of this condition of payment, and Reliance’s obligation did not arise until after this condition was satisfied, the Policyholders maintain that the debt was not antecedent at the time of the payment. Furthermore, the Policyholders assert that the Commissioner provided no “rational basis” for bringing preference actions against only four of the thousands of Reliance policyholders who received insurance payments during the preference look-back period. Finally, according to the Policyholders, Section 221.30 only applies to “creditors,” and the term “creditor” does not encompass “policyholders.” Therefore, the Policyholders conclude Section 221.30 does not apply to the payments made by Reliance to the Policyholders.</p>

The relevant language in Section 221.30(a), concerning voidable preferences, provides: <em>“A </em>preference is a transfer of any of the property of an insurer to or for the benefit of a creditor, for or on account of an antecedent debt, made or suffered by the insurer within one year before the filing of a successful petition [for rehabilitation].” 40 P.S. § 221.30(a).</p>

The phrase “antecedent debt” is not defined in the statute or in our case law. Each party offers a different interpretation of this language. In particular, the Commissioner submits that, as a general matter, an antecedent debt is considered to be a debt occurring when a creditor first had a claim against a debtor, whether fixed or contingent on subsequent events. According to the Commissioner, the payments here were made after the Policies’ inception and were made months after the Policyholders made claims for payment, and thus they constitute antecedent debt. Moreover, the Commissioner argues, the preference action cannot be defeated by the contention that Reliance’s payments of proceeds to the Policyholders were made in the ordinary course of business because the Insurance Act provides for no such exemption. Indeed, Section 221.30(a) does not use or refer to the terms “ordinary course of business.” The Commissioner notes while there is an ordinary course of business exemption in the federal bankruptcy law and in certain state insurance laws, these are set forth as express defenses to a preference action in the statute. <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>According to the Commissioner, if the General Assembly had intended the defense be available, it could have provided for such an exemption.</p>

The preference provision in the earlier Bankruptcy Act did not expressly include an exception for payments made in the ordinary course of business. The courts interpreting the federal law, however, developed what came to be known as the “current expense” rule to cover certain situations in which a debtor’s payments on the eve of bankruptcy did not diminish the estate because tangible assets were obtained in exchange for the payment. <em>Marshall v.

Specifically, our interpretation of the phrase antecedent debt protects and upholds the economic expectations of insureds, including policyholders. At the same time, it prohibits unusual transfers and the proverbial race to the courthouse <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>steps. Thus, our interpretation embraces concepts of both insured protection and equitable apportionment of losses. Additionally, we find our conclusion regarding legislative intent is consistent with the principles underlying federal bankruptcy law and with the federal courts’ experience under such law. Indeed, in the past, federal courts have not hesitated to judicially recognize limited exceptions to transfers that were otherwise preferences. While one state has expressly adopted an ordinary course of business transfer exception, other states that have considered similar issues have come to differing, albeit reasonable, conclusions. We simply find more compelling the approach which recognizes the phrase “antecedent debt” not to include ordinary course of business transfers.</p>

An insurance consumer’s selection of an insurer might very well turn on whether a policyholder’s receipt of monies paid for a loss by an insurer may be recovered as a voidable preference, and thus lead to domicile shopping in which potential policyholders avoid purchasing insurance from Pennsylvania insurers. Moreover, we find that without an ordinary course of business transfer exception, a real possibility exists that a distressed insurance company would not be able to be restored to financial stability due to policyholders cancelling existing coverage with that troubled insurer and seeking replacement coverage with another insurer. Finally, we simply do not believe that the General Assembly intended to create the uncertainty that would arise for insureds that have been paid in full for losses covered by varying insurance policies, such as automobile, workers’ compensation, and life insurance, if such payments could be regarded as preferences and taken back by the Commissioner. Thus, we conclude that the practical consequences of not recognizing an ordinary course of business exception provide a strong indication of the legislature’s intention.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> While arguments certainly can be <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>made to the contrary, if the General Assembly did not intend the conclusion we reach today, it may amend the Insurance Act accordingly.</p>

Reliance made the payments after each Policyholder filed a Claim and Proof of Loss under its Policy, after Reliance determined that the claim was covered, and after the Policyholder executed a Certifications and Release Agreement, all in accord with the terms of the Policy.

After that, a “waiting period” of up to six months was triggered before payment was due, <em>see, e.g., </em>Ingram Micro Policy (RR.127a), and in any event, payment was not mandatory until the insured signed a Certifications and Release Agreement form, which would not occur until after the insurer’s decision that the claim was valid.
