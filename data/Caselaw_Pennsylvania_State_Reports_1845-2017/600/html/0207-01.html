(“Huntley”), an engineering company involved in the oil and gas industry in Pennsylvania, sought to extract natural gas from two parcels of land located in the Borough of Oakmont, Allegheny County (the “Borough”). In particular, the company sought to drill and operate a natural gas well on residential property owned by Mr. and Mrs. Capretto. Huntley contemplated that the well would supply natural gas from that property, as well as an adjacent residential parcel owned by Mr. and Mrs. Massaro. Both parcels are located in an R-l (single-family) residential <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>zoning district within the Borough, and comprise a total of approximately ten acres (hereinafter, the “Property”).</p>
    <p id="b319-4" data-blocks='[["BL_319.5",319,[223,451,1153,1055]]]'>On August 31, 2005, Huntley entered into commercial oil and gas lease agreements with both the Caprettos and the Massaros to allow it to conduct drilling and extraction of natural gas from the Property. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (the “Department”) issued a permit one week later, approving the drilling of the well at that location. Thereafter, the Borough solicitor sent a letter to Huntley on November 9, 2005, setting forth its position on the matter. The letter stated that the Borough solicitor, the Borough Council (“Council”), and the municipality’s zoning officer were all in agreement that, under the proper interpretation of the Borough’s zoning ordinance (the “Ordinance”), drilling for natural gas constituted the extraction of minerals, which is only permitted in an R-l district as a conditional use. Thus, the solicitor directed Huntley to cease operations on the well and submit a conditional use application, which would ultimately be acted upon by Council after a hearing at which interested parties could be heard. Any approval, moreover, would be subject to such conditions as Council deemed appropriate.</p>
    <p id="b319-5" data-blocks='[["BL_319.6",319,[222,1532,1152,845]],["BL_320.1",320,[272,328,1150,302]]]'>In accordance with the above, Huntley perfected a conditional-use application and, on February 6, 2006, Council held a public hearing. At the hearing, Huntley’s employees testified that the construction of the well would take about six weeks, would require approximately 30 trips of heavy equipment or trucks, and would be noisy. If completed according to plan, the operation would entail: a wellhead consisting of red and green pipes protruding approximately four feet above ground; a chain link fence around the wellhead with privacy screening and landscaping to conceal unsightliness; a 15,000 square foot “pad;” a 50-barrel fluid tank beatable anywhere on the property; a vent shaft protruding from the tank to vent some of the gas; pressure relief valves; a gravel access road from a nearby street to the well site; and a utility gas meter along another road bordered by a chain link fence. Following construction, the well would require regular servicing for six <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>months, including the evacuation of water from the fluid tank, which would involve a truck traveling through the neighborhood to the site. Huntley estimated that 75 percent of the gas extracted from the well would be sold to a public utility, with the remainder to be consumed by the Caprettos and Massaros.</p>

One group, represented by counsel, made several specific objections to the application, including that: Council lacked jurisdiction; only solid crystalline substances qualify as minerals and, hence, natural gas does not constitute a mineral; and the proposed use is a prohibited commercial use in an R-l residential zone. The second group of objectors, not represented by counsel, protested that the use would have adverse safety, noise, and traffic effects on the community.</p>
    <p id="b321-4" data-blocks='[["BL_321.5",321,[241,901,1155,1283]]]'>Council eventually concluded — contrary to the view reflected in the Borough’s prior correspondence — that the proposed use did not fall within the zoning ordinance’s definition of “extraction of minerals” so as to constitute a conditional use within an R-l district. In reaching this determination, Council reasoned that extraction of natural gas does not constitute a mining process and that natural gas is not a mineral. Acknowledging that the zoning ordinance lacked any specific definition of “mineral,” Council relied on its view that Pennsylvania common law has applied a rebuttable presumption in the context of private deed conveyances that the term “mineral” does not include oil or gas. <em>See </em>Council’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 8 (citing <em>Dunham &amp; Short v.

Additionally, Council stated that, because the extraction of natural gas is not a use specifically identified in the zoning ordinance, Council lacked jurisdiction to consider whether that use would qualify as a special exception, as such determinations rest within the exclusive power of the Borough’s zoning hearing board.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Finally, Council held that the Oil and Gas Act did not preempt the Borough’s power to restrict the location of gas drilling and wellheads.

The court agreed with Council’s conclusions that gas drilling does not constitute the extraction of minerals for purposes of the Ordinance, and that the Act does not preempt local zoning regulations involving gas drilling and production. In the latter respect, the court relied on the Commonwealth Court’s decision in <em>Nalbone v. Borough of Youngsville, </em>104 Pa. Cmwlth. 623, <a href="/pa-commw/104/0623-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="522 A.2d 1173" data-case-ids="1356671" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/104/0623-01">522 A.2d 1173</a> (1987), in which the court held that the Act permitted local regulation of oil and gas operations upon compliance with the Municipalities Planning Code (“MPC”). The common pleas court, moreover, agreed with Council that the proposed use could only be allowed in the Borough as a special exception; thus, the court affirmed Council’s determination that the matter fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the zoning hearing board. <em>See Huntley &amp; Huntley v.

The court explained that <em>Nalbone </em>had concluded that the Act, as it existed in-1987, preserved “local regulation of oil and gas well operations upon compliance with the provisions of the [MPC].” <em><a href="/a2d/929/1252-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="929 A.2d 1252" data-case-ids="8356296" data-case-paths="/a2d/929/1252-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/929/1252-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="929 A.2d 1252" data-case-ids="8356296" data-case-paths="/a2d/929/1252-01">at 1256</a> (quoting <em>Nalbone, </em>104 Pa.Cmwlth. at 626, <a href="/pa-commw/104/0623-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="522 A.2d 1173" data-case-ids="1356671" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/104/0623-01">522 A.2d at 1175</a>). However, in 1992 the General Assembly amended Section 602 of the Act by adding the second sentence, which directs that municipal ordinances adopted pursuant to the MPC may not include provisions that “impose conditions, requirements or limitations on the same features of oil and gas operations regulated” by the Act. 58 P.S. § 601.602. The Commonwealth Court interpreted this language to mean that, to the extent the zoning ordinance in question (which was adopted by the Borough pursuant to the MPC) relates to features that the Act already addresses, it is invalid due to the Legislature’s express preemption. <em>See Huntley, </em><a href="/a2d/929/1252-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="929 A.2d 1252" data-case-ids="8356296" data-case-paths="/a2d/929/1252-01">929 A.2d at 1256</a>. Thus, the court found that the preemption question <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>distilled to whether the location of a gas well in a particular area of the Borough is a feature of gas well operations that the Act addresses. The court answered in the affirmative, noting that Section 205 of the Act imposes restrictions on gas well locations. <em>See </em>58 P.S. § 601.205 (providing that oil and gas wells may not be drilled within certain distances of buildings, water wells, wetlands, and various types of bodies of water, and requiring the Department to consider a prospective well’s impact on endangered species, as well as national and historical landmarks, when deciding whether to grant a drilling permit). According to the Commonwealth Court, by imposing further locational restrictions, the ordinance addressed the same topic and was, therefore, preempted with regard to any conditions on well placement, as applied to this case. <em>See Huntley, </em><a href="/a2d/929/1252-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="929 A.2d 1252" data-case-ids="8356296" data-case-paths="/a2d/929/1252-01">929 A.2d at 1256-57</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

In this regard, the Commonwealth Court observed that the ordinance’s enabling statute — the MPC — classifies natural gas as a mineral, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 10107, and that the dictionary defines mining to include mineral extraction. Thus, as the zoning ordinance expressly lists “extraction of minerals” as an allowable conditional use in an R-l district, the court found that the ordinance permitted the creation of the proposed well as a conditional use, notwithstanding that the ordinance itself does not specifically define the terms “mining” or “mineral.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b325-5" data-blocks='[["BL_325.6",325,[240,638,1153,1744]]]'>Appellants argue that the “very essence” of zoning is the designation of areas where different uses are permitted, subject to the appropriate level of municipal review. They state that, with the Oil and Gas Act, the Legislature distinguished the technical features of oil and gas operations, which the Act regulates and which the Department oversees statewide, from local zoning authority under the MPC, which the Act preserves. Thus, Appellants claim that the Commonwealth Court’s decision was flawed in that it failed to recognize this “how-versus-where” distinction. In support of their contention, Appellants point to state-preemption provisions of other statutes — such as the Solid Waste Management Act, the Surface Mining Act, and the Non-Coal Act — that they maintain are similar to the preemption language in Section 602, and aver that a substantial body of decisional law from the Commonwealth Court interpreting such statutes has recognized that these provisions preempt local governance of operations, but leave local authority for site selection unencumbered. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellants at 28-25 (citing cases). Appellants emphasize their point in this regard by asserting that, even in the three areas of the law where the Legislature has preempted all local regulation, namely, alcoholic beverages, banking, and anthracite strip mining, <em>see Hydropress Envtl.

According to Appellants, the General Assembly’s goal was merely to clarify, in the wake of certain judicial decisions, that the Commonwealth was preempting all local regulation of the operational facets of oil and gas enterprises, whether the ordinances in question were enacted before or after the effective date of the amendment. However, Appellants argue that the Legislature was not attempting to preempt zoning ordinances to the extent they designate appropriate districts in which oil and gas operations may be located. Rather, Appellants suggest that the setback and other requirements of Section 205, <em>see </em>58 P.S. § 601.205, are only intended as a minimum level of protection for existing buildings, national landmarks, bodies of water, and other environmentally sensitive areas.</p>

Thus, according to the Department, when the Legislature amended Section 602 of the Act to clarify that zoning ordinances enacted under the MPC may not “contain provisions which impose conditions, requirements or limitations on the same features of oil and gas well operations” regulated by the Act or “accomplish the same purposes” as the Act, it simply intended to foreclose municipalities from legislating on the technical aspects of well operations or enacting ordinances that purport to establish permitting, bonding, or registration <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>requirements for oil or gas wells.

They observe that the MPC’s definitions generally attach to terms as they are “used in this act [the MPC],” 53 P.S. 10107(a), and reference <em>Boyd </em>for the position that local ordinances need not utilize the same definition of such words. Appellants also aver that the Ordinance makes reasonable provision for natural gas development, as required by the MPC, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 10603(i), because drilling is permitted as a special exception in other areas of the municipality besides R-l residential districts. Additionally, Appellants point out that the Ordinance’s definition of “extraction of minerals” includes the term mining and, on this basis, the Borough’s construction of the activity to exclude drilling was reasonable.</p>

Further, Huntley maintains that <em>Boyd </em>is inapposite for the reason articulated by the Commonwealth Court, namely, that the ordinance in <em>Boyd </em>defined “structure” in a way that was consistent with the MPC’s definition, and that the Commonwealth Court appropriately looked to the MPC in the present dispute to supply a default definition of “mineral” in the absence of one provided by the Ordinance. Finally, Huntley states that this Court has previously acknowledged that natural gas is a mineral.</p>

As to the first of these points, the Borough’s argument is not persuasive because it does not explain why drilling for fugacious minerals is less compatible with the common use of land in an R-l district than is mining for coal or other solid substances, an arguably counterintuitive notion that would appear to require some justification.</p>

Because of the potential for confusion, we again emphasize that our holding in this respect should not be understood to imply that any and all regulation of oil and gas development under the Ordinance would be permissible simply because it is zoning legislation enacted pursuant to the MPC. We do not, for instance, suggest that the municipality could permit drilling in a particular district but then make that permission subject to conditions addressed to features of well operations regulated by the Act.</p>

Although the letter indicated that approval “possibly” would be granted upon completion of the application process, the suggestion that the permit might be denied was not predicated on a potentially restrictive definition of extraction of minerals.</p>

Although drilling for fugacious minerals and mining for solid ones may involve different technical procedures, mining, as the Commonwealth Court noted, is defined with reference to excavating the earth to extract minerals, <em>see Huntley, </em><a href="/a2d/929/1252-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="929 A.2d 1252" data-case-ids="8356296" data-case-paths="/a2d/929/1252-01">929 A.2d at 1257</a>; Random House Webster’s College Dictionary 844 (2d ed. 2000), a process that includes drilling. <em>See generally id. </em>at 459 (reflecting that "excavate” signifies making a hole in the earth by removing material). Thus, the Borough’s argument that removal of solid materials is the only type of mineral extraction allowed in an R-l district due to the use of the word "mining” remains unsupportable, as it rests on a definition of that word that does not appear in the Ordinance and is overly narrow.</p>
