The ensuing complaint was based on alleged negligence associated with surgical procedures performed by Dr. El-Daief on Appellant’s wrist and hand in May and August 2000. The central allegation was that Dr. El-Daief negligently lacerated the radial nerve in Appellant’s wrist during one of the surgeries. Appellees sought summary judgment, invoking the governing two-year statute of limitations, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 5524(2). In response, Appellant relied on the discovery rule, which operates to toll the running of the statute of limitations for latent injuries, or injuries of unknown etiology, until the plaintiff knew or should have known she was injured by the conduct of another. <em>See Fine, </em><a href="/citations/?q=582%20Pa.%20258" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="582 Pa. 258">582 Pa. at 267-68, 272-74</a>, <a href="/pa/582/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="870 A.2d 850" data-case-ids="650314,9019716" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0253-01,/a2d/870/0850-01">870 A.2d at 858-59, 862</a> (holding that defendant dentists were not entitled to summary judgment in malpractice actions commenced more than two years after the relevant dental procedures, where factual questions remained as to the plaintiffs’ diligence).</p>

The majority distinguished this Court’s decision in <em>Fine </em>as pertaining to the doctrine of fraudulent concealment and in light of its conclusion that, given her symptoms, “there could be no doubt in Appellant’s mind that she suffered an injury, and that the injury had occurred at the time of the second surgery[.]” <em>Id. </em>at 8.

According to the majority, there was evidence in <em>Caro </em>to suggest that the plaintiff may reasonably have believed her symptoms to have been a normal side effect of the treatment procedure; whereas, in the present case, the evidence indicated that Appellant knew by at least September 24, 2001, that her afflictions were not normal. The majority also rejected an argument by Appellant that <em>Caro </em>suggests a definitive diagnosis is necessary to trigger the running of the limitations period, since, under Rule of Civil Procedure 1042.3(a), a plaintiff in a professional liability action is required to file a certificate of merit simultaneously with her complaint, or within sixty days thereafter.</p>

Thus, a statute of limitations can effectively deprive a person of the opportunity to pursue what may be an otherwise valid claim. In the area of medical malpractice, an individual, more often than not, lacks the requisite expertise to know whether the ill effects of a particular medical treatment resulted from someone’s wrongdoing, rather than merely an inevitable or unforeseeable risk of treatment. Because the discovery rule is designed to prevent the accrual of a cause of action before an individual can reasonably be expected to discover that he has a basis for legal redress, the statute should not commence until a claimant knows, or through the exercise of due diligence, should know, that his injury resulted from someone's wrongdoing.</blockquote>

A plaintiff ... armed with the facts about the harm done to him, can protect himself by seeking advice in the medical and legal community. To excuse him from prompdy doing so by postponing the accrual of his claim would undermine the purpose of the limitations statute, which is to require the reasonably diligent presentation of tort claims against the Government. If there exists in the community a generally applicable standard of care with respect to the treatment of his ailment, we see no reason to suppose that competent advice would not be available to the plaintiff as to whether his treatment conformed to that standard. If’advised that he has been wronged, he may promptly bring suit. If competently advised to the contrary, he may be dissuaded, as he should be, from pressing a baseless claim. Of course, he may be incompetently advised or the medical community may be divided on the crucial issue of negligence____But however or even whether he is advised, the putative malpractice plaintiff must determine within the period of limitations whether to sue or not, which is precisely the judgment that other tort claimants must make. If he fails to bring suit because he is incompetently or mistakenly told that he does not have a case, we discern no sound reason for visiting the consequences of such error on the defendant by delaying the accrual of the claim until the plaintiff is otherwise informed or himself determines to bring suit, even though more than two years have passed from the plaintiff’s discovery of the relevant facts about injury.</blockquote>

Again, the discovery rule operates to balance the rights of diligent, injured plaintiffs against the interests of defendants in being free from stale claims, in furtherance of the salient legislative objectives. The balance struck in Pennsylvania has been to require more limited notice to the plaintiff, but to submit factual questions regarding notice to the jury as the fact-finder.</p>

I am compelled to write, however, as I believe the convergence of this Court’s adoption of the certificate of merit (COM) requirements and our application of the discovery rule in medical malpractice cases has the potential for unbridled mischief. Application of current Pennsylvania jurisprudence places plaintiffs, like Appellant, in the precarious position of being constrained to file a lawsuit before they know whether their resulting symptoms are linked to a physician’s malpractice or are common side effects of the procedure performed. Such an absurd consequence resulting from the application of these two countervailing principles of law should not be countenanced. To avert this fundamental unfairness, we should construe the discovery rule so as to toll the statute of limitations until the plaintiff obtains, or with the exercise of <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>due diligence should have obtained, medical evidence sufficient to enable the plaintiff to link her injury to the acts of the defendant. In the instant case, there is no genuine issue of material fact that the lawsuit was filed within two years of when Appellant, after diligent investigation, obtained medical evidence connecting her injury to Appellee Dr. El Daiefs actions. Thus, in my view, Appellant’s action was timely filed as a matter of law, and our mandate on remand should simply be for trial on the merits of Appellant’s claim.</p>

    <p id="b300-4" data-blocks='[["BL_300.5",300,[277,548,1149,837]]]'>This conclusion is on all fours with the Superior Court’s analysis in <em>Caro, </em>which recognized the tension between our application of the discovery rule and a plaintiffs duty to file a certificate of merit. In <em>Caro, </em>the plaintiff underwent surgery on her left knee in May of 1998. Following the surgery, she continued to experience pain, but the defendant/physician assured her that the pain would subside as the tissues healed. On July 14, 1999, the plaintiff obtained a second opinion from another physician, who merely encouraged her to continue treatment. Finally, on September 14, 1999, the plaintiff was examined by a third doctor, who informed her that she had suffered a fractured patella during the surgery performed by the defendant in 1998. The plaintiff did not commence her action within two years of when she incurred the injury, but filed it on September 13, 2001, within two years of receiving the medical diagnosis of the injury and its cause.</p>
    <p id="b300-5" data-blocks='[["BL_300.6",300,[275,1409,1152,510]]]'>As in the instant case, the trial court granted the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the action was untimely. The Superior Court reversed, concluding, as a matter of law, that the plaintiffs action was filed within the requisite two-year period. The court found that the plaintiff diligently investigated, but did not become aware of her injury or who caused it until she consulted with the third physician on September 14, 1999, and therefore the discovery rule applied to toll the statute of limitations on her claims. <em>Id. </em>at 537.</p>

The court ruled that, in light of the new requirements of Rule 1042.3, evidence that an injured party appeared to <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>have lost confidence in his or her physician, without more, is insufficient to trigger the running of the statute of limitations where a plaintiff has diligently sought to discover the cause of his or her injury. <em>Id.</em>

    <p id="b301-4" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[247,567,1149,365]]]'>I would adopt the approach taken in <em>Caro </em>and conclude that, where a plaintiff has diligently sought to discover the cause of his or her injury, the statute of limitations begins to commence when the plaintiff obtains medical evidence sufficient to enable the plaintiff to link his or her injury to the acts of the defendant, and thereby possesses the requisite knowledge to obtain a COM in support of the claim asserted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

    <p id="b301-5" data-blocks='[["BL_301.7",301,[246,961,1150,413]]]'>Applying such law to the facts presented, I would conclude that Appellant engaged in a diligent investigation into the nature and cause of her injury, and that there is no genuine issue of material fact that she was unaware of the nature of her injury and its cause until she obtained the medical diagnosis from Dr. Fried on April 23, 2003.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Thus, I would conclude that Appellant’s action filed on October 10, 2003 was timely filed as a matter of law.</p>

While it is not in the record, as a matter of common sense, we can divine that Dr. Nutt was appreciative of Dr. El-Daief’s referral of this as well as other patients, and was not about to jeopardize the referral relationship by explaining to Appellant that Dr. El-Daief’s malpractice was the cause of her difficulties.</p>

Contrary to the majority, I respectfully do not view this approach as constituting a policy decision reserved for the legislature. While it is clear that the ultimate issue lies in whether the statute of limitations has been satisfied, the approach advocated herein concerns not the statute itself, but rather the interplay of the judicially-created discovery rule and the court-imposed rules of civil procedure. Thus, I believe that it is within our judicial authority and, in fact, our obligation to reexamine our precedent in light of the countervailing interests discussed herein.</p>

I acknowledge that a determination of whether the discovery rule applies will ordinarily be left for the jury because ordinarily there will be genuine issues of material fact. <em>See Fine v. Checcio, </em><a href="/pa/582/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="148" data-cite="582 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="650314" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0253-01">582 Pa. 253</a>, <a href="/pa/582/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="149" data-cite="870 A.2d 850" data-case-ids="650314,9019716" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0253-01,/a2d/870/0850-01">870 A.2d 850</a>, 858 (2005) (providing that a jury ordinarily determines whether the discovery rule applies because such issue involves a factual determination as to whether a party was able, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, to know of the injury and its cause). In the instant case, however, it is undisputed that Appellant was unaware of the nature of her injury or its cause until she obtained the medical diagnosis from Dr. Fried on April 23, 2003. As there are no facts to submit to a jury, the general rule as established in <em>Fine </em>is inapplicable to this case.</p>
