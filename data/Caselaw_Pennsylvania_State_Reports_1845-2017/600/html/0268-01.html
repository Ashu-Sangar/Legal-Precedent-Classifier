Peters, </em><a href="/a2d/915/1213-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="915 A.2d 1213" data-case-ids="8340393" data-case-paths="/a2d/915/1213-01">915 A.2d 1213</a>, 1219 (Pa.Super.2007); the majority-agreed. Majority Op., at 271-74, 965 A.2d at 224-25. Such a notion could only be possible if “pursuit” means pursuing the investigation, not the culprit. According to the Superior Court’s holding, the commencement of any investigation would become a pursuit, as its object is the eventual capture of the perpetrator — this is not what is contemplated by the concept of hot or fresh pursuit, statutory or otherwise. The court further stated the officer “chased” appellant “from one scene to the next.” <em>See Peters, </em>at 1219-20. Clearly, there was no chasing done here — chasing connotes persons in motion, one after the other, whether in sight of one another or not. Police searched for appellant, but did not chase him anywhere. Here, appellant called the police, and other officers already arrived. The arresting officer simply drove to appellant’s home; he did not “chase” appellant anywhere. It is also questionable whether the officer pursued appellant “continuously” and “without interruption”; since the theory is the “chase” started with the radio call, it must be that the half-hour on-scene investigation was not an interruption of the “chase.”</p>
    <p id="b384-4" data-blocks='[["BL_384.5",384,[277,1655,1151,256]]]'>The police did nothing wrong here, but there was no hot, uninterrupted pursuit that began the moment of the report of an accident. Therefore, while I would find the facts support the propriety of the arrest and affirm the conviction, I would not do so on the basis of the Superior Court’s reasoning.</p>
