Appellant also held private conversations with the volunteer, criticizing the prison. Upon learning of these events, the Department of Corrections (DOC) recommended appellant’s transfer, noting his previous escape was consummated with the assistance of a prison volunteer, and reasoning the developing close relationship with another volunteer created an escape risk.

The Commonwealth Court found DOC failed to directly address the retaliation claim in its demurrer motion, <em>Yount, </em>at 1167-68, and a careful reading of DOC’s brief in support of its preliminary objections confirms the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion. Accordingly, the concern we expressed in <em>Luitweiler </em>is implicated because the merits of the dispositive issue were not fully litigated below. <em>Cf.

To remand would require additional time and expense from the parties and the Commonwealth Court when, in the end, our interpretation of prevailing law would be based on the same record and advocacy. We reiterate, it is inappropriate for a trial court to grant summary judgment for reasons addressed <em>sua sponte. </em>However, the relevant issue was fully briefed and discussed before this Court, and the parties were afforded the appropriate judicial attention to which they are entitled.

The other tests proffered by the various federal circuits are also, in my opinion, inferior to the <em>Rauser </em>approach. Requiring an inmate to demonstrate but-for causality, as do the First, Fifth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuit Courts of Appeal, <em>see McDonald v.

Moreover, applying a but-for test of causation would require a searching judicial inquiry into prison officials' motivation, since a court would have to consider every document with any relationship to the action or similar actions. This would impose a very high burden of production on officials while, as in <em>Abdul-Akbar, </em>imposing a high burden of persuasion on plaintiffs, simultaneously rendering it difficult for prisoners subjected to retaliation to obtain judicial review and, in violation of the express intent of the drafters of the state and federal PLRAs, rendering it difficult for prison officials to focus on doing their jobs rather than responding to multitudinous discovery requests. Furthermore, requiring a restriction to be "narrowly tailored” to achieve a legitimate objective, as does the Ninth Circuit, <em>see Rhodes v.

The Commonwealth Court and the majority herein declined to address that issue, and instead determined that Appellant had failed to set forth a viable cause of action based on retaliation for having engaged in constitutionally protected conduct. However, I believe it is logical and necessary for this Court to determine as an initial matter whether the relief Appellant seeks is cognizable before determining whether he has set forth a valid cause of action. If the remedy is not cognizable, it is irrelevant whether the cause of action can survive scrutiny. If we determine that prisoners have no right to re-transfer as a remedy in a retaliation case, a position that I advocate, then these causes of action are subject to dismissal at the outset upon proper motion. However, if the issue of available remedy remains unresolved at this time, then similar causes of action will proceed beyond the pleading stage, resulting in the unnecessary waste of precious time and resources of prison officials and the courts. Further, by failing now to address the issue of whether a prisoner may or may not seek transfer or re-transfer as a remedy for a retaliation claim, we simply invite the filing of additional meritless lawsuits by prisoners unhappy with their current places of confinement. Therefore, I believe it is imperative that we first address the issue of whether the courts can grant the relief Appellant requests. For the <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>following reasons, I believe they cannot; I do not believe that Appellant has a cognizable remedy.</p>

On more than one occasion, the United States Supreme Court has expressed the opinion that excessive judicial involvement in prison management “often squanders] judicial resources with little offsetting benefit to anyone” and “run[s] counter to the view ... that ... courts ought to afford appropriate deference and flexibility to state officials trying to manage a volatile [prison] environment.” <em>Sandin v.

The Court has considered the proposition that a prisoner in a more comfortable facility might begin to feel entitled to remain there throughout his term of incarceration. The Court has concluded, nevertheless, that this expectation is too ephemeral and insubstantial to trigger procedural due process protections as long as prison officials have discretion to transfer him for whatever reason or for no reason at all.</blockquote>
