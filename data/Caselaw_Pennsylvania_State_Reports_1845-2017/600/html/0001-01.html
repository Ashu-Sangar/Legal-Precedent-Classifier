Appellees argue that the notice of appeal was untimely because the Commonwealth had to appeal within thirty days of the PCRA court’s order dated January 29, 2003, <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>but did not. According to appellees, the January 29th order was a final order because it granted relief in the form of a new trial. Additionally, appellees aver that the time for taking the appeal was not extended because the Commonwealth’s February 28th request to Judge Keogh regarding the Rule to Show Cause was <em>ex parte. </em>Appellees argue that <em>ex parte </em>proceedings are prohibited by the rules of ethics, judicial conduct, and case law. Moreover, appellees submit, the order was a nullity because it did not comply with the requirements of 42 Pa.C.S. § 5505, which expressly requires notice to the parties. Appellees also assert that Judge Keogh’s order impermissibly expanded the Commonwealth’s time for taking an appeal when the law clearly provides that the time for taking an appeal may not be extended as a matter of grace or indulgence. Appellees intimate that the Commonwealth’s conduct in waiting until the final day of the appeal period somehow was underhanded and in bad faith. Appellees conclude that Judge Keogh’s February 28th order was a nullity, and therefore the Commonwealth had to appeal within thirty days of the January 29th order. The Commonwealth did not do so, and thus, appellees argue that the appeal filed on April 24, 2003 was untimely.</p>
    <p id="b121-5" data-blocks='[["BL_121.5",121,[232,1527,1152,843]]]'>The Commonwealth responds that the January 29th order was not a final order because it did not dispose of all pending claims and, in any event, the interlocutory order was properly vacated on February 28, 2003. The Commonwealth further notes that Section 5505 of the Judicial Code gives the trial court the authority to modify or rescind an order within 30 days after its entry provided no appeal has been taken. In this case, the Commonwealth was merely seeking a ruling as to why the January 29th order should not be modified within 30 days. The Commonwealth argues that Section 5505, which gives the court the power to modify or rescind an order, must include the lesser power to issue a rule to show cause why such modification or rescission is improper. Thus, in the Commonwealth’s view, Judge Keogh’s order vacating the earlier order extinguished any deadline related to the January 29th order.</p>

The Commonwealth’s conduct was not indicative of forum shopping, but rather was necessitated simply by Judge Lineberger’s unexpected absence. Administrative judges in multi-judge counties routinely enter such orders — which amount to status orders — in circumstances where the assigned judge is unavailable. Furthermore, it is worth noting that at the March 5th hearing, Judge Lineberger specifically found that the Commonwealth’s February 28th request was made in “good faith.” <em>Id. </em>at 10.

For these reasons, the PCRA court granted appellees a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b135-6" data-blocks='[["BL_135.6",135,[214,1152,1151,888]]]'>On this appeal, the Commonwealth argues that the defense consulted a forensic expert, Dr. Segal, who confirmed Dr. Hoyer’s evaluation of the case. In the Commonwealth’s view, once trial counsel received that confirmation, trial counsel were not required to shop around for an expert who agreed with their theory of the case. According to the Commonwealth, Attorney Padova obviously shared this information respecting Dr. Segal with Attorney Houston, as the attorneys were working closely together and met to discuss legal strategy. Furthermore, under governing law, the PCRA court was required to presume that counsel furnished Dr. Segal with all relevant materials required for his review unless appellees showed otherwise. The Commonwealth also contends that the evidence fully supported the conclusion of Drs. Hoyer and Segal, since there was bleeding along the wound tracts caused by the bullets, showing that the victim was alive at the time of his death.</p>

Thus, there was testimony that, prior to the events in question, appellees stated that they were going to have to kill the victim because “his father knew a lot <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>of people.” Moreover, even assuming that the victim died due to asphyxiation, the circumstances surrounding — and causing — the asphyxiation showed an intent to kill. The crux of the Commonwealth’s argument, thus, is that appellees cannot show that they were prejudiced by counsel’s actions, since appellees by their own admissions harbored the specific intent to kill the victim before actually causing his death. Thus, it was clear that appellees were guilty of first-degree murder irrespective of the particular time or cause of death.</p>

Appellees point out that the PCRA court credited the opinion testimony of Drs. Catherman and Arden, which would have permitted the jury to find that the victim was dead at the time the shots were fired. Appellees assert that the testimony of Dr. Catherman tended to show that Dr. Hoyer’s postmortem report was inadequate, since it failed to account for the position of the body or the presence of rigor mortis. Furthermore, in appellees’ view, trial counsel were ineffective for failing to cross-examine Dr. Hoyer about the position of the body or the presence of rigor mortis and made no effort to suggest, on the basis of scientific evidence, that the gunshots were fired postmortem. Finally, appellees contend that their PCRA defense experts established that the gunshot wounds were inflicted postmortem or, “at a minimum,” cast “grave doubt on the prosecution’s theory of the case at trial, the evidence presented at trial as it pertains to the cause of death, and more particularly, to the appellee[’s] intent.” Brief of Appellee Daniels at 50.</p>

Therefore, even presuming that Padova contacted Dr. Segal and gave him Dr. Hoyer’s reports, Daniels argues that such actions were constitutionally deficient because counsel failed to provide him with the information that he needed to reach an informed opinion. Furthermore, Daniels contends that his trial counsel knew that this was an issue based upon pre-trial discussions he had with Mr. Drost, but counsel still did nothing. “Rather, he uncritically accepted Dr. Hoyer’s erroneous conclusions regarding the cause of death and attempted, somehow, to argue that these conclusions were consistent with his defense.” Brief of Appellee Daniels at 57.

The death resulting from such acts was a far cry from being “accidental.” Indeed, the physical evidence showed that appellees attempted to kill the helpless victim in multiple ways, and the gunshot wounds— whether ultimately fatal or not — were the <em>coup de grace, </em>demonstrating beyond question that appellees intended to kill the victim.</p>

To suggest that the victim’s death was the result of an “accidental act” or was the result of something less than intentional conduct because he may have died of asphyxiation — caused by appellees — rather than by strangulation or gunshot wounds — also inflicted by appellees — fails to acknowledge that appellees controlled the circumstances surrounding his death every step of the way and that those circumstances fully supported a finding of an intent to kill beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

The origin of the disagreement is that, during <em>voir dire, </em>appellee Pelzer’s counsel, Attorney Padova, questioned the Commonwealth’s practice of striking African American jurors. N.T., 10/20/1989, at 269. Counsel did not, however, specifically raise a <em>Batson </em>challenge, the trial court did not interpret the objection as raising a <em>Batson </em>challenge, and counsel did not press the issue. On the day that the objection was made, the trial court noted the race of the struck jurors on the record, but thereafter, did not continue to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 269, 287, and 308; N.T., 10/23/1989, at 36 (“I don’t know whether the defense is still pushing on this, your use of peremptories, but just in case they are I want to put on the record that this juror, Janis Green, number 155, is a black woman.”). From that point on, however, Attorney Padova did not renew an objection nor did he request that the race of many of the remaining struck jurors be placed on the record. <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>
      <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T., 10/28/1989, at 102 (Queen Overton), 146 (Janis Brant), 193 (Lourdes Saldana). Accordingly, it appears that no <em>Batson </em>claim was raised and preserved at the trial level, and it is certain no such claim was pursued on appeal. Moreover, the bare-bones objection raised by Attorney Padova bears little resemblance to the claim that is now being pursued.

In projecting this number, appellees do not account for the inevitable effect on the "pattern” of strikes created by the defense exercise of strikes.
