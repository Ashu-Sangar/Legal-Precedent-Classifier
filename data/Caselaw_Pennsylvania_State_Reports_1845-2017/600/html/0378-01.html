In its appeal, Riverlife seeks to challenge the Planning Commission’s approval of the height of the Casino’s garage. On March 28, 2008, the Planning Commission and Intervenor PITG Gaming, LLC (“PITG”) filed a Joint Application for Summary Relief, asserting that River-life’s appeal was not timely because the decision Riverlife disputes in fact was rendered months before the Planning Commission’s January 14, 2008 decision and Riverlife failed to appeal the earlier decision. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that Riverlife’s appeal indeed was untimely, and that accordingly, this Court lacks the jurisdiction to consider it. Therefore, we grant the Joint Application for Summary Relief, and quash Riverlife’s appeal.</p>

Riverlife complains that the height disparity that will exist between the Casino and the garage is unacceptable, having increased substantially from that reflected throughout project review.

Riverlife further argues that a building permit issued for the core and shell of the Casino was contrary to Code provisions to the extent that the permit is inclusive of the garage. Riverlife requests that this Court reverse the Planning Commission’s decision to approve PDP No. 0724A and enjoin the issuance of building permits for construction of the garage, or alternatively, that this Court appoint a master under 4 Pa.C.S. § 1506.</p>

The application for PDP No. 0741 plainly describes the Casino as a “Main Structure” that is “2 Stories, 56 Feet” high, and the garage as an “Accessory Structure” that is “9 Stories; 119 Feet” high. <em>See </em>Riverlife’s Reply Brief at Exhibit 9. Similarly, the August 7, 2007 Downtown Riverfront Report submitted to the Planning Commission, recommending approval of the application for PDP No. 0741, states in a finding of fact that “[t]he casino building is to be 2-stories and 60 feet in height, including the parapet; and the parking structure is to be 9-stories and 119 feet in height.” <em><a href="/pa/525/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="582 A.2d 857" data-case-ids="1823699,1823704,1823765" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0504-01,/pa/525/0505-01,/pa/525/0505-02">Id.</a> </em>at Exhibit 13. A letter dated August 10, 2007, sent by the Acting Zoning Administrator to representatives of PITG after the Planning Commission had approved the application for PDP No. 0741 on August 7, 2007, notes the height disparity “between the 119-foot-high parking garage and the bulk of the building 59 feet below” and makes recommendations suggested by the Contextual Design Adviso<a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>ry Panel of the Department of City Planning to ameliorate the resulting “awkward appearance.” <em><a href="/pa/525/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="582 A.2d 857" data-case-ids="1823699,1823704,1823765" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0504-01,/pa/525/0505-01,/pa/525/0505-02">Id.</a> </em>at Exhibit 12. Notably, at the Planning Commission’s January 14, 2008 hearing on PITG’s subsequent application for PDP No. 0724A, Wrenna L. Watson, the Chairwoman of the Planning Commission, asked the Acting Zoning Administrator to confirm that the Planning Commission had already approved the garage and that questions regarding its height were out of order. The Zoning Administrator answered: “In terms of height, yes.” N.T., 1/14/08, at 81. Also, at the January 14, 2008 hearing, Planning Commissioner Todd E. Reibord stated that “the massing of the garage was already reviewed and approved ... in terms of the height and size.” <em>Id. </em>at 87. These record representations are supported by the documentation concerning the subject matter that was before the Planning Commission in connection with its prior approval of PDP No. 0741.</p>
    <p id="b497-4" data-blocks='[["BL_497.5",497,[242,1243,1153,1135]],["BL_498.1",498,[266,343,1148,94]]]'>Based on the record, we conclude that the height of the garage at 119 feet was a subject of the Planning Commission’s decision rendered on August 7, 2007, approving the application for PDP No. 0741. That such is the case is established by the description of the garage as a 119-foot structure in the application for PDP No. 0741 and the references to the 119-foot high garage that were made by the Acting Zoning Administrator in documents that accompanied the Planning Commission’s approval of the application. The post-decisional letter from the Acting Zoning Administrator, and the statements made by City officials at the Planning Commission’s January 14, 2008 hearing, confirm that the height of the garage had already been approved and was no longer open to challenge. Riverlife’s arguments to the contrary fail in light of this record. Thus, the fact that the garage is to be constructed out of pre-cast concrete and the assertion that as of August 7, 2007, the Planning Commission lacked detailed design information on the garage, even if assumed to be true, do not negate the record evidence that the height of the garage was placed before the Planning Commission in the application for PDP No. 0741 and was approved by the Planning Commission <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>on August 7, 2007, when it issued its decision approving that application.</p>

Riverlife, however, did not file its appeal until February 12, 2008, when it challenged the decision on PDP No. 0724A. Therefore, we hold that Riverlife’s appeal was untimely. The Planning Commission’s distinct January 14, 2008 decision, which did not include the Planning Commission’s approval of the height of the Casino’s garage, cannot be used as a means of enlarging Pa.R.A.P 1512’s 30-day appeal period as to the Planning Commission’s August 7, 2007 decision.
