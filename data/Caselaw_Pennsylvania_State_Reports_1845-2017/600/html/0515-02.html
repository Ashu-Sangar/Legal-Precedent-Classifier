Therefore, the Superior Court in <em>Cardenas </em>did not “discover” a new theory in a complaint. Rather, on appeal, in accordance with the appellant’s claim on appeal and not merely <em>sua sponte, </em>the Superior Court held that the plaintiffs stated facts sufficient to support a claim that they <em>had identified </em>as being the basis of their complaint. The <em>Cardenas </em>case involved a determination of whether a claim was supported under Pennsylvania law, and whether the plaintiffs complaint contained the necessary facts to support that claim. The <em>Cardenas </em>case did not involve the Superior Court’s discovery of a previously unidentified claim within a complaint.</p>

Moreover, in the instant matter, the Superior Court did not evaluate whether the trial court properly interpreted the facts pleaded in support of the Clients’ claim for professional malpractice. To the contrary, the Superior Court in this case evaluated whether the Complaint contained an entirely different, previously unstated, theory of recovery. The Superior Court in <em>Cardenas </em>simply ruled that the appellants’ complaint contained a claim for intentional interference with an inheritance. Here, even the Clients’ Concise Statement never mentioned a breach of contract claim, thus requiring the Superior Court to divine this claim for itself.</p>

Moreover, as a matter of record, the <em>Lobolito </em>appellant simply did not preserve any issues related to equitable claims before this Court. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at *5, <em>Lobolito v.

Thus, it seems clear that the matter of other theories of relief was no more or no less waived in <em>Lobolito </em>than it is in this case, and that this Court’s examination of the complaint in <em>Lobolito </em>for equitable theories was, in fact, undertaken <em>sua sponte.</em>

However, despite its assertion of waiver challenging any discussion by others, the majority itself decides this issue. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 527, 968 A.2d at 1260 (applying Rules of Civil Procedure 1019 and 126, and concluding “[t]he Clients here simply did not plead facts sufficient to apprise the Attorneys that the Clients intended to allege a cause of action grounded in contract.”). Even aside from the implications of <em>Lobolito, </em>if the Court itself is going to address a legal issue, the parties and responding Justices should be free to do so as well. In other words, either this is a pure Rule 1925 waiver case, and the majority should confine itself to this rule’s application, or the proceedings should be open for all participants to address substantive questions which are also being decided by the Court.</p>
