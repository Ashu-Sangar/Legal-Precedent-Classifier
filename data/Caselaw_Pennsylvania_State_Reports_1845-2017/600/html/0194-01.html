(“BMA”) from 1996 until 2001. In October 1999, Appellee sustained a work-related injury. On October 28, 1999, she signed a medical authorization, permitting her employer’s worker’s compensation consultant to obtain medical records for the purpose of calculating the medical expenses occasioned by the work-related injury. In addition to releasing the record of treatment for Appellee’s injury, however, BMA disclosed her unrelated use of marijuana and pain medication without a prescription. As a result of this disclosure, Appellee’s employer terminated her employment on November 6, 1999. Appellee commenced an action against, <em>inter alia, </em>BMA on October 26, 2001, alleging that BMA breached physician-patient confidentiality by disclosing her illegal drug use.</p>

The trial court rejected this contention, reasoning that a breach of <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>physician-patient confidentiality is a recognized cause of action in its own right, which is governed by a two-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 5524(7).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The matter proceeded to trial, at which the jury awarded Appellee $60,052.37.</p>

In particular, the court observed that, without Appellee’s express or implied consent, BMA divulged confidential patient information obtained from Appellee, which would tend to damage Appellee’s character and was not related to the stated purpose of the medical authorization: to review medical expenses resulting from Appellee’s work-related injury.</p>

As for <em>Coulter, </em>the intermediate appellate court stated that, although the decision indicated that a claim based on breach of confidentiality was governed by the one-year statute of limitations, that language was “molded by the manner in which the controversy was brought before” the court. <em>See Burger, </em><a href="/a2d/928/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="928 A.2d 246" data-case-ids="8355845" data-case-paths="/a2d/928/0246-01">928 A.2d at 248</a>. More specifically, the court emphasized that the plaintiff in <em>Coulter </em>had not challenged the dismissal of her breach-of-confidentiality claims, and thus, the only claim remaining before the court was one involving invasion of privacy, to which the one-year statute of limitations facially applied. <em>See Burger, </em><a href="/a2d/928/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="928 A.2d 246" data-case-ids="8355845" data-case-paths="/a2d/928/0246-01">928 A.2d at </a>248 (citing <em>Coulter, </em><a href="/pa-super/452/0619-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="452 Pa.

Thus, the Superior Court held that, because a breach of physician-patient confidentiality gives rise to a cause of action that cannot be categorized as an invasion of privacy, it was governed, not by the one-year statute of limitations expressly provided for invasion-of-privacy claims, but by the two-year limitations period of Section 5524(7).</p>

      <blockquote id="b307-6" data-blocks='[["BL_307.7",307,[291,1990,1084,348]]]'>The Legislature left it to the courts to define when invasions of privacy should be actionable, but mandated that all such actions shall be subject to a one-year statute of limitations. The question of the validity of the restrictions on actions for invasions of privacy posited by the Superior Court are thus irrelevant here. That question raises policy issues that are not necessary to the resolution of this case and would be better addressed in cases in which they are raised directly. This case turns simply on the fact that the Legislature has clearly made any claim that may exi[st] subject to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5532(1).</blockquote>
