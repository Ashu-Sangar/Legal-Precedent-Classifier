Appendix B (hereinafter, the “Ordinance”) comprised a wholesale re-enactment of the oil and gas regulations found in the prior legislation. In addition to its substantive restrictions on oil and gas drilling activities, the Ordinance established a fee for permit applications and provided for criminal penalties upon failure to comply with its terms.

In particular, the court found that the Ordinance requires a permit for all drilling-related activities; regulates the location, design, and construction of access roads, gas transmission lines, water treatment facilities, and well heads; establishes a procedure for residents to file complaints regarding surface and ground water; allows the Township to declare drilling a public nuisance and to revoke or suspend a permit; establishes requirements for site access and restoration; and provides that any violation of the Ordinance is a summary offense that can trigger fines and/or imprisonment. The court then summarized some relevant aspects of the Act’s “comprehensive regulatory scheme -with regard to the development of oil and gas and coal,” including those pertaining to such things as casing requirements, protection of water supplies, safety devices, and the plugging of wells. <em>Great Lakes Energy Partners v.

In light of all of the above, the court found that the Ordinance “places conditions, requirements, or limitations on some of the same features of oil and gas well operations regulated by the Oil and Gas Act,” <em>id. </em>at 7, and indeed, is even more stringent than the <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>Act with regard to the manner in which many activities are regulated.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The court suggested that the Township was attempting, through the Ordinance, to impose requirements with regard to the location of activities necessarily incident to the development of wells, and that these types of restrictions fall within the purview of the Act and the oversight of the Department of Environmental Protection (the “Department”). <em>See id. </em>at 7-8.

While the township may have traditionally been able to pursue such purposes, once the state has acted pursuant to those purposes, the township is foreclosed from exercising that police power. I would add that the comprehensive nature of the statutory scheme regulating oil and gas well operations reflects a need for uniformity so that the purposes of the legislature can be accomplished.</blockquote>

In reaching this determination, we agreed with the Department’s position that the statutory term, “features of oil and gas well operations,” refers to the “technical aspects of well functioning and matters ancillary thereto (such as registration, bonding, and well site restoration), rather than the well’s location,” <em>Huntley, </em><a href="/pa/600/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="600 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="4193892" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0207-01">600 Pa. at 223</a>, 964 A.2d at 864, and that the traditional purposes of zoning are distinct from the purposes set forth in the Act, <em>see id. </em>at 224, 964 A.2d at 865. We clarified, however, that our holding should not be understood to suggest that any and all zoning regulation of oil and gas development would be allowable under Section 602 of the Act simply because the ordinance in question was enacted pursuant to the MPC. <em>See id. </em>at 226 n. 11, 964 A.2d at 866 n. 11 (“We do not, for instance, suggest that the municipality could permit drilling in a particular district but then make that permission subject to conditions addressed to features of well operations regulated by the Act.”).</p>

      <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>Presently, the Township forwards arguments that overlap to some degree with those of the municipality in the <em>Huntley </em>case. It maintains, for example, that local land-use regulations adopted pursuant to the MPC are only preempted to the degree they address the technical, operational aspects of oil and gas drilling, but that they are permissible otherwise so long as their provisions are consistent with ordinary zoning principles. To the extent these assertions subsume the “how-versus-where” distinction articulated in <em>Huntley, </em>they are plainly supported by that case’s reasoning. In advancing the validity of the Ordinance’s comprehensive regulatory scheme, however, the Township suggests that this Court adopt two additional prongs as part of the preemption analysis. Thus, the Township proffers that local regulation of a particular surface activity ancillary to oil and gas drilling should only be deemed preempted if the activity: (a) relates to the technical operations of the oil and gas industry, (b) flows directly from the operation an oil or gas well, and (c) is unique to the oil and gas industry. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 9, 31. Under this proposed standard, the Township maintains the Ordinance’s regulations pertaining to the submission of site plans, storm water management plans, erosion and sediment control plans, grading of access roads, road bonding requirements, and other related surface disturbance activities or surface elements (such as the placement and subsequent removal of water treatment facilities), are all permissible inasmuch as they comprise traditional local controls over land use.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The Township then offers its own such analysis and, as to each section of the Ordinance, concludes that all of its provisions are valid, <em>see id. </em>at 36-49. The Township’s amici add that the Act should be read in a manner consistent with constitutional guarantees relating to the preservation of natural resources, <em>see </em>Pa. Const, art.

They maintain that the arguments of the Township and its amici address only the latter test and ignore the former. This is relevant, they argue, because the Ordinance is directed exclusively at regulating oil and gas development in the municipality, thereby seeking to accomplish the purposes of the Act. They aver, in this regard, that general local regulations pertaining to the bonding of municipal roads and bridges and the use of municipal facilities by all industries might pass the Act’s test for preemption because these potential features of operations are not addressed in the Act; but, <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>they argue, an ordinance, such as the one under review, that specifically targets the oil and gas industry, incorporates by reference the provisions of the Act, and “overlap[s] the Act at nearly every turn,” is clearly preempted as it amounts to local legislation seeking to accomplish the purposes set forth in the Act. Brief for Appellees at 30-31; <em>see id. </em>at 12 (positing that the Ordinance “is, in effect, a ‘mini’ Oil and Gas Act applicable only within Salem’s boundaries”). As regards severance of specific portions of the ordinance, Appellees assert that the Township waived the issue as it did not raise this concern before the trial court in defending against Appellees’ motion for summary judgment, and that, in all events the remainder of the ordinance would be unintelligible after severance of the offending provisions.</p>

They assert that the statewide economic benefits of developing Pennsylvania’s vast oil and natural gas reserves can best be realized if producers are required to comply with a uniform regulatory scheme administered by the Department. In this respect, they emphasize their view that fashioning and maintaining such a uniform regulatory scheme without substantial interference from local non-expert governing bodies is a primary legislative objective underlying the Act. Thus, Appellees contend that any ruling by this Court which permits the Commonwealth’s thousands of local governmental units to establish their own substantive oil and gas regulations (as the Township has done) would undermine the Act and its broad policy goals by effectively removing the regulation of the oil and gas industry from the expert statewide regulators charged with its oversight. <em>Cf.

While the Department qualifies its advocacy by recommending — as in <em>Huntley </em>— an interpretation of the Act that leaves room for municipal regulations bearing only a tangential relationship to oil and gas drilling and extraction, it avers that the common pleas court and the Commonwealth Court reached the correct result in this case because “the purposes of the Ordinance are duplicative of the purposes of the Act,” Brief for Department as Amicus Curiae at 12, and are thus preempted.</p>

While the Township may be correct in arguing that there are some aspects of the Ordinance that are not expressly covered directly by the Act, even these are bound up with the overall regulatory scheme which includes strict permitting and penalty provisions, and phrased in such general terms — e.g., “the most direct and feasible means,” “shall not unreasonably restrict access,” etc. — as to provide the Township with virtually unbridled discretion to deny permission to drill.

The Act does not indicate that preemption is only accomplished if the regulated activity is unique to the oil and gas industry and flows directly from the operation of a well. Rather, it states more generally that no feature of oil and gas well operations may be subject to any further conditions, requirements, or limitations by MPC-enabled local legislation. <em>See </em>58 P.S. § 601.602. Here, the concept of a "feature of” oil and gas well operations is statutorily limited only by the qualifier, “regulated by this Act.” 58 P.S. § 601.602.

The Act and its associated administrative regulations specify that any well operator who affects a water supply through pollution or diminution of the amount of available water must restore or replace the affected supply with an alternate source of water. <em>See </em>58 P.S. § 601.208(a); 25 Pa.Code. § 78.52. Well operators may, however, conduct pre-drilling water testing to establish a defense to future charges of water pollution, <em>see <a href="/pa/595/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="938 A.2d 401" data-case-ids="3844138,8315036" data-case-paths="/pa/595/0340-01,/a2d/938/0401-01">id.,</a> </em>§ 601.208(d), or they may elect not to conduct such testing and risk future liability. Under the Ordinance, pre-operation water testing is mandatory relative to all water sources within 1,000 feet of a well site. <em>See </em>Ordinance Section II (relating to required approvals); RR. 537b. Because the Ordinance thus forbids an operator from foregoing pre-drilling water testing and risking liability, while the Act allows such a course of action, the Ordinance is in direct conflict with the Act. <em>See Huntley, </em><a href="/pa/600/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="600 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="4193892" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0207-01">600 Pa. at 220</a>, 964 A.2d at 862 (observing that "local legislation cannot permit what a state statute or regulation forbids or prohibit what state enactments allow").</p>

This also answers the Township’s argument predicated upon its obligations under other statutes such as the Storm Water Management Act. While such enactments may encourage local management of certain environmental problems, Appellants have not shown that they authorize implementation of administrative controls specifically targeted at the oil and gas industry. Thus, because the Oil and Gas Act is industry-specific, its express preemptive language remains unaffected by provisions in other statutes generally imposing duties upon localities that are not phrased with particular reference to oil and gas development. <em>Cf. </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1933 (where two statutes conflict, special provisions prevail over general ones).
