The audit determines the allowable costs of care under the program, and may either be accepted by the provider or appealed. This case concerns the cover letter and audit report DPW mailed to JRSS on March 31, 2004, informing the facility of its audit results for 2002.

Thereafter, a telephone hearing was conducted before the Bureau’s Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”), Sharon Fox Zanotto, to determine whether JRSS was entitled to a <em>nunc pro tune </em>appeal. At the hearing, JRSS presented testimony from its office manager, who said that although she was authorized to accept service, she never received the audit report. JRSS further submitted the affidavit of Robert Sobanski, then a reimbursement analyst with JRSS’s law firm, Capozzi &amp; Associates. Sobanski represented in the affidavit that, in September 2004, JRSS’s Chief Financial Officer, Michael Callan, requested him to prepare projections for the facility’s medical assistance rates. In the process of preparing these projections, Sobanski noticed the 2002 audit results were missing from the files, and called Callan to determine their whereabouts. According to Sobanski, Callan told him JRSS never received DPW’s audit report for 2002. Sobanski then contacted DPW and requested a copy of the report, which he later obtained on October 27, 2004. JRSS did not contest Sobanski’s receipt of the report, but argued he was not authorized to accept service of the report on the facility’s behalf.</p>

She indicated that in accordance with the department’s practice and custom, the 2002 audit report would have been mailed out on March 31, 2004. She did not recall DPW experiencing any problems at the time with mailing any of the reports, and noted the report in question was never returned as undelivered. DPW also presented the testimony of its Chief Rate Analyst, Ian Cohen, who testified that the audit report was properly mailed on March 31, 2004, and that it was the department’s standard practice to stamp the mailing date on the notices the same day they were mailed. Cohen further testified that he personally provided a copy of the report to Sobanski on October 27, 2004, at which time Sobanski represented he was acting on JRSS’s behalf.</p>

      <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>Finding Penaranda’s testimony credible, ALJ Zanotto determined DPW established a rebuttable presumption that JRSS received a copy of the March 31, 2004 notice, thus shifting the burden to JRSS to demonstrate that it did not receive the notice. ALJ Zanotto then noted that while JRSS offered testimony reflecting it did not receive the notice, testimony alone on this point was insufficient to rebut the presumption. As JRSS offered nothing more than testimony, the judge indicated she could not grant its motion to proceed <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>ALJ Zanotto further found that JRSS failed to act promptly after its agent (Sobanski) obtained a copy of the report on October 27, 2004. For these reasons, the judge concluded JRSS failed to demonstrate it was entitled to a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appeal, and recommended the appeal be dismissed.</p>

JRSS then filed a petition for reconsideration with the Secretary of DPW, who upheld the Bureau’s decision. JRSS appealed to the Commonwealth Court, arguing that while the notice of adjudication was stamped with the March 31, 2004 date, it was defective because it did not comply with DPW’s Standing Practice Order (“SPO”)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Rule 13 requiring the notice to include the date the notice was deposited in the mail. JRSS also argued Sobanski was not an agent authorized to accept personal service on its behalf, and so personal service was not effectuated on JRSS when Sobanski was provided a copy of the audit report. JRSS did not, however, contest the Bureau’s determination that JRSS itself received a copy of the report, or otherwise challenge the Bureau’s conclusion that the facility was not entitled to an appeal <em>nunc pro tunc.</em>

The majority observed that a simple date stamp on the notice, as in this case, without any specific indication that it is the mailing date, is not sufficiently informative. Lastly, the majority rejected DPW’s claim that personal service of the audit report on Sobanski on October 27, 2004 began the running of the appeal period, noting that Sobanski was not JRSS’s agent authorized to accept personal service.

We found that, under the applicable statute, the Department of Revenue had a duty to inform the taxpayer of the mailing date of the reassessment decision because, without such information, the taxpayer had no way of knowing how much time he had to file an appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 458.' We agreed with the taxpayer that the first notice was inadequate to trigger the appeal period, and found the appeal to be timely since the Department of Revenue’s failure to provide the requisite notice of the decision’s mailing date justified the taxpayer’s reliance on the date of the second notice of reassessment as the commencement of the period for appeal. <em>Id. </em>In reaching this decision, we rejected the contention that a postmark on an envelope carrying an agency decision could serve as the date of mailing.</p>

DPW notes that in contrast to 67 Pa.C.S.A. § 1102 and SPO Rule 19, which begin the appeal period on “the date of the notice of the departmental action,” the statute in <em>Schmidt </em>started the appeal period on “the date of mailing of notice.” Moreover, DPW argues its notice clearly apprised JRSS of the applicable appeal period, whereas the defective communication at issue in <em>Schmidt </em>was undated, and contained no information about the appeal period dates. DPW contends JRSS was not, unlike the taxpayer in <em>Schmidt, </em>prejudiced in any way by the failure of the notice to specifically designate the date stamped thereon as the mailing date.

It is manifest to us that this is the "date” on the "notice” of the "departmental action.” Had the legislature intended the appeal period to be triggered by, for example, the date of its mailing, it could have so specified in the statute, as it did with the statute at issue in <em>Schmidt. </em>Here, we conclude "the date of the notice of the departmental action” was March 31, 2004, the date stamped on the notice.</p>

Rather, I find the statute to be poorly framed, in that it does not closely define the appeal period in terms of effective notice, or specifically eschew the concept of effective notice. Since, however, meaningful notice is a basic requirement of due process in administrative proceedings, <em>see Pennsylvania Bankers Ass’n v.

In this regard, I have difficulty envisioning that the Legislature would have so little regard for personal rights and interests that it would provide that any and all potential laxness in administrative procedures in the giving of notice should inure to the detriment of persons and entities affected by agency action. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1) (reflecting the presumption in statutory interpretation that the General Assembly does not intend results that are absurd or unreasonable).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

Under the Department’s own practice, “notice” (i.e., notification) is different from a “written notice form” (since the Department is authorized to “give notice” through the act of mailing “a written notice”). Furthermore, the standing order reflects a recognition that the mere act of date-stamping a notice form does not furnish notice, but that notice is given by affirmative acts of conveyance (mailing, service, or publication).

At a very minimum, the tension between the Department’s own reasonable interpretation of the statute, as reflected in its standing practice order, and the majority’s construction militates strongly against the majority’s position that the statute unambiguously keys notice to a <em>pro forma </em>date stamp, regardless of the date of conveyance. Finally, the similarity between a notification-based reading of Section 1102(b)(1)(ii) and other conventional procedures for providing notice, <em>see, e.g., </em>Pa.R.A.P. 121(c), (e), seems too close to overlook.</p>

Nevertheless, consistent with the Commonwealth Court’s decision, I believe the law prevailing at the time of the agency’s notice was clear, and I cannot fault the intermediate appellate court for applying <em>Schmidt </em>in its decision in this case.
