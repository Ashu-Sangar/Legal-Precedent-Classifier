At the penalty hearing, the Commonwealth presented evidence in aggravation that Appellant had a significant history of violent felony convictions. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9). Such history included two prior murders, one of which occurred in New Jersey when Appellant was sixteen years of age.

The Commonwealth observes that the most significant documentary evidence of mental deficiency on Appellant’s part was substantially dated and points to this Court’s comment in Appellant’s direct appeal from his other sentence of death that: “We do not regard [evidence] which related only to the duration of childhood alcoholic blackouts suffered by appellant so many years previous, as having been evidence of mitigation relevant to the present offense.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Indeed, those records contain the following comment: “In the short interview the patient had with the examiner, it became quite clear that this young man would always come out as the loser in any court trial or any cross-examination, because of his inability to express his thoughts.” At a minimum, such commentary would suggest investigation into other avenues of presenting mitigating evidence.

Further, the PCRA court is to permit the development of the mental-health mitigation evidence (as well as appropriate cross-examination and rebuttal evidence by the Commonwealth), or to provide a persuasive substantive explanation for why the presentation of such evidence should be precluded. Finally, since there seems to be a fair likelihood that the mitigation-related ineffectiveness issue ultimately will turn on the prejudice criterion of the ineffectiveness inquiry and/or the miscarriage-of-justice standard, the PCRA court is to develop a specific comparison of the mitigation case offered at trial with the credited evidence offered on post-conviction review, with the object of elaborating on why it is, or is not, reasonably probable that at least one juror might have assigned weight to Appellant’s credited post-conviction evidence equal or greater than the substantial aggravation found by the sentencing jury. <em>Accord Gibson, </em>597 Pa. at 423-24, <a href="/pa/597/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="951 A.2d 1110" data-case-ids="3924204,8221590" data-case-paths="/pa/597/0402-01,/a2d/951/1110-01">951 A.2d at 1122-23</a> (implementing a similar remand).

This difference, however, would support a narrower approach to review by the federal courts than that which is available in the state courts, and not the converse. In terms of our own review, we recognize the potential for subsequent federal habeas proceedings serves as a different kind of safeguard. Our aim, however, is for the Pennsylvania courts to put their own "Constitutional houses” in order first, so that the deference accorded by the federal courts is justified. <em>Fielding v.

In Pennsylvania, much of the discussion of serial post-conviction review was motivated by instances in which boilerplate allegations of deficient stewardship were treated as "magic words” supporting the affordance of review. <em>See Alexander, </em><a href="/pa/495/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="144" data-cite="495 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1770711" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0026-01">495 Pa. at 33-34</a>, <a href="/pa/495/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="145" data-cite="495 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1770711" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0026-01">432 A.2d at 185</a>. It is worth noting, then, that the present case is not merely a “magic words” case. Here, the record demonstrates trial counsel presented only limited and, indeed, substantially harmful testimony from Appellant as the sole evidence in mitigation and failed to make any argument to the jury whatsoever to support a case for life over death. Since trial counsel continued to represent Appellant on direct appeal, the post-conviction setting represented his first opportunity to challenge counsel's stewardship. Nevertheless, initial post-conviction counsel is alleged to have violated a court directive to present support for the claim of deficient stewardship in the development of mitigation. <em>See supra </em>note 7. Appellant has now advanced the evidence he contends should have been presented by effective counsel, but the PCRA court refused to consider it on a developed record and to pass on its believability and force. Moreover, as discussed, the reasoning offered by the court to support its decision to deny relief is flawed and incomplete. In such circumstances, it is far from clear that the present petition represents an instance of abusive litigation, as was under discussion in <em>Alexander </em>and its progeny.</p>

Therefore, Appellant's treatment of the standard in connection with matters of issue preservation is not wholly inapt. As to the substance, <em>Lawson </em>used the term "miscarriage of justice” to signify a high degree of fundamental unfairness — as discussed above this is exactly what Appellant argues, throughout his briefs, occurred at his trial in terms of an alleged, severe abdication by trial counsel of his penalty-phase responsibilities. Although the dissent highlights that Appellant did not reference <em>Lawson </em>directly in his initial brief, it should be noted that he did furnish a citation to a decision applying <em>Lawson </em>in his discussion of the asserted miscarriage of justice. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 15 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

The single aggravating circumstance was appellant’s significant history of violent felony convictions, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9). Appellant’s criminal history was both grave and unique. Prior to the instant trial, appellant had been convicted of murder on two separate occasions, the latter of which involved the capital murder of a Philadelphia police officer while appellant was at large after the murder he <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>committed here. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The fact that I believe it is unlikely in the extreme that <em>Strickland </em>prejudice and a <em>Lawson </em>miscarriage of justice can be proven in this case respecting the penalty phase does not and cannot excuse the PCRA court of its responsibility to engage in a responsible, substantive evaluation of appellant’s claims respecting both the guilt and the penalty phases of trial.</p>

I believe that as a matter of law, Appellant has not made and could not make, under any circumstances, a strong <em>prima facie </em>showing that the denial of this serial PCRA petition resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Specifically, he cannot demonstrate that the proceedings which resulted in his being sentenced to death were so unfair that no civilized society could tolerate the outcome. Without such a showing, I believe that relief under the PCRA is not warranted. Therefore, I depart from both the analysis engaged in and the result reached by the Majority in awarding Appellant relief. Rather, I would affirm the order denying relief from the 1981 jury verdict that Appellant be sentenced to death for this murder, Appellant’s third.</p>

I believe our High Court’s determination that a federal petitioner sentenced to death is entitled to no relief from that sentence despite his claim of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to adduce additional mitigating evidence conclusively refutes any notion that such a claim may result in proceedings that are so unfair as to constitute a miscarriage of justice that no civilized society could tolerate.

Similarly, Appellant's belated citation to <em>Lawson </em>in his reply brief is unaccompanied by any developed argument concerning his burden.
