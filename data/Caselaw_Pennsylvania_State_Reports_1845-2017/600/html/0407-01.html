The Board twice requested extensions of time to make a decision; § 508 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, <em>as amended, </em>53 P.S. § 10508, provides a municipality must take action on an application within 90 days of the next meeting of its governing body or planning agency, or such application will be “deemed an approval.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant agreed to both extensions; the new deadline for this plan was December 24, 2003.</p>

On the one hand, the Legislature’s intent via Section 508 to secure streamlined resolution of land development applications seems reasonably clear, suggesting that the burden should be allocated to the local government. On the other hand, the public maintains a strong interest in merits-based decisions assuring orderly land use decisions in implementing legislatively prescribed controls on land development, <em>see Wistuk v.

I realize that the majority opinion does not treat Appellant’s conditional use application as in the nature of a land development plan and, for the same reason, does not consider such application as a revision to the original subdivision plan. <em>See, e.g., </em>Majority Opinion at 412, 966 A.2d at 1112 ("Appellant's conditional use application was not intended to revise the land use application as it dealt with zoning issues as opposed to the original subdivision application, which addressed land use.”). Under the Upper Merion Township Code, however, a conditional use application framed under the cluster development overlay is addressed to the governing body and serves a dual function as a subdivision application. <em>See </em>Upper Merion Township Code § 165-73 (explaining that "such applications shall be simultaneously considered as a subdivision and/or land development application”). Thus, the subsequent proposal shared greater fundamental similarities with the original subdivision plan than the majority opinion implies.</p>

We would not be free to consider such an inquiry, absent a constitutional violation, but for the fact that Section 508 is silent as to the effect of serial applications upon the 90-day approval period. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b) ("When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.”). Under Section 508, a key event in calculating the ninety-day period is the filing of "the application,” 53 P.S. § 10508, and I believe that the filing of serial applications may render the statute ambiguous in terms of which filing or filings represents “the application” pending for consideration before the governing body. In this regard, I would conclude that the Legislature could not have intended to impose upon municipalities the obligation of having to consider numerous, inconsistent land development applications and render a decision on each individual application within 90 days of filing. <em>See generally </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1) (setting forth the presumption that the Legislature "does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable”).</p>
