        "text": "OPINION\nChief Justice CASTILLE.\nThe order of the Superior Court is affirmed for the reasons ably set forth in the Superior Court opinion, which opinion is adopted as the opinion of this Court on the \u201chot\u201d and \u201cfresh pursuit\u201d question. See Commonwealth v. Peters, 915 A.2d 1213 (Pa.Super.2007). We supplement the opinion as follows.\nThis Court granted review to determine whether the extraterritorial arrest of appellant was authorized under the Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act (\u201cMPJA\u201d), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8951-8954, specifically, the MPJA\u2019s \u201chot pursuit\u201d exception, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8953(a)(2). Section 8953 of the MPJA governs statewide municipal police jurisdiction and provides in pertinent part:\n(a) General rule. \u2014 Any duly employed municipal police officer who is within this Commonwealth, but beyond the territorial limits of his primary jurisdiction, shall have the power and authority to enforce the laws of this Commonwealth or otherwise perform the functions of that office as if enforcing those laws or performing those functions within the territorial limits of his primary jurisdiction in the following cases:\n(2) Where the officer is in hot pursuit of any person for any offense which was committed, or which he has probable cause to believe was committed, within his primary jurisdiction and for which offense the officer continues in fresh pursuit of the person after the commission of the offense.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8953(a)(2). Wfiiile this Court has examined extraterritorial authority within the confines of the MPJA and outside its reach, we have not directly considered the subsection (a)(2) \u201chot pursuit\u201d/\u201cfresh pursuit\u201d language of Section 8953.\nOn October 8, 2003, at approximately 10:15 p.m., appellant hit a telephone pole in the Borough of Sugarcreek, causing damage to, inter alia, the telephone pole, a mailbox and a street sign. Appellant fled before the police arrived and abandoned his truck one-half mile from the accident scene in the city of Franklin. Both the Sugarcreek and Franklin police immediately reported to the accident scene, and subsequently, the two police agencies investigated the incident together. During the on-going investigation, Franklin police located appellant\u2019s truck in Franklin and alerted Sugarcreek police, who arrived at the truck\u2019s location between 10:45 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. Following appellant\u2019s phone call to Franklin police identifying himself as the person who hit the telephone pole, Franklin police contacted Sugarcreek police to inform them of the location of appellant\u2019s residence in Franklin. At approximately 11:15 p.m., Sugarcreek police, with Franklin police present, questioned appellant, performed a breathalyzer test (which appellant failed), and eventually arrested him. A blood-alcohol content (\u201cBAC\u201d) test came back with a result of .09 percent.\nAppellant filed a motion to suppress the evidence on the grounds that, inter alia, Sugarcreek police arrested him outside their jurisdiction without legal authority. The motion was denied. After a jury trial, appellant was found guilty of violating 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3731(a)(1) (Driving Under Influence of Alcohol or Controlled Substance (\u201cDUI\u201d)), 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4525(a) (Tire Equipment and Traction Surfaces) and 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3361 (Driving Vehicle at Safe Speed). As this was his second DUI conviction, appellant was sentenced to a prison term of no less than sixty days and no more than twenty-four months, minus one day.\nOn appeal to the Superior Court, appellant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because, inter alia, his arrest was in violation of Section 8953(a)(2) of the MPJA. The Superior Court affirmed in a published opinion, Commonwealth v. Peters, 915 A.2d 1213 (Pa.Super.2007). The panel found that the arrest did not violate the MPJA because Sugarcreek police were in hot and fresh pursuit of appellant. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8953(a)(2). Relying upon Commonwealth v. McPeak, 708 A.2d 1263 (Pa.Super.1998), the panel reasoned that \u201c \u2018hot pursuit\u2019 requires some sort of chase, but does not require a \u2018fender-smashing Hollywood-style chase scene\u2019 nor \u2018police observation of the criminal activity.\u2019 [McPeak, 708 A.2d at 1266.] Furthermore, pursuit of a suspect may constitute a chase when it is \u2018based on witness information as to the location of the suspect.\u2019 Id. And \u2018fresh pursuit\u2019 requires that it be immediate, continuous and uninterrupted. See id.\u201d Peters, 915 A.2d at 1219. The panel found Sugarcreek police were in hot and fresh pursuit of appellant when he arrived at his house in Franklin because:\nafter [Sugarcreek police] received the radio call reporting the accident, [they] immediately began pursuing [appellant, first arriving at the accident scene and then tracking him to the abandoned vehicle, and ultimately to [appellant's house. The information that guided [Sugarcreek police] as [they] chased [appellant from one scene to the next was of course provided first by witnesses, then the Franklin police, and lastly by [appellant himself. Nonetheless within an approximately one hour period, [Sugarcreek police] continuously pursued [ajppellant without interruption, and at each step of the pursuit [they] got closer to catching him.\nId. at 1219-20.\nWhile Section 8953(a)(2) requires both \u201chot pursuit\u201d and \u201cfresh pursuit\u201d to fulfill the exception to the MPJA, the statute does not include definitions for either form of pursuit. However, the Superior Court has defined \u201chot pursuit\u201d and \u201cfresh pursuit\u201d under Section 8953 and has consistently applied its interpretation of each. Here, the panel ably set forth what is necessary to comply with Section 8953(a)(2). We agree that \u201chot pursuit\u201d and \u201cfresh pursuit\u201d require some sort of investigation and tracking of the perpetrator and that that pursuit be immediate, continuous and uninterrupted. The facts here support the panel\u2019s application of these standards to the instant case and thus confirm its sound findings and conclusion.\nThe arrest of appellant by Sugarcreek police was authorized under Section 8953 because they were in hot and fresh pursuit of appellant. Sugarcreek police engaged in an immediate and systematic pursuit of the person who left the scene of the accident. Further, Sugarcreek police pursued appellant continuously and without interruption for approximately one hour. It is clear that the hot and fresh pursuit exception to the MPJA was met.\nFinally, we note that the MPJA is to be construed liberally to give effect to its purposes. Commonwealth v. Lehman, 582 Pa. 200, 870 A.2d 818, 820 (2005). One of the intended purposes of the MPJA is to \u201cpromote public safety while maintaining police accountability to local authority; it is not intended to erect \u2018impenetrable jurisdictional walls benefit[ing] only criminals hidden in their shadows.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Commonwealth v. Merchant, 528 Pa. 161, 595 A.2d 1135, 1139 (1991)). Although the initial accident occurred on Meadville Pike in Sugarcreek, Meadville Pike is a street where one side is patrolled by Sugarcreek and the other side is patrolled by Franklin. Sugarcreek and Franklin police worked in conjunction with one another during the entire pursuit. Franklin police notified Sugarcreek police: (1) of the location of appellant\u2019s truck in Franklin (notably only one-half mile (approximately three blocks)); (2) that appellant had contacted Franklin police; and (3) where appellant could be found for questioning. Further, both police agencies: (1) were present at the accident scene immediately after it had occurred; (2) participated in the search for appellant\u2019s truck; (3) were present during the examination of appellant\u2019s truck; and (4) were present during the questioning of appellant.\nAccordingly, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed and its opinion, as herein supplemented, is adopted as that of this Court on the hot and fresh pursuit question.\nJustices SAYLOR and BAER, TODD, McCAFFERY and GREENSPAN join the opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a concurring opinion.\n. Section 8953 replaced the Intra-State Hot Pursuit statute, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8901 (repealed 1982), which provided:\nAny police officer of any political subdivision may arrest with or without warrant any person beyond the territorial limits of such political subdivision for a summary or other offense committed by such person within such political subdivision if the officer continues in pursuit of such person after commission of the offense. The police officer shall exercise under this section only the power of arrest which he would have if he were acting within the territorial limits of his political subdivision.\n. See, e.g., Martin v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 588 Pa. 429, 905 A.2d 438 (2006) (extraterritorial conduct not authorized as hot pursuit under Section 8953(a) without probable cause or under Section 8953(a)(5) if not on \"official business\"); Commonwealth v. Lehman, 582 Pa. 200, 870 A.2d 818 (2005) (Section 8953(a)(5) authorizes extra-jurisdictional detention where on-duty officer develops probable cause in primaty jurisdiction and limits out-of-jurisdiction activities to maintaining status quo until officers from appropriate jurisdiction arrive); Commonwealth v. McCandless, 538 Pa. 286, 648 A.2d 309 (1994) (because officer lacked probable cause to believe an offense had been committed within his primary jurisdiction, Section 8953(a)(2) not applicable); Commonwealth v. Pratti, 530 Pa. 256, 608 A.2d 488 (1992) (under Section 8953(a)(5) (\"official business\u201d exception), officer on routine patrol permitted to stop vehicle outside jurisdiction on suspicion of DUI); Commonwealth v. Merchant, 528 Pa. 161, 595 A.2d 1135 (1991) (subsections of Section 8953(a) provide separate, and independent justifications for permitting police action outside of primary jurisdiction) (officer permitted to stop and detain suspect under Section 8953(a)(5) because officer on routine patrol, i.e., on official business); Commonwealth v. O'Shea, 523 Pa. 384, 567 A.2d 1023 (1989) (six subsections of Section 8953(a) are not \u201call-encompassing of any activity that an officer may conduct outside of his primary jurisdiction, no matter how informal or unobtrusive\u201d).\n. See, e.g., McKinley v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 576 Pa. 85, 838 A.2d 700 (2003) (in absence of express, legislative grant of extraterritorial authority limited jurisdiction police personnel lack ability to act as police officers in implementation of Implied Consent Law, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1547, outside territorial boundaries); Commonwealth v. Firman, 571 Pa. 610, 813 A.2d 643 (2002) (under Railway and Street Railway Police Act, 22 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3305, extraterritorial jurisdiction enabled only when there is sufficient connection to transportation system business and once enabled, absent sufficient break, its exercise may continue through investigatory stop and/or arrest).\n. Section 3731 was repealed, effective January 31, 2004, and replaced with 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3802.\n. The panel\u2019s affirmance sub judice is consistent with its previous interpretations of Section 8953(a)(2). See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Laird, 797 A.2d 995 (Pa.Super.2002) (officer\u2019s \"tempered\u201d chase of appellant in order to avoid hazardous traffic stop and eventual traffic stop lawful as hot pursuit under Section 8953(a)(2)).\n. In Commonwealth v. Magwood, 503 Pa. 169, 469 A.2d 115 (1983), while interpreting Section 8953\u2019s predecessor, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8901 (repealed 1982), this Court defined the word \"pursuit\u201d as including \"both classic 'hot pursuit\u2019 and \u2018fresh\u2019 or 'continuous' pursuit.\u201d Magwood, 469 A.2d at 119. As noted above, the current statute employs both the terms \"hot pursuit\u201d and \u201cfresh pursuit.\u201d\n. In concurrence, Mr. Justice Eakin asserts that \"[t]he police did nothing wrong here[,]\u201d and as such, he \"would find [that] the facts support the propriety of the arrest and affirm the conviction.\u201d Concurring Op. at 276, 965 A.2d at 226. However, the concurrence does not explain how the Sugarcreek police conduct here can be deemed lawful if the arrest was not sanctioned under an exception to the MPJA, as the Sugarcreek police effectuated an arrest \"beyond the territorial limits of [their] primary jurisdiction.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8953(a).\n. Given our disposition, we do not reach or adopt the panel\u2019s alternative holding regarding the application of the exclusionary rule.",

        "text": "Justice EAKIN,\nconcurring.\nAlthough I do not disagree with the majority\u2019s result in this case, I disagree with its adoption of the Superior Court\u2019s analysis of the \u201chot pursuit\u201d/\u201cfresh pursuit\u201d provisions of the Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act (MPJA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8953(a)(2), pursuant to these facts.\nThe officer here responded to a report of a vehicle hitting a telephone pole \u2014 the Superior Court held this response constituted an immediate onset of pursuit, see Commonwealth v. Peters, 915 A.2d 1213, 1219 (Pa.Super.2007); the majority-agreed. Majority Op., at 271-74, 965 A.2d at 224-25. Such a notion could only be possible if \u201cpursuit\u201d means pursuing the investigation, not the culprit. According to the Superior Court\u2019s holding, the commencement of any investigation would become a pursuit, as its object is the eventual capture of the perpetrator \u2014 this is not what is contemplated by the concept of hot or fresh pursuit, statutory or otherwise. The court further stated the officer \u201cchased\u201d appellant \u201cfrom one scene to the next.\u201d See Peters, at 1219-20. Clearly, there was no chasing done here \u2014 chasing connotes persons in motion, one after the other, whether in sight of one another or not. Police searched for appellant, but did not chase him anywhere. Here, appellant called the police, and other officers already arrived. The arresting officer simply drove to appellant\u2019s home; he did not \u201cchase\u201d appellant anywhere. It is also questionable whether the officer pursued appellant \u201ccontinuously\u201d and \u201cwithout interruption\u201d; since the theory is the \u201cchase\u201d started with the radio call, it must be that the half-hour on-scene investigation was not an interruption of the \u201cchase.\u201d\nThe police did nothing wrong here, but there was no hot, uninterrupted pursuit that began the moment of the report of an accident. Therefore, while I would find the facts support the propriety of the arrest and affirm the conviction, I would not do so on the basis of the Superior Court\u2019s reasoning.",
