The issues for consideration, as rephrased for clarity are:\n1) Under 77 P.S. \u00a7 772, what burden of proof must a claimant who leaves a modified duty position to accept other employment, which involuntarily ends due to no fault of the claimant, meet in order to obtain reinstatement of his or her worker\u2019s compensation benefits, if the claimant remains disabled by his original work related injury?\n2) The parties are also to address in their briefs the question of how 77 P.S. \u00a7 772 allocates the burden of proof as between the claimant and the employer in reinstatement proceedings.
