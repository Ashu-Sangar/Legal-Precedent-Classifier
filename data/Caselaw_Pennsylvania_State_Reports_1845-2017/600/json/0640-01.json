The issues, which we have rephrased for clarity, are:\n(1) Whether the personal property exception to state sovereign immunity, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8522(b)(3), applies only if the property in question causes the plaintiffs injuries, or does it suffice that plaintiffs injuries are caused by the Commonwealth\u2019s care, custody, or control of the property?\n(2) Whether genuine issues of material fact exist which would preclude the entry of summary judgment?\n(3) Whether the State Police breached an implied contract for bailment of evidence which was Petitioners\u2019 personal property, thus subjecting the State Police to liability if the evidence was subsequently negligently destroyed?\n(4) Whether Pennsylvania recognizes, and if so whether Petitioners have alleged, a cause of action for negligent spoliation of evidence?",
