      <em>Carpenter’s Est. </em>and <em>Tarlo’s Est. </em>presented situations entirely different from the one now confronting us. In <em>Carpenter’s Est., </em>a son killed his father and was convicted of first degree murder. Under the law as it then was, we felt bound to decide that, as the intestate.law cast the inheritance on the son, without any exception, it was impossible for the courts to designate any differ<a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>ent persons to take the estate, without violating the law. In <em>Tarlo’s Est., </em>we held there could be inheritance through the murderer, who committed suicide immediately following the killing, because he had not been “finally adjudged guilty,” and the Intestate Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 129, Sec. 23, 20 PS Sec. 136, forbade inheritance only where the murderer had been “finally adjudged guilty.”</p>
