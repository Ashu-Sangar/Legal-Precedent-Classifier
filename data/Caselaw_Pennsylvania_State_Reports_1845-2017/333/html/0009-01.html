Superior Ct. 378</a>, a receivership was sustained, subject, of course, to the transfer of the property for administration in bankruptcy when such proceedings followed. Congress recognized the right of a state court to appoint a receiver by providing in the Bankruptcy Act as amended June 22,1938, c. 575, section 1, 11 USCA section 11(a), that “The courts of the United States . . . are hereby invested . . . with such jurisdiction at law and in equity as will enable them to . . . (21) Require receivers or trustees appointed in proceedings not under this title, assignees for the benefit of creditors, and agents authorized to take possession of or to liquidate a person’s property to deliver the property in their possession or under their control to the receiver or trustee appointed under <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>this title . . . and in all such cases to account to the court, . . . <em>Provided, however, </em>That such delivery and accounting shall not be required, except in proceedings under chapters 10 and 12 of this title, if the receiver or trustee was appointed, the assignment was made, or the agent was authorized more than four months prior to the date of bankruptcy ...” In construing a state insolvency law regulating assignments for the benefit of creditors, the court, in <em>Pobreslo v.

Star, </em><a href="/us/287/0527-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="287 U.S. 527" data-case-ids="370021" data-case-paths="/us/287/0527-01">287 U. S. 527</a>. If for the Supreme Court’s words “proceedings under any such assignment,” we substitute “proceedings under the state court receivership” it would seem equally apparent that Congress intended such receivership proceedings, “unless so put aside, should be regarded as not inconsistent with the purposes of the federal Act.”</p>

In that field the state insolvency act is in force and regulates the administration of insolvent estates until and unless the bankruptcy court on appropriate application takes over the administration of the estate. The farmer, for example, was exempted from involuntary proceedings ; in any case, petitioning creditors must show that they are owed the jurisdictional minimum; the assignment for the benefit of creditors has been recognized as valid ever since the Act was passed in 1898 though, under the conditions specified in the Act, such assignment might furnish the ground for involuntary proceed<a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>ings in bankruptcy displacing further administration under the state law; when the amendment of 1938 (supra) dealt with “receivers or trustees appointed in proceedings not under this title,” etc., the power of the state court to appoint receivers was likewise recognized, subject, as in the case of assignments, to subsequent action under the federal law. We can of course not know at this time what defendant may answer to the petition or what the trial may develop. All we now decide is that so far as now appears the court has jurisdiction of the cause of action.</p>
