As the patrolman was opening the truck door, defendant pulled another gun (together with a handkerchief) out of the left-hand pocket of his overcoat and fatally shot the officer through the chest and spine. Defendant contended that the shooting was accidental. Another eyewitness to the shooting testified that the “colored man pulled out a gun from his overcoat pocket, from the left side, and he changed it over to the right hand, and when the officer was facing the driver and opening the door the man turned around like this and shot the officer in the chest.”</p>

      <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>Appellant complains of many alleged trial errors and emphasis is laid on that part of the court’s charge reading as follows: “No accidental killing can possibly follow the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate a robbery, or the acts connected with it.” This statement is too broad. The Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 382, sec. 74, as amended by the Act of May 22, 1923, P. L. 306, provides that “all murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, oi* by lying in wait or by any other kind of wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration of or attempting to perpetrate any arson, rape, robbery, burglary or kidnapping, shall be deemed murder of the first degree,” A killing of a human being in order to be murder must be done maliciously. “Malice aforethought is an element of murder in either degree and distinguishes it from manslaughter”: <em>Com. v. Gibson, </em><a href="/pa/275/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="275 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="1075649" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0338-01">275 Pa. 338</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20A.%20403" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="119 A. 403">119 A. 403</a>. There is some divergence of opinion in other jurisdictions as to what acts of a person engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of any of the above felonies will make the felon guilty of murder when the death of another results from such acts. Pollock, C. B., in <em>Regina v. Lee, </em>4 F. &amp; F. 63, 176 Eng. Reports 468, makes this statement: “There is an ancient principle of law that if a man in the committal of a felony uses violence to the person, which causes death, even although he did not intend it; he is guilty of murder.” In Wharton’s Criminal Law (12th ed.), Vol. 1, page 747, sec. 511, appears the following: “It has sometimes been said that a homicide in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson, rape, robbery, or burglary, is, under the Pennsylvania and cognate statutes, murder in the first degree. But it must be remembered that the statutes under criticism do not say that ‘homicide,’ when so committed, ... at common law can be murder either in the first or second degree; and we have first to inquire, in determining the grade of any particular homi<a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>cide under the statutes, whether it is murder at common law.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

L., p. 845, sec. 148, it is declared: “It may be stated generally that a homicide is committed in the perpetration of another crime, when the accused, intending to commit some crime other than the homicide, is engaged in the performance of any one of the acts which such intent requires for its full execution, and, while so engaged, and within the res gestae of the intended crime, and in consequence thereof, the killing results. It must appear that there was such actual legal <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>relation between the killing .and the crime committed or attempted, that the killing can be said to have occurred as a part of the perpetration of the crime, or in furtherance of an attempt or purpose to commit it. In the usual terse legal phraseology, death must have been the probable consequence of the unlawful act.” Wharton’s Homicide (3d ed.), page 184, sec. 126, declares: “To render a killing without malice murder in the first degree under statutes making it murder in the first degree to kill in the perpetration of a felony, or of specified felonies, it must have been done in pursuance of the unlawful act, and not collateral to it. The killing must have had an intimate relation and close connection with the felony, and not be separate, distinct, and independent from it; and when the act constituting the felony is in itself dangerous to life, the killing must be naturally consequent to the felony,” (citing <em>Rex v. Plummer, </em>J. Kelyng 109, 12 Mod. 627).</p>

In <em>Com. v.

This court held that the murder had its inception in the attempt to perpetrate a robbery, that “no intervening act broke the series of events” from the attempted robbery to the homicide and that the conviction of the defendant of murder <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>of the first degree was therefore warranted.
