May 31, 1938, plaintiff demurred to the return. While this case was pending, another proceeding<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> for the removal of the School Directors of Branch Township was in process in the court below; it ended in their removal from office <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>¡by decree affirmed, as will appear, in tlie opinion of this court reported in <a href="/pa/330/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="330 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="1182985" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0529-01">330 Pa. 529</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=199%20A.%20194" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="199 A. 194">199 A. 194</a>.</p>
