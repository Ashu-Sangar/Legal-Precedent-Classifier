Section 1 provides: “That a tax shall be, and is hereby, imposed upon the transfer of any property, real or personal, or of any interest therein or income therefrom, in trust or otherwise, to persons or corporations in the following cases: . . . (c) When the transfer is ... of goods, wares, and merchandise within this Commonwealth, . . . made by a nonresident, by deed, grant, bargain, sale, or gift, made in contemplation of the death of the grantor, vendor, or donor, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after such death.”</p>

Johnson, describing himself in the deed as “of the City of Cardenas, Republic of Cuba, formerly of Wayne, Pennsylvania. ...” The deed provided for the payment of income to the settlor for life and, on his death, for the transfer and payment of principal and undistributed income to his three daughters, two of them residing, in Wayne, Pennsylvania, and the third in Massachusetts. The trust has been administered in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. The account shows that the deed of trust was prepared by The Wayne Title &amp; Trust Company. The property assigned fpr the purposes of the trust was a certain bond and mortgage on real estate located in Wayne. The account also shows that the Trustee not only prepared the deed of trust but also prepared the assignment of the mortgage to itself as trustee and made a charge for doing so and for recording the assignment. If foreclosure were required it would take place in Delaware County. The seat of the trust was therefore in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, a conclusion required by the circumstances, particularly by the facts that the settlor selected the trustee whose principal place of business was there, that the obligation and the property securing its payment were there and that resort to the local law was required to perfect the assignment of the mortgage, and, if necessary, its foreclosure.

And such is its effect by the canon law as well as the common law, which seems to have adopted the former ; 1 Atk. 180, 182; 3 <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.%2061" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="2 W. 61">Id. 62</a>; <em>Moore v.
