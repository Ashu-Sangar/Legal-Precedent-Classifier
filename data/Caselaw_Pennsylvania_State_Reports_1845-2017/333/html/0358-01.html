The oldest minor, William H. Seamans, whose estate is the subject of the present litigation, came of age on April 22, 1936. On November 12, 1936, after a citation had issued, an account was filed by Seranton-Lackawanna Trust Company as agent for the guardian, but it was subsequently withdrawn and the guardian himself filed an account on July 16, 1937, to which exceptions were filed by the ward. Most of these were directed to improper retention of the stocks, which had greatly depreciated in value. The court below decreed a surcharge of $45,-Í.72.47.

In Restatement of Trusts, section 230, the rule is thus stated: “Except as otherwise provided by the terms of the trust, the trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary within a reasonable time after the creation of the trust to dispose of any part of the trust property included in the trust at the time of its creation which would not be a proper investment for the trustee to make.”</p>

The law imposes limitations upon “ordinary prudence” in such cases in order to preserve the differentiation between nonlegal and legal securities, and between fiduciaries and others as to the right to speculate. The mere fact that a trustee may honestly believe that an unauthorized security will appreciate in value at some more or less remote period is not sufficient justification for his retention of it in the trust estate, and “common prudence” or “normally good judgment” must not be deemed to confer such latitude of discretion. It is within the power of a testator or settlor to provide that the trust <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>estate established by him may retain nonlegal securities, and his failure to make such a provision leads naturally to the conclusion that it was his desire that the law should take its course and the estate be invested in securities authorized for the investment of trust funds; this is especially true where the trust is to continue over an extended period óf time.</p>

Under certain circumstances a fiduciary is excused from the prompt sale of nonlegal securities which is otherwise required. Such circumstances cannot be completely catalogued; they must be considered in each case as they arise. Among them may be mentioned instances where the market is so restricted that it is reasonably impossible to sell the security; or where the offering of a large block of stock at one time would drastically break the market price; or where a security is abnormally depressed in value because of a general economic and financial collapse, so that a sale can be effected only at a sacrifice, but there is a reasonable likelihood of an early return to stable conditions which will restore the normal value. A fiduciary is not compelled to jettison seasoned investments during a temporary panic. Other exceptions to the general rule are where the will or other instrument creating the trust grants powers broad enough to justify the retention . of the securities, or where the beneficiaries of the trust themselves request or agree to such retention.</blockquote>

He sought no legal advice until after he was cited to file an account, and he seems to have had somewhat hazy ideas as to his duties. ■ In August, 1931, he turned over the possession of the securities to Scranton-Lackawanna Trust Company, under an agreement by which that company was to collect the interest and dividends but make sales and reinvestments only as appellant should approve.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The agreement provided that the company was periodically to review and examine the securities and malte recommendations to appellant, and apparently the latter felt that he was thereby relieved of the duty of keeping a watchful eye on the situation and determining for himself if and when the nonlegal securities should be sold. It is true he testified that from time to time he consulted with officers of the company, spoke to bond salesmen, and kept in touch with market prices, but a reading of the record does not give the impression that he was seriously concerned with the responsibilities which his office as guardian imposed. The reasons which he advanced at the hearing why he never sold the nonlegal investments are far from convincing. This much, however, can be said for appellant, — that when he obtained possession of the stocks in September, 1930, thé country, as we all know, was in the throes of an unprecedented, catastrophic depression which had continued with increasing intensity since October, 1929. Securities were constantly falling in market value, and- there prevailed a confusion in the financial world which laymen and experts alike were unable either to diagnose or to remedy. Moreover, the psychology of the period must be taken into consideration. There existed a general impression that normality would soon be restored and that pros<a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>perity was “just around the comer.” Even the most prudent men, not foreseeing that still worse times were ahead, optimistically retained their failing investments. Under such circumstances appellant is not to he censured for failure to comply with the rule ordinarily requiring prompt conversion, and we are of the opinion that the court below erred in surcharging him, as.it did, with the value of the nonlegal securities as of the very day, September 2, 1930, when they came into his possession. Such a surcharge is unreasonable. On the other hand, we find no adequate excuse for appellant’s retention of the stocks ever since 1930. The dividends on practically all of them were constantly being diminished, and during 1931 and 1932 ceased altogether. Market prices slumped more and more. Certainly by the end of a year after he received the stock, — two years in all after the depression started, — appellant should have realized that the probable duration of the depression could not be foretold, but that it certainly was not merely a temporary condition and that any conclusion as to whether stocks would recover or sink to still lower levels could be based only on guesswork. Under such circumstances a person might handle his <em>own </em>securities as he thought best, but the purpose of the law is to prevent a <em>fiduciary </em>in such a situation from speculating. The safe, proper, and only recourse for appellant was thereupon to convert the estate into authorized investments. We hold, therefore, that, while a surcharge was warranted, it should have been based upon the value of the stocks as of September 2,1931, instead of September 2, 1930. This grants him all the time for conversion to which even the unusual conditions then prevailing entitled him.</p>

The same observation applies to the stock of Third National Bank and Trust Company of Scranton. The estate had larger, holdings in Dime Bank-Lincoln Trust Company, but there existed a sufficiently active market in this stock to have enabled appellant to dispose of it before September, 1931. These stocks, therefore, should all be charged to appellant at their September 2, 1931, values. On the other hand, the evidence established that there was no available market for Union National Bank of Scranton stock and this surcharge cannot be sustained; it follows also that appellant was entitled to the credit, allowed by the court below, of $650 which was levied as an assessment on the Union National Bank stock.</p>

    <p id="b400-7" data-blocks='[["BL_400.8",400,[304,953,1151,970]]]'>I would make no surcharge. We are here dealing with a situation which might well confound any man. The guardian received the securities when the financial walls were falling. He did not make the investments himself. He did what, it seems to me, was the most prudent thing he could do, sought the aid and advice of one of the principal financial institutions of the community in which he lived to help him solve the problem with which he was confronted, whether to sell the securities at what seemed terrible sacrifices or to hold them. This I think was not speculating; it was in the exercise of judgment. Many of the securities were of local institutions. Experience shows that in the smaller towns these cannot be sold for anything like their intrinsic value. Other of the securities were of the country’s standard railroads and industrial concerns. No prudent person, unless compelled to do so, would have sold these securities at the distress figures of 1931.</p>
    <p id="b400-8" data-blocks='[["BL_400.9",400,[304,1936,1149,306]]]'>I think the case should be viewed, not retrospectively, but from the position in which the guardian found himself in the upset financial world, and, so viewed, I cannot say he did not exercise “normally good judgment” and common skill, common prudence and common caution.</p>
