L. 507, and its supplements, on a judgment recovered by the Estate of Mary J. Frederick against the city, growing out of the condemnation of her land for public purposes. The Orphans’ Court decided that the tax was not collectible, for reasons not similar to those we shall assign, and the Superior Court, on appeal to it (<a href="/pa-super/130/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="130 Pa.

General expressions used in a statute are restricted to things and persons similar to those specifically enumerated in the language preceding the general expressions: <em>Derk v. Zerbe Twp., </em><a href="/pa/322/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="322 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="1167897" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0350-01">322 Pa. 350</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20647" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="185 A. 647">185 A. 647</a>.

They are preceded by language specifically enumerating the various items of personal property made taxable, and must be read in connection with those specific expressions. When this is done, it is clear that the words “evidences of indebtedness,” refer only to obligations voluntarily incurred, such as on a bond or certificate of indebtedness, and that the Avord “judgment” refers to judgments entered on such an obligation, such as on a bond or a promissory note.</p>

Although legislation of this kind has been on the statute books for almost a century, so far as we have knowledge, it has never heretofore been supposed that it warranted, the taxation of tort judgments or judgments of the kind here entered.</p>
