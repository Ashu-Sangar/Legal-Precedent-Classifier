Some parts of the charge assigned as error are unobjectionable; others become objectionable only when separated from the context and evident meaning of the whole charge. The question of whether or not appellee had proved her defense was properly left to the jury, and the court below correctly instructed it as to the burden of proof. It was said in <em>Walters v. W. &amp; S. Life Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/318/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="318 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="1159649" data-case-paths="/pa/318/0382-01">318 Pa. 382</a>, at 389: “While the charge in the case now before us contains sentences which if standing alone would constitute reversible error, we must consider the charge as a whole. . . . This court has repeatedly held that ‘the general effect of the charge, rather than a casual expression in it, must govern the interpretation or construction of it.’ ” See also <em>Kyle v.

He can’t take a chance.” The court below defended this excerpt by citing a quotation from the former case of <em>Sears v. Birbeck, </em><a href="/pa/321/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="321 Pa. 375" data-case-ids="1165913" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0375-01">321 Pa. 375</a>, at 387. This quotation must be limited to the facts in this case, because there was evidence to show that Sears, payee, was under a duty to investigate, as he knew or had ample reason to believe <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>that Mrs. Birbeck was acting as accommodation maker.

Mrs. Birbeck had never asked Sears for a loan for herself. Sears therefore had every reason to believe that the note given by Mrs. Birbeck and her husband was given by them to accommodate Rogowski. Although he made out a check to Mrs. Birbeck’s order, attempting thereby to give the appearance of a direct loan to her, the entire transaction appears to have been merely a device to circumvent the statute.</p>
