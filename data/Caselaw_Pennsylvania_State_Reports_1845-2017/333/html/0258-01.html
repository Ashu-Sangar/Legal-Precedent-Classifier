    <p id="b291-8" data-blocks='[["BL_291.9",291,[100,848,1152,426]]]'>This appeal presents a question which appears to he raised for the first time in an appellate court of this state. It may be stated as follows: Where a legatee dies during the lifetime of a testator, and is indebted to him, whether the issue of the deceased legatee take the legacy (which is saved from lapsing by Section 15(a) of the Wills Act) subject to the indebtedness to testator, or free and discharged therefrom.</p>
    <p id="b291-9" data-blocks='[["BL_291.10",291,[94,1287,1156,809]]]'>The facts which give rise to the present controversy are not in dispute. James D. Callery, the testator, died on May 8, 1932. His will dated November 10, 1930, was duly probated. Under its provisions he bequeathed to his son, William, a four-fortieths interest in his residuary estate; he gave legacies of fractional interests to his widow and children, and then created a trust of twenty-fortieths of the residue of his estate for the benefit of his widow and the children of a second marriage, to continue during their respective lives, with remainder to his grandchildren. William Callery, who was a son by his first wife, died on October 31, 1931, about seven months prior to the death of the testator, and left surviving three minor children, for whom the Union National Bank of Pittsburgh was appointed guardian.</p>
    <p id="b291-10" data-blocks='[["BL_291.11",291,[94,2106,1152,321]],["BL_292.1",292,[301,358,1152,698]]]'>Upon the audit of the account of the administrators c. t. a. of testator’s estate, it appeared that William Callery owed his father’s estate the sum of $132,696.15, in addition to which the administrators had paid his note for $7,581.28, guaranteed by testator, which increased such indebtedness to $140,277.43. The audit<a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>ing judge awarded to the guardian of the three minor children the full legacy under the will, amounting to $29,831.47, free of the debts of the legatee to testator. Thereupon exceptions were filed by the testamentary trustees, who claimed that the indebtedness should be set off against the legacy, and that the share of the estate awarded to the minor children should be applied on account of William Gallery’s obligations to the estate. The exceptions were sustained by the court in banc, and the entire balance for distribution was ordered to be paid to the remaining legatees mentioned in the will. From the final decree so entered the guardian has taken this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b292-4" data-blocks='[["BL_292.4",292,[295,1069,1154,864]]]'>It is clear that the determination of the question before us rests primarily upon the construction to be given Section 15(a) of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, the pertinent part of which provides that “no devise or legacy in favor of a child or children, . . . shall lapse or become void by reason of the decease of such legatee or devisee in the lifetime of the testator, if such devisee or legatee shall leave issue surviving the testator; <em>but such devise or legacy shall be good and available in favor of such surviving issue, with like effect as if such devisee or legatee had survived the testator, </em>unless the testator shall in the will direct otherwise.” (Italics supplied.) Since the testator did not <em>otherwise </em>direct in his will, the disposition to be made of the legacy to his son William is determined by the effect given to the language of the statute.</p>

In this state such was the purpose of the Section of the Wills Act we are now considering, which is a reenactment of two previous Acts of Assembly to like effect, namely the Act of March 19, 1810, P. L. 96,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and the Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 249. Without this remedial statute the children of William Callery would not be entitled to any share of the testator’s estate: <em>Martindale v. Warner, </em><a href="/pa/15/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="15 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="408807" data-case-paths="/pa/15/0471-01">15 Pa. 471</a>; <em>Appeal of Wootten, </em><a href="/pa/239/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="239 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="995946" data-case-paths="/pa/239/0385-01">239 Pa. 385</a>; <em>In re Garrett’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/248/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="248 Pa. 199" data-case-ids="1011441" data-case-paths="/pa/248/0199-01">248 Pa. 199</a>. Notwithstanding the many years that these acts have been in force, we have not had occasion to consider whether legacies, saved from lapsing by virtue of their provisions, pass; to the “issue surviving” subject to the debts of the parent to testator, or free and clear of them.</p>
    <p id="b293-5" data-blocks='[["BL_293.4",293,[110,1173,1155,757]]]'>It is well settled that if the original legatee here had survived the testator, he would be compelled to pay his debt to his father’s estate before receiving the legacy, or to have the amount bequeathed to him applied against it. An executor or administrator has the right to set off against a legacy or distributive share, the amount of an indebtedness due the estate of a decedent by the legatee or distributee: <em>Thompson’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/42/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="42 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="481471" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0345-01">42 Pa. 345</a>; <em>Dull’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/137/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="137 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="821486" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0116-01">137 Pa. 116</a>.

Therefore, if the grandchildren in the present case are to take free of such debts, they will be given a more advantageous position in the distribution of the estate than would have been occupied by their father, for whom they are substituted.</p>
    <p id="b293-6" data-blocks='[["BL_293.5",293,[110,1941,1155,318]],["BL_294.1",294,[302,349,1146,212]]]'>But it is strongly urged on behalf of the guardian that as William Callery predeceased the testator, no interest in the legacy ever vested in him; that upon the death of testator the legacy passed directly to the grandchildren by force of the statute as an original and independent bequest under the will, in their own right as substituted <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>legatees, and not by representation through their deceased parent. In consequence, it is asserted that at no time did William Callery have an interest in the legacy against which the right of set-off could be exercised.</p>

    <p id="b294-6" data-blocks='[["BL_294.5",294,[301,955,1150,802]]]'>It seems to us that when the statute says the legacy shall be available “with like effect as if such devisee or legatee had survived the testator,” it means that such issue are substituted for and placed in the position of their parent, with the same effect for all purposes as if such parent had survived the testator. In other words, they succeed to all the rights which he possessed, but subject to his burdens and bound by the equities which would have existed against him. In the present case, for the grandchildren to take the legacy <em>with like effect </em>as their father would have done, is to take subject to a set-off of his indebtedness. If he could not avail himself of the legacy without deduction of his obligations to the estate, then they are not entitled to receive it clear of such debts.</p>
    <p id="b294-7" data-blocks='[["BL_294.6",294,[299,1776,1151,650]]]'>It has been aptly said, in construing a similar Act in another state, that “it was not intended to raise grandchildren to a plane higher than that which their parent could ever have occupied, or to give them rights as against the other beneficiaries under the will, which the person in whose place they are substituted never would have been permitted to assert. The statute-made legatee is a mere substitute; he is thrust, by force of [the] statute, in the place made vacant by the death of the legatee named in the will, and is given what, but for his death, would have gone to the primary legatee.” See <em>Denise’s Exrs. v.

      <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>As we have stated, the sole purpose of the statute was to prevent the lapse of a legacy to a child who predeceased the testator hut leaves issue surviving testator. It was not the intention of the legislature to confer upon such issue rights superior to those possessed by the original legatee, or to enrich them at the expense of other beneficiaries under the will. Such would be the result if the interpretation for which the guardian contends were to prevail, and it finds no support in reason, for we cannot assume that it was the legislative purpose to relieve against an injustice and inequality in the law by creating another one. As the present Chief Justice said in the recent case of <em>Desh’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/321/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="321 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="1165818" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0286-01">321 Pa. 286</a>, where we had under consideration Section 15(b) and (c) of the Wills Act (p. 290) : “Apart from the obvious plain meaning of Section 15(c), a provision of a statute must be construed with reference to the object intended to be accomplished by it, and this is so even to the extent of restraining the meaning of general terms in order to clearly interpret the spirit and reason of the statute.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
