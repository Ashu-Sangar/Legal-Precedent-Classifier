While it is contended on behalf of the receiver that the association is insolvent, we need not consider the contention because it clearly appears that at the time of the foreclosure claimant had no security belonging to the association. <em>Ivanhoe Building &amp; Loan Assn. v. Orr, </em><a href="/us/295/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="295 U.S. 243" data-case-ids="333918" data-case-paths="/us/295/0243-01">295 U. S. 243</a>, points the way. In that cáse it appeared that mortgagors, having given their bond and mortgage to the claimant building association, conveyed the land to Eastern Sash Company, subsequently bankrupt, who agreed to pay the debt. The Eastern Sash Company sold to Yavne, who also agreed to pay the debt. The mortgage was foreclosed and the property bid in by claimant for $100. Meanwhile the Eastern Sash Company had been adjudicated bankrupt. The question was whether claimant must allow credit for the value of the property ($9,000) or only for the $100. It was held that “petitioner does not come within the definition, for at the date of bankruptcy it held no security against the bankrupt company’s property, nor security given by any other person who in turn was secured by the bankrupt’s assets. ...” See also <em>In re United Cigar Stores Co., </em><a href="/citations/?q=73%20P.2d%20296" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="73 P.2d 296">73 P.

The Secretary of Banking takes the position that he is entitled to a credit for the fair value of the property. We have agreed that the fair value is $5,000 so that the claim is now reduced, if the position of the Secretary is correct, to $1,300. That $1,300, if your Honor pleases, represents a balance of $1,000 on the mortgage and $300 attorney’s fee. As to the $300 attorney’s fee the Secretary of Banking takes the position that under the guarantee agreement which will be offered in evidence there is no liability for an attorney’s fee, that it only guarantees the principal of the bond and does not guarantee the attorney’s fee.”</p>
