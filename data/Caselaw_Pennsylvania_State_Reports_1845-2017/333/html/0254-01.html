    <p id="b287-7" data-blocks='[["BL_287.8",287,[124,733,1157,1021]]]'>At the audit of the account of appellant, who, since December 5, 1935, was in charge of First Friday Building and Loan Association, The New York Life Insurance Company presented a claim on a bond and mortgage given by Anna Atkinson in 1925 maturing in three years. The building association held a second mortgage on the same premises “but at no time had any other interest therein.” March 6, 1931, claimant and the building association made an agreement<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> extending the maturity date of the bond and mortgage to February 5, 1934, etc. After default, foreclosure followed and on October 7, 1935, claimant purchased the property for $75. This, it will be noted, was before the receiver took charge. The claim with interest to December 5, 1935, when the receiver took possession, amounted to $4,570.60. It was agreed that the premises purchased at the sheriff’s sale were worth $3,900. The receiver contended that claimant must credit the value. The court allowed the claim in its full amount.</p>
