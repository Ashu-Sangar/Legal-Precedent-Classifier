Conrad, deceased, for $10,000 upon a sealed judgment note dated May 26, 1916. On the exceptions filed thereto by the residuary legatee, the court en banc awarded an issue to the common pleas to determine whether the decedent executed and delivered the note, and if there was any consideration therefor. The jury answered the first question in the affirmative <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>and the second in the negative. The court below declined to accept the verdict, but the exceptions were dismissed and the claim allowed on the theory that, since the note was under seal, no consideration was necessary, and appellant had failed to establish the defenses of fraud, forgery or payment.</p>

It does not appear from anything properly in the record that, apart from the seal, circumstances existed from which consideration could be inferred, and the note itself recites none. The only evidence offered is a letter written by appellee’s attorney to the corporate executor, wherein it was stated that the note was given “in payment of services rendered over a long period of years by the payee to Herman H.

Where no action is taken to collect a debt due on a specialty until twenty years has elapsed, although there is no statute of limitations for specialties such as sealed instruments, debts and decrees of record, a <em>legal </em>presumption arises, from delay itself, that the debt has been paid; the obligee must then show that payment was not made.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> In the present case the note lacks less than one year of twenty to raise this complete presumption. However, it is well established that, where there is a long delay, presumption of payment of a sealed instrument may arise in a period less than twenty years if there is a factual basis to support it other than the delay. The lapse of time combined with other circumstances is evidence from which a presumption of <em>fact </em>may arise that payment has been made. <em>Hughes v. Hughes, </em><a href="/pa/54/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="54 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="1006335" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0240-01">54 Pa. 240</a>, contains a clear statement of this rule. That was an action on a sealed instrument nineteen years old. The Court said, at p. 242: “That a complete legal presumption of payment of a bond or other instrument of like <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>nature does not arise short of twenty years is well settled; but it has also been well-settled that a shorter period aided by circumstances which contribute to strengthen the presumption of a payment from lapse of time may be submitted to a jury as grounds for the presumption of the fact of payment. [Citations.] Slight circumstances may be given in evidence for that purpose in proportion as the presumption strengthens by the lapse of time; but still they must be such as aid the presumption arising from time. They must be, as it is said, <em>persuasive </em>that the time would not have been suffered to elapse had the debt remained unpaid.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

    <p id="b599-6" data-blocks='[["BL_599.5",599,[108,1174,1155,1035]]]'>There are a number of circumstances, which, with the delay of nineteen years, create a factual presumption of payment. In 1930 the decedent, the obligor in the note, obtained a judgment of $300 against appellee upon the latter’s note, which judgment was paid by appellee. After the maturity of the $10,000 note, appellee obligee received and turned over to the decedent obligor large sums of money (at one time, $4,500) as his share in his wife’s estate, of which decedent and appellee were co-executors, and no attempt was made to assert any claim against these payments. Obligee paid obligor monthly sums of money due to him from properties leased. There was no evidence of any demand made for payment during the lifetime of the decedent although he lived eighth een years after the note matured. All of this is not oniy inconsistent with the existence of a valid debt on the long overdue note for $10,000 but would conclusively show payment. There is nothing in the record that would rebut this factual presumption.</p>
