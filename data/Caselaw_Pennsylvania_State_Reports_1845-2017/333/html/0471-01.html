The husband was operating the car, his wife was seated next to him, and the daughter was beside her mother, all on the single seat of their coupé type automobile. The day was clear, the road was dry, and both windows of the automobile were open.</p>

When they had traveled about four miles from their home, they came to the railroad crossing east of Spangler, near the village of St. Bene<a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>diet, where a single track branch of defendant company intersects the highway at grade. The railroad track is on an up-grade, and while its general direction is north and south, it curves in an arc to the west across the highway. The road extends east and west, and also approaches the crossing on an up-grade, beginning about 450 feet west of the track, increasing in gradient as the crossing is reached. It is of concrete construction, 16 feet in width, with a macadam berm on both sides of the road. Standard railroad warning signs are located near the track.</p>

Here, according to his testimony, he could see to -the right along the track a distance of approximately 50 feet. He looked in both directions, and listened, but neither saw nor heard the approaching train. <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> He then drove upon the track in Ioav gear, but before the front Avheels of his car reached the second rail, the train came into view upon his right, not more than 25 feet away. He swerved to the left of the crossing to avoid the collision, but the automobile was struck almost instantly <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>upon the right side, and carried a distance of 180 feet up the track. Both plaintiffs were seriously injured, and their automobile was demolished.</p>
    <p id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.4",506,[277,521,1152,854]]]'>Plaintiffs assert that they were unable to see the oncoming train because their view of the track in the direction from which it approached was obscured by a thick growth of bushes and trees; that they did not hear the whistle or bell sounded by the engine to give warning as it drew near the crossing. Testimony to the same effect was given by their daughter, and by three other witnesses who were within 800 feet of the place where the accident occurred. However, five members of the train crew, and eighteen other witnesses testified that they heard warning signals given by whistle and bell before the train reached the crossing. There was also a conflict in the testimony as to the speed of the train, the plaintiffs claiming that it was 40 or 45 miles an hour at the time of the accident, while defendant’s witnesses stated that it did not exceed 15 miles an hour.</p>
    <p id="b506-5" data-blocks='[["BL_506.5",506,[276,1395,1151,643]]]'>On behalf of defendant it was contended at trial that the evidence was not sufficient to support a finding that it was negligent. It moved for a compulsory nonsuit upon this ground, which was denied by the court. The questions of defendant’s negligence and of plaintiffs’ contributory negligence were submitted to the jury after a point for binding instructions in favor of defendant was refused. The jury was unable to agree upon a verdict and was finally discharged. Thereupon a motion for judgment upon the whole record was made by defendant, which was granted by the court in banc. Plaintiffs have appealed from the judgment so entered.</p>
    <p id="b506-6" data-blocks='[["BL_506.6",506,[277,2050,1153,370]]]'>The court below reached the conclusion that plaintiffs were barred from recovery because of their contributory negligence; also that the motion for a compulsory non-suit should have been sustained for the reason that plaintiffs’ testimony relating to the accident lacked probative force, — in effect that it was incredible: <em>Marach v.

The burden of proving negligence is upon him who asserts it, and more is required than mere proof of the happening of an accident.</p>
    <p id="b507-3" data-blocks='[["BL_507.4",507,[119,754,1152,262]]]'>Plaintiffs rely principally upon two grounds in support of their charge of negligence: (1) that at the time of the accident the train was operated at an excessive rate of speed; (2) that no whistle was blown or bell sounded to give warning of the approach of the train.</p>
    <p id="b507-4" data-blocks='[["BL_507.5",507,[118,1027,1154,1306]]]'>While the evidence is conflicting concerning the speed of the train, it is well settled that before a jury may consider whether a particular rate of speed constitutes negligence, there must be evidence of special circumstances that renders such speed excessive. A high rate of speed, even at public crossings, is not negligence per se, and no inference of negligence may be drawn from the fact alone of the rapid movement of a railroad train. <em>Childs v.

This fact alone would not warrant an inference of negligence. The crossing was in the country district where the rule has been applied that there is no limit to the rate of speed at which a railroad may run its trains so long as the bounds of safety to patrons are not transgressed : <em>Custer v.

However, the crossing is in the open country, and there is no evidence of any special conditions existing there which made necessary a reduction in speed of the train. Plaintiffs were familiar with the crossing, having passed over it many times. They testified that they did not see the train until it was within 25 feet of them, yet they estimated its speed at approximately 40 to 45 miles an hour within the fleeting seconds before it was upon them.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> This testimony cannot possibly be made the basis of a finding of negligence. Under like circumstances we said in <em>Graft v. Hines, Dir.

    <p id="b508-4" data-blocks='[["BL_508.4",508,[284,1613,1152,426]],["BL_509.1",509,[112,354,1152,317]]]'>It is not the rate of speed winch constitutes negligence of the railroad company in cases such as the present one. The crucial, fact is whether proper warning of the approach of the train was given: <em>Craft v. Hines, Dir. General, </em><a href="/pa/272/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="272 Pa. 499" data-case-ids="1068398" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0499-01">supra;</a> <em>Kelly v. Director Gen. of R. R., </em>supra. To establish the failure of defendant to perform this duty the plaintiffs, in addition to their own and the daughter’s testimony, produced three witnesses, Samuel Miller, <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>Samuel Lantzy, and Mrs. Amelia Gray, who said that they did not hear the whistle blown nor the bell sounded by the train. This is negative testimony, and the record does not disclose that any of these witnesses was sufficiently attentive or in a position to hear a warning signal if it had been given.</p>
    <p id="b509-3" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[110,683,1153,963]]]'>The daughter Lucille, when asked “did you hear anything that gave you warning of the approach of a train or any vehicle,” replied, “nothing at all.” This also is negative testimony. The husband testified that “I saw nothing to the left, nothing to the right, and I heard nothing.” This testimony as to warning is negative. In considering all this evidence the court below was of opinion that it was negative with one exception, — that of the wife-plaintiff. Her testimony was as follows: “Q. Did you see the train approaching before you got on the track? A. I didn’t. Q. Did you hear the train? A. I didn’t. Q. Did you have any warning of any kind the train was approaching? A. Did not.” It is apparent that this testimony is likewise negative in character, and cannot be accepted, standing alone, as proof of the essential fact that no warning was given. It does not amount to more than a scintilla of evidence upon this vital issue of the case.</p>
    <p id="b509-4" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[110,1665,1153,639]]]'>The engineer of the train, John Bowes, stated positively that warning signals consisting of two long and two short blasts of the whistle were given when the train was approximately 500 feet from the crossing, and the ringing of the bell was started at the same time and continued until the crossing was passed. The fireman, the conductor and the brakeman of the train corroborated this testimony. Eighteen other witnesses, who were apparently disinterested, gave positive evidence as to the blowing of the whistle and the ringing of the bell, substantially to the same effect as the testimony of the train crew.</p>
