Pryor, Jr., secured by three mortgages on certain land. The legal title to these bonds and mortgages, when assigned, was in decedent, who, however, owned only half the beneficial interest. No foreclosure has taken place. For the purposes of this case it was agreed that at his death the value of the collateral was $15,000. The question was whether claimant, the Germantown Trust Company, could prove for the full amount of its claim, or whether it must allow credit for $15,000, the value of the collateral, or for $7,500, the value of decedent’s interest in <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>the collateral.

But the court went further. By requiring the claimant to surrender the collateral or allow credit of $15,000 the court, in effect, required the secured creditor to contribute to the insolvent’s property for distribution among his creditors the sum of $7,500 which did not belong to the insolvent and which his creditors could not have taken in execution; in short, the secured creditor was required to make a gift of one-half of his security, in addition to surrendering his debtor’s pledge, or crediting its value, as a condition of proving his claim. It is clear that if equity can so require the property of another to be contributed to the insolvent’s creditors, subrogation will also be required and create a new claim against the fund in favor of the owner of the collateral.

But for that rule, the Bankruptcy Eule was substituted by section 28 of the Insolvency Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 404, 39 PS, section 90.” The Insolvency Act applied only to cases within its provisions and in subordination to the Federal Bankruptcy Law; but equity, whether administered in the common pleas, or the orphans’ courts, must frequently be called upon to distribute the property of insolvents in proceedings not brought under the state Act of 1901 or the federal bankruptcy statutes. We therefore concluded that the so-called bankruptcy rule, to the extent incorporated by the legislature in section 28 of the Act of 1901, should thereafter be applied whenever equity distributed an insolvent’s estate.</p>

The use of the word “surrender” instead of the word “assign” or some similar word, shows that the legislature intended to deal with a title derived from the debtor (which could be the subject of surrender to his representative) and not with the property of some surety, which would require assignment to pass title to the insolvent’s representative, and forthwith bring in subrogation.</p>

The Lord Chancellor said: ‘Now what are the principles applicable to cases of this kind ? If a creditor of a bankrupt holds a seóurity on part of the bankrupt’s estate, he is not entitled to prove his debt under the commission, without giving up or realizing his security. For the principle of the bankrupt laws is, that all creditors are to be put on an equal footing, and therefore, if a creditor chooses to prove under the commission, he must sell or surrender whatever property he holds belonging to the bankrupt; but if he has a security on the estate of a third person, that principle does not apply; he is in that ease entitled to prove for the whole amount of his debt, and also to realize the security, provided he does not altogether receive more than twenty shillings in the pound. That is the ground on which the principle is established; it is unnecessary to cite authorities for it, as it is too clearly settled to be disputed. . . .’”</p>

D. 105] was decided. Now, had the bank here a mortgage on the property of the debtors ? I think it is plain that they had, because they held the securities, and they have a charge upon them, and those securities are the property of the separate debtors. But are they securities for a debt due to them from the debtors ? I should have said quite clearly not. The bank held the securities for a debt due, not from the separate debtors, but from the firm, and unless ‘due from the debtor’ can be read as ‘taken from the debtor either alone or jointly,’ the matter seems to me to be disposed of merely by a consideration of that definition. I have no doubt that one of the reasons for the rule as to proof which has found its way into different Bankruptcy Acts — I have not traced the whole history of them — is that stated by the Master of the Rolls, that a creditor would not be allowed to prove against a bankrupt’s estate and retain a security which if given up would go to augment the estate against which he proves.”</p>
