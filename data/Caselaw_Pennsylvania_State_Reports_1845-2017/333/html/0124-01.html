Appellant, executor of the Starling Estate, which owned a first mortgage on 316 Market Street, Philadelphia, claimed that he entered into an agreement with the attorney for appellee building and loan association, holder of the second mortgage, that appellee, which was foreclosing, should pay the taxes on the property on condition that appellant would not bid at the sheriff’s sale, thus avoiding increased costs.</p>
    <p id="b157-10" data-blocks='[["BL_157.14",157,[120,1835,1154,591]]]'>The property was bought in by appellee on April 7, 1930, for $50.00. It thereafter collected the rents, and paid appellant an installment of interest due on the first mortgage. Later, appellee decided to abandon the property, and finally conveyed it to Welcome Stilling on December 29, 1930. The premises were duly registered in her name. Meanwhile, appellant instituted foreclosure proceedings on the first mortgage and purchased the property January 5, 1931. The attorney for appellee who is said to have made the promise to pay the taxes died in July, 1932.</p>

The necessity of special authority set forth in these cases, not only denies the existence of implied authority, but also of apparent authority of an attorney to bind his client to such obligations by virtue of his office.</p>
    <p id="b159-3" data-blocks='[["BL_159.4",159,[149,747,1154,1138]]]'>The mere retaining of an attorney to conduct a foreclosure suit would not authorize him to make his client personally liable for taxes due on the premises under circumstances such as here relatéd. The acts proposed to be done by the attorney in all of the cited cases, as well as in the instant case, would be violative of a client’s substantive rights, which are not to be surrendered by the attorney merely because he represents his client in a given proceeding. Anyone who deals with an attorney is bound to notice and to inquire into the authority he proposes to exercise. There was no such power given the attorney in this case, nor is there any testimony in this record that would show any right or authority to make the contract in question, and the court below correctly so held. Even assuming the alleged agreement constituted a legal contract capable of ratification, there is no evidence of knowledge on the part of the board of directors, from the time of purchase of the property to the reconveyance to Welcome Stilling, nor evidence of special circumstances which would have put appellee on inquiry as to whether there was such an agreement.</p>

Bergson, </em><a href="/pa/307/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="307 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="1138161" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0044-01">307 Pa. 44</a>, that taxes are not only a lien upon the property against which assessed, but also a personal charge against the registered or real owner, and that where the taxes are paid by the new owner he may be subrogated to the right of the taxing authority to collect the amount as the personal debt of the person owning the property at the time the taxes accrued. Appellant claims that he was subrogated to the City’s right against appellee for <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>the year 1931, because the sale to Welcome Stilling was made for the express purpose of avoiding liability for taxes, as the registered owner at the date of the assessment. Welcome Stilling was merely holding title as a “straw person.”</p>
    <p id="b160-4" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[281,625,1150,971]]]'>The law will not permit the real owner to set up an irresponsible party, a straw man, as registered owner while retaining the beneficial interest, and thereby escape the payment of taxes: <em>Pennsylvania Company, etc., v.

And the municipality, or one subrogated to its rights, such as the mortgagee who pays the taxes, has rights and remedies against the real or beneficial owner to collect any tax levied. But in this case it does not appear that appellee was the beneficial owner for 1931 — the property had been abandoned so far as the collection of rents was concerned and its conveyance to Welcome Stilling was absolute, by a fee simple deed of conveyance. As it appears there was no trust interest remaining in appellee it would not be liable for that year’s tax. Nor is there any evidence that would show there was no financial responsibility in the purchaser.</p>

We know of no law which compels a man to subject himself to a heavy burden of taxation by holding property which is worthless or unprofitable.
