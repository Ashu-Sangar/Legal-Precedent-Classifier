Appellee, not a war veteran but highest on the list, was selected.

Generally speaking, the laws have been sustained, but only if they prescribe that the veteran possess the minimum <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>qualifications necessary to the discharge of the pxxblic duties involved. Although the subject of preferences is not discussed elaborately, the results are clear and consistent. These preferences have been considered by the courts under constitutional prohibitions against special privileges and unreasonable classification, and while the constitutional provisions differ somewhat in the various jurisdictions, they are similar in that all permit reasonable classifications and prohibit unreasonable ones and arbitrary privileges.</p>
    <p id="b605-4" data-blocks='[["BL_605.4",605,[97,909,1156,919]]]'>The underlying principle in all cases is that the veteran must possess the minimum qualifications to perform the duties involved. Some states so provide by law; in others the courts have read into the statutes this proviso so as to be consistent with constitutional requirements. Where sucli qualifications are not provided for it is generally held that the law violates constitutional inhibitions, since the preference for veterans is commanded regardless of ability. The theory on which the cases are decided is that, while it may be perfectly lawful to prefer veterans, there must be some reasonable relation between the basis of preference and the object to be obtained, the preference of veterans for the proper performance of public duties. Public policy, as well as constitutional restrictions, prohibits an unrestrained preference as it does a preference credit based on factors not representative of true value.</p>

No one should deny that these advantages are conducive to the better performance of public duties, where discipline, loyalty, and public spirit are likewise essential. The fact that veterans, either through voluntary enlistment or conscription, have been to wars for the preservation of their country should be given some <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>consideration. It is the greatest service a citizen can perform, and it comes with ill grace for those of us not in such wars to deny them just consideration. Where the preferences reasonably and fairly appraise these advantages, there can be no question of illegal classification and arbitrary privilege. But, on the other hand, where war service is appraised, in the allotment of public positions, beyond its value, and the preference goes beyond the scope of the actual advantages gained in such service, the classification becomes void and the privilege is held unreasonable and arbitrary. Public policy demands such a rule of law. It is essential to the administration of public affairs that governmental employees be selected on the basis of their ability to perform the duties imposed upon them in an efficient manner, and if public servants are not selected on this basis, the appointing power violates its oath of office; where the legislature so provides, it offends the constitutional mandate.</p>

Some give preferences to veterans where the position does not require an examination. In these cases, the positions not being in the civil service class, statutes providing a preference for war veterans in the discretion of the appointive power, or where they possess reasonable qualifications, or equal qualifications with other candidates for the same position, have been held proper. Many statutes were enacted after the Civil War providing that veterans should be preferred for public position. Some of these statutes expressly required that the veteran be preferred only if reasonably qualified to discharge the duties involved. See <em>Spang v. Roper, </em>13 Fed. Supp. 840, reversed on other grounds in <em>Gossnell v.

In an elaborate opinion the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that, under a statute providing for such a mandatory preference, involving no considerations other than the passage of an examination, it was proper to prefer the veterans. The court pointed out that the passage of the examination was equivalent to establishment of the qualifications necessary for the position: <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em><a href="/mass/166/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="166 Mass. 589" data-case-ids="820652" data-case-paths="/mass/166/0589-01">166 Mass. 589</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20N.E.%20625" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="44 N.E. 625">44 N.

They give undue Aveight to military service and violate the constitutional provisions against class legislation and special privilege. It was argued in <em>Cook v. Mason, </em><a href="/cal-app/103/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="103 Cal. App. 6" data-case-ids="2133957" data-case-paths="/cal-app/103/0006-01">103 Cal.

While the court found it unnecessary to pass on this five point difference, it was strongly intimated that such a. preference was bad. In <em>State v. McDonald, </em><a href="/minn/188/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="188 Minn. 157" data-case-ids="1750512" data-case-paths="/minn/188/0157-01">188 Minn. 157</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=246%20N.W.%20900" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="246 N.W. 900">246 N. W. 900</a>, although the statute involved did not contain such a provision, the court expressly stated that if the legislature had provided a passing grade for veterans lower than that for non-veterans it would have violated the state constitution.</p>
    <p id="b611-4" data-blocks='[["BL_611.5",611,[101,1675,1166,646]]]'>In several jurisdictions the statutes have provided for a credit of a specific number of points to veterans; <em>who pass the examination, </em>which credit aids their order or standing in the eligible lists. These statutes are, of course, distinguishable. Their propriety rests on their reasonableness. In <em>Jones v. O’Toole, </em>supra, such a credit of five points was allowed and despite its mandatory character was assumed to be constitutional. In <em>State v. Emmons, </em><a href="/ohio-st/128/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="128 Ohio St. 216" data-case-ids="1007788" data-case-paths="/ohio-st/128/0216-01">128 Ohio St. 216</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20N.E.%20468" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="190 N.E. 468">190 N.

      <em>teen per cent </em>credit in advance to veterans as unconstitutional. It is not distinguishable from a statute which would allow a fifteen per cent lower passing grade for veterans. It gives undue weight to the military and public experience of the veterans and in that way constitutes a special and exclusive privilege. Moreover, the legislature has itself condemned the classification. It has enacted laws giving veterans a credit of five per cent in civil service examinations for employment in the state agencies referred to above, while in cities of the third class, fifteen per cent is given. There is no reason for this difference. We do not hold that no credit can be given to veterans <em>who have passed examinations </em>in addition to the preference when on the eligible list, but the present grading is given to those who do not pass the examination.</p>

We do not pass on the age and other provisions of the act. The preference feature is otherwise sustained as constitutional, while the fifteen per cent provision is held illegal.</p>
