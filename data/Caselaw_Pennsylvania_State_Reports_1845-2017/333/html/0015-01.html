Jeffery and for Margaret C. Jeffery, unhorn persons might become interested; to represent such interests the court appointed a guardian ad litem who excepted to the apportionment. The exceptions were dismissed on two grounds: first, as required by a provision in the deeds of trust, and, second, pursuant to the Act of July 2,1937, P. L. 2762, 20 PS section 844. Counsel for the assenting beneficiaries also sought to justify the apportionment by the equitable rules of marshalling and exoneration, but the learned court below rejected the contention. As either of the two grounds on which the decrees were made is sufficient to support them, they will be affirmed, but affirmance is not to be understood as holding that proper application of the equitable doctrine involved would not support the decrees; that subject is left open.</p>

The second paragraph required the trustee “To pay out of said trust fund all costs, charges and expenses of said trust estate and of the management thereof, including court costs and attorneys’ fees, and reasonable compensation to the party of the second part for its services as Trustee hereunder.” The deeds were made in contemplation of existing laws and at a time when revocable trusts were subject to federal estate tax on the settlor’s estate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The testator is presumed to have known that the tax was payable out of his property.
