On a November afternoon in 1937 he met her-^according to his subsequent statement, accidentally — and urged her to return to him, but she refused. They stood talking together under a railroad bridge. Afterwards she was heard shouting for help and screaming that her husband had thrown acid at her, and was found in great agony, her face dripping with the acid. Taken to a hospital, she died within two hours, her death being caused by the action of the corrosive fluid which had been drawn by inhalation through the nasal passages into her throat.</p>
    <p id="b98-12" data-blocks='[["BL_98.17",98,[280,2246,1147,152]],["BL_99.1",99,[115,353,1152,868]]]'>Defendant did not take the stand nor offer any testimony, but, according to a written statement made to the detectives and introduced in evidence by the Common<a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>wealth, he claimed that he had intended to drink the acid and commit suicide, that when he started to do so his wife tried to wrest from him the can containing it, that some of the contents spilled in his face and blinded him so that he could no longer see her nor know what became of her; he denied that he threw the acid. His defense was, therefore, that her death was accidental. The Commonwealth proved that the liquid was hydrofluoric acid, highly corrosive, and not acid of the kind that defendant regularly used in his work as a painter; also that the position of stains on the abutment of the bridge indicated that the acid had been hurled, not spilled. A police officer testified that he asked defendant at the station house “why he threw the acid on his wife, and he said that his wife set him up, and he said, I would do the same in his place.”</p>
    <p id="b99-3" data-blocks='[["BL_99.4",99,[113,1233,1153,316]]]'>The trial revolved principally around two issues of fact: (1) Did defendant throw the acid, or did his wife’s death accidentally result from a struggle between them for possession of the can? (2) If the acid was deliberately thrown, was defendant’s intent merely to cause bodily harm to his wife or to take her life?</p>

The learned trial judge charged: “If, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, the defendant has established that the killing was an accidental one, when the deceased, Mary Kluska, was struggling with him in the endeavor to prevent him swallowing the acid, the defendant should be acquitted.” Although this did not amount to an express statement that the burden was upon defendant to establish by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the death was accidental, it clearly implied that such was the law, and was therefore erroneous. The defense that the killing was accidental is not of the affirmative type which threw upon defendant the burden of <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>proving it, either by preponderance of evidence or otherwise; such a defense, instead of admitting the intentional act charged in the indictment, directly challenges and controverts it: <em>Commonwealth v. Deitrick, </em><a href="/pa/218/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="218 Pa. 36" data-case-ids="999628" data-case-paths="/pa/218/0036-01">218 Pa. 36</a>, <a href="/pa/221/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="221 Pa. 7" data-case-ids="956167" data-case-paths="/pa/221/0007-01">221 Pa. 7</a>; <em>Commonwealth v.

No doubt the error was a mere inadvertence in the course of the charge, but it may have had a gravely prejudicial effect upon the jury, nor was it corrected by the court’s further statement that “Where the defense is accidental killing, the burden is still on the Commonwealth to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,” since it would have been necessary so to charge even if the defense of accidental killing were one that had to be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b100-4" data-blocks='[["BL_100.4",100,[286,1120,1152,1301]],["BL_101.1",101,[124,356,1154,1954]]]'>The second and more important issue in the case was whether defendant had the intent to kill. Undoubtedly there was evidence sufficient to show the existence of such an intent. Ordinarily, perhaps, one would not expect death to result from throwing acid upon the face, but, on the other hand, such an effect might be apprehended. Considering the quantity and quality of the acid which defendant used, the motive which actuated him (resentment because of his wife’s refusal to go back to live with him), and all the other circumstances of the ease, it would be for a jury to say whether they believed beyond a reasonable doubt that his intent was to kill. However, the selection of such an instrumentality as here employed is so unusual if the intention is to cause death, that the trial judge should not only have made the question of defendant’s intent the principal subject of discussion in the charge, but also have been meticulously careful to state accurately — if at all — the legal principle concerning the presumption which arises from the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of another’s body. ■ The court charged: “Our Supreme Court has said where one intentionally uses a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the body of another,-there is a legal presumption of an intent to kill, which cannot be rebutted <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>by the assailant’s own testimony that he did not so intend, but whether the assailant intended to use the weapon at a vital part is a question of fact, and he may then deny that he intended to so use it or that he intended to take life.” It is true that this is a statement taken verbatim from the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Zec, </em><a href="/pa/262/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="262 Pa. 251" data-case-ids="1044370" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0251-01">262 Pa. 251</a>, 257, but it is not in accord with the prevailing authorities. The distinction between a legal and a factual presumption was discussed at length in <em>Watkins v. Prudential Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/315/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="315 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1156742" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0497-01">315 Pa. 497</a>, 500-503; a legal presumption is in effect a rule or conclusion of law, whereas a presumption of fact is but a prima facie inference which can be rebutted by testimony to the contrary. The presumption from the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body arises from the fact that it is common knowledge that such a use is likely to cause death and therefore a jury may infer that the intent of the person using such a Aveapon in such a manner was to kill. This presumption may be overcome by the assailant himself denying such intent, or by any other appropriate eiddence. In <em>Commonwealth v. Drum, </em><a href="/pa/58/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="58 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1013212" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0009-01">58 Pa. 9</a>, in Avhich the Pennsylvania law of homicide found its most classic expression, it was stated (p. 17) that the presumption arises “in the absence of qualifying facts.” In <em>Commonwealth v. Green, </em><a href="/pa/294/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="294 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="1113378" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0573-01">294 Pa. 573</a>, the question was discussed at length, and it was definitely held that the presumption was one not of laAV but of fact, and arose “in the absence of qualifying circumstances.” To the same effect see <em>Commonwealth v. Troup, </em><a href="/pa/302/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="302 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="1129126" data-case-paths="/pa/302/0246-01">302 Pa. 246</a>, 252, 253; <em>Commonwealth v.

Moreover, the statement of law as phrased in the charge is confusing in its inconsistency; although saying that the presumption of the intent to kill in such a case cannot be rebutted by the assailant’s own testimony that he did not so intend, it adds that he “may then deny . . . that he intended to take life.”</p>

Life may be taken as the result of an intent to take it even though no deadly weapon, in the ordinary sense of that term, be used. In <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Blakeley, <a href="/pa/274/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="274 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1073087" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0100-01">274 Pa. 100</a>, a club was the instrument by which death was inflicted, and the court said (p. 105) : “The implement in itself, as an indication of a purpose to effect the result attained, is not separable in any case from its use. A weapon ordinarily may be employed in such a manner that death is improbable.Its nature must be considered with the manner of its application and its effect, and, from the combined circumstances, there may appear an intention to kill. . . . it is always for the jury to say, from all the evidence adduced, whether an intention to kill was present in the mind of the defendant.” In <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Lisowski, <a href="/pa/274/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="274 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1072890" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0222-01">274 Pa. 222</a>, a wife was killed by being assaulted by her husband with his fists and feet, but a conviction of first-degree murder was sustained. In <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Murray, <em>2 </em>Ashmead’s Rep. 41, a man was beaten to death with a leather strap, and the court said (p. 58) : “If we should hold, that a killing by weapons, which, in the popular sense, are not regarded as deadly, is inadequate to induce a conviction of murder of the first degree, we establish a precedent jeopardizing the life of every man in the community, . . . No such rule happily exists; and although the nature of the weapon used may be quite material in the ascertaining of the intent to kill, that intent must still, in every case, be collected from all the attending circumstances, let the instrument of death be what it will.” In <em>Commonwealth v. </em>McMillan, <a href="/pa/144/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="144 Pa. 610" data-case-ids="823761" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0610-01">144 Pa. 610</a>, the killing was accomplished by the use of a heated poker; a conviction of murder in the first degree was affirmed. In <em>Commonwealth v. Guida, </em><a href="/pa/298/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="298 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1120305" data-case-paths="/pa/298/0370-01">298 Pa. 370</a>, where a victim was beaten to death without the use of any weapons, the court said (p. 374) : “The absence of deadly weapons deprived the Commonwealth of the pre<a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>sumption of an intent to kill which their use would have afforded; but it cannot be affirmed as a legal conclusion that an intent to take life is rebutted by the absence of a deadly weapon. Such a conclusion would be unthinkable in a case like killing by strangulation or drowning.”</p>
    <p id="b103-3" data-blocks='[["BL_103.4",103,[144,633,1154,1250]]]'>Considering that there is some doubt as to the likelihood of acid causing death when thrown upon the face, and therefore whether it should be regarded, when so used, as a “deadly weapon,” it would probably have been better for the learned trial judge to have omitted altogether any reference to the presumption arising from the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the body. It is true that he explained to the jury that the situation here was “somewhat different” from one where a pistol or a knife is used, that it was for them to determine whether “defendant knew that this acid was so deadly it was likely to be fatal,” and that, unless defendant had such knowledge, “we do not have the presumption in this case that would arise if he had used a revolver or some other deadly weapon.” Even this qualification, however, goes merely to the knowledge of defendant as to whether, the acid was deadly. He evidently knew it was deadly if swallowed, for, according to his statement, he intended to use it in that manner in order to commit suicide, but the real question is whether he knew or believed that, if thrown upon the face, its results would be likely to be those of a “deadly weapon” used upon a vital part of the. body.</p>

If, however, it be the law, as it is, that the commission of a collateral offense is not admissible in evidence, then certainly the making of a threat to commit a collateral offense is not admissible.

Superior Ct. 455</a>, Judge Gawthrop pointed out (p. 474), that “It seems clear that the more weighty or important the affair or question as to which action is to be taken the less substantial is the doubt required to cause hesitation as to it. Therefore, instruction that a doubt that would require an acquittal must be such as would cause hesitation in the weightier affairs of life gives effect to slighter doubt of guilt, and is more favorable to the accused, than instruction that the doubt must be one that would cause hesitation in coming to a decision in the ordinary affairs of life.”</p>

As a standard and approved form of charge, however, we are of opinion that the jury should be told either, as in the Andrews case, that they should not condemn unless so convinced by the evidence that they would venture to act upon that conviction in matters <em>of the highest importance </em>to their own interests, or, as in the Green and Jermyn cases, that a reasonable doubt was one that would cause them to hesitate to act in any of the <em>important </em>affairs of their own lives. The one form of charge explains the state of mind that must exist in order to warrant a conviction, the <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>other the degree of doubt that should lead to an acquittal.</p>

But did he intend to take the life of his victim, and was he therefore guilty of first-degree murder, or did he desire merely to inflict upon her grave bodily harm? For the jury to determine this question properly it was necessary that they should be instructed fully and accurately as to the legal principles designed to guide them in its consideration, but unfortunately there crept into the learned trial judge’s charge the defects herein pointed out.</p>
