She was first dismissed by the board in 1937, for the reason that she was a nonresident. As she had a contract when the Teachers’ Tenure Act of April 6, 1937, P. L. 213, went into effect, the court of common pleas ordered her reinstated. Thereafter she was assigned to teach the kindergarten, and taught until the end of the school year 1938, when the board discontinued the kindergarten entirely, and having no place for appellee, suspended her until the department should be reestablished. .</p>

The report was finished May 13, 1938, but it is not clear from the record when the board had knowledge of it. As approved by <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>the Bureau of Public Instruction, it recommended the discontinuance of the kindergarten department as a matter of good school business administration and instructional efficiency.</p>

An opportunity was given her to be heard and she appeared, through counsel, at the meeting held June 7. No formal charges were filed or heard. A second notice of the board’s action was sent appellee, and she was thereafter refused reemployment. On hearing de novo in the court of common pleas the board’s action was reversed and she was ordered reinstated. The reason given by the court below was that she had been dismissed because she was a nonresident. There is no evidence to support this conclusion, nor, on the other hand, does the record show the report of the Department of Public Instruction, though apparently the board based its action upon it. Because of this insufficiency, we will remand the record for further hearing, but in so doing, as it was argued that the board’s action was based on the departmental recommendation, we will state our views on the issues raised.</p>

The teacher’s position is that, though the board may discontinue the department, she must receive a contract from the board and be paid her salary indefinitely though there is no other place for her, or scholars for her to teach. Appellee bases her contention on the Tenure Act, asserting that she cannot be dismissed because of the abandonment of a department, but only for the causes mentioned in that Act.</p>

In doing so, we must keep in mind the underlying purpose of the Tenure Act, and inquire whether it was intended to apply to a situation such as is here presented.

Though containing individual policies in themselves, each is subordinate to' this cardinal purpose. Where a statute amends part of a general code so that its apparent effect is to materially modify, partially destroy, or interfere with the general purposes of the code by conflict with other sections, the amendment should be strictly construed and made to conform to the general purposes unless the • legislative intent is clearly and specifically otherwise. It should not be given the drastic effect of destruction by indirection.</p>

The Code must be construed in the light of this constitutional command. Section 1201 of the Code, as amended, reads: “The board of school directors in every school district . . . <em>shall </em>employ the <em>necessary </em>qualified teachers to keep the public schools open in their respective districts in compliance with the provisions of this act.” It must be assumed that the legislature had this constitutional provision in mind when it used the words “shall employ the necessary qualified teachers.” Both “shall” and “necessary” are mandatory words; “necessary” must be given its plain meaning and should not be construed to mean “unnecessary.” “Efficient” has reference not only to the qualifications of the teacher, but relates to other basic matters associated with the school system. There are many factors that enter into the meaning of the word “necessary,” as we said in <em>Wilson v. School Dist. of </em>Phila., <a href="/pa/328/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="328 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="1179655" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0225-01">328 Pa. 225</a>, 236. What would be “necessary” under this provision is a matter within the administrative discretion of the board to a large extent. Thus, the board has discretion to add supplementary departments, and by so doing to create a necessity for more teachers. <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>Tlie uncertainty of the school tax rate conies from the uncertainty of the amount that is required to pay the teaching staff of each district, which may be increased without outside interference, and may be decreased within the limitations of the Act.</p>

    <p id="b558-5" data-blocks='[["BL_558.5",558,[290,940,1152,914]]]'>The legislature knew perfectly well in analogous situations how tO' express the intent appellee attempts to read into the Act. Section 1206 .of the Code, as amended, provides that when schools are closed because of contagious diseases, fires, or other causes, the teachers must be paid during the interim according to their contracts, though they may remain idle at their homes. The body of teachers is kept .together during a temporary emergency, and in these circumstances there is justification for paying them; it makes for a more “efficient public school system.” The legislature also knew how to express its purpose when there is a natural decrease in student population, and provided that in such case there could be a suspension of teachers in the inverse order of appointment. Had it been intended that the Tenure Act should apply to the present situation, it would be reasonable to expect a similar provision.</p>

If this section forbids the suspension of teachers rendered unnecessary by the discontinuance of the department, the establishment of which created the necessity, it is in conflict with Section 1201 which compels the board to employ the <em>necessary </em>qualified teachers. Appellee’s argument places too great emphasis upon the dismissal <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>feature, and does not take into consideration the other provisions of the Tenure Act, the Code as a whole, and the Constitution. It ignores the effect of our decision in <em>Walker’s Appeal, </em>where,- with reference to the question then before us, we held that the limitations in Section 1205(a) were opposed not only to the general purpose of the Code, but were also opposed to other sections which had for their object the advancement of the educational system through the joint consolidation of.schools; that the dismissal and suspension features mentioned would not support the right of the. teachers there to an indefinite contract. The legal abandonment of a department of education that releases a teacher, presents no difference in its essential effect from the consolidation of schools; both have as their object a better educational system at a lower expense.</p>

Undoubtedly years ago it was thought a single teacher could instruct that number of pupils, but today it has been decided, as a matter of educational policy, that this cannot be done.</p>

As stated at argument, the district had difficulty in paying its staff out of its present collectible revenue, considering other necessary expenses. It was necessary to secure additional State aid to defray all expenses. When an entire department is lawfully abolished for valid reasons, which may include financial ones, in the interest of a. more efficient system, the teachers in that department can be dismissed. Economy is desirable in any governmental function, and we <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>cannot so view the present legislation as to prevent the abolition of a department for this purpose.</p>

The legislature having specifically restricted the consideration of seniority to suspensions for natural decrease in pupil population, it would be beyond the. province of this Court to hold the same rule, however desirable, to apply to suspensions for other reasons. If the safeguards of Section 1205(b) are to be extended to a situation like the present because of public policy, the legislature must so declare.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> Of course, a department may not be abolished merely to circumvent the provisions of the Act and to accomplish the dismissal of a teacher for political or arbitrary reasons by unlawful subterfuge.
