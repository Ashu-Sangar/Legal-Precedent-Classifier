The deeds conveyed properties in the borough of Mt. Pleasant, Westmoreland County. They were dated April 1, 1932, were acknowledged by the grantor on that day, and were recorded on May 27 and May 29, 1936, respectively.

Rumbaugh ; she had been his second wife, and Lloyd F. and Morris F. ■ Rumbaugh were her stepsons. Sarah E. Rhoades was her sister. Mrs. Rumbaugh visited the office of Wade T. Kline, Esq., in Greensburg, and directed him to prepare the deeds which are the subject of the present controversy. She signed and acknowledged them before him as notary, and apparently told him that she did not wish them to be delivered until her death.. Mr. Kline instructed her that to accomplish this purpose she should give them to someone who would turn them over to the grantees at that time. Mrs. Rumbaugh. took the deeds away with her. Nine months later, in , January, 1933, Mr. Kline prepared for her a will in which she gave one dollar to each of her stepsons, one dollar to her sister, the interest on $7,000 to her brother Robert G. Duncan for life, and at his death the principal to his seven children, who are. the plaintiffs in the present .action. The will directed that all stocks, bonds and mortgages should be converted into cash, and the remainder of the estate was to be divided between her. brother and sister or their heirs. Lloyd F. Rumbaugh and Edith Rhoades, the daughter of Sarah E. Rhoades, were named as executors. Mrs. Rumbaugh died in April, 1935. Lloyd F. Rumbaugh and Mrs. Rhoades both, lived in Mt. Pleasant, the former on the premises conveyed in the deed to him and his brother, whereas Duncan (who died in March, 1935) and his children resided in another part of the state. In May, 1936, the two deeds were discovered by Mr. Kline in a drawer in the library of Miss Emma Bair, who had died the day before. . Miss Bair <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>was seventy-nine years of age and had been in more or less feeble health for some time prior to her decease. She lived in Greensburg, and was a friend and relative .by marriage of Mrs. Rumbaugh. Mr. Kline turned the deeds over to the grantees, by whom they were subsequently recorded.</p>

    <p id="b355-3" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[97,746,1161,1631]]]'>In the present case the testimony indicates that the deeds were given by Mrs. Bumbaugh to Miss Bair for the purpose of delivery to the grantees at the time of Mrs.' Bumbaugh’s death. All the circumstances point in that direction. They may be cumulatively stated as follows: (1) Mrs. Bumbaugh, who was a woman active in practical affairs, had a safe deposit box of her own, and it is difficult to imagine a reason why she should have given the deeds to Miss Bair unless it were to insure delivery when Mrs. Bumbaugh died. (2) Having been directed by her attorney to place the deeds in the hands of a third person for that purpose, it is natural to presume that Mrs. Bumbaugh delivered them to her friend in pursu-. anee of such instructions. (3) Her relations with her sister and stepsons were friendly and intimate; it seems unlikely that she would have given a legacy of f7,000 to her brother and his children, living quite a distance away, and cut her sister and stepsons off with a dollar each, unless she were acting on the assumption that she had given them the properties in Mt. Pleasant. (4) She had received part of her estate from her deceased husband, and there was therefore justification — if not indeed a moral duty — for making some provision for her stepsons. (5) Her will did not refer to real estate but only to stock, bonds and mortgages, which would indicate her belief that she had already disposed of the properties. (6) The failure of Miss Bair to deliver the deeds to the grantees in the period of a year which elapsed between Mrs. Eumbaugh’s death and her own is readily explainable by her age and infirmities.</p>
