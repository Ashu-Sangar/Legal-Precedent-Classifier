Among the reasons offered were that the reports were not filed within the time fixed by act of assembly, nor under the act requiring such reports, nor in the proper office.</p>

Other officers likewise sought to intervene but their proceedings are not here involved. The sheriff’s application was granted by the court below, whereupon he immediately, under the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, attacked its jurisdiction to entertain the proceedings to strike off the reports. The court found that it had jurisdiction and intimated the reports had been improperly filed with the prothonotary. It also stated that, because of the controller’s unexplained failure to audit the accounts of officers and the manner of filing, the reports were a fraud on the court.</p>

The commissioners, as taxpayers, and as successors to any prior board, had such notice when they entered on the duties of their office. The Act does not require specific notice to be given to the county commissioners or any other officer. The various officers, and all others in the county, are sufficiently apprised by the advertising required by the General County Law, which was fully complied with. They now propose to uproot all reports for the years mentioned, Avipe out the judgments entered thereon, and leave the county, its taxpayers and fiscal officers without any legal statement of the county’s financial status. This they ask to be done though accountants or officers affected may have lost or destroyed much of the evidence to sustain their accounts, and also in face of the fact that the commissioners had a complete statutory remedy to correct any mistake in the reports, or to prevent a failure to audit any of the accounts. Such failure, standing alone, does not constitute fraud or collusion between the controller and the officers. If the auditing officer without ulterior motives carelessly neglects or fails to audit any of the accounts of officers, his neglect or failure is not fraudulent in fact or law.</p>

This is but an example of the too frequent carelessness of public officers in the performance of the duties entrusted to them. No doubt in some counties the idea still prevails, as it did years ago, that it is not necessary to audit the accounts of all county officers who deal with county money. This is not only erroneous, but the neglect is of the most serious consequence to the controllers, or county auditors who perform similar duties.</p>
    <p id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[121,910,1155,801]]]'>But, while this Court has frequently asserted the sound policy that public officers must be held to strict accountability, and that technical objections or unnecessary impediments will not prevent the proper investigation of their accounts <em>(Godshalk v.

If for any reason the county commissioners or taxpayers thought there was material error in the reports, this could have been inquired into by exceptions and appeal to the common pleas under Section 379 of the General County Law. In the interest of establishing a sound financial status and a definitely fixed liability, the law requires those desiring to attack the controller’s report to act within a specified time. If no action is taken, the conclusion of the report as affecting each officer whose account is audited is to be treated as a final judgment, and cannot be disturbed by any court unless fraud or col<a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>lusion appears, or circumstances exist from which, there is a natural inference of fraud.</p>

See <em>O’Gara et al., County Comrs., v. Phillips, </em><a href="/pa/297/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="297 Pa. 526" data-case-ids="1118276" data-case-paths="/pa/297/0526-01">297 Pa. 526</a>, 532; <em>Lackawanna, County’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/296/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="296 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="1116608" data-case-paths="/pa/296/0271-01">296 Pa. 271</a>, 276; <em>Zeigler's Petition, </em><a href="/pa/207/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="207 Pa. 131" data-case-ids="933581" data-case-paths="/pa/207/0131-01">207 Pa. 131</a>. The better practice is to allow an appeal nunc pro tunc challenging only the accounts of the particular officer alleged to be in default. Such concealment not being apparent on the face of the report, it will not support a motion to strike off as is here attempted: <em>Nixon v. Nixon, </em><a href="/pa/329/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="329 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1181467" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0256-01">329 Pa. 256</a>, 263. As the court stated in <em>Zeigler’s Petition, </em><a href="/pa/207/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="207 Pa. 131" data-case-ids="933581" data-case-paths="/pa/207/0131-01">207 Pa. 131</a>, at 137: “. . . the court below has full power to deal with the question upon its merits, and to grant equitable relief by <em>opening </em>the judgment and allowing an appeal from the report of the auditors to be filed nunc pro tune; and if upon full investigation it should appear that the report of the auditors had been procured by fraud, it would become the duty of the court to interfere by allowing the appeal asked for. The question, however, being of grave import, ought not to have been summarily disposed of on the petition and demurrer.” Here, if appellant knowingly stated an improper account, withholding moneys from the county, or if improper financial transactions were obscured through fraudulent acts, the court could, as to those acts, open the judgment entered thereon if steps were taken within a reasonable time. We question the right to proceed by the independent action of assumpsit as we stated at one time. The parties can secure relief under the Act where fraud is present, and courts should not hesitate to grant it, although to constitute fraud something more definite than failure to report must appear. There must be evidence of active concealment, or collusion. But in no case should there be a striking off of the entire report; <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>it is basically necessary for the fiscal affairs of the county that the report remain filed though it may be changed in one or more particulars in the proper way.</p>

The controller stated that the Act of June 27, 1895, P. L. 403, was the effective act; it had. been superseded by Section 345 of the General County Law. But this did not cause the reports to be a nullity. The court will take judicial notice of public statutes: <em>Goldberg v. Friedrich, </em><a href="/pa/279/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="279 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="1083437" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0572-01">279 Pa. 572</a>, 574. Furthermore, the statute does not require the controller’s reports to make any particular form of recital. See <em>Godshalk v. Northampton County, </em><a href="/pa/71/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="71 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1031208" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0324-01">71 Pa. 324</a>, 329.

It does not appear just what caused the delay, but this omission to file within the month of January will not prevent the reports from being valid. See <em>Com. ex rel. Fortney v. Wozney, </em><a href="/pa/326/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="326 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="1174419" data-case-paths="/pa/326/0494-01">326 Pa. 494</a>, 497; <em>Com. ex rel. v.

The statute does not indicate or provide that failure to file in that month will nullify all action by the controller. On the contrary, after the month of January has passed the controller can be compelled by mandamus to file his report, if he fails to do so. See <em>Armstrong County v. McKee et al., </em><a href="/pa/172/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="172 Pa. 64" data-case-ids="874098" data-case-paths="/pa/172/0064-01">172 Pa. 64</a>, 67; <em>O’Gara et al., County Comrs., v.

Proceedings for mandamus could not have been instituted until the failure had continued. during the entire month of January, and yet if appellees’ contention were correct any report filed pursuant to such proceedings would not be valid. This is clearly not the <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>law. See <em>Com. ex rel. Kelley v.

The validity of the belated report, however, does not render the controller immune from responsibility for his default. See <em>Deibert v.

Filing with the prothonotary was -filing with the court. He is its appropriate officer. The general practice has been to file the reports of controllers or auditors with that officer.

The papers were found filed in the prothonotary’s office among the records of the court, and the procedure was assumed, without discussion, to be proper. In <em>Armstrong County v.
