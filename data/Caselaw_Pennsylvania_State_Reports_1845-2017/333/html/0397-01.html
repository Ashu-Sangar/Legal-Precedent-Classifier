To stay execution on a tax assessment of $1,406.97, made against plaintiff under section 273 of the Revenue Act of 1926, plaintiff and defendant executed and delivered their bond to W. J. Rothensies as Collector of Internal Revenue, the bond running to him “or to any of his successors in office.” It was conditioned<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> for the payment of $1,406.97 or so much thereof as might not be abated according to law.</p>

Plaintiff also averred that by letter attached to the statement, dated October 1, 1937, the Collector of Internal Revenue had “notified the Defendant of the termination of its liability as surety under said bond.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In support of that position counsel for defendant say — “Of course, the letter from the Collector (Exhibit C, Record, 31a), states that the jeopardy assessment was ‘settled by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,’ but under the <em>Botany Worsted Mills Case </em>[<a href="/us/278/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="278 U.S. 282" data-case-ids="3904681" data-case-paths="/us/278/0282-01">278 U.
