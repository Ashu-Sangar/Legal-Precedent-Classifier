The deposit of these securities in some state in the United States was required under the. insurance laws: see Section 601, Act of May 17, 1921, P. L. 682. The settlor-insurance company, under the agreement, retained absolute dominion and control over the fund, its investment, reinvestment and general management, and reserved an unqualified power to revoke the agreement at any time after the expiration of one year from the date thereof. The only circumstances under which the Girard Trust Company will acquire any degree of control are in the event that (1) the insurance company’s auditors notify the trustee that the reserve is impaired, (2) the company ceases to .do business, or (3) the company fails to satisfy a judgment on a policy claim within a fixed time. None of these contingencies appears to have arisen; the insurance company in fact has at all times exercised absolute control over the fund; and the trustee has merely held custody of the fund, the value of the part involved in these proceedings having been $7,271,908 on the assessment date.</p>

The first part of this section provides that “all personal property of the classes hereinafter enumerated, owned, held or possessed by any person ... or company, resident, located, or liable to taxation within this Commonwealth, or . . . by any . . . bank, or corporation . . . liable to taxation .. . . whether such personal property be owned, held, or possessed ... in his, her, their, or its own right, or as active trustee . . . for the use . . . of any other person . . . company . . . or corporation, —is hereby made taxable annually for county purposes . . .at the rate of four mills. . . . ”</p>

When enumerating the various classes of intangible property to be taxed, and providing for definite exemptions, the legislature no doubt had in mind either its legal inability to subject these exempted intangibles to a tax, or that the exempted intangibles had already been taxed in another form for State purposes. In a word, the legislature wished, among other things, to avoid double taxation. There, are other exemptions noted which cannot be explained on these two grounds, but rest on other policies.</p>

If we were to hold, however, that the tax is against the <em>trustee </em>measured by the gross valúe of the property in the trust, we would subject all the exempted property to <em>tax; </em>and if we were to hold that the words <em>“all </em>securities so held by them” intended to include this exempt property, then, in either case, the words that follow, “as in the case of individuals,” would have no place in the Act.

There are the further questions of whether the legislature intended to include revocable trusts in the class of trusts that are mentioned in the Act, and whether the legislature could include property for tax, the domicile of the real owner being outside of the State and the property here under a deposit or trust that had been ordered and directed by the legislature to be maintained either in this State or some other state.

That the gross premiums tax is clearly the equivalent of a capital stock tax within the meaning of the exemption is evident from a consideration of the legislative purpose underlying both the exemptions and the tax on premiums. In <em>Dupuy v. Johns et al., </em><a href="/pa/261/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="261 Pa. 40" data-case-ids="1042250" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0040-01">261 Pa. 40</a>, at 49, it was stated that the purpose of the legislature in enacting the exemption clauses was to divide corporations into two groups: “(1) Those doing no business, making no official reports, and paying no capital stock tax in Pennsylvania, upon the stock of which resident shareholders must pay a tax; (2) Those which are bona fide engaged in business here, report to the auditor general, and are either liable to a state tax on capital stock or relieved therefrom by the laws of the Commonwealth, the stock of which is exempt in the hands of resident shareholders.” It was held in that case that the purpose was not solely to prevent double taxation, and that therefore it was immaterial that a foreign corporation paid a tax on but a small portion of the capital represented by its shares. When the capital stock tax on foreign corporations was replaced by the franchise tax, which afforded a fairer basis of taxation, this Court held in <em>Arrott’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/322/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="322 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="1167890" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0367-01">322 Pa. 367</a>, that the franchise tax was equivalent to the capital stock tax within the meaning of the personal property tax exemptions. The effect of these decisions is that when a foreign corporation brings itself within the class of corporations doing business within this State, reporting to <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>the auditor general, and liable to a State tax which is in lieu of or equivalent to a capital stock tax, it brings itself and its shares within the exemptions of the personal property tax Act. While the gross premiums tax is not measured by capital stock value, it has been adopted by the legislature as the fairest way to obtain an equivalent taxation of foreign insurance corporations, and as one which bears a substantial relation to the tax paid by similar domestic corporations. We therefore conclude that the gross premium tax of two per cent is equivalent to the capital stock and premium tax paid by other insurance companies within the spirit and purpose of the exemption provisions.</p>
    <p id="b169-3" data-blocks='[["BL_169.4",169,[124,1070,1155,1354]],["BL_170.1",170,[289,356,1147,305]]]'>The only matter requiring further elucidation is whether in applying this Act appellant under the circumstances here related is to be considered the owner of the securities. Under the agreement the Girard Trust Company is acting merely as custodian of the securities. Until one of the specified contingencies occurs, this is virtually a deposit for safekeeping, with appellant exercising complete control and dominion over the securities, including the right to terminate the agreement, and receiving the full benefits thereof. The. purpose of this arrangement was to comply with this state’s statutory requirement that an insurance company of a foreign nation deposit somewhere in this country a portion of its reserve funds sufficient to cover its outstanding United States liabilities, so that those having just claims against it will not have to look beyond the seas for their satisfaction. Such , an arrangement does not create an active trust setting up a fund separate and distinct from the capital assets of the company for a purpose other than that for which they would be used if retained by the company. No one could contend that the reserve funds of an insurance company in its own hands constitute an active trust. In the instant case, the funds held by the Girard Trust Company ás a deposit to protect United States creditors and policyholders still are as much a <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>part of the capital assets of appellant as if they were in their own hands, subject to its complete control and dominion, and are to be considered as owned by it within the meaning of the tax statute. Appellant is therefore exempt from paying a four mill tax on the property it owns.</p>

No tax is imposed by Pennsylvania on this foreign corporation for the privilege of doing business here except the gross profits tax referred to in the majority opinion, which tax is imposed on <em>all </em>foreign corporations doing business here. This particular foreign corporation, in addition to doing business in Pennsylvania, <em>creates a trust </em>and names a trustee here <em>for its benefit in all the states of the Union. </em>Our Taxing Act of 1913, P. L. 507, imposes a tax on “all personal property of the classes hereinafter enumerated . . . whether such personal property be owned, held or possessed by such person or persons, ... or corporations in his, her, their or its own right, or <em>as active trustee, agent, attorney in fact, </em>or in any other capacity, <em>for the use, benefit or advantage of a/ny other person, persons, ... or corporation.” </em>(Italics supplied.)

The answer to this contention is that there is not a particle of evidence in this record that the trust res in question consists of “property specifically exempted by the Act.” For all we know the property may consist of bonds of the British government or of cash or of something else. Under the indenture of August 29, 1911, the Assurance Corporation “transfers” to the Girard Trust Company “all moneys, funds, securities and real estate enumerated in the schedule attached” to the indenture. What this property may consist of at the present time nowhere appears in the record, and it would not make the slightest difference if it did appear. The State of Pennsylvania has not the slightest concern with the composition of the subjects of trust property held for a specific legal or business purpose. When any kind of property is delivered to a Pennsylvania trustee for a certain purpose, that property becomes under our law a subject of taxation. If, for example, Pennsylvania taxed the deposits with clerks of the courts, of cash or of securities as <em>bail, </em>as Pennsylvania has the power to do, it would not make the slightest difference in the taxability of such deposits whether they consisted of “tax exempt securities” or not. They would not be taxed as securities, <em>they would be tawed as bail. </em>Their status as tax exempt securities would merge in their new status. In the instant case the Girard Trust Company is not taxed on “tax exempt securities” held by it; it is taxed on <em>property </em>held, by it as trustee. Whether the property so held as trustee consists of British bonds or pounds, or American bonds or dollars, is immaterial. The thing <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>so held for a specific business and legal function constitutes “property,” and that is all that is required to make it under our law taxable in the hands, of the trustee.</p>

Since the Assurance Corporation voluntarily exercises the privilege accorded it of depositing certain property in Pennsylvania so that it may do an insurance business in the several states of the Union, it is only reasonable and just that the corporation should compensate this Commonwealth for the privilege so exercised. If an American citizen deposited either with a trustee or in a safe deposit box in Great Britain certain cash or securities owned by him, he could have no cause for complaint if the British government taxed him something for the protection it accorded his property. The powers to tax and the duty to protect are correlative. Even a mere custodian of property is entitled to be compensated for his custody.</p>

S. 204</a>, 212, “Taxation is an intensely practical matter.” Since a decedent’s intangible personal property may be actually in different jurisdictions but since in the majority of instances most of that property has its situs where he has his domicile, the practical rule is to assess inheritance taxes on intangible property at the owner’s domicile. A leading case on this subject is <em>Farmers Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Minnesota </em><a href="/us/280/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="280 U.S. 204" data-case-ids="3910985" data-case-paths="/us/280/0204-01">(supra).</a> In that case the decedent resided in New York and at the time of his death and long previously thereto he had owned and kept within that state negotiable bonds and certificates of indebtedness issued by Minnesota and certain cities in that state. The Supreme Court, after pointing out that none of these securities “had any connection with business carried on by or for decedent in Minnesota,” held that Minnesota could not legally assess “an inheritance tax upon the same testamentary transfer.” The Supreme Court, however, declared in that case that “choses in action may acquire a situs for taxation other than at the domicile of their owner if they have become integral parts of some local business” (citing <em>New Orleans v.

The United States Supreme Court in recent decisions has given clear recognition of the fact that intangible personal property may be localized for purposes of taxation in a state other than the owner’s domicile.

Fox, State Tax Comr., </em><a href="/us/298/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="298 U.S. 193" data-case-ids="1486355" data-case-paths="/us/298/0193-01">298 U.

The language of Chief Justice Hughes’ opinion, speaking for the court in that case, is as follows: “Our conclusion is that appellant has failed to show that West Virginia in laying the tax [on the Delaware corporation’s bank deposits and accounts receivable in West Virginia] has transcended the limits of its jurisdiction and thus deprived appellant of its property without due process of law.” The court said further: “The decision in the instant case, . . . is . . . that the statutes require taxation in West Virginia . . . <em>only of such intangibles as upon the facts and the lata, according to the course of business, may be deemed to be toithin the jurisdiction of the State.” </em>(Italics supplied.) This was an emphatic recognition of the right of a state to tax <em>intangibles </em>which according to the course of business are <em>toithin the jurisdiction of the taxing state. </em>In the light of this recent decision of the United States Supreme Court, it is incomprehensible to the writer of this opinion how the tax Pennsylvania imposes on the intangibles held “according to the course of business” by the Girard Trust Company as trustee and within the confines of this State is in conflict with the due process clause of the 14th Amendment as the Supreme Court of the United States interprets it.</p>

S. 88</a>, the United States Supreme Court upheld the validity of a tax imposed by the State of Maryland upon stocks and bonds held by a Maryland trustee for a resident of Virginia. The Maryland statute imposed a personal property tax on property “held in trust for the benefit of another.” In that case the Supreme Court said: “Manifestly, the securities are subject to taxation in Maryland where they are in the actual possession of the Trust Company — holder of the legal title. . . <em>.: De Caney v.

But the general rule must yield to established fact of legal ownership, actual presence and control elsewhere, and ought not to be applied if so to do would result in inescapable and patent injustice, whether through double taxation or otherwise: <em>State Board of Assessors v.

The donor reserved to himself power of revocation but, without exercising it, died in 1920. I fail to see how the irrevocability of the trust affected its taxability in the slightest degree. The Supreme Court upheld the right of Maryland to tax these securities, saying “that they are property within Maryland is not questioned.” It appears to me that that was the pivotal fact in the case, to wit, that the property was localized in Maryland. In the instant case the trust <em>was </em>revocable, but the important point is that <em>until the trust was revoked, the property was localised in Pennsylvania. </em>That the trust may be revoked <em>next </em>year and the property therefore be no longer localized in Pennsylvania does not affect the power of Pennsylvania to tax the <em>currently localised </em>property <em>this </em>year.</p>

That case is so clearly distinguishable from the instant case that it should be regarded as of no controlling influence here. In the first place, the tax complained of in that case was a tax on an <em>inheritance; </em>here it is a tax on <em>property. . </em>The courts, as herein-before pointed out, have uniformly held that a tax on the transfer of a decedent’s estate should be imposed only by the state of the owner’s domicile. Both the logical and practical reasons for this are apparent. The transfer of intangible personal property is in law actually made in the state of the decedent’s domicile and it is manifestly appropriate that the transfer tax should <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>be imposed there. In <em>Lines’s Estate </em>this court, in upholding the assessment of an inheritance tax by Pennsylvania on all of Lines’s property, said: “The manifest purpose of our collateral inheritance tax law is to subject property, limited by deed in the manner stated in the statute, to taxation, because it is still substantially the property of the grantor, and does not actually pass, nor is it intended to pass to the collateral beneficiaries until his death, and hence it is essentially similar in that respect to a devolution of property by testacy or intestacy upon the death of the owner.” However, in the opinion in that case, this court, quoting from <em>Orcutt’s </em>Appeal, <a href="/pa/97/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="97 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="444784" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0179-01">97 Pa. 179</a>, recognized the fact that “for particular purposes some species of personalty may have a situs, distinct from the legal one.” In Orcutt’s Appeal this court, in justifying the assessing of an inheritance tax on all the personal property owned by a decedent resident in Pennsylvania, said: “The [inheritance] tax doe's not attach to the very articles of property of which the deceased died possessed. It is imposed only on what remains for distribution after expenses of administration, debts and rightful claims of third parties are paid or provided for. It is on the net succession to the beneficiaries and not on the securities in which the estate of the decedent was invested: <em>Commonwealth’s </em>Appeal, 10 Casey 204; <em>Strode v. </em>Commonwealth, 2 P. F. Smith 181.”</p>

      <em>Lines’s Estate </em>is further distinguished from the instant case by the fact that in that case, though the New York Trust Company which had custody of certain of Lines’s stocks and bonds had “legal title to the securities,” the securities were, as this court pointed out, “the personal property of Mr. Lines. They were his to enjoy during his lifetime.” “The naked legal title acquired by the grantee” was described by this court as “the merest shadow.” In the instant case the personal property of the Assurance Corporation deposited by it with the Girard Trust Company was decidedly not “its to en<a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>joy” as long as it wished to qualify to carry on business in the United States, unless it chose to substitute for the personal property so deposited other personal property of equal value. Furthermore, the indenture of trust between the appellant and the Assurance Corporation did not create a “naked legal title” of the “merest shadow.” This indenture of trust was created by a mandate of law as a prerequisite to the doing of business by the corporation in this country (see Act of May 17, 1921, P. L. 682, art. YI, sec. 601, 40 PS 721), and “for the protection of the policyholders of the” Assurance Corporation “in the United States of America,” and as “a reserve fund sufficient to comply with the laws of the several states into which the corporation may now or in the future be admitted for the transaction of business.” The situs of these securities was fixed <em>in this Gommomoealth </em>by the <em>voluntary </em>act of the Assurance Corporation and for its benefit. These securities are in this State for a particular purpose. They are actually “working” here, i. e., performing a definite and important legal function in the interest of this Scotch Assurance Corporation. Our laws require their deposit <em>in some state. </em>Their actual situs is the state selected by the Assurance Corporation. That state happens to be Pennsylvania. Judge Rice in <em>Singer v.

In this court’s opinion in that case, a contrast is drawn between inheritance tax cases where the intangible personal property is held to be assessable at the domicile of the decedent and cases where the personal property of a decedent had an “actual situs in this state.” Reference was particularly made in Justice Brown’s opinion in that case to the decision of this court in <em>Small’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/151/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="151 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="836645" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0001-01">151 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20A.%2023" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="25 A. 23">25 A. 23</a>. In this last named case this court said: “The general question presented is whether the interest in said partnership association [of York County, Pennsylvania] held by the testator [a resident of Maryland] at the time of his decease, viz., 150 shares capital stock valued at $150,000, or any part thereof, was subject to the payment of collateral inheritance tax under the laws of this state?” This court held it was taxable here and quoted with approval the following from <em>Hoyt v.

In that case Circuit Judge Taft, after quoting the general rule that the situs of personal property is that of the owner, said, speaking for the court: “Certain exceptions to this rule are recognized.

To contend that because the property actually placed in Pennsylvania for a definite business purpose, to wit, to enable this foreign Assurance Corporation to issue policies of insurance in <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>the United States, has not actually been drawn upon to pay claims and that therefore it has performed no function here and has no “business situs” here is as unsound as it would be to contend that a battleship stationed at some strategic point in time of war for a military purpose performed no function in that war because it was never called upon to engage the enemy in actual battle. The property the Assurance Corporation localized in Philadelphia has been performing an important business function there ever since it was so localized. If it had not been there or somewhere else in the United States, the Assurance Corporation would not have dared to write a single insurance policy “in most of the States” of the Union. Appellant says in its paper book: “The laws of most of the States and of Pennsylvania require that such a foreign insurance company shall maintain a deposit somewhere in the United States in an amount equal at least to that required of local companies. See Act of May 17, 1921, P. L. 682, sec. 601; 40 PS sec. 721. There is no requirement that the deposit shall be maintained in any particular state. It is sufficient as long as it is in one of the United States.” That this property may, in case of the foreign corporation’s default in the payment of any claim under its policies, be called upon to perform <em>additional business functions </em>does not alter the fact that it <em>has been performing here important business functions from the very day it was deposited in Pennsylvania.</em>

There may be states where such property in the hands of a trustee would not be taxable at all; I believe that appellant’s counsel so intimated in his oral argument. With that situation in other states, Pennsylvania would have no concern. Pennsylvania simply declares that all personal property in the hands of Pennsylvania trustees or agents or attorneys in fact <em>shall be taxed. </em>The Assurance Corporation placed a portion of its personal property, for the corporation’s own benefit, in the hands of a <em>Pennsylvania </em>trustee; the property is actually <em>here </em>and performing a function <em>here </em>which is useful to the Assurance Corporation all over the United States and which therefore increases the profits of the corporation at its corporate situs in Scotland. It follows that the property is therefore taxable exactly as would be the personal property of any other foreign citizen who might for his own good reasons establish a trust in Pennsylvania. The property is not taxed because the foreign Assurance Corporation is doing business in this state; it would be taxed exactly the same <em>if that corporation never did business here and never proposed to do business here. </em>This foreign Assurance Corporation, having paid a tax or fee for the privilege of doing an insurance business in Pennsylvania, cannot justly or legally claim that that fee also entitles it to send any part or all of its personal property to a trustee in Pennsylvania, there to be protected by this Commonwealth, without any further compensation to this State by way of taxes on property which clearly comes within the description of taxable personal property in this State’s taxing statute. Since Pennsylvania is according the corporation’s property a protection which <em>otherwise </em>Great Britain or some American state other than Pennsylvania would be called upon to accord it, I can see no reason whatsoever <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>why tliis State should exempt this property from taxation and I can find no Pennsylvania statute which makes any attempt so to exempt it.</p>
