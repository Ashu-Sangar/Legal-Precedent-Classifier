Plaintiff deposited the note in a New York bank for collection, which sent it for that purpose to the First National Bank of Scranton. The maker gave instructions that the note was to be presented at the Third National <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>Bank &amp; Trust Company of Scranton, where it maintained an account. Accordingly, at three o’clock of the day on which the note matured, the First National sent the note, in the hands of a notary public, to the Third National for payment. There were ample funds of the maker on hand there with which to make payment, and, acting on telephone instructions from the maker, the assistant cashier of the Third National wrote on the note the letters “O.K.,” to which he added his initials. It was then handed back to the notary, who returned with it to the First National. Just as he arrived there he found that the Third National was informing the First National by telephone that the maker had called up and stated that it did not want the note paid or O.K.’d, and was therefore requesting the First National to erase the “O.K.” This was done by the notary, who then protested the note on the alleged ground that answer had been made “Not provided for,” and the First National returned the note to the New York bank as dishonored. When plaintiff, some time later, learned of what had taken place, it brought the present action against the two Scranton banks, — against the Third National on the theory that it had made itself liable by its certification of the note, and against the First National for the reason that it had breached its duty as plaintiff’s agent. The learned trial judge, who heard the case without a jury, gave judgment in favor of defendants. On appeal to the Superior Court the judgment was affirmed as to the First National but reversed as to the Third National, and entry of judgment against the latter was directed: <a href="/pa-super/132/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="132 Pa. Super. 421" data-case-ids="1010351" data-case-paths="/pa-super/132/0421-01">132 Pa. Superior Ct. 421</a>. An allocatur being allowed, there are now before us two appeals, the one by plaintiff because of the rejection of its claim against the First National, and the other by the Third National because of the judgment against it. Plaintiff admits that if the judgment against the Third National is sustained its appeal in regard to the First National must be dismissed, and since we have reached the conclusion that <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>the entry of judgment against the Third National was properly ordered by the Superior Court it will be unnecessary to discuss plaintiff’s appeal.</p>
    <p id="b413-3" data-blocks='[["BL_413.4",413,[129,521,1156,1411]]]'>The Third National Bank is obliged at the outset to admit that in the presentation of the note for payment the First National was plaintiff’s agent. Whatever may have been the law prior to 1931, the Bank Collection Act of that year, P. L. 568, provides, section 2, that “where an item is deposited or received for collection, the bank of deposit shall be agent of the depositor for its collection, and each subsequent collecting bank shall be sub-agent of the depositor.” Defendant (Third National Bank) must also concede that, while the notary acted as a public official in the performance of his duty of protesting the note, in presenting it for payment he was merely the private agent of plaintiff or of the First National or of both, and as to that operation was the same as any other messenger who might have been employed for the purpose: <em>Bellemire v. Bank of the United States, </em><a href="/whart/4/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Whart. 105" data-case-ids="1834975" data-case-paths="/whart/4/0105-01">4 Wharton 105</a>, 113; <em>Parke v.

Williamson, </em><a href="/citations/?q=13%20Phila.%20140" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="13 Phila. 140">13 Phila. Rep. 140</a>. It follows, — and to this extent also defendant acquiesces,— that, if the Third National had paid the note in cash, such payment to the notary would have been payment to the First National and therefore to plaintiff, and the money thus paid would not have been recoverable by the Third National or by the maker in the absence of fraud or mistake; there is no pretense that such elements were here present.</p>
    <p id="b413-4" data-blocks='[["BL_413.5",413,[131,1942,1153,482]],["BL_414.1",414,[279,350,1152,2066]],["BL_415.1",415,[113,356,1153,755]]]'>Defendant’s position on this appeal is thus reduced to the contention that there is a difference in legal effect between paying in cash and writing “O.K.” upon a note. Defendant argues that the First National, as collecting bank, was unauthorized to accept payment in any other medium than money, that the O.K.ing of the note was merely an offer to the First National as plaintiff’s agent to accept payment in that form, that until such offer was accepted it was revocable, and that it was in fact re<a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>voked with the acquiescence of the First National. This view of the case, plausible as it may superficially appear, overlooks the vital fact that . a. practice existed among Scranton banks whereby, instead of negotiable instruments being paid in cash upon presentation at the bank where payable, they were, marked “O.K.,” with the added initials of the proper official, and were turned in by the collecting bank the next day for payment through the clearing house as an obligation of the certifying bank. The trial judge, upon adequate evidence, found that such a local custom existed, and that, in accordance with it, the writing of the letters “O.K.” on negotiable paper was treated by the banks as the equivalent of a certification that the instrument was good and would be paid on the following day. through the clearing house. Of course, it is ordinarily true that an agent is without authority to accept anything except legal tender for the debt of his principal, but in selecting a bank as collecting agent a depositor is bound by any reasonable usage, whether known to him or not, which prevails among the banks at the place where the collection is to be made: see <em>Jennings v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em><a href="/us/294/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="294 U.S. 216" data-case-ids="3925380" data-case-paths="/us/294/0216-01">294 U. S. 216</a>, 220. This has been written into the statute law of the State in the Bank Collection Act of 1931, P. L. 568, section 9 of which provides that “Where ordinary care is exercised, any agent collecting bank may receive in payment of an item without becoming responsible as debtor therefor . . . such method of settlement as may be customary in a local clearing house or between clearing banks or otherwise.” A collecting bank is not obliged to exercise the right thus given, but here the First National did follow the custom by sending the notary without instructions to demand cash; in the myriad of transactions occurring daily between banks it must be presumed that they are intended to be conducted in conformity with prevailing practices unless thére be some expression to the contrary. The notary was sent to the Third National to obtain,, not cash, but the usual <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>“O.K.„ in accordance with the custom, and, when he received it, and with the O. K.’d note in his hand stepped away from the teller’s window of the Third National, the transaction was completed as to all the parties concerned. The O.K.ing of the note was not an offer by the Third National to the First National to give a certification instead of cash, but rather an acceptance by the Third National of the application of the First National that, in accordance with the banking custom, the note should be certified. This being done, there was nothing further for the First National to do or to say; any optional power it had possessed to demand cash was waived when its messenger was sent to handle the transaction according to the customary mode of procedure.</p>

The certification works an automatic transfer of the amount of the check from the account of the maker to the credit of the payee.
