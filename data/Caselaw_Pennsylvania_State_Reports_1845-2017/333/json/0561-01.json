        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Kephart,\nThe auditing judge allowed appellee\u2019s claim against the estate of Herman H. Conrad, deceased, for $10,000 upon a sealed judgment note dated May 26, 1916. On the exceptions filed thereto by the residuary legatee, the court en banc awarded an issue to the common pleas to determine whether the decedent executed and delivered the note, and if there was any consideration therefor. The jury answered the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative. The court below declined to accept the verdict, but the exceptions were dismissed and the claim allowed on the theory that, since the note was under seal, no consideration was necessary, and appellant had failed to establish the defenses of fraud, forgery or payment.\nThe instrument upon which the claim in the present case is based is a negotiable promissory note under seal. It is well settled that a seal imports consideration. This is more than a mere presumption; the seal takes the place of proof of consideration and in the absence of fraud makes the promise enforceable without it. The defense of want of consideration is not available in an action on a sealed instrument: Yard v. Patton, 13 Pa. 278. This is true of sealed negotiable instruments as well as bonds and deeds. Where, however, there is evidence of fraud upon the maker, the seal will be disregarded and proof of consideration will be required.\nFailure of consideration, on the other hand, is a valid defense to a sealed instrument. The distinction between want and failure of consideration has been pointed out in a number of cases. The defense of failure of consideration, relied upon by appellant, is unavailing. It does not appear from anything properly in the record that, apart from the seal, circumstances existed from which consideration could be inferred, and the note itself recites none. The only evidence offered is a letter written by appellee\u2019s attorney to the corporate executor, wherein it was stated that the note was given \u201cin payment of services rendered over a long period of years by the payee to Herman H. Conrad and wife in connection with their refreshment stand. ...\u201d This refreshment stand was owned and operated by decedent\u2019s wife, and appellee\u2019s services therein were of very slight value. It is not shown that the note was given therefor.\nThe letter of the attorney, without proof of his authority, is neither competent nor adequate to show failure of consideration. While an attorney has power to bind his client by his admissions and acts in the course of suit, or in management of the regular course of litigation, his statements or admissions out of court and not made in the conduct of litigation are generally not binding upon his client in the absence of express authority. Without the letter the record is barren of any evideuce to show failure of consideration. The finding of the jury in the Common Pleas Court \u201cthat there was no consideration\u201d would not be conclusive of that question, nor would it be proof of it. Even if it could be so treated, the court below was within its undoubted right to disregard it as a finding. The award of such an issue being discretionary, the court is not bound to accept the verdict.\nAppellee faces a more difficult problem, and one which prevents recovery, in the defense Of payment. Where no action is taken to collect a debt due on a specialty until twenty years has elapsed, although there is no statute of limitations for specialties such as sealed instruments, debts and decrees of record, a legal presumption arises, from delay itself, that the debt has been paid; the obligee must then show that payment was not made. In the present case the note lacks less than one year of twenty to raise this complete presumption. However, it is well established that, where there is a long delay, presumption of payment of a sealed instrument may arise in a period less than twenty years if there is a factual basis to support it other than the delay. The lapse of time combined with other circumstances is evidence from which a presumption of fact may arise that payment has been made. Hughes v. Hughes, 54 Pa. 240, contains a clear statement of this rule. That was an action on a sealed instrument nineteen years old. The Court said, at p. 242: \u201cThat a complete legal presumption of payment of a bond or other instrument of like nature does not arise short of twenty years is well settled; but it has also been well-settled that a shorter period aided by circumstances which contribute to strengthen the presumption of a payment from lapse of time may be submitted to a jury as grounds for the presumption of the fact of payment. [Citations.] Slight circumstances may be given in evidence for that purpose in proportion as the presumption strengthens by the lapse of time; but still they must be such as aid the presumption arising from time. They must be, as it is said, persuasive that the time would not have been suffered to elapse had the debt remained unpaid.\u201d\nNo fixed rule of substantive law or evidence can be laid down as to the scope, quality or quantity of the additional circumstances necessary to support the presumption of payment arising from a delay of less than twenty years. Each case depends upon its individual circumstances. Such proof as the debtor\u2019s ability to pay during that period, or, a statement of the creditor or obligee that the debt was paid, or it was regarded as not owing, or he had destroyed the note, have been held sufficient in conjunction with the lapse of a long period of years before bringing suit. Hess v. Frankenfield, 106 Pa. 440, is a case, closely analogous to the instant one, where the note was nineteen years old and the additional circumstances were that the obligee had executed releases to the obligor-in receipt for his distributive share of an estate, and had settled with him several times for other claims without attempting to set up the stale claim against him. ' Also in Morrison v. Collins, 127 Pa. 28, it was shown that the obligee had paid sums of money to the obligor after the note was due and had stated that there had been a settlement of all other affairs. Similar facts existed in Miller\u2019s Estate, 188 Pa. 214.\nWhere the enforcement of a claim on a specialty has been delayed for a long time, any circumstance which shows conduct on the part of the obligee inconsistent with the existence of the debt as a valid claim, will, with the delay, support the inference that the obligation has been paid. As we have heretofore stated, the corroborative circumstances take on greater significance with the passage of time after the maturity of the obligation, and in a case like the present one, involving a stale claim against an estate, slight additional evidence is required.\nThere are a number of circumstances, which, with the delay of nineteen years, create a factual presumption of payment. In 1930 the decedent, the obligor in the note, obtained a judgment of $300 against appellee upon the latter\u2019s note, which judgment was paid by appellee. After the maturity of the $10,000 note, appellee obligee received and turned over to the decedent obligor large sums of money (at one time, $4,500) as his share in his wife\u2019s estate, of which decedent and appellee were co-executors, and no attempt was made to assert any claim against these payments. Obligee paid obligor monthly sums of money due to him from properties leased. There was no evidence of any demand made for payment during the lifetime of the decedent although he lived eighth een years after the note matured. All of this is not oniy inconsistent with the existence of a valid debt on the long overdue note for $10,000 but would conclusively show payment. There is nothing in the record that would rebut this factual presumption.\nThis Couit has frequently stated that where a claim which could have been made against a decedent during his lifetime is not presented until after his death, it is viewed with the greatest suspicion. Normally, creditors and obligees are prompt to assert their claims and press them during the lifetime of the debtor. It is only natural that the courts should lend their assistance to the representatives of a decedent to compel claimants who fail to do so to establish their claims beyond reasonable doubt.\nDecree reversed; appellee\u2019s claim disallowed, costs to be paid by appellee.\nGrubb v.

Had there been any impeachment, however slight, of the fairness of the assignments, we would have required full proof of consideration: ...\u201d And see: Twitchell v. McMurtie, 77 Pa. 383; Jeffers et al. v. Babis, 304 Pa. 282.\nIn Killeen\u2019s Estate, 310 Pa. 182, at 187, it was said: \u201cThere is, however, a distinction between want and failure of consideration: want of consideration embraces transactions or instances where none was intended to pass, while failure of consideration implies that a valuable consideration, moving from obligee to obligor, was contemplated: Meek v. Frantz, 171 Pa. 632. Want of consideration is no defense, as this would contradict the terms of the instrument, while failure of consideration does not contradict the terms of the instrument, but shows that the consideration contemplated was never received.\u201d To the same effect see: Yard v. Patton, 13 Pa. 278, 284; Piper v. Queeney, 282 Pa. 135, 142; Homer B. & L. Assn. v. Noble, 120 Pa. Superior Ct. 153, 156; Gsell, to use, v. Herman, 108 Pa. Superior Ct. 258, 261.\nSwartz v.

Superior Ct. 71, where the court refused to admit in evidence a letter of defendant\u2019s counsel containing expressions inconsistent with his client\u2019s ease, stating at page 77: \u201cIt would be an intolerable rule if it were to be held that the rights of clients could be divested by loose expressions of their attorneys made under the circumstances disclosed in the evidence in this case.\u201d See also: Malone v.
