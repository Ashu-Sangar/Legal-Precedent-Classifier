If the operation of the plant does, become a nuisance in fact, appellants have their remedy, either by a new proceeding or under the present bill, of which the court below will retain jurisdiction.\nThe other questions raised have been , passed upon in support of the decree of the court below in Sheets et al. v. Armstrong et al., 307 Pa. 385, and other decisions.\nThe erection and operation of the incinerator plant by the City was in its proprietary capacity. See Gemmill v. Calder et al., 332 Pa. 281. This latter case could not have been decided as it was if such had not been the holding. This, however, does not affect the conclusion reached in the present case.\nDecree affirmed at appellants\u2019 cost.",
