        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Stern,\nThis case turns upon a letter written to plaintiff by his broker and friend Morris L. Parrish under dat\u00e9 of March 13, 1930. Was it clear and unambiguous?' Or was it of such dubious meaning that it required oral evidence as the guide, and \u00e1 jury as the tribunal, for its interpretation?\nPlaintiff carried a collateral loan account with defendant company. During the winter of 1929-30 h\u00e9 w\u00e1s in Europe. On January 8, 1930, Parrish cabled him at Paris: \u201cMiss Yackey ne\u00e9ds fifteen thousand her account Pennsylvania Company. Do you feel like helping her?\u201d No answer being received, on January 14 Parrish cabled to\u25a0 him again at London: \u201cMay we have deposited fifte\u00e9n thousand for Miss Yackey at Pennsylvania Company? Answer quickly\u201d\u2019 The Miss Yackey referred to in these messages had been employed in \u00e1n editorial capacity on the Ladies Home Journal, of which plaintiff had been editor-in-chief. Parrish had acted as her broker on two or three occasions, having been originally recommended to her in that capacity by plaintiff. Miss Yackey had a collateral loan account at the Pennsylvania Company.\nOn February 13 plaintiff wrote to Parrish from Rome, explaining that the latter\u2019s cable had been delayed almost a week in transit and he had assumed \u201cit was then too late to do anything.\u201d He added, however, that \u201chad I been home I could have taken care of it, and would gladly have done so,\u201d and that he had heard from a friend of Miss Yackey that \u201cshe had been taken care of and that everything was working out all right. This was good to hear. It was fine, of you to have come to her rescue as you did.\u201d\nDue to a rise in the market, or for some other reason, the Pennsylvania Company withdrew its demand upon Miss Yackey for additional margin at that time, but in March gave notice that it required further collateral from her to the extent of $6,000. Parrish thereupon assumed the responsibility of requesting defendant to transfer from plaintiff\u2019s account fifty shares of American Can Company common stock, then worth about $7,000, to Miss Yackey\u2019s account at the Pennsylvania .Company, and defendant acceded to this request upon receiving from Parrish his written guaranty against any loss it might sustain by reason thereof. Parrish then wrote to plaintiff, at Naples, the letter of March 18 which is the subject of the present controversy, and the relevant portions of which are as follows: \u201cThe Pennsylvania Company at first decided that they would carry Miss Yackey\u2019s account, at any rate until your return. They have now taken over the Colonial Trust Company, and in order to get their house in order before, the combination takes place, they have asked her for $6,000 additional collateral. Geiger [a vice president of defendant company] has stated that he would deposit 50 shares of American Can stock of yours with them on my guarantee. This I have given him, so the matter can rest until your return. ... I hope you will approve of what I did for Miss Yackey. I will take care of it if you do not.\u201d\nOn April 11 plaintiff wrote to Parrish from Paris: \u201cThat was all right about that American Can for Miss Yackey, but isn\u2019t the market high enough for her to lighten down a bit? Do you. notice where Indian Territory and Vanadium is?\u201d\nNotwithstanding the aid thus given to Miss Yackey\u2019s account, the Pennsylvania Company was obliged to sell put her collateral in 1986, including the American Can stock, and leaving a debit balance due the Pennsylvania Company.\nThe present suit was brought in trespass for conversion of plaintiff\u2019s stock. The defense was that although Parrish did not originally have authority to request defendant to transfer the stock to Miss Yackey\u2019s account, plaintiff ratified the transaction in his letter of April 11. Plaintiff, on the other hand, while apparently admitting, as he must, that this letter was, on the face.,of it, a ratification, contends that he was not bound by it for two reasons \u2014 the one, because he did not know at that time how weak Miss Yackey\u2019s account was, and the other, because he interpreted the Parrish letter of March 13 to mean that Parrish had given to defendant his guaranty to protect, not defendant, but him\u25a0, plaintiff, against loss. The learned trial judge left to the jury the question of determining what the letters between the parties \u201cfairly mean, giving to the language of the letters the ordinary and customary meaning of the words as used.\u201d The court also affirmed a point presented by plaintiff to the effect that if the Parrish letter \u201ccould reasonably be understood by plaintiff to mean that plaintiff was guaranteed by Parrish against any loss in connection with the delivery of his said shares of stock of the American Can Company and that it was so understood by plaintiff, then the jury may find that the letter by plaintiff to Morris L. Parrish, dated April 11,1930, was not a ratification of the defendant\u2019s act in delivering plaintiff\u2019s stock, without plaintiff\u2019s knowledge or consent, to another party, and that plaintiff had no true or full knowledge of the facts of the transaction when he wrote such letter, which is offered as a ratification in behalf of the defendant.\u201d The jury found for plaintiff and the court overruled defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v.\nPlaintiff neither does nor can contend that the Parrish letter contained any misstatements or deliberately concealed any facts. He complains, rather, as he himself \u00a1expressed it ip his testimony, that \u201cI never dreamed the account [Miss Yackey\u2019s account] was in such shape that it was, or it was as large a loan.\u201d It is undoubtedly a general principle of law that a person affirming a transaction, made on his behalf but without his authority, may avoid' the effect of his ratification if at the time he was ignorafit of material facts-: Daley v. Iselin, 218 Pa. 515, 518; Shields v. Hitchman, 251 Pa. 455, 459, 460; Culbertson v. Cook, 308 Pa. 557, 564, 565; Simonin\u2019s Sons, Inc., v. American Credit Indemnity Co., 318 Pa. 160, 164. But there is an equally well-recognized limitation of this doctrine to the effect that \u201cA principal can . . . ratify the unauthorized act of his agent without full knowledge of all material facts connected with it if he intentionally and deliberately does so, knowing that he does not possess such knowledge and does not care to make further inquiry into the matter\u201d: Pollock v. Standard Steel Car Co., 230 Pa. 136, 141. It is inferred from a ratification under such circumstances that the principal is willing to assume the risk of facts as to which he knows he is ignorant. In the present case, when plaintiff wrote to Parrish: \u201cThat was all right about that American Can for Miss Yackey,\u201d he must have known that the risk he was taking depended upon the condition of her account and the value of her collateral. He could have sought information upon those matters before deciding whether or not to ratify; if he chose not to do so, he cannot now, upon that ground, repudiate his action.\nPlaintiff alleges that he misunderstood the purport of the statement that Parrish had given to Geiger \u201cmy [Parrish\u2019s] guarantee.\u201d His contention that this was ambiguous is, in our opinion, wholly untenable. We cannot find in the letter any difficulty of construction which justified the trial judge in permitting plaintiff to testify as to his interpretation and in submitting to the jury the question of the reasonableness of such interpretation. We think that its language was plain, and that, therefore, as in the case of all written instruments, it was the function of the court to declare and apply its meaning. We cannot understand how the words \u201cGeiger has stated that he would deposit 50 shares of American Can stock of yours with them on my guarantee. This I have given him . . . \u201d \u25a0 could reasonably be understood to mean that the guaranty was for the protection, not of Geiger\u2019s company, the defendant, but of plaintiff. To give someone a guaranty means, in ordinary English speech, to guarantee that person against something. \u201cI gave A my guaranty\u201d means that I guaranteed A, and it would take additional language to make it mean \u201cI gave A. my guaranty in favor of B.\u201d Moreover, the concluding sentences of the letter: \u201cI hope you will approve of what I did for Miss Yackey. I will take care of it if you, do not,\u201d would have little, if any, meaning if plaintiff\u2019s interpretation were to be adopted, because, if Parrish were giving a guaranty to plaintiff, Parrish, not plaintiff,, would Jbe.\u201ctaking care\u201d of the transaction even if plaintiff did approve of- it.\u201d And yet Parrish\u2019s statement was that he, Parrish, would \u201ctake care of it\u201d only if plaintiff did not approve, the necessary corollary being that if plaintiff did approve Parrish\u2019s responsibility would cease.\nSeveral witnesses testified on behalf of defendant that after plaintiff\u2019s return from Europe he did not seek to revoke his ratification until just before the present suit was started, which was nearly six years later, but plaintiff insists that he made continued protests. This controversy is of no consequence. Since the ratification in his letter of April 11 was legally binding upon him he could not afterwards rescind it.\nJudgment reversed and here entered for defendant.\nMr. Justice Linn did not participate in the decision of this case.\nThere was no doubt as to Parrish\u2019s financial responsibility to honor his guaranty.",
