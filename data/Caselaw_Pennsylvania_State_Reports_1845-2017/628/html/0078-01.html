As this is an area of law that has been regulated by the Commonwealth for centuries, and since we are not persuaded that there is a clear and manifest federal congressional intention to preempt Pennsylvania law on the issue presented — as corroborated by the view of the local federal court — we decline to invalidate the rights and remedies afforded to appellants under the laws of this Commonwealth. Accordingly, we reverse the order below and remand the case to the Commonwealth Court for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>

Appellants purchased hotel property in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, in 1996, and <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>they claimed that the bridge thereafter obstructed the flow of a creek which ran under the bridge, causing the creek to flood appellants’ upstream hotel on three separate occasions of extreme weather conditions. On each occasion, appellants experienced flooding that filled the hotel basement and first floor. In 2001, the hotel closed and appellants declared bankruptcy.</p>

In June of 2001 the bridge collapsed. In his deposition, Miller testified that the floods caused a “sort of Biblical destruction” to the hotel’s basement and first floor, at an estimated cost of two million dollars in damages per flood. When the bridge collapsed during the 2001 flood, however, Miller noticed that the flooding receded more quickly than on prior occasions. He also noticed that SEPTA’s replacement bridge was built with wider spans between the supporting piers, thereby providing more space for a swollen creek to pass through. In 2003, appellants filed a complaint against SEPTA alleging negligence in failing to properly care for, repair, inspect and maintain the bridge, seeking damages for recovery of repair costs, lost profits and lost earnings.</p>

Thus, the trial court entered judgment in favor of SEPTA, and appellants appealed to the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b127-4" data-blocks='[["BL_127.5",127,[155,739,1153,1228]]]'>A divided Commonwealth Court, sitting <em>en banc, </em>affirmed in a published 4-3 decision, agreeing with the trial court that appellants’ claims are preempted by the FRSA. The majority reasoned that, in <a href="/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020106" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="49 U.S.C. § 20106">49 U.S.C. § 20106</a>(a)(2), Congress authorized state law to remain in force only until the Secretary of Transportation prescribes a regulation covering the subject matter of the relevant state requirement, and here, the Secretary had, in fact, issued a regulation addressing drainage issues posed by railroad tracks, which was dispositive of the preemption issue. Specifically, Section 213.33 of the “Track Safety Standards” regulations states: “Each drainage or other water carrying facility under or immediately adjacent to the roadbed shall be maintained and kept free of obstruction, to accommodate expected water flow for the area concerned.” <a href="/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20213.33" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="49 C.F.R. § 213.33">49 C.F.R. § 213.33</a>. In the majority’s view, the regulation required SEPTA to “accommodate expected water flow for the area concerned” lying “under ... the roadbed,” <em>ie., </em>water must be allowed to flow under a bridge without obstruction. That stated, the court held that appellants’ common law action was preempted by the FRSA because its subject matter, the duty to maintain a water course “under ... the roadbed” and “kept free of obstruction,” was the subject of Section 213.33. 65 A.3d at 1014.</p>

      <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>The court further reasoned that while the FRSA’s saving clause, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020106" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="49 U.S.C. § 20106">49 U.S.C. § 20106</a>(a)(2)(A)-(C), allows states to impose stricter regulations than those in the FRSA, the saving clause only saves state law from preemption in limited circumstances which were not met here. Specifically, a state may impose stricter standards only when such regulation: “(A) is necessary to eliminate or reduce an essentially local safety or security hazard; (B) is not incompatible with a law, regulation, or order of the United States Government; and (C) does not unreasonably burden interstate commerce.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020106" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="49 U.S.C. § 20106">Id.</a> </em>Here, the court found, first, that the common law of negligence was statewide in scope, not addressing a local hazard. Second, the maintenance of a railroad bridge “to accommodate expected water flow” was a subject occupied by Section 213.38, leaving no place for state regulation. And finally, complying with the common law of fifty states on the matter of railroad bed drainage would burden interstate commerce. Thus the Commonwealth Court majority concluded that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in SEPTA’s favor. 65 A.3d at 1018.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The collective dissenting view emphasized the presumption in favor of state sovereignty with respect to state law causes of action which insists that “the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded ... unless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.” <em>Id. </em>(Cohn Jubelirer, J., dissenting, joined by Pellegrini, P.J., &amp; McCullough, J.) (quoting <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em><a href="/us/331/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="331 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6157471" data-case-paths="/us/331/0218-01">331 U.S. 218</a>, 230, <a href="/us/331/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="331 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6157471" data-case-paths="/us/331/0218-01">67 S.Ct. 1146</a>, <a href="/us/331/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="331 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6157471" data-case-paths="/us/331/0218-01">91 L.Ed. 1447</a> (1947)). In the dissenting view, the requisite clear and manifest congressional purpose to preempt has not been expressed. Judge McCullough noted that the purpose of the FRSA is “to promote safety in every area of <em>railroad operations </em>and reduce rail<a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>road-related accidents and incidents.” 65 A.3d at 1022 (McCullough, J., dissenting, joined by Pellegrini, P.J., &amp; Cohn Jubelirer J.) (quoting <a href="/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020101" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="49 U.S.C. § 20101">49 U.S.C. § 20101</a>). To meet this purpose, the FRSA mandates that the Secretary of Transportation prescribe regulations as needed to address railroad safety. <a href="/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020103" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="49 U.S.C. § 20103">49 U.S.C. § 20103</a>(a). Here, Judge McCullough observed, the flow of a creek underneath the railroad bridge neither directly nor indirectly impacted railroad safety or railroad operations, particularly because the flooding at issue occurred upstream, and there is no allegation that the flooding encompassed or otherwise affected the railroad tracks on the bridge.</p>
    <p id="b129-4" data-blocks='[["BL_129.4",129,[150,918,1151,1180]]]'>Further, specific to the “Track Safety Standards” regulation at issue, the dissenting view noted that Section 213.33 does not cover the actual subject matter in dispute, <em>i.e., </em>this dispute is not about drainage issues relating to railroad tracks. Section 213.33 relates to man-made drainage systems, not a natural creek which runs beneath a railroad bridge, or the maintenance thereof. While the “Track Safety Standards” regulations do not define the phrase “water carrying facility,” Judge McCullough noted, a preceding section in the same chapter defines “facility” as: “railroad tracks, right-of-way, fixed equipment and facilities, real-property appurtenant thereto, [including] signal systems, passenger station and repair tracks, station buildings, platforms, and adjunct facilities such as water, fuel, steam, electric, and air lines.” <a href="/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20200.3" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="49 C.F.R. § 200.3">49 C.F.R. § 200.3</a>. Additionally, she noted, Black’s Law Dictionary defines “facility” as “[sjomething that is built or installed to perform some particular function[.]” Black’s Law Dictionary 591 (6th ed.1990). Neither the regulation itself, nor the referenced definitions encompass a creek or maintenance of a creek bed so as to prevent the accumulation of sediment caused by the railroad bridge’s restriction of the creek’s flow, which, of course, was the basis of the common law negligence claim at issue.</p>

Even if the regulation at issue applied in this context, Judge Cohn Jubelirer posed, it ex<a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>pressly prescribes only “minimum requirements for roadbed and areas immediately adjacent to roadbed.” <a href="/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20213.31" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="49 C.F.R. § 213.31">49 C.F.R. § 213.31</a>. More importantly, the regulation simply does not relate to bridges. In fact, there are no regulations for “bridges” or “bridge safety” under the FRSA, only an advisory Policy on the Safety of Railroad Bridges. Policy on the Safety of Railroad Bridges, 65 Fed.Reg. 52667-01 (August 30, 2000) (Final Statement of Agency Policy).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The Railroad Bridge Policy expressly states that it does not preempt state regulation. In the dissent’s view, this express statement, in conjunction with the presumption against preemption, showed there is no clear congressional purpose to preempt the state law at issue here. Neither the policies of the FRSA nor the regulations (which set only minimum standards) conflict with existing riparian rights or other state law.</p>

Appellants naturally highlight the recent holding in <em>MD Mall </em>that Section 213.33 is not addressed to the protection of neighboring property from flooding caused by a railroad facility, and therefore, it does not result in the preemption of Pennsylvania common law concerning the duty not to cause flooding on neighboring property.

Thus federal law does not preempt state regulation when the state-regulated activity is merely a peripheral concern of federal law. Applying these principles, appellants maintain, <em>MD Mall </em>makes it clear that the state law claims at issue in this case are not expressly preempted. Further, the state law claims are not subject to field preemption because, <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>as the court held in <em>MD Mall, </em>Congress has not legislated to occupy the entire field. And, lastly, there is no implied conflict preemption because compliance with both Pennsylvania law and Section 213.33 is not impossible. While many federal regulations address safety of trains and track, none address protection of neighboring landowners or purport to set standards for allowable flooding. On the other hand, Pennsylvania law does address such issues. Finally, appellants argue that a stream is not a water carrying facility as defined in the relevant regulations, and no case law says otherwise. For these reasons, appellants contend that the Commonwealth Court’s decision should be reversed.</p>

SEPTA reads <em>Easterwood </em>as specifically instructing “that courts are not to look at the purpose of a FRSA regulation when determining whether it preempts state law”; rather, the determination is simply one of whether regulations have been adopted that cover the subject matter.

The drainage and maintenance requirements of the regulation — keeping drainage and other water carrying facilities free of obstruction — necessarily involve the prevention of flooding. Thus, SEPTA argues, railway safety relative to improper drainage under and on property around the railroad roadbed is thoroughly covered by the FRSA and Section 213.33. SEPTA further posits that <em>Eastenuood </em>and its progeny were all decided with an eye toward the congressional goal of nationally uniform railroad regulation, and allowing riparian rights claims against rail service providers conflicts with this goal. SEPTA contends that juries cannot be allowed to determine the standards for maintenance and inspection of tracks and roadbed. SEPTA goes so far as to claim that the fact that Pennsylvania plaintiffs may be left with no remedy under its view of the matter is inconsequential.</p>

The manual calls for inspection of “Drainage facilities (bridges, trestles or culverts),” and states drainage openings must be inspected for accumulated debris to the extent that expected water flow cannot be accommodated.

Additionally, the FRA’s Bridge Safety Standards also address various issues relating to the structural integrity of railroad bridges, including inspections following floods, further evidencing the goal of nationally uniform and comprehensive railroad safety regulation.</p>

In SEPTA’s view, the MD Mall court erroneously compared the type of harm sought to be avoided by Section 213.33 and the harm the plaintiff alleged, and wrongly based its decision on the regulation’s silence on railroad duties to neighbors. SEPTA argues that this approach is in direct contravention of <em>Easterwood; </em>thus, <em>MD Mall </em>should not be regarded as persuasive. Drainage onto neighboring property is clearly implicit in Section 213.33, SEPTA reiterates; it would be illogical to assert that the regulation only covers the tracks themselves, since overflowing water would eventually go onto neighboring property.

      <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>This appeal has been well-briefed, and after due deliberation, we must reject SEPTA’s core contentions. We view the case, in its essence, as implicating concerns of federalism. Generally speaking, the federal government exists by reason of agreement by and among the states of this land to be united by a centralized, and yet limited, federal government. Pursuant to that agreement “the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union ...” ordained and established the U.S. Constitution. U.S. Const, pmbl. Therein, the people established that “Th[e] Constitution, and the Laws of the United States ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.” U.S. const, art. VI cl. 2 (the “Supremacy Clause”) (emphasis added). What is understood then, is that the laws of any State (or Commonwealth as the case may be) which are not contrary to the “supreme Law of the Land” retain full force and effect because the allocation of powers in our federal system is designed to preserve “the integrity, dignity, and residual sovereignty of the States[,]” not to abrogate or abolish them. <em>Bond v.

Notably, the provision identified by the Commonwealth Court majority as dispositive here, Section 213.33, pertains specifically to “Drainage.” It provides: “Each drainage or other water carrying facility under or immediately adjacent to the roadbed shall be maintained and kept free of obstruction, to accommodate expected water flow for the area concerned.” (emphasis added). Given the plainly limited scope of the Track Safety Standards, including Section 213.33, and the further limited scope of the Roadbed subpart, it is clear that the “area concerned,” specifically for safety purposes, is the railroad track and the track’s roadbed. Under Section 213.33, expected water flow (presumably primarily storm-water flow) upon the track and roadbed must be accommodated by drainage or other water carrying facilities, quite obviously to prevent the track safety issue which would otherwise be presented by the accumulation of standing water on railroad tracks, and corresponding interference with railroad operations. To be sure, attention to the tracks, drainage, and obstructions may inure to the benefit of neighboring landowners. But the concerns addressed have no express relation to the riparian rights at issue in this case.</p>

In any event, the preemptive effect of the relatively recent Bridge Safety Standards is not an issue in this matter because this action, which was filed in 2003 for damages caused before that time, substantially predates the 2010 effective date of the FRA's bridge safety regulations.</p>

The <em>MD Mall </em>court addressed two separate preemption issues: (1) express preemption — whether the FRSA’s express preemption provision operated to extinguish MD Mali's state claims in trespass seeking damages for personal injury, death, or property damage; and (2) implied conflict preemption — whether MD Mall’s "lawsuit may be preempted by implication because the state-law principle it seeks to vindicate would conflict with federal law.” <em>MD Mall, </em><a href="/f3d/715/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="715 F.3d 479" data-case-ids="3566360" data-case-paths="/f3d/715/0479-01">715 F.3d at 495</a> (quotation marks and citation omitted). While the court in <em>MD Mall </em>held that Section 213.33 is not an express abrogation of state storm-water trespass law, the court remanded the matter for a determination concerning conflict preemption, concluding that the question of whether the railroad might employ reasonable means to comply with Section 213.33 while also complying with the state law at issue presented a question of fact best determined by the lower court. <em>MD Mall, </em><a href="/f3d/715/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="715 F.3d 479" data-case-ids="3566360" data-case-paths="/f3d/715/0479-01">715 F.3d at 495-96</a>.

We decline the invitation to modify appellants' issue presented to account for any possible discrepancy in characterizing the cause of action as one for negligent construction as opposed to negligent maintenance, as we deem the distinction between construction and maintenance to be inconsequential for purposes of our preemption analysis. The extent to which that distinction may become relevant in the lower courts for some other purpose is a matter that we will leave for resolution by the lower courts and this Court if and when necessary. Notably, however, appellants have long maintained that the bridge at issue "was defectively designed, built and maintained such that it acted as a dam creating a ‘choke point’ which failed to allow for a sufficient lateral flow of water.” Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law Contra Defendant [SEPTA’s] Motion for Summary Judgment, at 2.</p>

The Pennsylvania Public Transportation Association, the American Public Transportation Association, the Association of American Railroads and the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association have filed <em>amicus curias </em>briefs in support of SEPTA. In the aggregate, these associations argue that Section 213.33 preempts the claims at issue because the claims pertain to damage caused by the obstruction of a creek by a railroad bridge, while Section 213.33 required SEPTA to maintain the bridge in a manner to accommodate, not obstruct, the expected flow of watercourses. Thus, <em>amici </em>say, the regulation ad<a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>dresses the same conduct as the Pennsylvania common law principles at issue and, as a result, appellants’ claims are preempted under <em>Easterwood. </em>The associations challenge the U.S. Court of Appeals’ decision in <em>MD Mall, </em>claiming that the rule articulated therein calls for a harm-based approach which is at odds with <em>Easterwood, </em>and will result in a morass of confusion and uncertainty in railroad regulation. <em>Amici </em>further claim that overturning the decision below will subject public rail service providers to monstrous tort liabilities and massive costs while jeopardizing the continuation of public rail transportation as we know it. Finally, they call for maintenance of a uniform national policy with federal regulations establishing the applicable standard of care, rather than state-based standards established by what they denigrate as ill-equipped and unqualified juries, which will force service providers into inefficient use of limited funding as they react to shifting jury perceptions.</p>

(C) has failed to comply with a State law ... that is not incompatible with subsection (a)(2).” Because the state law at issue does not relate to railroad safety, we conclude that it is not incompatible with subsection (a)(2), and therefore, according to the preemption provision, Section 20106 should not be construed to preempt the present action. We recognize, however, that Section 20106(b)’s clarification expressly applies to causes of action arising on or after January 18, 2002, while the events underlying this action occurred before then. Thus, we do not rely upon Section 20106(b) in resolving the issue presented herein, but do note that this "clarification” is telling as a counterpoint to the arguments of SEPTA and <em>amici </em>regarding supposed congressional intentions vis-a-vis Section 20106(a).</p>
