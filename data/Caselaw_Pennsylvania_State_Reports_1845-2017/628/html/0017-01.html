Historically, and not surprisingly, the <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>mining of underground coal in Pennsylvania has been -widely considered a dangerous endeavor. While significant improvements in mining safety have been achieved over the years, the recent events at the 2002 Quecreek Mine accident in Somerset County Pennsylvania, where nine miners were trapped for three days in a flooded mine shaft, made manifest the continued perilousness of mining. While the federal government regulates mining in Pennsylvania through the Mine Safety and Health Administration Act, as amended by the Mine Improvement Emergency Response Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> state governments are permitted to regulate mining as well, and our Commonwealth has done so for over 100 years.</p>

The most recent version of the statute was drafted in 1961 and constituted the first comprehensive mining legislation designed to regulate mining safety practices. The 1961 version of the Act included various provisions concerning safety, including inspectors being tasked with inspecting mines on a regular basis, with the ultimate purpose being to protect the health and safety of miners.</p>

(“Emerald”) engages in underground bituminous coal mining at its Emerald Mine in Wayne Township, Greene County, Pennsylvania. On January 19, 2009, at approximately 10:00 p.m., a crew of miners working in the B-7 section of the operation mined through into the adjoining B-6 section. A plan for the cut through had been prepared and a mine examiner was to be sent and stationed at the B-6 section to wait for and listen for the approach of the mining crew in the B-7 section. The plan also required the mine examiner to close two doors that the <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>company had erected for the purpose of maintaining safe ventilation in the mine following the cut through. Although the mine examiner went to the B-6 area, he did not remain there, and the doors stood open at the time of the cut through. Due to the doors remaining open, the ventilation in the area was affected. Specifically, a witness to the cut through felt the air along a conveyer belt reverse, and he could feel the heat from the feeder on his face. Additionally, a methane detector on a shuttle car sounded an alarm. Once certain protective measures were taken at the cut through, employees entered the B-6 area and closed the doors, resulting in the ventilation returning to its proper path.</p>
    <p id="b72-4" data-blocks='[["BL_72.4",72,[253,913,1145,300]]]'>Emerald did not notify the DEP of the incident. Thus, on January 30, 2009, the DEP issued an administrative order for Emerald’s violation of Section 109 of the Mine Safety Act for failing to report this “accident,” even though Section 104 does not list a ventilation disruption as a specific reportable accident.</p>
    <p id="b72-5" data-blocks='[["BL_72.5",72,[247,1245,1152,935]]]'>Appellee Cumberland Coal Resources L.P. (“Cumberland”) is the owner and operator of Cumberland Mine in Waynesburg, Greene County, Pennsylvania. At approximately 2:00 a.m. on February 12, 2009, an electrical storm resulted in a power outage at its mine that caused a fan in the mine’s ventilation system to stop working. The mine’s backup power system also failed to start after the loss of power, and, as a result, the mine’s ventilation system at the No. 5 bleeder shaft was inoperable for over 16 minutes. The diesel powered backup system, which should have automatically been triggered, failed to operate. Ultimately, a fan monitoring system alerted surface personnel of the stoppage, and an electrician restarted the fan. The Mine Safety Act requires mine operators to evacuate the mine when a ventilation system is down for 15 minutes or more; however, such an event is not included in Section 104’s list of “accidents” subject to reporting requirements. Cumberland did not notify the DEP of the fan outage, and the DEP issued an administrative order for the violation.</p>

The DEP, interpreting “off-track locomotive” to include “scoops,” issued multiple administrative orders and notices of violation to both Cumberland and Appellee Amfire Mining Co. (“Amfire”) for failing to equip their scoops with portable fire extinguishers in violation of Section 273(f) of the Mine Safety Act. A scoop is a “battery-powered, four-wheeled vehicle equipped with a bucket” used “to transport tools, materials, and coal” throughout the mine. EHB Opinion, 3/16/10, at 2.

The EHB consolidated these two cases, and the DEP moved for summary judgment, arguing the events occurring at both mines did, in fact, constitute “accidents” under Section 104 that required reporting under Section 109(a)(1).</p>
    <p id="b73-5" data-blocks='[["BL_73.5",73,[148,1393,1151,474]]]'>Cumberland and Amfire also filed appeals to the EHB from the administrative orders issued regarding their failure to provide fire extinguishers on scoops, which were consolidated for review.

In the Emerald/Cumberland matter, the EHB found the DEP lacked the authority to issue orders effectively expanding Section 104’s list of “accidents” to include the incidents that occurred at the Emerald and Cumberland mines. As to the Cumberland/Amfire matter, the EHB determined a scoop was not a “locomotive” within the meaning of Section 273(f), and, thus, that the DEP erred in citing Cumberland and Amfire for <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>violating the Mine Safety Act. The DEP appealed both decisions to the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b74-4" data-blocks='[["BL_74.4",74,[258,389,1152,1476]]]'>The Commonwealth Court consolidated the appeals and affirmed. <em>DEP v. Cumberland Coal </em>Resources, <a href="/a3d/29/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="29 A.3d 414" data-case-ids="7274836" data-case-paths="/a3d/29/0414-01">29 A.3d 414</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2011). First, the court held Emerald and Cumberland did not violate the reporting requirements of Section 109(a)(1). In reaching this conclusion, the court looked to the definition of “accident” in Section 104 and noted the definition was subject to two different interpretations: the use of the word “including” before the list of events could signify that the list was not intended to be exclusive, and the use of the word “any” in the phrase “any of the following” could mean that the General Assembly intended the list to be exclusive. As such, the court determined Section 104 was ambiguous, and it deferred to the DEP’s reasonable interpretation of the definition of “accident” as allowing additional events of the same general kind or class as those expressly set forth in the list. The court concluded, however, that the DEP could not expand this list through the adjudicatory process, as the General Assembly vested the Safety Board with the authority to develop the Mine Safety Act through rulemaking, and gave the DEP no such power. Accordingly, the court opined that the DEP’s powers under the Mine Safety Act are limited to enforcing the express provisions of the Act and any regulations promulgated by the Safety Board. According to the court, were it to hold otherwise, the DEP could expand the list of “accidents” on a case by case basis without giving mine operators any advanced notice, effectively punishing operators for failing to act when they had no reason to know action was required.</p>
    <p id="b74-5" data-blocks='[["BL_74.5",74,[255,1890,1151,416]],["BL_75.1",75,[154,267,1149,197]]]'>The court also rejected the DEP’s alternative argument that it had authority to issue the administrative orders pursuant to its general enforcement powers under Sections 105 and 501 of the Mine Safety Act. The court observed that Sections 105 and 501 contain no language giving the DEP authority to create rules and requirements under the Act, and it further opined that the General Assembly would not have expressly provided for an expedited reporting requirement for “accidents” in <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>Section 109(a)(1) if it also allowed the DEP to use its general enforcement powers under Sections 105 and 501 to impose a similar reporting requirement for events not included in the definition of “accident.”</p>
    <p id="b75-4" data-blocks='[["BL_75.4",75,[153,498,1152,910]]]'>As to the issue of whether the DEP established that Cumberland and Amfire violated Section 273(f) by failing to provide fire extinguishers for their scoops, the court held the DEP’s interpretation of the term “locomotive” to include scoops was erroneous. In so holding, the court noted the General Assembly did not define the term “locomotive” in the Act, and it relied on both the technical and common dictionary definitions of “locomotive,” which both define “locomotive” as a “powered vehicle used to move nonpowered vehicles.” As scoops do not move nonpowered vehicles, the court agreed with the EHB that they were not locomotives and, thus, not subject to the requirements of Section 273(f). Additionally, for the same reasons the court held the DEP could not rely on its enforcement powers to expand the list of “accidents” under the Act, the court found the DEP also could not rely on its general enforcement powers under Sections 105 and 501 to require fire extinguishers to be placed on scoops.</p>

Therein, Judge Pellegrini focused solely on the issue of the reporting requirements of Section 109, and disagreed with the majority’s conclusion that the DEP was precluded from expanding the list of “accidents” in Section 104, as the Mine Safety Act contained no language indicating that enforcement of the Act depended on the Safety Board’s enactment of regulations. According to Judge Pellegrini, to hold otherwise would allow the Safety Board to become a quasi-enforcement body, hindering the enforcement of the Mine Safety Act and the safety of miners.</p>

The DER observed that, while the Mushroom Farm identified every hourly employee underground, it did not have a process to identify supervisors, independent contractors, repairmen, or visitors, including high school students on tours. This was critical to the DER, as, in the event of a fire, the absence of individuals in the mines would allow rescuers to avoid embarking upon an unnecessary and dangerous search and rescue mission. In response, the DER ordered the Mushroom Farm to develop and implement a sys<a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>tem to track all individuals in the mines. The Mushroom Farm appealed the order to the EHB, contending the DER did not have legal authority to issue such an order.

Specifically, the DEP cites Section 105, which grants to the DEP the “power and the duty to administer a mine safety program for individuals employed at mines,” including the power to “[i]ssue orders to implement and enforce the provisions of this act.” 52 P.S. § 690-105(1), (3). The DEP contends this is one of the many enumerated powers and duties conferred on the DEP as part of its overall power and duty to administer the mine safety program. Even more broadly, the DEP points to its power to issue written orders “to enforce this act, to effectuate the purposes of this act and to protect the health and safety of miners and individuals in and about mines.” 52 P.S. § 690-501(a). Thus, according to the DEP, the express and expansive authority conferred by the Mine Safety Act upon the DEP allows it to issue administrative orders requiring actions not specifically expressed by statute that promote safety.</p>

The DEP asserts it interpreted and applied the Mine Safety Act to the incidents at issue, in light of the expansive definition of the statutory term “accident” and the requirement to provide notice to the DEP. In concluding that the mine operators should have provided notice of the incidents at issue, the DEP reasons that it was merely exercising its prerogative to interpret the statute as it deemed appropriate, as long as that interpretation is consistent with the Mine Safety Act. Similarly, DEP asserts that it reasonably determined that scoops fell within the term “off-track locomotive” under the Mine Safety Act and ordered operators to equip such vehicles with fire extinguishers.</p>

Const, art. 2, § 1. According to Appellees, the DEP in this instance is acting as a super-legislature and in a fashion contrary to what the legislature intended when creating the Board. Appellees urge that this is true for the DEP’s expansion of what constitutes an “accident,” as well as its decision to require fire extinguishers on scoops.

They offer that the Mine Safety Act, because it imposes criminal and civil penalties for non-compliance, must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth; accordingly, they contend the immediate reporting requirements must be limited to the events enumerated in Section 104. Appellees again emphasize that, if DEP had the power to expand reporting requirements, mine operators would be left in a state of uncertainty as to when to provide the DEP notice. Addressing the expansive phrase “including any of the following” with respect to enumerated events that constitute accidents, Appellees turn to Black’s Law Dictionary and assert that the term “including” may expand a meaning, but also may merely specify a particular thing already included within general words already used. Pointing to the prior mine safety statute, Appellees vaguely offer that a policy issued pursuant to that statute listed 14 events requiring notification, and, although not identical to those contained in the present statute, the policy spoke to two events not included in the statute, one <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>relating to ventilation interruptions and one regarding unplanned connections into abandoned workings. These two events, as noted by Appellees, were not included in the 2008 version of the Mine Safety Act and, according to Appellees, this omission indicates that the legislature did not intend the statute to include these circumstances as reportable accidents.</p>

Appellees offer that scoops, like numerous other self-propelled vehicles used in mining that are equipped with fire suppression systems, are excluded from this requirement; however, the DEP contends that they are “off-track locomotives” and, thus, required to carry fire extinguishers. According to Appellees, scoops are not locomotives, as they are not merely engines used for pulling, but are equipped with a bucket for scooping material off the mine floor. Further, Appellees note that personnel carriers and mantrips are used to move individuals in and out of the mines, but a scoop has a single operator with no seats for passengers. Thus, Appellees argue that Section 273(f) simply does not support the DEP’s position that a scoop must carry a fire extinguisher, and any attempts to require such equipment on that vehicle requires rulemaking. Finally, Appellees contend that the DEP is entitled to no deference in its interpretation <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>of the Mine Safety Act, as the language is clear that scoops are not the type of vehicle required to carry portable fire extinguishers.

These occurrences include unanticipated events such as death, serious injury, entrapment of an individual with reasonable potential for serious injury, inundation of a mine by liquid or gas, unplanned ignition or explosion of gas or dust, unplanned roof fall that impairs ventilation, an unstable condition requiring emergency action, and damage to hoisting equipment which endangers an individual or interferes with the use of equipment for more than 30 minutes. As is clear from this list, the unanticipated events contained in Section 104 all share the common thread of fairly serious unplanned incidents that potentially pose a serious risk to miners and other individuals’ health, safety, or life. Thus, as the DEP has the power to interpret and enforce the Mine Safety Act, the DEP has the authority to issue administrative orders for a failure to report unanticipated events if they may be regarded as of the same general class or nature as those expressly set forth in Section 104 — i.e., those involving fairly serious incidents potentially impacting the miner or other individual’s health, safety, or life.</p>

As noted by the EHB, Emerald did not dispute the DEP’s contention that the incident at its mine caused a potential threat to the health and safety of the miners. EHB Opinion, 2/24/2010 at 2. Indeed, at the Emerald Mine, the change in ventilation was accompanied by a methane detector being activated. Moreover, with respect to the Cumberland Mine, the EHB explained “there is no dispute that the loss of <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>ventilation caused by the malfunctioning equipment posed a potential threat to the health and safety of miners, not only directly as a result of the disruption in air flow, but indirectly as a result of the need to commence an evacuation of numerous miners over long distances on foot.” <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>

Specifically, Appellees’ position is that, by interpreting Section 104 to include events beyond those expressly listed, the DEP engaged in rulemaking, and, if permitted, would make the Safety Board’s rulemaking powers superfluous. Appellees’ argument is overstated. Our conclusion that the DEP properly has the authority to interpret and enforce the Mine Safety Act with respect to the reporting of accidents refutes Appellees’ contention that it engaged in unlawful rule-making in contravention to the rulemaking functions of the Safety Board. The DEP’s interpretation of its governing statute and enforcement of a broad statutory directive is not rulemaking. Moreover, while Section 106.1 of the Act vests the Safety Board with rulemaking powers, permitting the DEP to engage in traditional interpretation and enforcement responsibilities, based upon statutory authority, would not render the Safety Board’s rulemaking powers superfluous or redundant, as the Board could, consistent with its statutory powers, promulgate new rules or amend existing ones. Nor does it avoid or undermine the legislature’s construct for rulemaking through the Safety Board.

The DEP considered the scoops at issue in this appeal to be “off-track locomotives,” requiring a portable fire extinguisher.

The provision lists three particular pieces of mining transportation vehicles which require a portable fire extinguisher. Focusing on the term “locomotive,” dictionaries commonly provide that a locomotive is a “self-propelled engine, now usually electric or diesel-powered, that pulls or pushes freight or passenger cars on railroad tracks.” American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Houghton Mifflin Morris 766 (ed. Boston 1996). Conversely, a “scoop” is a battery-powered, four wheel vehicle with a single operator seat that is equipped with a bucket and used in underground mines to transport tools, materials, and coal from one location to another in the mine; it does not pull or push anything. Scoops are used daily and travel throughout a mine. R.R. 98a. While, generally, scoops are equipped with fire suppression systems, the scoop battery, which is large and can accumulate coal dust, is not protected by a fire suppression system. <em><a href="/a3d/29/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="29 A.3d 414" data-case-ids="7274836" data-case-paths="/a3d/29/0414-01">Id.</a> </em>We also note that the other vehicles listed — a mantrip car and personnel carriers — -just as the terms connote, are vehicles used for shuttling and carrying miners, and scoops are neither used to transport miners nor pull cars of supplies or coal.</p>

A scoop does not pull or push freight or passenger cars. Nor does a scoop move individuals in and out of a mine, like a mantrip car or personnel carrier, as a scoop has a single operator seat with no room for passengers. Indeed, consistent with our discussion above regarding the definition of “accident,” if a scoop were substantially similar to these vehicles, or in the same general class, the DEP’s interpretation may have more validity; but to interpret the definition of “locomotive” to include a scoop would be to stretch the plain meaning of the term used by the General Assembly beyond the breaking point. Consistent with the limited statutory language delineating the specific types of vehicles encom<a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>passed by this statutory provision, we find that scoops fall outside of the requirements of Section 273.

We do not doubt that the DEP enjoys broad powers to carry out the laudable and essential purposes of the Mine Safety Act, and, more specifically, that requiring a portable fire extinguisher to be carried by scoops may be exceedingly prudent; however, the DEP’s suggestion that, simply because it is safety related, it can require fire extinguishers on all vehicles, even if they are not statutorily required, would be to arrogate a power without a statutory basis, make it virtually impossible for a mine operator to reasonably understand what was required of it so as to comply with the law, and to raise the specter of constitutional infirmity on the basis of vagueness.</p>

    <p id="b94-9" data-blocks='[["BL_94.10",94,[251,1250,1152,1064]]]'>With respect to the Department’s compliance orders pertaining to placement of portable fire extinguishers on scoops to supplement their existing automatic fire protection systems, I agree with the majority’s conclusion that scoops are not locomotives, mantrip cars, or personnel carriers under Section 273(f) of the Mine Safety Act. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 49-50, 102 A.3d at 980-81. My only reservation about the majority’s reasoning concerns its breadth relative to the Department’s wider array of powers. <em>See id. </em>at 49, 102 A.3d at 981 (“[T]he DEP’s suggestion that, simply because it is safety related, it can require fire extinguishers on all vehicles, even if they are not statutorily required, would be to arrogate a power without a statutory basis, making it virtually impossible for a mine owner to reasonably understand what is required of it so as to comply with the law, and to raise the specter of constitutional infirmity on the basis of vagueness.”). Left to my own devices, I would confine the present discussion more closely to the factual scenario at hand, entailing the Department’s issuance of notices of violation expressly predicated on an incorrect interpretation of a statute.</p>

      <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>I realize that the Department suggests, as an alternative to its position on statutory construction, that we can disregard the specific grounds for its compliance orders which are plainly stated on the face of each, <em>see </em>R.R. 101a-107a (reflecting that each compliance order specifies Section 273 as the basis for the relevant violation), and treat such orders as a general exercise of the agency’s broader powers to effectuate the purposes of the Mine Safety Act and advance safety. However, I would simply decline to proceed beyond the matters at hand in such a fashion. In this regard, I would suggest that some underlying source of authority must precede a violation, whether this may be a statute, regulation, or other form of valid administrative prescription or pronouncement.</p>
