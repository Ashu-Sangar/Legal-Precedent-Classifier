Moreover, the Commonwealth contends that the testimony provided a foundation for later questions related to how the police obtained the Defendant’s DNA sample. The Commonwealth emphasizes that the reference to Defendant’s silence was not employed as a tacit admission of guilt. The Commonwealth observes that this Court has previously held that prosecutors can reference a defendant’s pre-arrest silence to impeach a defendant’s testimony at trial and as fair response to a defendant’s arguments.
