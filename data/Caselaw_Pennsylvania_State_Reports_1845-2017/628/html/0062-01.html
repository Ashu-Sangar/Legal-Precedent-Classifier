The murder/suicide was highly publicized in the local media and on the internet. The Jaconos purchased the property from the Koumboulis estate at auction in September, 2006, for $450,000.

The Jaconos’ agents received the same assurance when they called the Pennsylvania Association of Realtors Legal Hotline. The agents researched the matter further on the internet and read an article discussing stigmatized or psychologically-impacted properties and the adverse effect such can have on property values. While the agents still suggested disclosure would be a good idea “just to get it out there[,]” Fran Day Deposition, 4/19/10, at 22, the Jaconos replied that they had investigated the issue and did not wish to disclose the murder/suicide.</p>

Thereafter, the Jaconos and appellant entered an agreement of sale for $610,000. Approximately one month prior to closing, appellant received a copy of the homeowners’ association documents, which listed Koumboulis as the owner, and a title report. Although appellant did not review the homeowners’ association documents, she read the title report, which stated the Jaconos purchased the property from the Koumboulis estate; she did not investigate the matter further. Concerned about the difference between the purchase price paid by the Jaconos and the $610,000 price tag, appellant consulted her own realtor who suggested a possible mortgage foreclosure as an explanation. Although appellant “intuitively [] thought there was something more to it,” she proceeded with the transaction. Milliken Deposition, 4/20/10, at 72.

The trial court granted summary judgment, finding as a matter of law the murder/suicide was not a material defect required to be disclosed either by the RESDL or common law. Although a three judge panel of the Superior Court initially reversed the trial court, upon <em>en banc </em>reconsideration, the court affirmed, holding as a matter of law “psychological damage to a property cannot be considered a material defect in the property which must be revealed by the seller to the buyer”; therefore, appellant’s claims failed. <em>Milliken v.

Thus, if the murder/suicide cannot be considered a material defect, or if there was no legal obligation to reveal this alleged defect, there can be no liability for appellant’s claims.</p>
    <p id="b112-5" data-blocks='[["BL_112.4",112,[247,688,1149,899]]]'>Initially, we reject appellant’s argument that because the Jaconos chose to use a “broad” disclosure that purported to go beyond the requirements of the law, their non-disclosure of the murder/suicide was improper. The fact that the disclosure utilized purported to go beyond the basic requirements of the law does not necessarily lead to a conclusion that the murder/suicide had to be disclosed. Voluntarily revealing more than is required does not create additional involuntary requirements. A review of the disclosure statement reveals that it closely tracks the RESDL, except that on each required disclosure, the statement goes into more detail. This is clearly what was intended by: “this disclosure statement covers common topics beyond the basic requirements of the Law in an effort to assist sellers in complying with disclosure requirements and to assist buyers in evaluating the property being considered.” Seller’s Property Disclosure Statement, 6/17/07, at 1.</p>
    <p id="b112-6" data-blocks='[["BL_112.5",112,[245,1618,1149,417]]]'>The remainder of appellant’s argument posits that the steps taken by the Jaconos and Re/Max to determine whether the murder/suicide had to be disclosed, coupled with her expert’s opinion that such event resulted in a reduction in value and made the house one in which “certain buyers” would not want to live, was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the murder/suicide was a material defect. Appellant’s Brief, at 17. We must reject appellant’s contention.</p>
    <p id="b112-7" data-blocks='[["BL_112.6",112,[244,2063,1150,257]],["BL_113.1",113,[144,279,1153,695]]]'>Regardless of the potential impact a psychological stigma may have on the value of property, we are not ready to accept that such constitutes a material defect. The implications of holding that non-disclosure of psychological stigma can form the basis of a common law claim for fraud or negligent <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>misrepresentation, or a violation of the UTPCPL’s catch-all, even under the objective standard posited by appellant,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> are palpable, and the varieties of traumatizing events that could occur on a property are endless. Efforts to define those that would warrant mandatory disclosure would be a Sisyphean task. One cannot quantify the psychological impact of different genres of murder, or suicide — does a bloodless death by poisoning or overdose create a less significant “defect” than a bloody one from a stabbing or shooting? How would one treat other violent crimes such as rape, assault, home invasion, or child abuse? What if the killings were elsewhere, but the sadistic serial killer lived there? What if satanic rituals were performed in the house?</p>
    <p id="b113-5" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[146,1013,1154,796]]]'>It is safe to assume all of the above are events a majority of the population would find disturbing, and a certain percentage of the population may not want to live in a house where any such event has occurred. However, this does not make the events defects in the structure itself. The occurrence of a tragic event inside a house does not affect the quality of the real estate, which is what seller disclosure duties are intended to address. We are not prepared to set a standard under which the visceral impact an event has on the populace serves to gauge whether its occurrence constitutes a material defect in property. Such a standard would be impossible to apply -with consistency and would place an unmanageable burden on sellers, resulting in disclosures of tangential issues that threaten to bury the pertinent information that disclosures are intended to convey.</p>
    <p id="b113-6" data-blocks='[["BL_113.5",113,[150,1837,1150,262]],["BL_114.1",114,[261,275,1149,295]]]'>Moreover, considerations such as the time that has passed since the event, and changes and renovations made to the property, have a significant effect on the impact of the event.

The <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>possible fact patterns are endless and lead down a slippery slope — a slope we are not willing to descend. If there is to be a newly created duty to disclose psychological stigma, it should only be imposed with clear definition by the legislature after careful consideration of all aspects and ramifications of the issue.</p>
    <p id="b114-5" data-blocks='[["BL_114.4",114,[257,602,1150,942]]]'>The difficulty in assigning a proper remedy to common law claims premised on the failure to disclose a psychological stigma further cautions this Court against recognizing such as a material defect. Here, appellant seeks rescission of the contract and repayment of costs associated with her purchase of the property, an arguably extreme remedy given appellant’s own expert stated that usually “ ‘things [ ] cool off and return to normal’ ” within three to seven years — a relatively short period of time in the homeownership realm and one that has already elapsed. Sam Wood, <em>Hot market good for ‘stigmatized’ property, reprinted </em>in R.R., at 0133a. Resorting to the less extreme remedy of damages carries its own issues, as it is nearly impossible to assign a monetary value to psychological stigma because its impact will vary greatly from person to person and dissipates over time; thus, an objective standard cannot be justly implemented, and employing a subjective standard would be wholly unfair considering the unpredictable impact psychological stigmas have on prospective buyers.</p>
    <p id="b114-6" data-blocks='[["BL_114.5",114,[254,1577,1150,614]]]'>Lastly, this event was not latent. The murder/suicide was well-publicized, with coverage appearing in print and on the internet. Even under <em>caveat emptor, </em>there was no duty to disclose as the murder/suicide was patent. <em>See Anderson v.

As noted by the majority, the Seller’s Property Disclosure Statement cites the RESDL and parrots the definition of “material defect” set forth in 68 Pa.C.S.A. § 7102. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 65-66, 103 A.3d at 808 (quoting Seller’s Property <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>Disclosure Statement, 6/17/07) (“A Material Defect is a problem with a residential real property or any portion of it that would have a significant adverse impact on the value of the property or that involves an unreasonable risk to people on the property.”). Appellant makes the same allegation and reference to the Seller’s Property Disclosure Statement with regard to her UTPCPL claim. <em>See </em>Appellant’s Brief at 32-33 (asserting that Appellees “concealed] the Murder/Suicide,” and “affirmatively misrepresented that the Home had no material defects having a substantial adverse impact on the value of the Home”).
