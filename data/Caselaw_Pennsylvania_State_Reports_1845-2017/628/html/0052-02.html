    <p id="b97-6" data-blocks='[["BL_97.7",97,[145,566,1152,803]]]'>I join the <em>per curiam </em>order, denying the application for a writ of prohibition and application for stay. I write separately to note that, upon preliminary review of the matter, it appears that Petitioner has presented, <em>inter alia, </em>a colorable argument that the Commonwealth Court <em>sua sponte </em>inserted an undisputed issue into an otherwise moot case. Nevertheless, I join in the denial of the writ of prohibition because such writ is generally available to restrain a court from usurping jurisdiction that it does not possess or exceeding the established limits of its jurisdiction, and the writ does not lie to correct errors of law. <em>See Capital Cities Media, Inc. v. Toole, </em><a href="/pa/506/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="506 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="1790966" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0012-01">506 Pa. 12</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="506 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="1790966" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0012-01">483 A.2d 1339</a>, 1342 (1984). Because it appears to me that the Commonwealth Courtâ€™s action, regardless of its propriety, did not exceed the bounds of its jurisdiction, relief in the form of a grant of writ of prohibition is unwarranted.</p>
