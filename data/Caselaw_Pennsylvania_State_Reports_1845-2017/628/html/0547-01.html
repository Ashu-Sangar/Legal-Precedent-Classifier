The sentencing court, however, having sentenced the defendant prior to the completion of the Assessment, had not imposed the five-year statutory maximum, sentencing him instead to a maximum sentence of one year.

Section 3815(2) imposes separate conditions on offenders who are not determined by the procedure of Section 3814 to be addicted to alcohol or another substance, and another set of conditions for those who are so determined. For offenders in the latter category, any drug and alcohol treatment that is ordered by the sentencing court must conform to the recommendations set forth in the full Assessment.

Relying on Section 3804(d), the Commonwealth argues that if the sentencing court has imposed the statutory maximum sentence, the sentence is legal, and the lack of the mandatory, presentence Assessment is irrelevant. Section 3804’s requirement that the sentencing court impose a sentence equal to the statutory maximum, however, flows directly from that court’s consideration of the Assessment and the offender’s need or lack thereof for drug or alcohol treatment. 75 Pa.C.S. § 3804(d) <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>(providing that where an offender is determined to be in need of additional treatment pursuant to the Section 3814(2) Assessment, then the sentencing court is required to impose the statutory maximum). The purpose of imposing the statutorily available maximum sentence against such offenders is to extend the sentencing court’s parole authority pursuant to Section 3815 to require the offender to complete needed treatment. <em>Id </em>§ 3815(b)(2)(ii)(B) (directing the sentencing court to require compliance with the treatment needs revealed by an Assessment as a parole condition for offenders addicted to drugs or alcohol); § 3815(c) (providing that treatment imposed as a parole condition “must conform to assessment recommendations made under section 3814.”). Thus, consideration of an offender’s need for treatment is a pre-requisite in the mandatory sentencing scheme of Section 3804(d) to the requirement that he be subject to the statutory maximum sentence. We therefore disagree with the Commonwealth that the imposition of a sentence within the standard range but without the required Assessment complies with the sentencing scheme articulated in Sections 3814, 3815, and 3804.</p>

Accordingly, at the time of Appellant’s initial sentencing hearing and the rescheduled hearing, there was no designated agency or personnel pursuant to Section 3814(3) providing presentence Assessments in Franklin County, nor was there a mechanism in place for an offender to obtain an independent Assessment to present to the court before being sentenced. Additionally, the sentencing court suggested that the reason Appellant did not obtain the Assessment was because there was no funding available for it. Under these circumstances, therefore, as conceded by the parties, <em>supra </em>n. 7, Appellant herein had no ability to obtain an Assessment before being sentenced.

The accused here was “subject to” many things, including all the potential sentencing options and consequences available under the law — that does not make those consequences mandatory. The clear import of this language is that if the court ordered an assessment, the accused must cooperate — he is “subject to it.” It suggests the legislature thought an assessment would be a good idea, helping the court fashion an appropriate sentence. However, it is difficult to find where it unequivocally demands an assessment on pain of causing the sentence to be illegal. Does a judge impose an <em>illegal </em>sentence by sentencing without something to which a defendant is merely “subject to” and <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>nothing more? I think not. It might be so if the defendant was “entitled to” the assessment, or the judge was “required” to order it, or the assessment was “mandatory,” but that simply is not what the statute says. Respectfully, appellant has slipped the rabbit into the hat by premising his argument on the conclusory premise that § 3814(2) is a right of the accused, not an obligation. Being “subject to” an assessment does not make the assessment something to which one is entitled.</p>

It is not to direct the court or restrict the court; it does not compel the court, suggest a mandatory result, or affect the statutory mínimums or máximums. Likewise, § 3816(a) repeats the same language.
