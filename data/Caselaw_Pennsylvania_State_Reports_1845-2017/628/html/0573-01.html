This has historically been done through a system of sixty Centers located throughout the Commonwealth. The Centers employed, <em>inter alia, </em>approximately sixty-one nurse consultants, who have expertise in a variety of specialized public health fields involving tuberculosis, communicable diseases, immunizations, HIV, family health, tobacco, cancer, and injury prevention. The nurse consultants support public health services and provide coordination and consultation for the community health nurses who administer care at the Centers.</p>

Specifically relevant here, Subsection 8 of Act 87, codified at 71 P.S. § 1403 (hereinafter “Section 1403”), is entitled “Duty to protect health of the people,” and included various directives to the DOH. One of these directives was to establish a pilot review program to determine the feasibility of privatizing the operation of three state health centers, which program would terminate after twelve months, at which point the DOH could submit to the Legislature a report and recommendation regarding the privatization and operation of all remaining health care services. <em>See </em>71 P.S. § 1403(c)(2) (expired pursuant to Act of July 2, 1996, P.L. 518, No. 87 § 4); § 1403(c)(4).

It submits there are no apparently reasonable grounds for the Commonwealth Court’s denial of the preliminary injunction because the unambiguous language of Section 1403(c)(1) prohibits the conduct it seeks to enjoin. SEIU argues that the Commonwealth Court’s interpretation of the statute, affording the Executive Branch discretion to reduce the number of Centers and the level of public health services provided, overlooks the unambiguous “shall operate” language, which mandates expressly that the DOH shall operate the number of Centers and provide the level of public health services that existed as of July 1, 1995.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> SEIU emphasizes that when the words of a statute are free from ambiguity, the letter of the statute cannot be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b).

First, SEIU points out that if the provision was intended to curb only closures of Centers due to privatization, the second sentence of Section 1403(c)(1) would accomplish that task as it states, “the [DOH] shall not enter into contracts with any additional private providers that would result in the elimination of any State health center nor reduce the scope of services currently provided nor reduce the number of centers.” 71 P.S. § 1403(c)(1). However, SEIU emphasizes, Section 1403(c)(1) is not limited to that prohibition. Rather, as noted, the first sentence states that, with the exception of the three Centers privatized in the now-expired pilot program, “the [DOH] shall operate those public State health centers and provide at a minimum those public health services in effect as of July 1, 1995.” <em>Id </em>This language, SEIU contends, goes beyond prohibiting closures of Centers due to privatization, and declares a clear legislative intent to prohibit the closure of Centers and the reduction of public health services for any reason. It emphasizes that in construing a statute, courts must attempt to give meaning to every word, as it is not to be assumed that the legislature intended any language to be mere surplusage. 1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1921(a), 1922(2).

Clearly this statute speaks to two things: health <em>centers </em>and health <em>services. </em>The two are not synonymous — the former is the location where the latter is provided. The statute states it is the department that shall operate health centers — it shall not contract it away to a private provider; it also says the department shall provide the existing level of health services. As the second sentence makes clear, what the statute precludes are contracts with private providers that would result in changing centers or <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>services (again the two are separately enumerated); it does nothing to imply there cannot be changes in the centers by the department itself, so long as services are maintained.</p>
    <p id="b642-4" data-blocks='[["BL_642.5",642,[265,434,1156,1483]]]'>That is, in addition to requiring the maintenance of service levels, what this section focuses on is the continued operation of health centers by the state, as opposed to private companies. It does not say the department cannot close or modify a center — it says the department cannot do so by means of contracts with private providers. It does not say the department cannot substitute a mobile unit for a fixed location. It does not set a minimum number of buildings or employees that must be maintained — it says only that the department must provide the public health services available as of July 1, 1995. Clearly, this section was concerned with the preservation of available public health services, not the perpetual insulation of employees from the normal changes that every other employee faces. If the centers are sacrosanct, so are the landlords. But times change, and it cannot be that the legislature meant to lock the state into a series of locations in perpetuity. There will always be demographic shifts, lease expirations, building closures, employee furloughs and transfers, and the advances of technology and treatment options that make change inevitable. It would be absolutely silly to require the department to maintain exactly the same building as a center, forever tying the taxpayers’ support to a location that has become an albatross. Why would the legislature demand such fealty to a “center” when its goal is service? The answer is that it did not do so — it required a level of service, not an immovable location, and precluded the state from abdicating responsibility by means of contract with private providers.</p>

The first sentence addresses the department’s obligations. It mandates the department continue its operation of state health centers except those covered by the privatization pilot program and maintain, at minimum, the current level of health services. The language is devoid of a specific number of centers that must be operated or language <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>stating the specific number then in existence must be maintained. Moreover, given the exception of three health centers yet to be selected for the privatization pilot program,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> the legislature showed no intent to set a definitive number of health centers that the department must operate, nor did it require the department to operate centers within specific counties. As a matter of fact, had the legislature intended to do so with this language, the magic number would be 57, not 60, and the continued presence of health centers in Dauphin, Butler, and Berks Counties would not be required. The only portion of the sentence that sets a minimum standard concerns the public health <em>services </em>available, not the number, employment, or location of <em>centers </em>providing them.</p>
    <p id="b643-4" data-blocks='[["BL_643.5",643,[158,992,1151,638]]]'>The second sentence concerns actions from which the department must refrain, specifically, entering into additional contracts, aside from those employed in the privatization pilot program, with private providers that would result in reduction of the scope of services or number of centers then available. Here we find the only reference to maintaining the number of health centers, and such is only protected from privatization measures. The statute makes no mention of reducing the number of centers for other reasons.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Compare this to the scope of public health services, which is protected from reduction both by a set minimum level in the first sentence and from privatization in the second.</p>
