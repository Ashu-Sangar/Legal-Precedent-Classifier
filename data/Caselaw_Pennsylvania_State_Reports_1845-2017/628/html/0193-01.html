The Commonwealth argues that Judge Temin had no authority to vacate the death sentences because in doing so she overruled Judge Lineberger’s prior dismissal. That action, the Commonwealth alleges, violated Pa.R.A.P. 2591, which provides that the lower court must proceed in accordance with the judgment or order of the appellate court on remand, as well as the coordinate jurisdiction rule, which provides that judges sitting on the same court in the same case should not overrule each other’s decisions. The Commonwealth contends that this Court’s remand order was narrow, merely directing the PCRA court to produce a written opinion on the remaining issues it had dismissed, and Judge Temin exceeded that mandate when she granted penalty phase relief. Respecting coordinate jurisdiction, the Commonwealth posits that Judge Lineberger specifically rejected appellees’ mitigation-based ineffectiveness claim on the merits during a March 25, 2003 PCRA hearing and then memorialized the decision in an order dated the same day. According to the Commonwealth, the <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>coordinate jurisdiction rule precluded Judge Temin from overruling the merits determination of a fellow PCRA judge.</p>
    <p id="b257-5" data-blocks='[["BL_257.5",257,[164,384,1149,573]]]'>The Commonwealth further argues that Judge Lineberger’s June 2004 written opinion, which stated that the claims he did not address in the opinion were “moot,” is not part of the record on appeal, and therefore Judge Temin should not have considered its contents in determining whether she could address the merits <em>“ab initio.” </em>The Commonwealth concludes that “because the PCRA court lacked the authority to go beyond this Court’s narrow remand order and overrule the prior binding decision of a judge of coordinate jurisdiction, the court’s <em>ultra vires </em>award of a new penalty phase hearing should be reversed.” Principal Brief of Commonwealth, at 26.</p>

Pelzer adds that this Court recognized that the claims were dismissed as moot in our remand directive (quoted above). According to Pelzer, the Court remanded the case specifically because certain claims remained unaddressed by the PCRA court. It follows, Pelzer says, that the coordinate jurisdiction rule was not violated by Judge Temin because Judge Lineberger did not decide the merits of the remaining claims. Pelzer further contends that the cases cited by the Commonwealth to support its argument that Judge Lineberger’s opinion is not part of the record are inapplicable because they stand for the proposition that facts stated in an opinion cannot overcome the lack of record evidence to support the existence of those facts, a proposition not at issue here.

The suggestion of mootness was plainly misguided in light of this Court’s repeated insistence on a comprehensive approach to PCRA petitions. A capital PCRA petitioner’s claims should not be deemed “moot” by the trial court based upon a determination that a claim or two possesses merit; any finding of mootness would depend upon this Court’s determination of any ensuing Commonwealth’s appeal. As an institutional matter, and as a matter of judicial economy, mootness is more properly for this Court to determine in capital PCRA proceedings. If a single collateral issue is both contested (as here) and deemed of such importance as to warrant immediate interlocutory review in the PCRA court context, the PCRA court can avail itself of the issue certification process, Pa.R.A.P. 312 (interlocutory appeals by permission). But, a PCRA trial court should not invoke “mootness” to avoid the task of deciding the entire case before it so as to make for a ready, comprehensive, and timely single appeal. This imperative is not just a matter of sparing the parties and this Court the burden of multiple, “ping-<a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>ponging” appeals but it also avoids the prospect — as happened here — of the PCRA judge no longer being available to preside over any remand.</p>

Even if Judge Lineberger had made it perfectly clear that he was rendering a merits conclusion as to every claim, that fact would hardly advance the purpose of our remand. The impediment to meaningful appellate review was the absence of any reasoned expression why any particular claim was being rejected. Judge Lineberger denied most of appellees’ claims without an evidentiary hearing. <em>See </em>N.T., 2/2/2000, at 80-89. He then held multiple hearings related to specific claims, including both the guilt phase claims that were subject of the prior collateral appeal and the penalty phase claim upon which Judge Temin ultimately granted relief. When Judge Lineberger granted relief on the two guilt phase claims, the prosecutor stated that he “would assume all the other claims are denied.” Judge Lineberger replied, “No. What I’m saying to you, is this. I didn’t go down the list of claims on there.... Some of those issues that were raised did not trouble me at all____” N.T., 1/29/03, at 11. But, the court did not identify these claims or articulate the reasons he believed they were not troubling. During a March 5, 2003 hearing, Judge Lineberger appeared reluctant to rule on the merits of the penalty phase issues because he had not fully considered them. <em>See </em>3/5/03, at 5, 12-15 (“See, I’m in a position at this moment where I really did not give the issues raised concerning the penalty phase probably the consideration they might have legally deserved.... ”). Ultimately, on March 25, 2003, the court appeared to deny relief on the mitigating evidence claims on the merits, but again without any kind of reasoned expression, and in an equivocal manner tied to a hope that the penalty phase issues would be rendered “academic” by his granting of new trials: “[S]o I guess what I’m saying is this, gentlemen, that in this Court’s opinion the conduct of the lawyers were not an F. Lee Bailey type presentation on the <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>part of Houston, but in my opinion it does not warrant another penalty phase should the Commonwealth overcome the threshold on its appeal of this Court’s decision on the new trial. Hopefully the question will be academic.” N.T., 3/25/03, at 14. The court’s subsequent reference to mootness in its opinion seems to continue its equivocation.</p>
    <p id="b260-5" data-blocks='[["BL_260.5",260,[248,599,1153,1216]]]'>What is not equivocal is that the initial PCRA judge memorialized no findings of facts or specific conclusions of law as to the various claims he dismissed, and he offered no reasoned explanation as to any of the claims; an offhand reference to Attorney F. Lee Bailey is not helpful to meaningful appellate review. We are left with nothing of substance from Judge Lineberger to review, irrespective of whether the judge intended to engage the merits. In these circumstances, Judge Temin, tasked with providing this Court with a reasoned analysis of the myriad remaining claims, can hardly be faulted for proceeding to analyze the claims <em>de novo: </em>there was nothing material for Judge Temin to defer to, and she was no better off than this Court, when the appeal was here before, to try to fathom the grounds for Judge Lineberger’s decisions (or nondecisions). Our remand order did not contemplate a circumstance where the judge who had failed to fully discharge his duty in the first instance would be unavailable to complete the task upon remand. Hence, at least in these admittedly unique circumstances, we see no error in the judge to whom the case was reassigned examining the merits anew, so as to provide this Court with the explication necessary for us to discharge our appellate task. Thus, we will proceed to the merits.</p>

However, we reiterated that, in the layered claim scenario, a remand remains unnecessary if the petitioner has not met his burden of establishing the underlying claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness. <em>Walker, </em><a href="/pa/613/0601-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="36 A.3d 1" data-case-ids="4205279,7295124" data-case-paths="/pa/613/0601-01,/a3d/36/0001-01">36 A.3d at 8-9</a>.</p>

Pelzer adds that the trial court did not make any reference to the evidence of strangulation as <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>a possible cause of death or reference the defense claim that the victim was already dead at the time he was shot. Pelzer continues that trial counsel should have objected to these “unbalanced” instructions which, he says, failed to present the defense to the jury.

The Commonwealth notes that in this case, Daniels’s testimony showed that appellees were unsure whether the victim was dead and that he was shot in order to make certain he was dead. Thus, the evidence did not show that appellees had a bona fide belief that the victim was dead at the time of the shooting.

Daniels also notes that standby counsel and Thomas Bello, Esquire (co-defendant Stacey Torrance’s counsel) testified at the PCRA hearing that trial counsel (retained by Daniels and granted <em>pro hoc vice </em>status) was looking to divine intervention for help instead of arguing the law as relevant to the facts of the case.

While counsel then gave an alternative argument, premised upon assuming that the victim was alive at the time he was shot, alternative arguments do not necessarily undermine the defense case; it is the Commonwealth that bears the burden. Thus, counsel frankly addressed the most damning evidence against his client, albeit he did so in an idiosyncratic fashion. Finally, although counsel’s description of the reasonable doubt standard did not comport with the governing law, the Commonwealth accurately observes that the argument — not objected to by the Commonwealth — would have heightened the Commonwealth’s burden.

The Commonwealth notes that trial counsel spoke with Pelzer about his background, asking him for the names of anyone who could testify on his behalf. The Commonwealth stresses that trial counsel interviewed Pelzer’s mother, Foy, Hilderbrand, Pelzer’s girlfriend, and a friend named Angel. The Commonwealth notes that Foy was called and testified that Pelzer was a “slow learner.” Related to information in the school records, the Commonwealth avers that no one had indicated to counsel that there could be possible mitigation evidence in those records. Instead, the only information that counsel received from Pelzer and his family was that he was disrespectful in school and was expelled. The Commonwealth further contends that this sort of negative information also was incompatible with counsel’s penalty phase strategy of casting Pelzer in a positive light. Thus, the Commonwealth concludes that counsel cannot be faulted for failing to uncover any mental health mitigation evidence, as he never received any information that would cause him to thoroughly investigate the school records and, in any event, the information identified at the PCRA hearing was contrary to his strategy.</p>

For example, trial counsel asked Foy why <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>Pelzer lived with her as a child; Foy answered that both of his parents were moving. Yet, when asked a similar question during the PCRA hearing, Foy responded differently, claiming that Pelzer moved in with her because of a difficult living situation, and she then elaborated on that difficulty. The Commonwealth avers that Foy simply changed her testimony after Pelzer was sentenced to death, and the differences in her account have nothing to do with the reasonableness of trial counsel’s conduct.</p>

Moreover, the Commonwealth notes that its expert disputed that diagnosis.</p>

The Commonwealth further argues that the school records did not shed light on any of Pelzer’s problems.

Specifically, Pelzer contends that counsel conducted a very limited investigation into mitigation evidence, relying on only a narrow set of sources. Pelzer also reiterates his view that counsel failed to adequately and thoroughly question Foy when she was on the stand. Pelzer argues that counsel met with Foy for fifteen minutes prior to <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>her testimony, telling her only that she would be called as a “character witness.” Pelzer avers that the mere fact that counsel elicited some testimony from Foy does not change the fact that he could have elicited much more helpful testimony, as demonstrated by her broader testimony at the PCRA proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[253,615,1149,632]]]'>Pelzer then turns to his school records and expert testimony, arguing that even a cursory examination of the records would have revealed his longstanding psychological issues. Furthermore, such records, according to Pelzer, would have revealed (1) that he had been placed in classes for social and emotionally disturbed children and (2) his unstable home environment (given his frequent changes of address). Pelzer extends this argument by alleging that the school records would have prompted a reasonably effective attorney to consult with a mental health expert, which, he says, would have led to mitigation evidence of the type he presented during the PCRA hearing.</p>
    <p id="b296-6" data-blocks='[["BL_296.6",296,[250,1275,1151,527]]]'>Pelzer further argues that the lack of a proper investigation prejudiced him as his experts opined that the evidence supported two different statutory mental health-related mitigating circumstances, and also provided additional information relevant to the catch-all mitigator one juror found.

Counsel’s failure to present a fuller life history and to consult with a mental health expert and uncover and place before the jury information of Pelzer’s childhood circumstances and mental health issues was deficient performance. The failure is noteworthy given that counsel asked the trial court to instruct the jury on the (e)(2) mitigator <em>(i.e., </em>that Pelzer was acting under the influence of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance) by relying on the sole fact that Pelzer allegedly shot the victim under the direction of Daniels.

At the PCRA hearing, Drs. Krop and Crown testified that the information provided to them supported conclusions that Pelzer suffered from an extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the offense which impaired his capability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct (the (e)(2) mitigator), and that he was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law (the (e)(3) mitigator). The experts based their opinions on a combination of factors, including Pelzer’s learning disability, his troubled childhood, and his drug and alcohol abuse. To be sure, the Commonwealth presented <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>experts in rebuttal, who testified to their opinions that Pelzer did not suffer from a learning disability and that he did not establish either of the mental health mitigators. Of course, in a case of dueling experts, it is difficult to project which set of experts the jury or any single juror would have chosen to believe, or even if the jury would have been receptive to the notion that the opinions here, on the evidence presented, properly made out the mitigators. What can be known, however, is that those opinions would have been admissible and become part of the mix for the jury’s consideration; and, even if the jury did not find the mental health mitigators specifically, the additional information was still available for consideration under the catchall mitigator, and in the jury’s overall comparative assessment. Noting again the relative paucity of the case in mitigation actually forwarded at trial, we believe that, at a minimum, there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have found a stronger case for mitigation under the catchall mitigator.

Moreover, in assessing <em>Strickland </em>prejudice, although some members of the direct appeal Court may have been unconvinced respecting certain aggravators, the fact remains that the jury unanimously found all four circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt; contrary to the view of the PCRA court, there is no reason to believe that the jury harbored the same doubts about those aggravators <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>that were articulated, as a legal matter, by the Justices ultimately in the minority on those issues.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Nonetheless, particularly given the weakness of the case presented in mitigation at trial, and the dictated standard of Sixth Amendment review, we conclude that there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would view both the mitigation case differently, and the overall penalty judgment differently, and would have decided against the imposition of the death penalty.

Furthermore, the court found that Houston’s failure to present any testimony from Jacqueline Daniels was unreasonable since Drost had performed the initial investigation and had alerted Houston to the existence of her potential testimony related to Daniels’s life history. The court then determined that the evidence of Daniels’s abusive upbringing not presented would have altered the sentencing profile presented to the jury.

The Commonwealth argues that Houston, once he assumed the defense, was not required to take the redundant step of contacting Dr. Tepper after he was contacted by Drost.

Echoing the PCRA court, Daniels asserts that the evidence he produced at the PCRA hearing would have altered the sentencing profile presented to the jury.

Counsel presented a modicum of evidence to the jury of Daniels’s troubled background, but mixed it with an evidence on some of his successes in life, combined with an acceptance of responsibility, an apology, and evidence of Daniels’s religious conversion — a point no doubt resonant with many jurors, and a point understandably important enough to Daniels himself that he repeated it at the PCRA hearing. The jury still returned a unanimous verdict of death. By way of immediate comparison, the additional mitigation evidence adduced at the PCRA hearing was not so different or significant as that proffered by co-defendant Pelzer in his own collateral presentation. Thus, Dr. Tepper opined that Daniels suffered from a mixed personality disorder and substance abuse, testimony that was not as precise or certain as the testimony of Dr. Crown or Dr. Krop, and it is difficult to see how it could have altered the outcome of the penalty proceeding. For example, although Dr. Tepper initially testified that there was evidence to support the Section (e)(3) mitigator, he retracted that view on cross-examination. Similarly, there was no evidence in Daniels’s school records to suggest any significant mental health history that warranted, or required, further investigation. Instead, Daniels appeared to be a good student both academically and emotionally: he was a high school graduate and he attended a year of college. We are not persuaded that there is a reasonable probability that the jury, or any one juror, would have concluded that the evidence produced for the PCRA hearing, combined -with the mitigation already made available to the jury, warranted a finding that the (e)(2) mental health mitigator existed and, <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>considered with the other relevant penalty evidence, warranted a verdict of life in prison.</p>

Of course, it is theoretically possible that a juror or two would have given the catchall mitigator some additional weight if Ms. Daniels had testified, but the question the Court must answer is whether the additional testimony by Jacqueline Daniels and Dr. Tepper was weighty enough to the point where there is a reasonable probability that one juror may have decided against the imposition of the death penalty.</p>
    <p id="b310-6" data-blocks='[["BL_310.6",310,[259,1041,1151,993]]]'>Based on the record of the PCRA proceedings and the trial, we simply cannot conclude that such a reasonable probability existed. The aggravating circumstances demonstrated that Daniels was actively involved in a plan to kidnap a young man, not yet an adult, for ransom. The victim died as a result of the conduct of Daniels and his cohorts, but only after having been cruelly confined in the trunk of a car for twenty-four hours, tied up and with a sock stuffed in his mouth. Given the case in mitigation already presented to the jury emphasizing both Daniels’s troubled childhood as well as positive attributes and his religious conversion, and the substantial evidence in aggravation, we do not believe that the marginal additional mitigation evidence produced at the PCRA hearing was sufficient to establish a reasonable probability that the result of the penalty phase would have been different. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the additional mitigating evidence undermines confidence in the jury’s verdict. The PCRA court’s summary conclusion respecting <em>Strickland </em>prejudice to the contrary cannot stand, and it is hereby reversed.</p>

Daniels notes that trial counsel could have objected to the instruction, pointing out that counsel for one of the co-defendants had raised the issue during the guilt phase. Furthermore, Daniels explains that appellate counsel challenged the evidence in support of the aggravator on direct appeal, but failed to raise a challenge to <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>the instruction itself; in that regard, Daniels says, appellate counsel was ineffective.</p>

The Commonwealth also accurately notes that the trial court made clear that the aggravating circumstances had to be established by the Commonwealth beyond a reasonable doubt (citing N.T., 11/13/89, at 152). Additionally, the Commonwealth argues that the jury had been given the definitions of “direct evidence” and “circumstantial evidence” during the guilt phase jury instructions. Finally, the Commonwealth argues that the Court has consistently held that the (d)(5) aggravator can apply to potential witnesses since <em>Appel, </em>and stresses that the sole case cited by Daniels in fact applied the aggravator consistently with <em>Appel.</em>

Daniels argues that “all parties agree” that he did not personally inflict any gunshot wounds upon the victim.

Daniels argues that <em>Lassiter </em>merely clarified the statute and did not change it, as the discussion in <em>Lassiter </em>was this Court’s first pronouncement on the substance of the (d)(6) aggravator. Daniels then contends that, prior to his trial, the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Enmund v. Florida, </em><a href="/us/458/0782-01" class="citation" data-index="195" data-cite="458 U.S. 782" data-case-ids="636586" data-case-paths="/us/458/0782-01">458 U.S. 782</a>, <a href="/us/458/0782-01" class="citation" data-index="196" data-cite="458 U.S. 782" data-case-ids="636586" data-case-paths="/us/458/0782-01">102 S.Ct. 3368</a>, <a href="/us/458/0782-01" class="citation" data-index="197" data-cite="458 U.S. 782" data-case-ids="636586" data-case-paths="/us/458/0782-01">73 L.Ed.2d 1140</a> (1982), held that a killing in the perpetration of a felony aggravator could only apply where the evidence demonstrated that a participant in a felony murder either killed or attempted to kill the victim, or intended that a killing take place, or that lethal force be employed. According to Daniels, under <em>Enmund, </em>an instruction was required to inform the jury that capital culpability must be based on the accomplice’s proven desire, <em>i.e., </em>an intent to bring about the victim’s death.</p>

Thus, Daniels says, trial counsel was put on notice of the viability of a challenge to the (d)(6) aggravator. Daniels then maintains that the prejudice arising from the failure to object to and negate the aggravator is self-evident.

First, the Commonwealth contends that there was evidence that Daniels was a principal in the murder and not merely an accomplice, citing as proof this Court’s opinion in the first collateral appeal, where we stated that “the jury could have found that both actors were principals based upon the evidence presented ... the evidence inculpated both men depending on whose version of the shooting the jury believed.” <em>Daniels and Pelzer, </em><a href="/pa/600/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="198" data-cite="963 A.2d 409" data-case-ids="4193624,8163770" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0001-01,/a2d/963/0409-01">963 A.2d at 432, n. 17</a>. Second, the Commonwealth notes that counsel’s effectiveness must be evaluated using the standards in effect at the time of trial.

Indeed, the Commonwealth notes that the Court has upheld the sentencing of a defendant, prior to <em>Lassiter, </em>where the jury found the (d)(6) aggravator based on accomplice liability. <em>See </em>Brief of Commonwealth at 56 (citing <em>Commonwealth v. Spotz, </em><a href="/pa/587/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="199" data-cite="587 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="3465881" data-case-paths="/pa/587/0001-01">587 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/pa/587/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="200" data-cite="896 A.2d 1191" data-case-ids="3465881,8431353" data-case-paths="/pa/587/0001-01,/a2d/896/1191-01">896 A.2d 1191</a>, 1239 (2006)).</p>

The presentence report was prepared by Dennis Martell and was dated December 11, 1989, while the pre-sentence mental health evaluation prepared by Lawrence Byrne, M.Ed., was dated November 20, 1989. Presumably, the PCRA court intended its citation to the pre-sentence report as corroboration that there was something to be found in a mental health diagnosis contemporaneous to the trial, and that the evidence in the school records should have triggered an inquiry by counsel along those lines.</p>

In a responsive opinion in a previous case, I appended a ready example of the effective use of such evidence, developed upon the cross-examination of a Commonwealth mental-health expert. <em>See Commonwealth v.

For instance, the forensic psychiatrist candidly acknowledged the profound psychological impact of childhood trauma and deprivation, in terms of fostering poor impulse control and lack of judgment, insight, and reasoning. <em>See <a href="/pa/577/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="284" data-cite="846 A.2d 105" data-case-ids="91641,91719,9252174,9252208" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0472-01,/pa/577/0473-01,/a2d/846/0105-01,/a2d/846/0105-02">id.</a> </em>Although it may be observed that this sort of explanatory mitigation evidence may be viewed negatively by some jurors, it must also be borne in mind that the defense need only gain the support of one of twelve jurors to evade a death sentence. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 254-57, 104 A.3d at 303-04; <em>accord Wiggins v.

By way of another example, this Court has determined that prior juvenile adjudications are "convictions” for purposes of aggravation under the death-penalty statute, <em>see Commonwealth v.

To my mind, given that juvenile adjudications are not convictions for nearly every other purpose, it is simply impossible to say that the Court is engaging in narrow construction, while it is simultaneously disregarding the statutorily-prescribed treatment of such adjudications for purposes of aggravation in capital punishment.</p>
