The residence was the central unit of a two-story triplex built in 1998-99, and purchased by the Tinchers in 2005. The fire was eventually extinguished and no persons were harmed. Subsequently, investigators concluded that a lightning strike near the Tinchers’ home caused a small pune<a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>ture in the corrugated stainless steel tubing (“CSST”) transporting natural gas to a fireplace located on the first floor of the residence. The CSST installed in the Tinchers’ home was manufactured and sold by Omega Flex as part of a gas transportations system marketed as the TracPipe System. The heat attending the melting of the CSST caused by the lightning strike ignited the natural gas and fueled a fire estimated to have burned for over an hour. The fire caused significant damage to the Tinchers’ home and belongings.</p>
    <p id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[266,759,1146,356]]]'>After the fire, the Tinchers reported the incident to their insurer, United Services Automobile Association (“USAA”). USAA compensated the Tinchers for their loss up to the limit of their policy and received an assignment of liability claims. The Tinchers suffered an additional out-of-pocket loss because a portion of their claimed loss exceeded the limits of the USAA policy.</p>
    <p id="b354-5" data-blocks='[["BL_354.6",354,[265,1140,1149,412]]]'>In January 2008, the Tinchers filed a complaint against Omega Flex in the Chester County Court of Common Pleas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> USAA prosecuted the claims in the name of the Tinchers to obtain reimbursement of the insurance proceeds payout, but the Tinchers retained an interest in the litigation to recover the losses exceeding their insurance coverage.

Complaint, 3/18/2008, at ¶¶ 19-25 (citing Restatement (2d) of Torts § 402A). The Tinchers alleged that Omega Flex is liable for damages to their home caused by the placement on the market and sale of the TracPipe System. According to the Tinchers, the CSST incorporated into the TracPipe System is defective, and unreasonably dangerous to <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>intended users, because its walls are too thin to withstand the effects of lightning. The Tinchers requested compensatory damages, interest, fees, and costs of litigation. Omega Flex answered the complaint denying the Tinchers’ allegations. The matter was assigned to the Honorable Ronald C. Nagle, Senior Judge of the Chester County Court of Common Pleas. The parties proceeded with discovery and the filing of dispositive motions, which the trial court denied.</p>
    <p id="b355-5" data-blocks='[["BL_355.5",355,[187,712,1153,522]]]'>In September 2010, in anticipation of trial, Omega Flex filed a motion in limine requesting the application of Sections 1 and 2 of the Third Restatement of Torts to the Tinchers’ strict liability claim. Omega Flex also proposed jury instructions and findings of fact consistent with the provisions of the Third Restatement. The Tinchers opposed Omega Flex’s motion in limine and offered proposed jury instructions and findings of fact consistent with the Second Restatement and <em>Azzarello, supra. </em>The trial court did not resolve Omega Flex’s motion before trial. <em>See </em>Notes of Testimony, 8/12/2011, at 17-22.</p>

At trial, the Tinchers offered evidence regarding the events of June 20, 2007, the subsequent investigation into the cause of the fire, the losses sustained by the Tinchers, and USAA’s process of adjusting the insurance claim. The parties generally agreed that lightning had caused the fire, although they disagreed as to the sequence of events or the cause of ignition in the area of the fireplace. The Tinchers offered evidence that lightning transferred an electrical charge to parts of the home, including the TracPipe System; the electrical current then sought ground and created different electrical charges in the various metal components of the structure. The Tinchers’ expert witnesses testified that a flow of energy between a differently charged TracPipe and another metal component of the home caused an electrical arc, and the accompanying heat punctured the CSST and ignited the natural gas that the CSST transported. According to the Tinchers’ expert, the perforation in the corrugated stainless steel tubing from the Tinchers’ home was “characteristic of a lightning strike, not anything else.” By comparison, Omega <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>Flex’s witnesses testified that lightning measured near the Tinchers’ home on the night of the fire did not carry sufficient energy to puncture the CSST. According to these witnesses, once lightning entered the house, lightning-related high voltages — although with low energy — broke down the insulation on electrical wires and, if the circuit breakers did not interrupt the current, the electrical current caused the fire. Omega Flex also responded that the conditions of the Tinchers’ home after the fire and after the investigation, during which part of the evidence had been removed from its original location, made it impossible to confirm the Tinchers’ theory. Finally, Omega Flex offered evidence that an attempt had been made to bond the TracPipe System to the cold water pipe at the Tinchers’ residence which, if successful, would have prevented the electrical arc — and the resulting fire — from occurring. Witnesses testified that, after the fire, a bonding clamp had been found connected to the CSST and near but disconnected from the cold water pipe. The parties offered competing testimony as to whether the clamp had been attached to the cold water pipe before the fire.</p>
    <p id="b356-5" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[249,1356,1151,958]]]'>Relevant to their strict liability theory, the Tinchers offered testimony regarding a defect in the TracPipe from experts in electrical engineering and metallurgy, electrical arc physics, and material science — Mr. Mark Goodson and Dr. Thomas Eager, respectively. These experts opined that CSST is inherently defective because its wall is 1/100 of an inch thick— the width of four sheets of paper — and, as a result, the probability is “very high,” “close to a hundred percent,” that a lightning-generated current will perforate it. By comparison, an alternative natural gas conduit made of black iron pipe is ten times thicker for a half-inch diameter pipe similar to the CSST present in the Tincher home. According to the witnesses, CSST withstands the transfer of ten times less energy than black iron pipe and, given the same energy, the amount of time to puncture CSST is 1/100 the amount of time required to puncture black iron pipe. Experts estimated that an electric arc is fifty thousand to a million times more likely to perforate CSST than black iron pipe.</p>
    <p id="b357-4" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[179,273,1150,682]]]'>
      <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>The witnesses acknowledged that the energy transferred by any particular lightning strike is difficult to predict and cannot be replicated in a lab, but concluded that the probability was high that CSST would be punctured by occurrences within expected ranges of electrical current. Such results, according to the Tinchers’ experts, are observable and predictable with equations developed in the Nineteenth Century. Nevertheless, the experts noted that Omega Flex had not conducted testing on the TracPipe’s ability to withstand lightning strikes, although testing for resistance to lightning was necessary and available. Moreover, according to the Tinchers’ evidence, the Omega Flex installation guide failed to direct compliance with lightning-related fire protection codes.</p>
    <p id="b357-5" data-blocks='[["BL_357.5",357,[180,978,1153,782]]]'>The Tinchers’ witnesses also testified that Omega Flex recommended grounding the TracPipe system by plugging any natural gas-fueled appliances into three-prong outlets. Additional grounding, although attempted at the Tinchers’ residence, was not required by the installation instructions provided by Omega Flex to professionals to whom TracPipe was marketed and sold for installation in consumers’ homes. Moreover, according to the Tinchers’ experts, the bonding of the TracPipe System at one location would be insufficient to protect the CSST from the effects of lightning. To be effective, the witnesses testified, bonding would be required every ten feet, which the experts deemed to be an impractical and unfeasible solution. The alternative would be to encase the CSST in black iron pipe. <em>See </em>N.T., 10/13/2010, at 291-98, 357-420.</p>
    <p id="b357-6" data-blocks='[["BL_357.6",357,[181,1791,1149,299]]]'>After the Tinchers rested, Omega Flex moved for a nonsuit, citing the standard of the Second Restatement and <em>Azzarello; </em>Omega Flex expressly assumed that the trial court had denied its request to apply the Third Restatement.

The witnesses were Dr. James Dydo, an expert in metallurgy and mechanical engineering <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>with a focus on fuel gas piping, and Dr. Michael Stringfellow, an expert in physics with a focus on lightning and the protection of structures from lightning. The Omega Flex experts opined that the TraePipe System is not defective or unreasonably dangerous. According to the defense experts, CSST is a technology with significant advantages, including resistance to corrosion, structural shifts, and mechanical ruptures; ease of installation, relocation, and retrofitting; and fewer joints accompanied by decreased susceptibility to natural gas leaks at any required joints. The experts noted that these net benefits are marked advantages over black iron pipe arising from the flexibility of CSST. If CSST’s walls were thickened, according to the experts, there would be little practical difference between CSST and black iron pipe.</p>
    <p id="b358-4" data-blocks='[["BL_358.5",358,[255,1022,1149,570]]]'>The defense witnesses also testified that the TraePipe System meets and exceeds all standards for minimum performance governing CSST developed by the American National Standards Institute, a clearinghouse for trade groups. Additionally, the witnesses stated, installation of the TraePipe System conforms with the Fuel Gas Code and the National Electric Code in force in 1998-99. The experts emphasized that these applicable standards did not anticipate intrusion by lightning as a possible safety concern, suggesting that it was unnecessary for Omega Flex to have foreseen any danger from lightning.</p>
    <p id="b358-5" data-blocks='[["BL_358.6",358,[254,1617,1148,456]]]'>Finally, Omega Flex’s experts agreed that the installation instructions for the TraePipe System did not require installation of a bonding clamp. The witnesses also noted, however, that a disconnected clamp was consistent with Omega Flex’s assessment of the circumstances surrounding the fire. The experts offered that the attempt to bond the TraePipe System to the cold water pipe was inadequate and that a successful attempt would have likely averted the resulting fire. <em>Id. </em>at 657-712.</p>

The risk of loss for injuries resulting from the defective product is best warned [sic] by the person who manufactured it, principally because they are the ones that put it in the stream of commerce and said it would work for its intended purpose.</blockquote>

First, according to Omega Flex, judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial were appropriate under the Second Restatement because lightning protection, the safe conduction of electricity, or even a foreseeable event such as the fire are not intended uses of the TracPipe System. In the alternative, Omega Flex argued that, once the Tinchers offered evidence that lightning was a “foreseeable” event, the dispute paradigm changed from a typical Second Restatement design defect case to a fireworthiness/crashworthiness case, which required the trial court to issue a jury instruction that the Tinchers had the burden to prove the existence of an alternative safer design similar to the burden articulated by the Third Restatement.</p>

Returning to its fíreworthiness doctrine theory, Omega Flex emphasized that the trial court’s Azzarello-based instructions on the Second Restatement confused the jury: first, by mentioning, without explaining, the relevance of evidence of a proposed alternative design, <em>ie., </em>the black pipe system; second, by failing to guide the jury on the burden of proof relating to the alternative design; and, third, by failing to explain how the jury should consider the role of lightning in assessing liability. Additionally, Omega Flex argued that the failure to charge the jury, and relatedly the absence from the verdict sheet, of foreseeability-based principles and elements <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>related to the existence of a safer alternative design, erroneously lessened the Tinchers’ burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 31-40.</p>

The Tinchers explained that the decision in <em>General Services </em>was distinguishable on the facts: in <em>General Services, </em>the product released harmful chemicals when exposed to a fire caused by unrelated events; because the fire was not an intended use of the product, this Court held that strict liability principles were inapplicable. By comparison, the Tinchers noted that the allegations in this matter were that the defect in CSST even when employed for its intended use, <em>ie., </em>carrying natural gas, caused the fire; these allegations implicated a manufacturer’s strict liability for the alleged defect. The Tinchers then argued that the evidence offered at trial was sufficient to support the trial court’s gateway decision related to the risk-utility analysis as well as the jury’s ultimate verdict. The Tinchers also responded that the Third Restatement was not applicable in Pennsylvania and that, until this Court adopts the Third Restatement, the governing law remains the Second Restatement. Moreover, the Tinchers asserted that the Third Circuit’s prediction that this Court would eventually adopt the Third Restatement is premature and unwarranted, citing the Superior Court decisions in <em>Gaudio, <a href="/a2d/976/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="976 A.2d 524" data-case-ids="7295134" data-case-paths="/a2d/976/0524-01">supra,</a> </em>and <em>French v.

According to the trial court, the Tinchers’ case did not relate to how the TraePipe performed during the fire, as in <em>General Services; </em>rather, the defect in the TraePipe they pursued was the proximate cause of the Tinchers’ injuries.

The trial court, Omega Flex argued, following existing decisional law, instructed the jury inadequately, noting in particular that the Tinchers were not “required to prove the existence of a feasible alternative design to prevail on [their] strict-liability claim.” Omega Flex claimed that the trial court erred in denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict premised upon error in instructing the jury, and requested a new trial on this basis.

According to Omega Flex, the Second Restatement was “focused” on allegations of manufacturing defects rather than design defects and did not address the latter “meaningfully, if at all.” Nevertheless, Omega Flex recounts, Pennsylvania and other jurisdictions have applied the Second Restatement articulation to design defects. Omega Flex states that early applications of the Second Restatement in Pennsylvania called for a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether the product, as designed, was defective or unreasonably dangerous; this approach “was squarely in the mainstream of American tort law.” But, in 1978, according to Omega Flex, the decision in <em>Azzarello </em>altered the legal landscape of products liability in Pennsylvania by divorcing prod<a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>ucts strict liability from principles of negligence, and by directing the trial court — rather than the jury — to make the only determination, upon a lower burden of proof, regarding the defectiveness/dangerousness of the product.</p>
    <p id="b368-4" data-blocks='[["BL_368.5",368,[250,508,1153,1424]]]'>Omega Flex argues that <em>Azzarello </em>is theoretically unsound and unworkable in practice, suggesting that we should disapprove the decision. Initially, Omega Flex claims that a core principle familiar in negligence law — reasonableness—inherently infuses strict liability law: a product is defective only if “unreasonably” dangerous. Omega Flex explains that a manufacturer is not the insurer of the consumer for any injury caused by its product and may be held liable only if the product is “defective.” As a practical matter, according to Omega Flex, a design is not defective “in the abstract,” as a function of the injury caused a particular plaintiff, but as a function of its risks and utilities. Omega Flex emphasizes that any product may cause injury, yet not every product is “defective” as that concept is properly understood in the law of strict liability — of note are inherently dangerous products such as knives and lighters. On this premise, Omega Flex suggests that the risk-utility calculus is essentially a matter of whether the manufacturer departed from the proper and reasonable standards of care. “To condemn a design for being unreasonably dangerous is inescapably to condemn the designer for having been negligent.” Appellant’s Brief at 29 (citing James A. Henderson, Jr. and Aaron D. Twerski, Achieving a Consensus on Defective Product Design, <a href="/citations/?q=83%20Cornell%20L.%20Rev.%20867" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="83 Cornell L. Rev. 867">83 Cornell L.Rev. 867</a>, 919 (1998)).

The difficulty, according to Omega Flex, is that the Court’s decision nevertheless prohibited the trial court from submitting to the jury the factual question of whether the product was unreasonably dangerous. Omega Flex notes that, per <em>Azzarello, </em>juries are instructed to determine whether a product is defective unmoored from any inquiry into the product’s risks and utilities and the reasonableness of the manufacturer’s conduct.

Boardman, </em><a href="/pa/608/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="608 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="4199397" data-case-paths="/pa/608/0327-01">608 Pa. 327</a>, <a href="/pa/608/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="11 A.3d 924" data-case-ids="4199397,7288569" data-case-paths="/pa/608/0327-01,/a3d/11/0924-01">11 A.3d 924</a>, 940 (2011)). In this case, Omega Flex notes, the trial court offered the standard <em>Azzarello </em>charge, which instructed the jury to decide whether the TracPipe System was defective without any reference to whether the product was unreasonably dangerous. Omega Flex argues that, absent a determination of whether the risk was unreasonable, the jury may well have found that any risk — including a justified risk— rendered the TracPipe System defective. The <em>Azzarello </em>instruction, Omega Flex claims, does not offer the jury any guidance as to the critical concepts of defect and whether the product is “safe for its intended use.” Moreover, Omega Flex argues that the use of the term of art “guarantor” in relation to the product, without any explanation of its meaning, misleads the jury into holding manufacturers absolutely liable for any injuries caused by the product. Omega Flex further offers that the jury’s verdict in its favor on the negligence claim here suggests confusion of the jury with respect to the standards applicable to the strict liability claim. The <em>Azzarello </em>instructions, Omega Flex emphasizes, have “profoundly unfair consequences” to a manufacturer against whom design defect claims are made. <em>Id. </em>at 35-38.</p>

Omega Flex recommends the Third Restatement on the grounds that its articulation of the law is specifically intended to address design defects and represents the current mainstream view on the topic. According to Omega Flex, the Third Restatement was drafted by “two prominent product-liability scholars,” Professors James Henderson and Aaron Twerski, and was reviewed in a comprehensive process.

Omega Flex describes the Third Restatement as requiring, in design defect cases, a balancing of risks and benefits by the finder of fact, upon consideration of a broad range of factors. The critical distinction in approaches, as described by Omega Flex, is that “the plaintiff could not simply criticize the existing design; instead, the plaintiff would be required to prove that the manufacturer could and should have adopted a reasonable alternative design.” <em><a href="/pa/576/0644-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="841 A.2d 1000" data-case-ids="16773,9286806" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0644-01,/a2d/841/1000-01">Id.</a> </em>at 47 (citing Restatement (3d) of Torts: Products Liability § 2(b) cmt. d).

The Tinchers claim that “defect” is difficult to define: the critical consideration is whether the product is unreasonably dangerous. According to the Tinchers, because the question of unreasonable dangerousness “could easily be confused by a jury as importing concepts of negligence into a strict liability analysis,” the <em>Azzarello </em>Court directed that decision to the trial court rather than to the jury.

In the Tinchers’ view, the Third Restatement represents “an instrument of tort reform” rather than an articulation of existing law, which will impose a prohibitive cost on plaintiffs and counsel to produce alternative designs in the pursuit of otherwise meritorious claims. <em><a href="/citations/?q=38%20Duq.%20L.%20Rev.%201059" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="38 Duq.

The Third Restatement, according to the Tinchers, is a boon to manufacturers by placing at a “tremendous disadvantage” injured consumers who would necessarily have to become experts and seek to redesign the product that caused the injury; the cost of this exercise may exceed the benefit of a recovery. Additionally, the Tinchers argue that the attendant costs of representing an injured plaintiff in a Third Restatement jurisdiction would discourage <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>counsel from representing injured consumers. The Tinchers suggest that application of the Third Restatement would vitiate the public policy upon which products liability law is premised, <em>i.e., </em>of holding manufacturers liable for defects in products placed in the stream of commerce; manufacturers are in a better position to absorb the costs of injuries than are individual consumers.</p>

With regard to the Third Restatement, Omega Flex argues that the “reasonable alternative design” element of proof does not erect the types of insurmountable barriers to meritorious claims that the Tinchers portray: plaintiffs may adduce proof of existing products <em>(ie., </em>predecessor products or competitor products) or no expert proof at all if the feasibility of an alternative design is obvious and understandable to lay persons. Appellant’s Reply Brief at 20 (citing Restatement (3d) of Torts-. Products Liability § 2 cmt. f). Omega Flex presents the Third Restatement as a refinement of its predecessor with specific provisions for design defects, whose approach has already been accepted in the form of numerous exceptions to the general Second Restatement rules. Moreover, Omega Flex claims that, con<a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>trary to the Tinchers’ representations, adherence to the Second Restatement view has become the minority position.

In part, this is a function of how the issues were presented to the lower courts and of the lower courts’ recognition that the question of whether to “move” to the Third Restatement has been a matter of debate and speculation in interested legal circles and in federal court cases (as well as in separate opinions in this Court); all recognize that, as a common law matter, the decision of whether to adopt principles from the Third Restatement would ultimately be made by this Court. As a result of this background circumstance, the lower courts offered no principled assessment or practical perspective regarding the core, and strictly legal, positions now presented by the parties to this Court. While the importance of lower courts’ analysis of a proposed change in the law as applied to the facts of a particular case and the centrality of such analysis to the development of the common law cannot be understated, we note, nevertheless, that there is no suggestion by either party that the issue so presented was waived. <em>See Scampone v.

This Court has grown more careful over the years when presented with invitations to issue broad-based pronouncements in areas where it is apparent that such pronouncements are better suited to the information-gathering and give-and-take balancing of competing concerns available in the legislative arena. Thus, for example, it is difficult to imagine a modern court simply adopting something so broad-based and legislative in character as an outside organization’s Restatement of the Law, even if it is the product of an esteemed organization. That being said, the fact is that, in this particular area of the law, the Court has played a major developmental role; and when an issue is properly joined in a case, we are of course duty-bound to resolution and explication of the matter. And, in this process, while the line of demarcation between advancing or correcting the common law — or, perhaps, accounting for nuance not advanced, perceived, or predicted in the crucible of prior cases — and a foray into legislative policy-making is a gray area, some principles governing decision are readily apparent.</p>

In this sense, the adoption of a restatement formulation intended to advance the law cannot be so unmoored from existing common law and produce such a policy shift that it amounts in actuality or public perception to a derogation of legislative authority, and the concomitant suggestion that such authority is reposed in the Judiciary or in the American Law Institute. Consistent with this principle, the Court must generally show restraint in altering existing allocations of risk created by long-tenured common law rules and resist the temptation of experimentation with untested social policies, especially where the individual record and the advocacy of the parties in the context of that record offer little more than abstract justifications. Thus, the Court is not in a position to upend risks and expectations premised upon broad-based arguments calling for a judgment about socially acceptable economic incentives; the legislative setting is a preferable forum for such an endeavor. <em>See City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/622/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="125" data-cite="81 A.3d 24" data-case-ids="4281188,7301219" data-case-paths="/pa/622/0581-01,/a3d/81/0024-01">81 A.3d at 55</a>; <em>accord Pegram v.

Negligence, in tort, spoke to the notion of redress for a legal wrong or direct and forcible injury to the person, land, or chattels of another. <em>See </em>R.F.V. Heuston, Salmond on the Law of Torts 4 (17th ed.1977). Negligence theory also offered the convenience that it did not require proof of knowledge of a particular defect in the product, but simply the failure to exercise due care had the defect been foreseeable. Meanwhile, a breach of warranty action, sounding in assumpsit, was at its origin an action in tort, which “transformed into an action of contract, becoming afterwards a remedy where there was neither tort nor contract.” James Barr Ames, <em>The History of Assumpsit </em>in 3 Select Essays in Anglo-American Legal History 1, 298 (1909). The word assumpsit suggested the making of a promise and, originally, the actionable conduct was the breach of an express promise. The cause of action evolved, however, to encompass the breach of an implied promise, and even of a fictitious promise. <em>See id. </em>(commenting upon “assumpsit” as illustration of “the flexibility and power of self-development of the Common Law”). “[Wjarranty (unlike negligence which is a tort concept based on fault) is not a concept based on fault or on the failure to exercise reasonable care. But this does not mean that warranty is necessarily contractual or nontortious in nature. Liability in warranty arises where damage is caused by the failure of a product to measure up to express or implied representations on the part of the manufacturer or other supplier. Accordingly, an injured person is not required to prove negligence in a warranty-products liability case.” <em>Putman v. Erie City Mfg.

As these criminal statutes were repealed, judicial decisions referred in <em>dicta </em>to the civil liability of sellers to those to whom they sold “corrupt victuals.” <em>See </em>Prosser, 69 Yale L.J. at 1104. Early American jurisprudence denominated the special civil responsibility as “warranty,” imposed upon the seller <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>of food in favor of the direct purchaser. At the beginning of the Twentieth Century, judicial decisions extended sellers’ “strict liability” beyond the direct purchaser to injured consumers. <em>Id. </em>The decisions articulated an exception to the general rule of more direct liability premised upon proof of negligence or privity of contract. “In the beginning, these decisions displayed considerable ingenuity in evolving more or less fictitious theories of liability to fit the case. The various devices included an agency of the intermediate dealer or another to purchase for the consumer, or to sell for the seller; a theoretical assignment of the seller’s warranty to the intermediate dealer; a third party beneficiary contract; and an implied representation that the food was fit for consumption because it was placed on the market, as well as numerous others.” Restatement (2d) of Torts § 402A cmt. b. Later jurisprudence settled upon a theory of warranty “running with the goods” or made directly to the consumer; the alternative was strict liability in tort. After 1950, jurisdictions extended the rule of strict liability beyond the sale of food for human consumption, to other products intended for intimate bodily use. Finally, in the late 1950s, courts began applying these developed rules of strict liability to the sale of any product. <em>Id.; see also </em>Prosser, 69 Yale L.J. at 1103-14 (stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that Pennsylvania had extended application of a heightened responsibility to sellers of products other than food in <em>Jarnot v.

The <em>Miller </em>plaintiff was the estate administrator of a deceased infant, who was fatally injured when a vaporizer-humidifier used to relieve congestion in his nose shot boiling water on his body. The plaintiff filed a complaint asserting a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability against the manufacturer, the distributor, and the retail pharmacy that had sold the vaporizer-humidifier to the deceased infant’s aunt. The infant had used the product in the aunt’s home, next door to his family’s home. In relevant part, the trial court sustained preliminary objections to the complaint, on the ground that the implied warranty did not extend to the deceased infant because he had not been in privity of contract with any of the defendants.</p>

(By comparison, the <em>Webb </em>plaintiff had pursued an action in tort on a theory of negligence.) Additionally, the <em>Miller </em>Court affirmed the judgment in favor of the manufacturer and of the distributor, reasoning that the Code’s provisions did not extend warranty liability to remote sellers in the chain of distribution. <em><a href="/citations/?q=220%20A.2d%20853" class="citation" data-index="172" data-cite="220 A.2d 853">Id.</a> </em>at 324 (citing 12A P.S. § 2-318).

The plaintiff proceeded on theories of negligence and strict liability in the design and manufacture of the brake locking mechanism. At the close of evidence, the trial court granted summary relief to the manufacturer on the negligence claim and submitted the strict liability claims to the jury; the jury was dismissed when it could not agree on a verdict. Subsequently, the trial court granted the manufacturer’s motion for judgment on the record. On appeal, this Court reversed the trial court’s judgment and awarded the plaintiff a new trial. Justice Pomeroy’s OAJC reasoned that evidence relating to the accident, in addition to the occurrence of five similar malfunctions of the locking mechanism, was sufficient to show that the product was defective, even absent direct evidence of a specific defect. According to the OAJC, in the absence of other identifiable causes, the malfunction itself was evidence of a defective condition; “[t]his rule reflects the fact that liability under [Section] 402A turns on a lack of fitness in the defendant’s product, as in the case of an action for breach of warranty, rather than on the breach of a particular duty of care by the defendant, as in the case of an action for negligence.” The OAJC continued: “[w]hile a plaintiffs hand in a <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>strict liability case will obviously be strengthened by evidence of a specific defect in the defendant’s product such evidence is not necessary to take ... the plaintiffs case to a jury.” <em>Id. </em>at 920.</p>

Chief Justice Jones explained that the result of limiting the liability of a seller premised upon a “reasonable man” standard, which the clause “unreasonably dangerous” could suggest, protects the seller from becoming “an insurer of his products with respect to all harm generated by their use.” But, such standard would also require an injured consumer-plaintiff to prove an element of negligence, which means in practice that, regardless of the injured consumer’s expectations regarding the product, the injured consumer would be unable to recover if an “ordinary consumer” would have expected the product’s defective condition.

The difficulties arose from the happenstance of the idiosyncratic procedural postures of cases in which the Court nevertheless apparently sought to make conceptual advances in the arena. To start, the <em>Webb </em>Court “adopted” the Second Restatement and remanded the case to the trial court for application, without offering much explanation of either how Section 402A derived from or complemented existing common law, or direction concerning its application by the lower courts, including the realm of jury charges. The procedural posture of <em>Webb </em>— an appeal from a trial court decision sustaining preliminary objections — and some consensus regarding the direction of the law, perhaps explain the approach. The concurring and dissenting expressions in <em>Miller, </em>upon which the <em>Webb </em>Court relied, offered a more reasoned explanation for the availability of strict liability in tort as a separate cause of action and attenuated, to a degree, the stark approach of the summary <em>Webb </em>majority decision.

In the subsequent decade, foundational issues regarding the strict liability in tort cause of action did not reach the Supreme Court or, when questions were presented, expressions failed to command clear majority support. To the extent that the Court spoke to broader considerations, several trends became evident: the original prominence of warranty-related attempts to limit application of strict liability theory decreased, and the relevance of negligence-related <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>encroachments commenced its ascent; rhetoric emerged not only to distinguish strict liability from its negligence roots, but also to excise negligence principles and terms (such as foreseeability) from strict liability theory; the reliance upon formulaic reiteration of consumer protection-related policies, offered as a bulwark against attempts to dilute the application of strict liability theory in individual cases; and then a focus in strict liability theory that ultimately turned upon a statutory construction-type of analysis of the Second Restatement.

The Court concluded that the words “unreasonably dangerous” explain the term “defective” but have “no independent significance and merely represent a label to be used where it is determined that the <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>risk of loss should be placed upon the supplier.” The words “unreasonably dangerous” limit liability and signal that a seller is not an insurer but a guarantor of the product. However, the difficulty with the use of the term in jury instructions, the Court reasoned, was that it signaled to the jury that the consumer has the burden to prove an element of negligence. According to the Court, in strict liability cases, burdening a plaintiff with proof of negligence is unwarranted; the seller’s liability is limited “by the necessity of proving that there was a defect in the manufacture or design of the product, and that such defect was a (legal) cause of the injuries.” <em>Id. </em>at 1025 (quoting <em>Cronin, </em><a href="/citations/?q=104%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20433" class="citation" data-index="203" data-cite="104 Cal.

Indeed, according to the Court, the formulation of the Second Restatement was not intended to articulate jury instructions but employed principles designed instead to predict responsibility and to guide the professional bench and bar. The Court then concluded that the best means to implement the principles of the Second Restatement was to direct: (1) that the phrases “defective condition” and “unreasonably dangerous,” which predict whether recovery would be justified, are issues of law and policy entrusted solely for decision to the trial court; and (2) that the inquiry into whether a plaintiff has proven the factual allegations in the complaint is a question for the jury. According to the Court, in cases of an alleged defective design, the dispositive question is whether the product is safe for its intended use. The Court emphasized that the seller is the “guarantor” of the product, and a jury could find a defect “where the product left the supplier’s control lacking any element necessary to make it safe for its intended use or possessing any feature that renders it unsafe for the intended use.” <em><a href="/pa/462/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="206" data-cite="462 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="485148" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0083-01">Id.</a> </em>at 1027 (citing <em>Berkebile, </em><a href="/pa/462/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="207" data-cite="462 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="485148" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0083-01">337 A.2d at 902</a>).

The core objectives of the Second Restatement had been to relieve consumer-plaintiffs of the burden of proving that the supplier had exercised due care in the manufacturing process (necessary to prove negligence), and to spread the risk of loss among consumers.

As a result, while the rhetoric of retaining a firm separation between strict liability and negligence remained pervasive in decisional law, in application, the distinction was unnecessary: “[i]n design cases the character of the product and the conduct of the manufacturer are largely inseparable.” The concurrence advocated recognition of the essential role played by negligence-derived risk-utility balancing in design defect litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 1015-16.</p>

According to the concurrence, courts have implemented the <em>Azzarello </em>decision by: (1) assigning the risk-utility balancing to trial courts on the facts most favorable to the plaintiff; and (2) providing juries with minimalistic instructions that, in an effort to insulate the jury from negligence terminology, “lack essential guidance concerning the nature of the central conception of product defect.” Because the jury is not permitted to consider the cost-benefit factors, neither judge nor jury “actually decide whether the true benefits of the proposed alternative design outweigh the true cost” and whether the product is in fact unreasonably dangerous or defective. Furthermore, the concurrence added that, by omitting the critical “unreasonably dangerous” limitation on liability or cost-benefit instructions, the Azzarello-approved charge fails to define the term “defect” clearly, and consequently fails to guide the jury in distinguishing products safe and unsafe for their intended use. <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>The concurrence also noted that the use of the term “guarantor” in relation to the manufacturer is not a sufficient limitation on liability, especially because the term “to a lay jury will surely seem indistinguishable from ‘insurer.’ ” <a href="/pa/576/0644-01" class="citation" data-index="238" data-cite="841 A.2d 1000" data-case-ids="16773,9286806" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0644-01,/a2d/841/1000-01">841 A.2d at </a>1016-18 (citing Thomas, 71 Temp.

According to the concurrence, the Third Restatement’s negligence-derived standard represents “the distilled expression of thirty years of design-defect litigation.” The concurrence summarized the general rule of the Third Restatement as follows: “a product is deemed defective in design when the foreseeable risks could have been reduced or avoided by the use of a reasonable alternative design, and when the failure to utilize such a design has caused the product to be ‘not reasonably safe.’” The concurrence explained that design defect liability under the Third Restatement is predicated upon a concept of responsibility in which the determination is made by reference to an independent assessment of advantages and disadvantages, rather than by reference to the manufacturer’s own design or marketing standards, which are in fact alleged to be unreasonable by the plaintiff. Moreover, the concurrence stressed, products are not defective simply because they are dangerous. Relevant to the issue in <em>Phillips, </em>the concurrence added that the Third Restatement expressly incorporates notions of reasonable foreseeability that would temper the exclusive reliance on the risk-utility test. In the view of the concurrence, the Third Restatement provided the best-balanced and reasoned approach to strict liability in Pennsylvania. On a final note, the concurrence opined that application of the strict liability doctrine should be closely limited until the existing substantial deficiencies in the strict liability schema are addressed and remedied by the Court.</p>

The dissent also noted that the categorical divide between strict liability and negligence principles, articulated in the cases, is most readily justified in manufacturing defect cases; claims implicating design or warning defect, however, are far more problematic. Relevant to design defect claims, the dissent explained that doctrinal limiting principles evolved to contain the liability of product suppliers because traditional notions of strict liability were ill-suited to a tort regime with a largely open-ended damages scheme and the reality that all product designs are capable of contributing to human injury.

The Court explained this decision by saying that: “While a lay finder of fact is obviously competent in resolving a dispute as to the condition of a product, an entirely different question is presented where a decision as to whether that condition justifies placing liability upon the supplier must be made.” The Court then suggested that it is within the trial court’s bailiwick to answer questions of law whose resolution “depends upon social policy” such as: “Should an ill-conceived design which exposes the user to the risk of harm entitle one injured by the product to recover?

They do not fall "within the orbit of a factual dispute which is properly assigned to the jury for resolution.” Without further explanation of these broad assumptions, bottomed on notions of social policy, the Court concluded that “[a] standard suggesting the existence of a ‘defect’ if the article is unreasonably dangerous or not duly safe is inadequate to guide a lay jury” and adopted in its stead a formulation by which the seller would be held liable unless the seller “provide[d] with the product every element necessary to make it safe for use.” <a href="/pa/480/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="311" data-cite="480 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="1745082" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0547-01">391 A.2d at 1025-27</a> (quoting <em>Berkebile, </em><a href="/pa/462/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="312" data-cite="462 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="485148" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0083-01">337 A.2d at 902</a> (Jones, C.J.)).

Thus, in a jurisdiction following the Second Restatement formulation of strict liability in tort, the critical inquiry in affixing liability is whether a product is “defective”; in the context of a strict liability claim, <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>whether a product is defective depends upon whether that product is “unreasonably dangerous.” Yet, <em>Azzarello </em>divorced one inquiry from the other: under the <em>Azzarello </em>scheme, the trial court serves as the gate-keeper of one question with the apparent task of deciding as a matter of law and policy whether a product is one even susceptible to a strict liability claim. As a practical matter, the <em>Azzarello </em>decision did not indicate at which point of the trial the court should consider the question, nor what pleadings or evidence would be relevant to the inquiry; the Court did suggest, however, that the matter “d[id] not fall within the orbit of a factual dispute.” <a href="/pa/480/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="316" data-cite="480 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="1745082" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0547-01">391 A.2d at 1026</a>.</p>

In this case, Omega Flex moved for summary judgment before trial, a nonsuit after the close of the Tinchers’ case, and then renewed the motion for a nonsuit after both parties rested, asking the court to determine whether the TracPipe System was unreasonably dangerous. Although the trial court denied all motions, the court addressed the merits of the risk-utility calculus on the record only in the context of the motions for nonsuit. <em>See </em>N.T., 10/18/2010, at 514-15 (“The [trial cjourt had denied the [summary judgment] motion, presumably, although I don’t know for sure, because it thought this might be an issue of fact that needed to be heard at trial.”). Given the opportunity to rule on Omega Flex’s motions for nonsuit, the trial court reviewed the evidence introduced at trial before denying the motions, in addition to evidence deemed inadmissible at <em>trial </em>— ie., proof of a redesigned TracPipe System, marketed as “Counterstrike,” that was resistant to lightning strikes. <em>See <a href="/pa/480/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="317" data-cite="480 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="1745082" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0547-01">id.</a> </em>at 514-26 <em>&amp; </em>721-41; Tr.

Thus, the policy of some jurisdictions is that those who engage in the business of selling a product are subject to a duty of due care in manufacturing and selling the product. <em>See, e.g., Prentis, </em><a href="/citations/?q=365%20N.W.2d%20176" class="citation" data-index="337" data-cite="365 N.W.2d 176">365 N.W.2d at 186</a> (Michigan).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_20" id="ref_footnote_1_20">20</a> By comparison, the policy of those jurisdictions that have incorporated the Second Restatement into their common law is that those who engage in the business of selling a product are subject to both a duty of care in manufacturing and selling the product and a duty to sell a product free from a “defective condition.” The duty spoken of in strict liability is intended to be distinct from the duty of due care in negligence.

When making safety “promises” in an effort to sell its products, a manufacturer seeks to convince potential buyers that its affirmations are both valuable and true. Safety information is valuable to users because it provides a “frame of reference” that permits a user to shift his or her limited cognitive and other resources away from self-protection toward the pursuit of other goals — which in turn shifts responsibility for protecting the user to the manufacturer. In this manner, true safety information adds value to the product by enhancing the user’s autonomy, for which value the consumer fairly pays a price. So, if the information is not true but false, the purchaser loses significant autonomy, as well as the benefit of the bargain. Since an important purpose of the law is to promote autonomy, and the equality of the <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>buyer to the seller as reflected in their deal, the law fairly may demand that the seller rectify the underlying falsity and resulting inequality in the exchange transaction if harm results.</blockquote>

Sections 2 through 4, as well as Sections 6 and 7, address evidentiary questions. Notably, Section 2 identifies three types of defects and, at least with respect to “design” defect (subsection (b)), states a general rule, which defines a defect by reference to the relative risk-utility calculi for the allegedly defective product and an alternatively designed product. <em>See also </em>Henderson, 83 Cornell L.Rev. at 888-89 (alternative design is proof of technological feasibility, “an empirical factor for courts to consider in the normative process of risk-utility balancing”).

The Restatement illustrates its view that other evidence may be probative in a design defect case by articulating special rules. Thus, Sections 8, 4, and comment e to Section 2 of the Third Restatement establish alternative means for proving a design defect “in circumstances in which common experience teaches that an inference of defect may be warranted under the specific facts,” where the seller or distributor violates statutory and regulatory norms, and “when the product design is manifestly unreasonable.” Meanwhile, Sections 6 and 7 address special rules of liability for specific products: prescription drugs and medical devices, and food products. <em>See id. </em>at §§ 6-7; <em>see also </em>§ 6 cmt. f (Section 6 principle articulates judgment that liability attaches only when certain type and quantum of evidence is adduced by plaintiff; noting expectation that, under “this very demanding objective standard, liability is likely to be imposed only under unusual circumstances”).

Initially, from a jurisprudential perspective, Omega Flex argues that the Third Restatement offers a clearer and more precise articulation of strict liability doctrine than does the Second Restatement, and adoption of the new formulation would return Pennsylvania into the mainstream in this arena. Omega Flex adds that a move to the Third Restatement is also the next logical step in the evolution of the law given that several Justices of this Court and members of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in <em>Berrier, </em>have articulated its merits and supported its application.

According to Omega Flex, the present iteration of Pennsylvania law improperly lowers the burden of proof upon plaintiffs generally. Omega Flex posits that the Third Restatement, in contrast, is a “closely reasoned and balanced approach” that enhances the fairness and efficacy of the liability scheme.

Citing representative cases from several jurisdictions, the reporters offer that an alternative-design driven risk-utility general rule — with a special consumer expectations rule for cases in which the design defect is demonstrable — reflects the consensus among American jurisdictions as to the applicable liability construct in “classic design cases.” <em>See </em>Henderson, 83 Cornell L.Rev. at 887-901. Notably, while recognizing that “tort cases are particularly fact-sensitive,” the reporters purported to undertake an “empirical study of case law” to determine whether the alternative-design driven risk-utility general rule has support in the decisional law in a majority of jurisdictions. The reporters commented that: “[t]ort cases are particularly fact-sensitive and courts are consequently prone to pepper their decisions with dicta and footnotes to allow ‘wiggle room’ for cases that <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>may arise in the future.

This approach no doubt fulfills the role of the American Law Institute in its own salutary task of restating and clarifying a view of strict liability that can be reduced to decisive terms. We also respect the effort of the Third Restatement reporters in approaching that non judicial task practically and with humility. But, what drives the Institute and treatise writers does not make comparative modesty, nuance, and reticence in the judiciary mistaken (much less indecisive) in a jurisdiction, like Pennsylvania, where the area, to date, has been the exclusive province of the common law.</p>

That the more typical case implicates the type of products and circumstances in which evidence of an alternative product design is the most persuasive and efficient means of convincing the trier of fact may also be true. That offering evidence of an alternative product design may be the preferred legal strategy of the plaintiffs bar in certain cases — or may be a strategy the defense bar would like to impose on the plaintiffs bar in certain cases — again may also be true. But, while the reporters’ intuition that meritorious cases are premised upon certain types of evidence may have some general validity and support in practice (and may prove helpful to litigants in articulating claims and preparing defenses), the reporters’ commentary candidly betrays a problem — for the judiciary at least — of perspective. Principally, at least in a climate where suggestions are made along the lines of simply “adopting” or “moving to” a Restatement construct, it is our view that the reporters’ “precise and categorical” perspective insufficiently accounts for the imperatives of the courts’ more modest decisional role, by, for example, describing the reasoned and purposeful articulation of general principles as “dicta.”</p>

Of course, these cases may, by analogy and distinction, illuminate general principles at issue; but, purporting to limit the general rule to the facts of those cases is anathema to the common law.

Essentially, strict liability is a theory that effectuates a further shift of the risk of harm onto the supplier than either negligence or breach of warranty theory by combining the balancing of interests inherent in those two causes of action.</p>

The prominence of the legal issue in decisional law coincides with the advent of design defect claims, in which issues of proof tend to more complexity than where a manufacturing defect is in dispute. This development reflected the complex litigation calculus implicated in a strict liability claim premised upon this type of defect resulting from either lack of proof (for example in the case of known or foreseeable risks for which an available cure may or may not have been available at the time of design) or the relative deterrent inefficacy of a theory of liability for unknowable risks, short of exiting the market. <em>Accord </em>Prosser, 69 Yale L.J. at 1116 (“So long as there is the possibility that negligence may not be found, the defendant is encouraged by vain hopes, and the plaintiff gnawed by lingering doubts; and a case which can be decided for the defendant is worth less, in terms of settlement, than one which can not.

Yet, some types of disputes are absent from the decisional law and may, indeed, provide rather strong evidence of strict liability as a deterrent by preventing bringing a product to market or encouraging settlement of claims — it must be remembered that an appellate expression is not necessary to illustrate the point that designers are properly deterred by strict liability from using consumers as guinea pigs. <em>See </em>Henderson, 83 Cornell L.Rev. at 901 (“Some courts, in <em>dicta, </em>hold out the possibility that the risk-utility imbalance might be so egregious that the product should not be marketed at all.

Going forward, consistent with this decision, when a plaintiff proceeds on a theory that implicates a risk-utility calculus, proof of risks and utilities are part of the burden to prove that the harm suffered was due to the defective condition of the product. The credibility of witnesses and testimony offered, the weight of evidence relevant to the risk-utility calculus, and whether a party has met the burden to prove the elements of the strict liability cause of action are issues for the finder of fact, whether that finder of fact is judge or jury. A question of whether the party has met its burden of proof is properly “removed” — for example, via adjudication of a dispositive motion — “from the jury’s consideration only where it is clear that reasonable minds [cannot] differ on the issue.” <em>Hamil v.

While the risk of error in a particular adjudication does not vary depending on the standard of proof adopted, the burden allocates that risk between the parties.” <em>Sanchez, </em><a href="/pa/613/0639-01" class="citation" data-index="500" data-cite="36 A.3d 24" data-case-ids="4205851,4207029,7295141,7295171" data-case-paths="/pa/613/0639-01,/pa/614/0001-01,/a3d/36/0024-01,/a3d/36/0024-02">36 A.3d at 65</a> (citations omitted).

A more stringent burden of production and persuasion imposes a higher risk of an erroneous decision on the party upon which the burden rests. Thus, shifting the burden of proof onto a defendant places the risk of an erroneous decision upon the defendant. The determination of whether such a shift is suitable rests, as the <em>Barker </em>court also noted, primarily on considerations of whether the shift vindicates the public policy at issue. In addition, we consider difficulties of adducing evidence to prove a negative, the parties’ relative access to evidence, and whether placing the burden of proof on one party is necessary to help enforce a further right, constitutional or otherwise. <em>See Sanchez, </em><a href="/pa/613/0639-01" class="citation" data-index="504" data-cite="36 A.3d 24" data-case-ids="4205851,4207029,7295141,7295171" data-case-paths="/pa/613/0639-01,/pa/614/0001-01,/a3d/36/0024-01,/a3d/36/0024-02">36 A.3d at 67</a>.</p>

Moreover, proving a negative is generally not desirable as a jurisprudential matter because of fairness concerns related to anticipating and rebutting allegations, and because of the encumbrances placed upon the judicial system by an open-ended approach to pleading and trying a case. Finally, evidence relevant to a risk-utility test, including the feasibility and cost of alternative designs, while involving technical matters, would seem to be within the knowledge of expert witnesses available to either plaintiff or defendant in many cases; and liberal discovery may also aid the plaintiff.</p>

Premised upon these descriptions, Omega Flex emphasizes that this <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>case reflects an "overlap” of negligence principles with the proper application of strict liability law.

Initially, the Tinchers suggest that the ‘‘Court should decline consideration of the issue [on which we granted allowance of appeal], as it is not outcome determinative, and affirm the lower court ruling.” According to the Tinchers, the circumstances of this particular case required the Tinchers to offer evidence at trial that was sufficient to meet the requirements of the Second Restatement and <em>Azzarello, </em>as well as the Third Restatement. The Tinchers argue that, as a result, "[(liability for the defective design of the TracPipe product” — and the jury’s verdict — “is appropriate under either Restatement standard."

This is an expensive, time-consuming, and wasteful process, and it may be interrupted by insolvency, lack of jurisdiction, disclaimers, or the statute of limitations, anywhere along the line.
