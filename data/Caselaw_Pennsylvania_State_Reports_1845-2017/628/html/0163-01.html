Schneller (“requestor”), of Eastern Pennsylvania Citizens Against Gambling, sent an email to Catherine Stetler, a press aide in the Office of Communications and Legislative Affairs of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (“GCB”), requesting copies of communications between the GCB and several applicants for gaming licenses, as well as copies of the financial data that each applicant provided to the GCB. He also asked for permission to speak at the GCB’s next public hearing, and copied his request to the GCB’s Director of Media Relations and Chief Enforcement Counsel. It is undisputed that requestor did not make mention of any open-records officer in his written request. On March 24, 2009, the press aide responded to the written request by return email, wherein she apologized for having been out of the office and attached a public comment sign-up form with instructions to return the completed form <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>for permission to comment at the GCB’s public hearing on the following day.

In opposition, the GCB took the position that there was no deemed denial from which an appeal could rightfully be taken under the RTKL because requestor had not submitted a valid RTKL request to its open-records officer, and therefore, the GCB had no duty to respond concerning the records requested. The OOR disagreed, concluding that the request was not defective under the RTKL, and that the GCB’s failure to respond did, in fact, constitute a deemed denial. Further, because the GCB had not offered any substantive defense to the records request, the OOR ordered the GCB to release the records within thirty days.</p>

The Commonwealth Court erred by holding that requestor’s email to a GCB press aide constituted a RTKL request triggering the procedures and remedies of the RTKL in spite of requestor’s failure to conform to the RTKL by addressing the request to the GCB’s right to know officer. In the RTKL, the General Assembly prescribed a clearly-delineated framework for receipt, review, and response to records requests. The RTKL provides that <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>agencies may fulfill verbal, written, and anonymous requests, but if the requestor seeks to invoke the remedies afforded under the RTKL, the request must be in writing. It further provides that the written request must be addressed to the open-records officer, and that upon receipt, the agency shall determine whether the record at issue is subject to disclosure. The open-records officer has five days to respond on behalf of the agency, and if the agency fails to respond -within that time-frame and fails to obtain an extension, the written request is deemed denied. A requestor denied records may then file an appeal with the OOR. This process provides a reasoned approach, while the Commonwealth Court majority’s opinion imposes burdens on all agencies that are inconsistent with the RTKL.</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.4",214,[251,1024,1152,1277]]]'>The GCB further argues that the General Assembly intended the process to be mandatory when utilized, requiring that a request “must” be addressed to the open-records officer, meaning the requestor must thereby indicate his intent to invoke the RTKL process. This requirement is not concerned with courtesy and salutation, the GCB says, but with indicating an intent to invoke the RTKL’s process in order to ensure timely processing without deemed denials, potential defaults, or detriment to third parties. Alternatively, however, the GCB asserts, agencies commonly respond to informal records requests, and citizens may desire to take advantage of this informal process rather than invoking the RTKL process, which delays the processing of requests. The Commonwealth Court’s decision, therefore, erodes efficiency by demanding that every records request to every agency employee be deemed a RTKL invocation, requiring that it be forwarded to an open-records officer for review and formal response, and all within a five-day period. The GCB stresses that because not every records request is a RTKL request, agency employees must have some means to readily determine whether a request triggers the RTKL to avoid repetition of the present controversy. In this case, the press aide did not ignore the records request, but simply had no reason to believe it was a RTKL request.</p>
    <p id="b215-3" data-blocks='[["BL_215.3",215,[159,265,1153,1164]]]'>
      <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>The OOR counters that the Commonwealth Court majority decision is consistent with plain language of RTKL, and to the extent that the RTKL is ambiguous, the RTKL must be liberally interpreted in conformity with its remedial purpose of ensuring easy access to government records and consistency with the Freedom of Information Act, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="5 U.S.C. § 552">5 U.S.C. § 552</a>. According to the OOR, all requests that are (1) written, (2) include the requestor’s name and address, and (3) are specific, should presumptively be deemed RTKL requests. The OOR posits that, where an agency fails to notify a requestor of his failure to comply with agency policies regarding access to records and an appeal is taken to the OOR, the record holding agency may overcome that presumption by application of a reasonably prudent person standard. Here, the OOR says, the Commonwealth Court’s critical findings of fact are that requestor complied with these three prerequisites for a presumptively valid RTKL request, and that he reasonably forwarded that presumptively valid RTKL request to persons familiar with the RTKL. Because the GCB does not argue that these findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence, the OOR reasons that the Commonwealth Court’s decision should be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b215-4" data-blocks='[["BL_215.4",215,[164,1460,1150,688]]]'>The OOR further emphasizes that the General Assembly’s intent to provide access to public records cannot be ignored, even in the face of real or perceived procedural defects. The remedial purpose of the RTKL governs, and therefore, to the extent that the parts of Section 703 at issue are irreconcilable, under 1 Pa.C.S. § 1934, the last sentence must control such that RTKL requests can be properly sent to any agency employee. Thus, in the OOR’s view, this Court should enforce the directive that employees forward requests to the open-records officer over the provision that requests must be addressed to the open-records officer. Further, reading the operative provisions together, as opposed to reading them as being in conflict, the OOR argues:</p>

Moreover, the GCB failed to list the name of its open-records officer on its website.

Thus, the OOR posits, agencies must respond to all written requests, since all requests are presumptively valid, regardless of which employee receives the request. And finally, where a written request is defective for failure to comply with agency policies, under 65 P.S. § 67.902(b)(1), the agency must send the requestor notice of any such defects.</p>

The GOGC agrees with the General Assembly’s arguments and stresses the great burden upon agencies that results from the Commonwealth Court’s decision. To illustrate, the GOGC asserts that in 2013 Commonwealth executive and independent agencies alone received over 6,500 RTKL requests, all properly addressed to an open-records officer. For many agencies, it states, treating all written requests as RTKL requests would render efficient and timely execution of agency duties under the RTKL nearly impossible. The GOGC references the Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission as an example of an agency that, while receiving only thirty to forty RTKL requests per year, responds to over 10,000 requests for information annually, both written and otherwise, without application of the RTKL. Thus, the GOGC maintains that if all requests for information were treated as RTKL requests, the impact would be overly burdensome.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

They further insist that all written requests should be deemed RTKL requests, and that the RTKL does not require a reference to the statute to validate such requests. In the view of these <em>amici, </em>the RTKL has placed the duty of delivering requests to the appropriate open-records officer upon agency employees and not upon the requestors, as the General Assembly did not intend technicalities to thwart requests, but established that agencies bear responsibility for misdirected requests. Thus, these <em>amici </em>posit that the Commonwealth Court majority’s reading of the RTKL is the only interpretation that gives full effect to the RTKL. <em>Amici </em>argue that, while furtherance of greater transparency and public disclosure requires doubtful cases to be resolved by permitting public inspection, courts have and should take a functional approach focused on the substance of a given request, rather than the form. <em>Amici </em>conclude that the GCB’s arguments fail to account for agencies that may have failed to comply with the law by naming an open-records officer in the first place.

Specifically, we find that the plain language of the RTKL reveals an intention that citizens seeking the protections of the RTKL have to indicate their intention in this regard and place the respective agency on notice of that intention by addressing their requests, at least generally, to the agency’s open-records officer in order to trigger the procedural provisions of the RTKL concerning the five-day time-frame to respond, deemed denials, and OOR review. The interpretive dispute focuses primarily upon the import of the statutory language which states requests “must be addressed to the open-records officer[.]” The asserted ambiguity and point <em>of </em>contention concerning the import of this clause lies in the fact that it does not specifically identify who is required to “address” the written request to the open-records officer. The GCB, General Assembly and GOGC read these words as applying to the requestor, while the OOR and requestor posit that these words apply to all agency employees. But, the notion that this language is ambiguous depends upon improperly viewing it in isolation. When the language is properly read — together and in conjunction with the rest of the statute — the General Assembly plainly intended the words “must be addressed to the open-records officer” to place the onus on the requestor in addressing his or her own request.</p>

First, Section <em>703 </em>follows Section 702, 65 P.S. § 67.702, which governs “Requests,” and clearly places the onus on the requestor by stating, “If the requester wishes to pursue the relief and remedies provided for in this act, the request for access to records must be a written request.” Under Section 702, the decision whether to make a records request in writing is up to the requestor, and no one is responsible for reducing the request to writing, but the requestor. Not to belabor the <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>obvious, but the requestor is solely responsible for his own written request. Section 703, notably, is specific to just such “written requests,” and it builds logically upon Section 702 by first informing the requestor how the requestor may submit his request: “A written request for access to records may be submitted in person, by mail, by e-mail, by facsimile or, to the extent provided by agency rules, by any other electronic means.” There can be no reasonable dispute that, under the first sentence of Section 703, the decision as to how to submit a written request also belongs to the requestor, and the act of submitting the request is his burden as well.</p>
    <p id="b222-4" data-blocks='[["BL_222.4",222,[256,896,1150,687]]]'>The sentence following the “must be addressed” language at issue sets forth, in part, the requisite content of the written request: “A written request should identify or describe the records sought with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to ascertain which records are being requested and shall include the name and address to which the agency should address its response.” It is clear that the specificity and return address requirements obligate the requestor as well, and no one else. Viewing the disputed language within this obligatory context, we perceive no plausible ambiguity: it is clear that the General Assembly intended to place the onus on the requestor to address his own request to the appropriate employee, <em>i.e., </em>the open-records officer.</p>

This is so because the latter sentence already requires agencies to direct their employees to forward record requests to the open-records officer. We do not believe the General Assembly intended such a redundancy, particularly when it requires <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>construing the word “addressed” as if it meant something other than its common meaning.</p>

On the one hand, the OOR argues that “must be addressed to the open-records officer” plainly places the onus on agency employees to do the “addressing,” but then it argues that: “In the alternative, the two sentences in Section 703 ... require a particular action but permit a failsafe if that action is not followed.” Appellee’s Brief at 28. So then, according to the OOR, Section 703 first requires that agency employees address or direct requests to the open-records officer, and then mandates that agency employees forward the requests to the open-records officer (again, perhaps) as a “failsafe,” in case the agency employees neglect to direct requests to the open-records officer in the first instance. It is much more logical to conclude that the onus is where the statute says it is — on the requestor to address his request to the open-records officer — and that the intended “failsafe,” in the event that a properly addressed request ends up in the hands of some other employee, is the direction that employees forward the request to the open-records officer of the agency.</p>

Thus, in the context of this case, the requestor easily could have complied with the plain language of the statute by positively indicating his intention that the open-records officer for the GCB was his intended recipient, and could have done so by emailing his request directly to the open-records officer, by an express designation in the subject line or body of his email expressly commanding the attention of the open-records officer, or otherwise expressly indicating <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>that the open-records officer was the intended recipient. By-addressing the open-records officer in some logical, reasonable fashion — which imposes no great burden — the requestor gives all employees so contacted the notice required that his written request is submitted pursuant to the RTKL. And while the requestor might accomplish the same by specifically citing or otherwise expressly referring to the RTKL, the RTKL places no such burden on requestors and, therefore, we cannot. The General Assembly’s express notice requirement requires that the request be addressed to the open-records officer, not a citation to the RTKL. It is sufficient, as well as required, that the requestor address his request to the open-records officer in some meaningful way.</p>

This is not a case where a request was properly addressed to the open-records officer, but was received by another employee, and was not forwarded to the open-records officer. Thus, even assuming that the GCB never directed its employees to forward all record requests to the GCB open-records officer, such failure on the part of the agency has no bearing on the requestor’s initial obligation to properly address his request to the open-records officer, if he intended to invoke the provisions of the RTKL. Based upon the rules of statutory construction, we cannot disregard the express requirement that requestors address their requests to the designated open-records officer, and we decline to construe Section 703 as if the sentence addressing agency employees nullifies the immediately prior sentence, since both can be made to stand together.

As noted, the dissenting opinion below raised the concern that “an unaddressed request written on the back of a brown paper bag and given to a PennDot plow driver by the side of the road on a snowy winter night [might constitute] a valid right-to-know law request.” <em>PGCB, </em><a href="/a3d/48/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="48 A.3d 503" data-case-ids="7312678" data-case-paths="/a3d/48/0503-01">48 A.3d at 516</a>.

Beyond that, as the panel majority below aptly noted, the matter before us does not involve plow drivers, brown paper bags or snowy winter nights, but an email to a press aide in the GCB’s Office of Communications and Legislative Affairs, and copied to the GCB’s Director of Media Relations and Chief Enforcement Counsel. We will leave it to the General Assembly to refine its intention respecting which employees are to receive and forward requests for records (particularly those made on brown paper bags), unless and until such a factual scenario is part of an actual controversy presented to the Court in a proper case. Until then, it is sufficient to hold, as we do, that requestors must address their written requests to an agency’s designated open-records officer in order to trigger the five-day agency obligation, the deemed denial consequence, and the appellate provisions of the RTKL, and agencies are independently responsible for determining how to implement the provision requiring a direction that employees forward such records requests to the open-records officer.</p>

In its reply brief, the GCB contends that the regulations pertaining to its Office of Communications predate the present RTKL and make no reference to RTKL requests, but provide general information concerning the GCB and its meetings, including how one might participate in GCB meetings and how one might request information regarding the GCB. The GCB insists that in anticipation of the RTKL becoming effective on January 1, 2009, the GCB posted its RTKL policy to its website on December 31, 2008, including the address of its Open Records Office and the statement that RTKL requests must be addressed to "the Board’s Open Records Officer” at the stated address. Appellant’s Reply Brief at 8-9. Given our resolution premised upon the language of the statute <em>infra, </em>we need not address or resolve this factual dispute.</p>

The County Commissioner’s Association and School Boards Association ("School Boards”) have also submitted <em>amicus </em>briefs in support of the GCB, generally in agreement with the position taken by the GCB, the General Assembly and the GOGC. The School Boards go so far as to say that "a requester must put the open-records officer’s proper address on a written request----to pursue relief under the [RTKL].” School Boards’ <em>Amicus </em>Brief at 5. The School Boards further explain that they treat the mandate to direct employees to forward RTKL requests as a training issue to ensure that RTKL requests do not linger on random fax machines or in school front office outboxes. To illustrate the absurdity of a construction of Section 703 that makes all written requests RTKL requests, the School Boards offer the example of emailed parent-teacher communications regarding a student’s work. Under that construction, according to the School Boards, the parent’s <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>email would have to be forwarded to the appropriate open-records officer. Downs Racing LP and Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment, Inc., also write in support of the GCB arguing that, if we reach the issue of whether the records requested here are exempt from disclosure, they are, in fact, exempt from disclosure and the information sought by requestor is confidential.</p>

In a September 23, 2014, version of the 2013 Pennsylvania Senate Bill Number 444, a proposed amendment to the RTKL (Printer’s No. 2330), legislators have proposed an amendment to Section 703 which would allow requesters to address written requests to either the administrative office of the agency, or to the designated open-records officer. The proposed amendment would then clarify that the administrative office would be required to promptly forward requests to the open-records officer. As it stands as of the date of this Opinion, however, the language of the current Section 703 remains in effect. We must interpret and apply the statutory language as written.</p>
