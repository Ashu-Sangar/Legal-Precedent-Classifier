The Commonwealth claimed that Appellee subsequently left the speakeasy while still possessing his gun, drove away, and, minutes later, was stopped by police, who recovered the gun from the front passenger seat of his car.

In reaching this conclusion, the Superior Court relied principally upon our decision in <em>Gonzalez. </em>Therein, the appellant killed an individual with a shotgun, but asserted that he did so in self-defense.

The <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>Superior Court herein reasoned that we determined the evidence was insufficient to sustain the appellant’s PIC conviction in <em>Gonzalez </em>because we found that the jury’s acquittal reflected the jury’s acceptance of the appellant’s self-defense claim, and no other evidence existed to support a finding that the appellant possessed his gun with the intent to employ it criminally. Applying that logic to the instant case, the Superi- or Court concluded that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Appellee retrieved the gun from his car rather than finding it at the speakeasy, because the offense of PIC requires a defendant to have the intent to employ a weapon or a firearm criminally, and because Appellee was acquitted of committing any crime with his firearm, Appellee lacked the requisite criminal intent to sustain his PIC conviction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Thus, according to the Commonwealth, the Superior Court’s decision to reverse Appellee’s PIC conviction on the basis that the verdict was inconsistent with his murder and attempted murder acquittals contravenes our established precedent and runs afoul of the basic maxim that an acquittal shows nothing more than the fact that the jury was “not convinced of the defendant’s guilt.” Appellant’s Brief at 12 (quoting <em>Carter, </em><a href="/citations/?q=282%20A.2d%20375" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="282 A.2d 375">282 A.2d at 377</a>).</p>

The Commonwealth also suggests that the Superior Court mistakenly relied upon <em>Gonzalez </em>in reaching its decision, asserting that, in that case, we held the evidence was insufficient to sustain the appellant’s conviction not because of the jury’s acquittal, but because the evidence itself indisputably established self-defense. However, in the alternative, the Commonwealth argues that, even if we were to find that <em>Gonzalez </em>did, in fact, hold that evidence is insufficient to support a conviction of PIC in circumstances where the jury acquits the appellant of the other offenses for which he is charged, that decision is erroneous and should be overruled.</p>

In further support, Appellee cites to this Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b155-5" data-blocks='[["BL_155.4",155,[160,599,1151,1007]]]'>With these arguments in mind, we begin our analysis. Initially, the Superior Court correctly observed that, in our decision in <em>Gonzalez, </em>authored by former Justice Larsen, we refused to uphold the inconsistent verdicts at issue, which concerned a defendant who, similar to Appellee, was acquitted of murder and voluntary manslaughter, but was nevertheless convicted of PIC. Specifically, the defendant in <em>Gonzalez </em>owned a small variety store in Philadelphia and threatened two gang members who attempted to steal a radio from one of his customers, forcing them to leave, and warning that he was “going to kill somebody.” <em>Gonzalez, </em>527 A.2d at 107. Minutes later, one of the men returned with 15 to 20 gang members, and the defendant shot and killed him from the doorway of his store. Although the victim was unarmed, the defendant asserted that the victim stated “I’m going to shoot your butt” and reached into his jacket for a black, shiny object, which the defendant claimed prompted him to act in self-defense. The jury convicted the defendant of PIC, but acquitted him of murder and voluntary manslaughter.</p>

Even though <em>Watson </em>concerned a sufficiency review of the defendant’s <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>multiple convictions and not a review of inconsistent verdicts, we nevertheless relied on its rationale in <em>Gonzalez </em>and concluded that “Appellant did not commit a crime with the shotgun” — an apparent reference to his homicide acquittal— and “[t]hus, the jury could not infer from the killing ... that appellant possessed intent to employ the shotgun criminally.” <em>Gonzalez, </em>527 A.2d at 108. We further determined that the defendant’s statement that he was “going to kill somebody” was “consistent with an expression of [the defendant’s] preparedness to kill <em>in self defense </em>(which is what the jury determined he did in this case).” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis original). Such reasoning reflects that the Court inferred from the defendant’s acquittal that the jury believed he killed in self-defense and, thus, lacked criminal intent relevant to his PIC conviction — without conceding that doing so conflicted with the long line of cases disapproving such jury inferences.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

We agreed the conviction could not stand because the defendant was acquitted of terroristic threats, which was a predicate offense to ethnic intimidation at the time of the defendant’s conviction. Specifically, the Crimes Code provided at that time that a defendant is guilty of ethnic intimidation <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>“if, with malicious intention toward the race ... of another individual or group of individuals, he commits an [enumerated] offense,” including terroristic threats. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2710(a) (1998). We interpreted the express statutory language of Section 2710(a) and concluded that, because the jury acquitted the defendant, it essentially found that the defendant did not “commit” terroristic threats, which was a specific element of the crime and the only potentially applicable predicate offense in the defendant’s case, and so the evidence was insufficient to sustain the defendant’s ethnic intimidation conviction. <em>Magliocco, </em><a href="/a2d/883/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="883 A.2d 479" data-case-ids="8908078,988483" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/0479-01,/pa/584/0244-01">883 A.2d at 493</a>.

We agreed, concluding the Commonwealth had failed to disprove the self-defense claim, and, thus, essentially finding that the defendant killed her common law husband in self-defense. <em>Id. </em>at 951. Applying that crucial finding to the defendant’s possession of a concealed weapon conviction, we concluded that “criminal intent cannot be inferred from the circumstances surrounding appellant’s possession of the gun which killed her husband because appellant, having acted in self-defense, never used that gun to commit a crime.” <em>Id. </em>at 953. Thus, <em>Watson </em>did not involve a jury acquittal, an inference from a jury acquittal, or an inconsistent verdict challenge.

Thus, the Supreme Court has explicitly cautioned that sufficiency review "should not be confused with the problems caused by inconsistent verdicts.” <em><a href="/us/469/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="105 S.

Justice Baer opines in his Concurring Opinion that the <em>Gonzalez </em>Court's basis for reversal was the "lack of sufficient evidence to sustain the [defendant's] PIC conviction,” not an inference from his homicide acquittal. Concurring Opinion (Baer, J.), at 121, 103 A.3d at 1252; <em>see also id. </em>at 124, 103 A.3d at 1254-55. Respectfully, we disagree. As noted above, the <em>Gonzalez </em>Court twice referenced the jury’s determination. Furthermore, while Justice Baer correctly points out that this Court engaged in a sufficiency review in <em>Gonzalez, </em>our review in that regard was focused on whether the jury could have inferred criminal intent from the defendant's statement during his <em>initial altercation </em>with the victim, in response to the Commonwealth's argument that the jury could have inferred criminal intent from that exchange. <em>Gonzalez, </em><a href="/pa/515/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="515 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="1805997" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0098-01">527 A.2d at 108</a>. Admittedly, <em>Gonzalez's </em>terse, six-paragraph analysis is, as Justice Saylor implies, not a model of clarity. <em>See </em>Concurring Opinion (Saylor, J.), at 120-21, 103 A.3d at 1251 <em>(“[Gonzalez] </em>is subject to multiple, reasonable interpretations”). Nevertheless, in our view, the <em>Gonzalez </em>Court's reliance on an inference from the jury acquittal predominates. Indeed, in his dissenting opinion in <em>Gonzalez, </em>Justice McDermott described the majority opinion as "grounded in a belief that appellant’s [PIC] conviction is invalid because a homicide conviction was not accomplished,” rather than because there was insufficient evidence to render the appellant guilty of PIC. <em>Id. </em>at 109 (McDermott, J., dissenting).
