Notably, petitioner does not request reinstatement to his position on the bench or resumption of his judicial duties. Petitioner adds that he “does not contest the Court’s ongoing administrative authority to regulate judicial assignments.” Essentially, petitioner requests to be reimbursed for his non-work for the past year and one-half and to be paid for the next three years, also without working.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Petitioner adds <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>that he will seek separate relief from the order of the CJD suspending him without pay.

Specifically, the CJD contrasted petitioner’s alleged actions with those of Magisterial District Judge Mark A. Bruno, a Delaware County magisterial district judge occasionally designated to sit in Traffic Court, who also had been suspended by the CJD -with pay in the aftermath of his indictment for similar misconduct on the Philadelphia Traffic Court bench. The CJD noted that, “Sullivan both received requests for ‘consideration’ from other judges’ personals and made requests for ‘consideration’ to other judges, as communicated through the personals and court staff’; “[a]llegations of specific examples of Sullivan’s conduct are spread throughout the [i]ndictment.” Moreover, the CJD concluded that, “as the Board aptly note[d], Judge Sullivan was Administrative Judge of the Traffic Court for a period of time in 2011 (April to December) and thus Vas in a unique position to put a stop to the errant behavior of its judges’; but he did no such thing.” The CJD found that, in Sullivan’s case, the conduct alleged “is inherently disdainful of the laws he was elected to enforce, contemptuous of the law in general, took place over and over again, and became a way of life. And the law became a laughing-stock.” The CJD held that “only an order of interim suspension which removes [petitioner] from the public payroll has any prospect of ameliorating the potential harm to the public’s confidence in the judicial system which has been caused by [petitioner]^ alleged conduct which has led to the pending charges against him.” CJD’s Opinion, 8/9/2013, at 5-8.</p>

The Court today goes further and vacates the February 1, 2013, Order in its entirety, washing its hands of the matter.</p>

Different considerations pertain in petitioner’s case than in <em>Bruno, </em>where reinstatement was authorized (which is not to say that Judge Bruno should not still be subject to some form of discipline for ticket-fixing in the ordinary course). Petitioner — like Bruno — was acquitted of the criminal charges, yet — unlike in the case of Bruno — the CJD did not act either <em>sua sponte </em>or immediately to vacate the order of suspension without pay in petitioner’s case. As a practical matter, the present action is unnecessary because, even after the Court’s <em>per curiam </em>action, the CJD’s order remains in effect. Any advantage petitioner may hope to gain is one of perception — and a potent one at that — that this Court is content to lay the matter to rest.</p>

The conclusion of the federal indictment in an acquittal does not close the chapter on any duty of the Judicial Conduct Board to investigate, or of the CJD to adjudicate, disciplinary infractions implicated by the conduct giving rise to the federal indictment against petitioner. Because disciplinary proceedings are confidential in their initial stages, it may be that the CJD’s order remains in effect because a disciplinary investigation or disciplinary charges are presently pending against petitioner; I certainly hope that is the case.</p>

Notably, the defense in the federal trial was not predicated upon denying participation in the -widespread ticket-fixing culture, or denying that petitioner knew, oversaw, or failed to report on the corruption pandemic at the Philadelphia Traffic Court. And, the federal acquittal certainly does not mean that petitioner and his comrades in the Traffic Court scheme did not seek to fix tickets.

Since the jury acquitted Mr. Mulgrew of the underlying fraud and conspiracy charges, he asserts that there was no evidence that his statements were false. This argument assumes that the jury acquitted Mr. Mulgrew of fraud because the jury did not believe that he engaged in the consideration process. To the contrary, the jury might have decided that the government’s proof that Mr. Mulgrew made and honored requests for consideration was credible, but that he lacked the requisite intent to deprive the City [of Philadelphia] and [the] Commonwealth [of Pennsylvania] <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>of money or property....

      <p id="b338-6" data-blocks='[["BL_338.7",338,[260,1567,1148,745]]]'>. Of the Traffic Court Judges whose circumstances were addressed by both the CJD and the Supreme Court, <em>i.e., </em>Judges Bruno, Sullivan, and Michael Lowry, the CJD correctly predicted the outcome of the criminal trials in only one <em>case </em>— Bruno. All three jurists were suspended without pay by this Court. Bruno was suspended with pay by the CJD and subsequently acquitted. Lowry was suspended with pay by the CJD and convicted of perjury. Sullivan was suspended without pay by the CJD but acquitted of all federal charges. This illustrates that the CJD’s approach of deconstructing the criminal indictment as a basis for making an interim suspension decision is at best a guessing game and at worst a collateral attack on the criminal proceedings premised on questionable expertise involving, in these cases, federal criminal law. I remain of the view that the approach I counseled in my special concurrence in <em>Bruno, </em><a href="/pa/627/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="101 A.3d 635" data-case-ids="4352291,6916018" data-case-paths="/pa/627/0505-01,/a3d/101/0635-01">101 A.3d at 688-95</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204915942" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="2014 WL 4915942">2014 WL 4915942</a>, at *42-47 (Castille, C.J., specially concurring), is the preferable approach to achieve the dual purposes of uniformity and, more importantly, of protecting the integrity and probity of the judicial process in Pennsylvania, which the authority to suspend a jurist during the pendency of criminal or disciplinary charges vindicates.</p>
