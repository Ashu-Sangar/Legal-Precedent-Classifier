Mrs. Johnson testified she was able to see and hear Appellant clearly, who was wearing a black ski mask, a black jumpsuit, and black timberland boots, as he held her husband at gunpoint. She distinctly saw his unique eyes through the “very, very large” cut-out area of the ski mask. N.T., Trial, 3/17/99 at 115-121, 138, 140-42; N.T., PCRA, 5/29/13 at 70.

While Appellant represents that Mrs. Johnson testified at trial she circled Appellant’s color photograph, in fact, she stated that when she viewed the photographic array in color, she identified Appellant as the shooter, though she repeatedly admitted that she could not remember if she circled Appellant’s photograph or signed the photographic arrays. N.T., Trial, 3/17/99 at 124-128. Significantly, Mrs. Johnson never wavered in her identification of Appellant during the trial process or at the PCRA hearing.</p>

Second PCRA Petition at ¶ 52. Notwithstanding, in his initial brief Appellant divides this principal claim into four subparts, the fourth of which includes subissues. In an opinion, I would have discussed that Appellant waived several of these additional issues for failing to raise them specifically in his Second PCRA Petition or to develop them at the evidentiary hearing held thereon, that some of those issues have been previously litigated, and few are both waived and previously litigated.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>
