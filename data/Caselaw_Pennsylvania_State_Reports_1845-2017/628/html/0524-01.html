When the officers arrived, an unknown individual discharged a weapon in their direction and fled the scene. The shooter remained at large until July 13, 2007, when appellee was arrested for another offense. During their investigation of the other offense, the police found evidence that linked appellee to the 2006 Radnor shooting and, on January 30, 2009, appellee was charged with crimes related to that shooting. After a preliminary hearing in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, appellee was bound over for trial, and counsel was appointed to represent him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The pre-trial conference was repeatedly continued, and a scheduled July 18, 2011 trial date (nearly two and one-half years following the lodging of charges) was continued to August 15, 2011. On August 16, 2011, the day jury selection was to begin, appellee asked for leave to represent himself, and for a continuance in order to prepare his defense. After a colloquy, the trial judge, the Honorable Michael F.X. Coll, concluded that the request was a delaying tactic, and denied a continuance. Given the denial, appellee acceded to being represented by appointed counsel, a jury was selected, and the case proceeded to trial as scheduled. On August 19, 2011, the jury found appellee guilty of various counts of criminal attempt to commit homicide, possession of firearm prohibited, possession of an instrument of crime, and loitering and prowling at night.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Appellee was sentenced on October 25, 2011; a post-sentence motion was filed and denied.

The court further stated that the “dockets indicate that the pre-trial conference was continued six times and trial was continued from July 18, 2011 to August 15, 2011.” The court also deemed it significant that: “Once [appellee] learned that this Court would not continue the matter again, he withdrew his request to represent himself.

The panel ruled that the trial court erred in denying appellee’s request for a continuance in order to represent himself. The panel reasoned that appellee’s request was made before jury selection, and was therefore timely. The panel further explained its view that consideration of intent in making a continuance request was “critical, and the trial court must determine if the motion to proceed <em>pro se </em>with a continuance is a reasonable attempt to delay the proceedings for the legitimate purpose of preparing a defense, or if it is intended to obstruct the process of justice and frustrate the operation of the court.” <a href="/a3d/66/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="66 A.3d 352" data-case-ids="7307716" data-case-paths="/a3d/66/0352-01">66 A.3d at 356</a>.

According to the Commonwealth, appellee had a year to prepare for trial and his last-minute request for continuance was untimely, insincere, and pursued only for purposes of delay. The Commonwealth posits that appellee asserted his right to represent himself only as a bargaining device for a continuance. The Commonwealth contends that the published Superior Court decision here devised a new standard that: 1) creates a presumption that a last-minute request to proceed <em>pro se </em>should be granted; 2) requires the trial court to demonstrate a “compelling reason” for denying such continuance; and 3) assigns to the trial court the burden of placing “sufficient evidence” on the record to support its conclusion that the defendant is engaging in improper delay.

Moreover, there is some force to the Commonwealth’s argument on appeal that the burden is upon the party requesting a continuance to support that request; the trial court does not have an obligation to assume that the request must be granted, and then probe the party (here, a defendant represented by counsel) for support for the request, or to find weaknesses in the request. This is particularly so if the trial court — which has the advantage of familiarity with the case and its history, and of observing in person the defendant requesting a continuance to represent himself — believes that further delay is the real reason for a day-of-trial request to represent oneself, a motivation the defendant is unlikely to simply admit.

Respecting appellee’s assertion that he “never acted in a disruptive fashion,” it is true that disruptive behavior might affect a trial judge’s exercise of discretion, but the lateness of a continuance request itself can be disruptive, as is recognized by the restriction in Rule 106(D); the defendant’s conduct need not be contumacious for a request to be disruptive and the absence of such behavior does not warrant granting an eleventh-hour continuance.</p>

Moreover, although there certainly is something to be said for more thorough trial court explanations of the grounds for a decision — a practice that can obviate appeals and narrow issues on appeal, and that creates a better record for review— the Superior Court’s approach was problematic to the extent it could be read as: creating a presumption that a last-minute continuance request to proceed <em>pro se </em>should be granted, and to the extent that the decision appears to assign a burden upon the trial court to place “sufficient evidence” of “compelling reasons” on the record to support a conclusion that a defendant seeking a continuance in order to represent himself was engaged in an attempt to delay the proceedings. <a href="/a3d/66/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="66 A.3d 352" data-case-ids="7307716" data-case-paths="/a3d/66/0352-01">66 A.3d at 359</a>.

      <p id="b582-8" data-blocks='[["BL_582.8",582,[266,1795,1147,509]]]'>. There is a discrepancy between defense counsel’s account of the length of the referenced federal transcript (140 pages) and that of the Commonwealth (7 pages). The certified record contains a single transcript from federal proceedings, dated January 26, 2009, in the case of <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>which arose out of federal firearms charges related to appellee’s illegal possession of a handgun during the incident involved in this appeal, to which appellee pled guilty and for which he was sentenced. That transcript is 45 pages, consisting of the District Court's guilty plea colloquy and appellee’s guilty plea. There is no 140-page transcript containing appellee’s allocution prior to federal sentencing in the certified record. As our explication below will make clear, the details regarding such a transcript are not material to our determination in this appeal.</p>
