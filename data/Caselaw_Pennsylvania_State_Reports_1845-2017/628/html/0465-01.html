After reviewing this issue of first impression, to which the United States Supreme Court has not definitively spoken, we agree with the Superior Court, as well as several of our sister courts, that the use of pre-arrest silence as substantive evidence of guilt violates a non-testifying defendant’s constitutional rights. As discussed below, we would affirm the order of the Superior Court remanding for a new trial. However, given that the status of federal jurisprudence is uncertain, we base our holding upon the right against self-incrimination set forth in Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>

On September 7, 2003, Victim told her mother, with whom she lived, that she was leaving the house to run some errands. When she did not return, Victim’s mother reported her disappearance to the Missing Persons Unit of the Pittsburgh Police Department. Six months later, her decomposed remains were found under moldy clothing and other debris in the basement of a house in the Spring Garden section of Pittsburgh in which Michael Benintend, one of the prosecution’s primary witnesses, resided during the relevant time period.</p>

Following a lead that Defendant was holding Victim against her will, the Missing Persons Unit detective assigned to the case went to Defendant’s house two days after Victim’s disappearance. Pamela Deloe, a second primary prosecution witness, answered the door and asserted that neither Victim nor Defendant were at the house. Accordingly, the detective left her card and asked that Defendant call her. Later that day, Defendant called the detective.</p>

After reviewing this precedent, the trial court briefly addressed whether it erred in allowing the prosecutor’s statements during closing arguments and also considered whether it should have granted a mistrial <em>sua sponte, </em>because of the statements. The court opined that the prosecutor “did nothing more than talk about the police investigation and provide information to the jury which would allow them to assess the credibility of [Defendant’s] ‘testimony.’ ” Tr.

The court used the term “[Defendant’s] ‘testimony’” to describe the detective’s summary of her phone call with Defendant, as Defendant did not take the witness stand in his own defense during trial. The trial court also concluded that it did not err in not granting a mistrial <em>sua sponte, </em>concluding that the detective’s testimony did not prejudice Defendant.

While the defendant in this case walked away telephonically, he nevertheless did no more than break off a mere encounter with a police officer. To find that his actions are admissions of substantive guilt unprotected by Article 1, Section 9 puts every citizen of Pennsylvania in the "cruel trilemma” referenced repeatedly by the United States Supreme Court and this Court. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Muniz, </em><a href="/us/496/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="299" data-cite="496 U.S. 582" data-case-ids="12124771" data-case-paths="/us/496/0582-01">496 U.S. 582</a>, 596, <a href="/us/496/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="300" data-cite="496 U.S. 582" data-case-ids="12124771" data-case-paths="/us/496/0582-01">110 S.Ct. 2638</a>, <a href="/us/496/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="301" data-cite="496 U.S. 582" data-case-ids="12124771" data-case-paths="/us/496/0582-01">110 L.Ed.2d 528</a> (1990); <em>Swinehart, </em><a href="/pa/541/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="302" data-cite="664 A.2d 957" data-case-ids="470796,7873532" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0500-01,/a2d/664/0957-01">664 A.2d at 967</a>. If a citizen exercises his well-established right to walk away without consequences under the Fourth Amendment/Article I, Section 8, he can find that he has nevertheless somehow admitted guilt by remaining silent under Article I, Section 9. Removing the ability to remain silent without negative effect leaves a defendant with the choice to speak and incriminate himself or to commit perjury. These options are inconsistent with his seeming Fourth Amendment/Article I, Section 8 right to break off the encounter and his Article I, Section 9 right against self-incrimination. To place our citizens on the horns of this trilemma during every mere encounter with police simply cannot be constitutionally countenanced, yet that is the proposition the Commonwealth espouses herein.</p>

The OAJC recognizes this point, noting the Superior Court’s observation that the probative value of silence is minimal given the ambiguity inherent in silence. After noting that silence obviously does not necessarily convey guilt, the Superior Court also quoted Mr. Justice Musmanno’s notorious observation that an accusation of criminal culpability may lead some to dramatically declare their innocence, but for others, “[t]he accusation may be so startling that the accused is benumbed into speechlessness.” <em>Commonwealth v. Molina, </em><a href="/a3d/33/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="325" data-cite="33 A.3d 51" data-case-ids="7266097" data-case-paths="/a3d/33/0051-01">33 A.3d 51</a>, 65 (Pa.Super.2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth v.

Since silence does not reliably convey anything respecting the defendant’s guilt or innocence, before rushing to make constitutional pronouncements, it may be more instructive to focus on the predicate question of relevance.</p>

As the OAJC correctly concedes, the jury could have postulated any number of reasons for appellee’s decision not to come down to the station and speak further to police, but the OAJC then declares that “jurors generally view silence as an indication of guilt.” OAJC at 451 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

Certainly, <em>Turner </em>made this declaration, but the observation is hardly empirical and, in any event, in cases like this one (at best involving cooperation followed by silence before arrest and innocuous commentary), the observation, even if generally valid, is far less compelling — a reminder of the mischief that can be caused by constitutional over-generalization. Furthermore, to the extent the jury was tempted to draw an adverse inference, and to the extent the prosecutor can be said to have invited the jury to do so, defense counsel was free to argue from the trial evidence that there are many other possible reasons for a person’s refusal to come to the police station. Not every trial event implicates constitutional values. But every trial event is subject to screening for relevance. Appellee here, however, did not forward this objection, either; and so, the trial court again cannot be said to have erred.</p>

In this case, of course, we are also presented with alleged commentary on pre-arrest silence, though not in the context of impeachment during a testifying defendant’s trial testimony.

      <em>Salinas </em>was a fractured decision, but a majority of the Court clearly found no express invocation of rights. Salinas, in custody, stood mute, and intuiting invocation from the circumstances was not approved. However, the dissent, finding the circumstances sufficient to infer an invocation of the Fifth Amendment, emphasized “[pjolice ... made clear that [Salinas] was a suspect” and “[h]is interrogation took place at the police station.” <em>Salinas, </em>at 2189 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Here, again in stark contrast, appellee was not in custody. He did not stand mute. He was not told he was a suspect at all when he spoke to the detective — indeed, there was no known crime at this point, nor was that implied by police in any way. His refusal to meet with detectives occurred at the end of a voluntary telephone conversation, contact with police he initiated himself. Two factors emphasized by Justice Breyer were police-station interrogation and the declaration the person was a suspect — neither exists here. Even if Pennsylvania constitutional jurisprudence ignored the <em>Salinas </em>majority and aligned itself with the <em>Salinas </em>dissent, there was no invocation of rights in the present case.</p>

While appellee stated “it was on the street,” there was no express or implied effort by police suggesting they wished to extract incriminating evidence from him.
