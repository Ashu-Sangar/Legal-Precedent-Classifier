The trial court is ordered to rule promptly on counsel\u2019s January 27, 2010 Motion to Withdraw as well as appellant\u2019s Motions requesting IFP status and appointment of new counsel, which were filed on December 29, 2009, and renewed on January 27, 2010. In ruling on these motions, the trial court is directed to ascertain the basis for, and the legitimacy of, counsel\u2019s assertions that they are not authorized to continue as appellant\u2019s counsel in a direct appeal, as well as to consider Pa.R.P.C. 6.2 and Explanatory Comment (relating to the appointment of counsel). Appellant\u2019s request to stay the trial court\u2019s Pa.R.A.P. 1925 order dated January 8, 2010, is DENIED without prejudice.\nJurisdiction relinquished.",
