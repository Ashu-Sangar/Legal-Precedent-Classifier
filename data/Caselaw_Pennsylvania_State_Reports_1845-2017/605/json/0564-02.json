The Orphans\u2019 Court division is merely a division of the court of common pleas and it may exercise the full jurisdiction of the court of common pleas. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 952 (\u201cIn a court of common pleas having two or more divisions each division of the court is vested with the full jurisdiction of the whole court, but the business of the court may be allocated among the divisions of the court by or pursuant to general rules.\u201d). The Orphans\u2019 Court here properly exercised jurisdiction, and no one \u2014 including Respondents \u2014 ever objected to the petition being litigated there. Because the case was in Orphans\u2019 Court, Petitioner properly followed Orphans\u2019 Court rules, which do not require post-trial motions to preserve issues for appeal. Pa.O.C.R. 7.1. The case is REMANDED to the Superior Court for consideration of all issues otherwise properly preserved and presented to that court.",
