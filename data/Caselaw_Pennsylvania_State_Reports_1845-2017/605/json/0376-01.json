        "text": "Chief Justice CASTILLE,\nconcurring.\nI join the denial of the application for reargument and write only to respond to appellant\u2019s assertion, forwarded for the first time on reargument, that the claim he faults this Court for finding waived in fact was unwaivable. He further alleges that the claim \u201cwas explicitly and implicitly reached\u201d by this Court even though we held it was waived and said nothing on the merits. This theory of \u201cimplicit and explicit\u201d exhaustion of claims fails to acknowledge this Court\u2019s rejection of the theory in Commonwealth v. VanDivner, 983 A.2d 1199, 1205 (Pa.2009).\nIn his direct appeal, appellant raised numerous claims, but his application for reargument is limited to a single claim: that he was entitled to a new penalty hearing because the trial court violated his constitutional rights by requiring him to appear shackled before the jury during the penalty phase. This Court\u2019s unanimous Opinion concluded that the claim was waived because appellant failed to include it in his Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement of matters complained of on appeal. See Commonwealth v. Bond, 985 A.2d 810, 823 (Pa.2009) (citing Commonwealth v. Castillo, 585 Pa. 395, 888 A.2d 775, 780 (2005)). We did not pass upon the merits of appellant\u2019s claim.\nIn his application for reargument, appellant does not dispute that he failed to comply with Rule 1925(b). Instead, he asserts that his claim cannot be deemed waived because this Court\u2019s statutory review in death penalty cases, which obliges us to affirm the sentence of death unless, inter alia, \u201cthe sentence of death was the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3)(i), requires this Court to \u201caddress the constitutional issues that it believes are present, even if they are not raised by the defendant.\u201d Application for Reargument, at 3. Appellant goes farther and declares that \u201cwhen this Court conducted its independent review of the record for passion, prejudice or other arbitrary factor, it explicitly and implicitly [sic] reached the constitutional issues arising out of the defendant\u2019s shackling before the jury.\u201d Id. at 5 (citing Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 74-75, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985)). However, at the same time, appellant says \u201cwe failed to consider the merits\u201d of the claim and he then faults this Court in that regard. Id.\nIn his brief on appeal, appellant did not forward this claim of relaxed waiver or non-waiver. Putting aside the inherent contradiction in appellant\u2019s current position as stated, his assertion that statutory penalty review operates to preserve waived claims, or obliges this Court to consider any and all constitutional claims even if waived, or operates to \u201cexplicitly and implicitly\u201d decide constitutional claims we say we have not decided, is meritless. Indeed, this Court discussed at some length and rejected this very argument recently in our Opinion on Reargument in VanDivner, 983 A.2d 1199. The appellant in VanDivner suggested, as appellant does here, \u201cthat this Court\u2019s statutory review of a death sentence impliedly exhausts all penalty-related constitutional claims, irrespective of whether the claims were argued to the Court or were discussed in the Court\u2019s decision; and if we \u2018overlook\u2019 such a claim, he can pursue it for the first time upon reargument.\u201d 983 A.2d at 1203. We rejected this \u201cnovel theory,\u201d noting:\nNot all claims of error, or even all claims of constitutional error, implicate passion, prejudice, or arbitrariness. (Appellant\u2019s claim that the statute authorizes review of \u201call constitutional errors\u201d ignores the statutory language.) Appellant cites to no authority from this Court, or from any other source, that remotely suggests that the claim he has belatedly identified implicates the statutory standard. Merely labeling a waived claim as one implicating the standard, as appellant does, does not make it so. Nothing in the statute, this Court\u2019s practices, or this Court\u2019s precedent suggests that our statutory review of death sentences for passion, prejudice or arbitrariness operates as an obligation to discover and raise any and all possible new defense claims and constitutional theories, such that a claim of sub silentio appellate court decision and \u201cerror\u201d becomes available on reargument.\nId. We then discussed at some length Bronshtein v. Horn, 404 F.3d 700, 725-27 (3d Cir.2005), where now-Justice Alito examined this Court\u2019s review obligation. We noted that Justice Alito\u2019s understanding comported with our own and concluded as follows:\nThis Court does not silently pass upon, and thereby impliedly preserve, decide or exhaust, claims in capital cases never argued to it or never discussed in our opinions. Our statutory review obligation does not prevent or discourage capital defendants from raising statutory review claims affirmatively. Moreover, generally speaking, statutory review does not relieve capital defendants of the obligation to affirmatively raise their claims on direct appeal.\nVanDivner, 983 A.2d at 1205. See also Commonwealth v. Chambers, 980 A.2d 35, 59 n. 12 (Pa.2009).\nVanDivner is controlling law for purposes of the theory of error appellant poses on reargument \u2014 yet appellant fails to acknowledge or discuss the case. Because the application does not account for controlling authority, it is frivolous as stated. See Pa. R.P.C. 3.1, 3.3.\n. As a result of appellant's waiver, the trial court's otherwise comprehensive opinion did not address his claim.",
