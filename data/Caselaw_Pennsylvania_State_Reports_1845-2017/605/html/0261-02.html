Applicant also complains that he raised this “resources” issue in his post-conviction appellate brief, but the Court neglected to address it in its opinion. According to Applicant, particularly in light of the strong post-conviction evidence of constitutionally deficient stewardship on the part of his trial counsel, the circumstances amount to “a complete breakdown in the imposition of capital punishment in Pennsylvania, and the consequent imposition of an <em>ipso jure </em>unreliable, and thereby unconstitutional, sentence of death.” Application for Reargument at 1.</p>

The difficulty with <em>Hubbard </em>is that most of supporting decisions referenced by the <em>Hubbard </em>Court expressed (or at least allowed for) necessary exceptions to the issue-preservation requirement, including “where peti<a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>tioner is represented on appeal by new counsel, but the grounds upon which the claim of ineffective assistance are based do not appear in the trial record.” <em>Commonwealth v.

In this regard, the <em>pre-Hubbard </em>jurisprudence was not inflexible; rather, it embodied a Grant-like exception for extra-record claims (among others), thereby already accounting for the very time- and-resources difficulties which the <em>Grant </em>Court considered it so important to remediate. <em>See Grant, </em><a href="/pa/572/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="813 A.2d 726" data-case-ids="716471,9381173" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0048-01,/a2d/813/0726-01">813 A.2d at 733</a> (“[Contrary to the absolute rule we currently follow, the rule at its inception created general guidelines for raising claims of ineffectiveness, while recognizing that in order for the rule to work in practice, common sense required some exceptions.”).</p>

      <em>Hubbard, </em>however, neglected to account, in any way, for the flexibility afforded by the <em>Dancer </em>exceptions.

At least in the early aftermath of <em>Hubbard, </em>therefore, it would have taken a vigilant practitioner indeed to surmise that the Court had intentionally jettisoned essential interests-of-justice exceptions via footnote, without any developed explanation for such a material change.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

As another contextual reference, <em>Hubbard, </em>was issued relatively soon after the abolition of the plain error rule, eliminated in Pennsylvania (at least for non-capital criminal cases) in <em>Commonwealth v.

The Court thus had recently removed a mechanism which is commonly applied elsewhere to reach claims in the interests of justice, <em>see, e.g., </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b), and some disharmony resulted in terms of settling the new review landscape. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.
