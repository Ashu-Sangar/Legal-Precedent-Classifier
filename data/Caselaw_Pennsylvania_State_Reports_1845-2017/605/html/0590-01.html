In the modern workplace essentially every benefit afforded an individual is thus excluded from § 1722. In reality, under the rationale of the Superior Court, there are no benefit plans which would be subject to § 1722....

According to the majority opinion, an automobile insurer may reduce a disabled person’s income loss benefits under his underinsured motorist policy (“UIM”) by amounts he received under separate disability policies, even though he paid for such benefits entirely out of his own funds <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>and through employer deductions from his wages. Such an interpretation, in my view, is contrary to our Court’s previous recognition that the source of an injured individual’s separately paid for income loss benefits impacts whether an automobile insurer may, under the MVFRL, reduce payments to its injured insured by the amount of such additional benefits. Further, the majority’s interpretation of Section 1722 will result in automobile insurance companies receiving an unjust windfall, since it relieves them of the obligation of providing the full measure of benefits for which their insureds have paid, a result that I conclude the legislature did not intend when it enacted this statutory provision.</p>

The majority observed that Section 1720 took away the subrogation right of insurers and employers for recoupment of these type of benefits, but, correspondingly, Section 1722 also precluded the injured person from recovering the amount of those benefits in his or her action against the third party tortfeasor.

Specifically, we presume that the General Assembly in enacting a statute does not intend a result that is “unreasonable,” 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(1), intends an entire statute “to be effective and certain,” 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(2), and intends “to favor the public interest as against any private interest.” 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(5). Applying these presumptions leads me to the conclusion that the lower courts, in interpreting Section 1722, properly considered the rationale expressed in <em>Panichelli </em>regarding the relevance of the source of payment of benefits under “a program, group contract or other arrangement for the payment of benefits.” Thus, I would uphold their conclusion that Section 1722 permits disabled individuals to receive the full measure of benefits under their UIM policies, in addition to disability benefits for which they paid separately for the right to receive.</p>

We expressly recognized in <em>Panichelli </em>that, if a person pays once for income loss coverage under their automobile insurance policy, and pays yet again for additional income loss coverage under “a program, group contract or other arrangement,” receipt of benefits under both policies does not result in a windfall to the injured individual.

Neither is this a situation such as that which was permitted under the former No Fault Act, where an injured individual was permitted to recover twice for identical expenses even though he paid but one insurance premium, such as receiving payment for medical expenses from his employer-paid group health plan and then seeking compensation for the very same medical expenses from his <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>automobile carrier. <em>See, e.g., Allstate Ins.

I do not construe Section 1722 as evincing the legislature’s intent to prohibit recovery by individuals like Dr. Tannenbaum who procure, at their own expense, policies of excess insurance in order to augment the level of coverage they purchased under their automobile policy, because each insurance company is compensated, via premiums, for its risk under each policy.</p>

This is because these decisions do not, as explained above, resurrect the double recovery and collateral source rules with regard to recovery from tortfeasors in automobile accident litigation. Further, and importantly, as both Dr. Tannenbaum and amicus, the Pennsylvania Association of Justice, have pointed out, there is absolutely no evidence of record which suggests that Nationwide considers the existence of other insurance covering its customer when writing a policy of UIM coverage, and that it correspondingly adjusts the premiums it charges as a result of such consideration.</p>

This conclusion is consistent with the long standing principle of law our Court articulated in <em>Panichelli </em>that an individual is entitled to receive the full benefit of all insurance coverage for which he or she specifically paid via diminished wages. In the intervening 13 years since <em>Panichelli </em>was decided, this principle has been acknowledged and followed consistently by the intermediate appellate courts of this Commonwealth, which have uniformly concluded that an individual possessing such coverage, who also has purchased a UM or UIM policy, is not precluded by Section 1722 from recovering UM or UIM benefits if he or she is injured in an automobile accident. <em>See Browne, Carroll, Tannenbaum, <a href="/a2d/919/0267-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="919 A.2d 267" data-case-ids="8325627" data-case-paths="/a2d/919/0267-01">supra.</a> </em>This settled interpretation of the MVFRL has been reasonably relied upon during this time period by insureds when purchasing UM, UIM, and disability coverage, and by insurers in setting rates for such coverages.</p>
