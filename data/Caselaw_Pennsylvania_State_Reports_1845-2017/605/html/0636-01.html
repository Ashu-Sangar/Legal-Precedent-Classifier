    <p id="b704-7" data-blocks='[["BL_704.8",704,[261,996,1154,746]]]'>Under Section 204(a) of the Workers’ Compensation Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> benefits afforded under that Act are subject to being offset by retirement benefits, as follows: “[Bjenefits from a pension plan to the extent funded by the employer directly liable for the payment of compensation which are received by an employe shall ... be credited against the amount of the [workers’ compensation] award[.]” 77 P.S. § 71(a); <em>accord </em>34 Pa.Code § 123.8(a). In 2005, Employer invoked Section 204(a) and implemented an offset in the amount of $359 per week, as the employer-funded share of Claimant’s disability retirement benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The calculations resulting in the credit were accomplished by the State Employees’ Retirement System (“SERS”).

C.S. §§ 5101-5956, SERS administers a defined-benefit retirement plan for Commonwealth employees and certain others. Under the plan, benefits are a function of years of service multiplied by a final average salary, discounted according to <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>defined annual accrual and class-of-service factors. <em>See </em>71 Pa.C.S. §§ 5102 (definition of standard single life annuity), 5702 (definition of maximum single life annuity). Complexities arise because the amount (and present value) of any particular employee pension is not determined finally until retirement. <em>See </em>71 Pa.C.S. §§ 5102, 5702. Even then, the expense to the system (and, correspondingly, employers) in funding ongoing installments is open-ended, since cost is dependent on variables such as the pensioner’s longevity and future investment performance. Nevertheless, benefits are fixed, payable indefinitely into the future, and not directly related to the amount of specific employee contributions. <em>See </em>71 Pa.C.S. §§ 5102, 5702</p>
    <p id="b705-4" data-blocks='[["BL_705.5",705,[208,978,1152,789]]]'>In light of the multiple variables, SERS employs an actuarial assumption of an 8.5 percent investment return as a central factor in assessing the system’s ongoing performance and calculating the amount of the periodic employer contributions necessary to maintain its viability. <em>See </em>HayGroup, Sixteenth Investigation of Actuarial Experience of The State Employees’ Retirement System of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, at 8-9 (March 15, 2006) (“[T]he analysis and investment projection support the continuation of an investment return assumption of 8.5 percent.”). Since the pension system itself incorporates essential actuarial assumptions in determining ongoing employer funding, SERS has taken the position that it is reasonable and necessary, for purposes of Section 204(a), to rely on such assumptions in calculating the employer-funded component attributable to individual pensions.</p>
    <p id="b705-5" data-blocks='[["BL_705.6",705,[209,1791,1150,578]],["BL_706.1",706,[273,342,1154,579]]]'>To determine the offset amount, with the advice of an actuarial firm, SERS designed the following formula. First, it selects a maximum single life annuity figure, or the amount payable to the claimant each month, using the statutory formula referenced above (resulting, here, in a monthly payment of $1,888.97). The present value of the account is then calculated by annualizing this figure and multiplying it by an actuarially determined factor representing life expectancy (in this case, 9.47370, yielding $214,746). Actual employee contributions are then aggregated (to $15,071 in this case). Then, an 8.5 percent assumed annual rate of interest — the same figure <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>utilized in the actuarial evaluations of the overall system and in determining employer contributions — is added (resulting, here, in a value of $27,741 being assigned to the employee-funded portion).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The sum is subtracted from the total present value of the pension, yielding the present value allocated to its employer-funded component ($187,005, in Claimant’s case), which is converted to an annual figure by dividing by the life expectancy factor (resulting in a figure of $19,739, and yielding a weekly offset of $380).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> SERS implements the formula to perform calculations in each specific case by reference to a spreadsheet developed by its actuary consultant.</p>
    <p id="b706-4" data-blocks='[["BL_706.5",706,[271,949,1153,365]]]'>Claimant premised his objection to this calculation on his view that Section 204(a) does not permit the use of assumptions in determining employer funding, but rather, requires an identification of actual dollars contributed by Employer toward his individual pension and specific associated returns. To the extent it is not possible to quantify these, Claimant took the position that Employer is simply without a remedy.</p>
    <p id="b706-5" data-blocks='[["BL_706.6",706,[268,1342,1157,635]],["BL_707.1",707,[207,339,1154,749]]]'>In addressing Claimant’s challenge before a workers’ compensation judge (the “WCJ”), Employer presented testimony from SERS’s director of its benefits determination division, who discussed the above methodology used in calculating Section 204(a) offsets and its specific application to Claimant. Employer also presented the testimony of a consulting actuary specializing in employee benefits with an emphasis on retirement programs. The consultant explained that SERS derives the actuarial assumptions necessary to value the assets and liabilities it administers through annual actuarial valuations and five-year studies in which he and his firm are involved. The consultant recognized that the pension system benefitted <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>from many years of exceptional investment performance. On the other hand, he also identified years reflecting negative returns, emphasizing that, in a defined-benefit plan, the risk of loss is allocated to the employer and losses must be addressed on an ongoing basis, as pension payments are distributed, through increased employer contributions. The consultant also explained that there is no method of accurately predicting future returns and liabilities; therefore, reasoned assumptions are necessary elements of the valuation process. Further, specific to the assumed 8.5 percent annual rate of return, he indicated that the figure is derived from past experience viewed with a degree of conservatism, and is subject to periodic reevaluation, <em>inter alia, </em>via the five-year investigations.</p>
    <p id="b707-4" data-blocks='[["BL_707.5",707,[210,1141,1153,535]]]'>According to the consultant, the same assumption is reasonable and appropriate for use in Section 204(a) offset calculations. The primary reasons he identified for the use of assumptions in determining the employer-funded component of pension payments related to the nature of defined-benefit plans; concomitant fluctuations in employer funding as compared to the fixed interests of employees; and the inability to trace specific employee or employer contributions or their associated returns to pension benefits. <em>See </em>71 Pa.C.S. § 5508; 34 Pa.Code § 123.2.
