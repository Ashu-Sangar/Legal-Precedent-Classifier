Appellant contends Scott’s statement in his plea agreement, that he was a substantial cause of the victims’ deaths because he previously heard appellant indicate his <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>intention to kill them, was contradicted by Scott’s preliminary hearing testimony, which did not implicate appellant or Scott in any wrongdoing.

The statement, which referred to appellant seeing the lifeless bodies of his family, was intended to suggest that the murders were committed by someone else prior to appellant arriving at the house. The trial court ruled that the statement was inadmissible both pretrial on the Commonwealth’s motion <em>in limine, </em>and during the cross-examination of Scott. In its opinion, the trial court found that the statement was a mechanism whereby appellant sought to distance himself from the murders and that the five to ten minutes that appellant was absent from the car was sufficient time for reflection, thereby negating the excited utterance exception.

But, in my view, where statements proffered by the non-testifying accused are exculpatory, there is substantial reason to question their reliability and this fact provides an independent reason not to apply the excited utterance exception. Some courts have touched on this reality. For example, in <em>Commonwealth v. Simms, </em><a href="/pa-super/284/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="154" data-cite="284 Pa.

In response to Simms’ motion for a mistrial, the prosecutor argued that Mills’ statement was an excited utterance. The trial court granted the mistrial. On appeal to the Superior Court, the central question was whether double jeopardy barred retrial. The court rejected the Commonwealth’s argument that Mills’ statement qualified as an excited utterance, reasoning as follows:</p>

    <p id="b437-6" data-blocks='[["BL_437.8",437,[204,808,1151,359]]]'>As to the first of these claims, I would rest the disposition of the claim of underfunding more squarely on Appellant’s failure to request additional funds upon a showing of further cause after exhaustion of the funds that were allocated. Furthermore, I would specifically address Appellant’s claim that the court-appointed psychologist was not competent to assist the defense. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 18.</p>
    <p id="b437-7" data-blocks='[["BL_437.9",437,[205,1191,1151,944]]]'>As to the asserted excited utterance, I do not fully understand the majority’s position that Appellant’s statement related only to an event outside the house, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, at 864-65, 989 A.2d at 906, when the alleged emotional impact arises from Appellant’s claim to having seen something in the house (presumably, indicia that one or more of his family members had been killed). The substantial reliance on the passage of five to ten minutes time for reflection is also problematic, as certainly courts have held that declarants may remain under the stress from severe emotional events for longer periods of time. <em>See </em>Kenneth S. Broun, 2 McCormick on Evidence § 272 (6th ed. 2006) (“Passage of time viewed in isolation is not an entirely accurate indicator of admissibility. For example, while courts have held statements made twelve or more hours after a physical beating to be the product of the excitement caused by the beating, other courts have held statements made within minutes of the event not admissible.” (footnotes omitted)).</p>

Moreover, given the vague and self-serving-character of the asserted declaration (as noted by the majority), and the weight of the other evidence of Appellant’s guilt, it does not seem to me that there is any real likelihood that it would have had any impact on the verdict. Thus, I find any error in the trial court’s statement of its reasons for exclusion of the evidence to have been harmless.</p>
    <p id="b438-5" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[272,841,1155,1178]]]'>Finally, concerning Appellant’s last claim, that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by stressing that Appellant killed his own family as rebuttal to the defense mitigation case, the majority appears to accept the prosecutor’s position that “the Commonwealth was free to address the catch-all mitigator’s applicability on its general terms — ‘the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense’— without being confined to specific aspects emphasized by the defense[.]” Majority Opinion, at 367, 989 A.2d at 908. Such position, however, is contrary to law, since rebuttal is confined to particular form of mitigation put into issue by the defense. <em>See Commonwealth v. Hughes, </em><a href="/pa/581/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="165" data-cite="581 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1140661" data-case-paths="/pa/581/0274-01">581 Pa. 274</a>, 333-34 &amp; n. 40, <a href="/pa/581/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="166" data-cite="865 A.2d 761" data-case-ids="1140661,9035570" data-case-paths="/pa/581/0274-01,/a2d/865/0761-01">865 A.2d 761</a>, 796-97 &amp; n. 40 (2004) (explaining that the appropriate scope of rebuttal mitigation is defined according to the evidence that it is offered to rebut). I am able to join the result obtained under the majority opinion only because the prosecutor also related the comments to Appellant’s character (which was implicated by the defense mitigation ease). <em>See </em>N.T., August 31, 2004, at 1229. In this regard, I agree that the comments were sufficiently related to Appellant’s character — particularly as he was portrayed in the defense mitigation case as “loving.” <em>See id. </em>at 1204.</p>
