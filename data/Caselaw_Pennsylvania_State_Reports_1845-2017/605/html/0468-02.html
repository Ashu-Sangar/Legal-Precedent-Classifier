It was addressed to seven of appellants’ employees, including two other attorneys in appellants’ general counsel office. Document 395 was authored by appellants’ agency administration director.

Like the trial court, I would find this matter turns on waiver. The trial court relied on <em>Minatronics, </em>an Allegheny <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>County Court of Common Pleas decision, for the proposition voluntarily disclosing confidential communications “waive[s] the privilege as to every confidential communication ... involving the same subject matter.” <em>Minatronics, </em>at 18; <em>see </em>Trial Court Opinion, 2/16/05, at 3. The issue in <em>Minatronics </em>was whether the inadvertent disclosure of confidential communications waived the privilege as to other confidential communications containing the same subject matter. The <em>Minatronics </em>court also noted significant support for the position that such disclosure does not waive the privilege “where there is no apparent prejudice to the party seeking further disclosure[,]” because “where it is clear that the limited disclosure is not being used [as a sword and a shield], there is no justification for applying a subject matter waiver.” <em>Minatronics, </em>at 19-20. The court held the inadvertent disclosures at issue did not waive the attorney-client privilege, and further opined, “the law should not discourage parties from voluntarily disclosing confidential communications (unless made for the purpose of achieving a tactical advantage) by adopting a rule of law that causes voluntary disclosures to operate as a waiver of other confidential communications involving the same subject matter.” <em>Id., </em>at 20-21.</p>
    <p id="b541-4" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[207,1512,1152,630]]]'>The trial court also relied on <em>Murray, </em>a United States District Court decision from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, holding the defendant waived its attorney-client privilege as to intentionally disclosed documents and their subject matter. <em>Murray, </em>at 367.

Read together, however, Documents 314, 395, and 529 contain the same subject matter — appellants’ response to agent defections. Document 529 contains counsel’s opinion-based outline regarding the ongoing activities for dealing with the defections, specifically, litigation efforts in Pennsylvania and New York. In Document 529, counsel states the litigation’s primary purpose — to send a message to current employees contemplating defection — and concedes the likelihood of receiving a damages award is remote. Counsel notes his office’s participation in modifying the Reflex Action Plan, and suggests edits for appellants’ no-compete contract.</p>

As in Murray, appellants seem to have produced only the documents beneficial to their case by disclosing Documents 314 and 395, and withholding Document 529 based on its privileged nature. I believe appellants waived the attorney-client privilege with respect to the subject of agent defections upon disclosing Documents 314 and 395, and cannot claim the privilege applies to a document containing the same subject matter, as well as potentially <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>damaging admissions.
