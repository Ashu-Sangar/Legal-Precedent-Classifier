He further alleges that the claim “was explicitly and implicitly reached” by this Court even though we held it was waived and said nothing on the merits. This theory of “implicit and explicit” exhaustion of claims fails to acknowledge this Court’s rejection of the theory in <em>Commonwealth v.

Instead, he asserts that his claim cannot be deemed waived because this Court’s statutory review in death penalty cases, which obliges us to affirm the sentence of death unless, <em>inter alia, </em>“the sentence of death was the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3)(i), requires this Court to “address the constitutional issues that it believes are present, even if they are not raised by the defendant.” Application for Reargument, at 3. Appellant goes farther and declares that “when this Court conducted its independent review of the record for passion, prejudice or other arbitrary factor, it explicitly and implicitly [sic] reached the constitutional issues arising out of the defendant’s shackling before the <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>jury.” <em><a href="/pa/585/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="888 A.2d 775" data-case-ids="2472599,8998737" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0395-01,/a2d/888/0775-01">Id.</a> </em>at 5 (citing <em>Ake v.

    <p id="b444-5" data-blocks='[["BL_444.5",444,[263,577,1153,908]]]'>In his brief on appeal, appellant did not forward this claim of relaxed waiver or non-waiver. Putting aside the inherent contradiction in appellant’s current position as stated, his assertion that statutory penalty review operates to preserve waived claims, or obliges this Court to consider any and all constitutional claims even if waived, or operates to “explicitly and implicitly” decide constitutional claims we say we have not decided, is meritless. Indeed, this Court discussed at some length and rejected this very argument recently in our Opinion on Reargument in <em>VanDivner, </em><a href="/pa/603/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="983 A.2d 1199" data-case-ids="4196989,7294535" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0318-01,/a2d/983/1199-01">983 A.2d 1199</a>. The appellant in <em>VanDivner </em>suggested, as appellant does here, “that this Court’s statutory review of a death sentence impliedly exhausts all penalty-related constitutional claims, irrespective of whether the claims were argued to the Court or were discussed in the Court’s decision; and if we ‘overlook’ such a claim, he can pursue it for the first time upon reargument.” <a href="/pa/603/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="983 A.2d 1199" data-case-ids="4196989,7294535" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0318-01,/a2d/983/1199-01">983 A.2d at 1203</a>.

    <blockquote id="b444-6" data-blocks='[["BL_444.6",444,[304,1519,1109,850]]]'>Not all claims of error, or even all claims of constitutional error, implicate passion, prejudice, or arbitrariness. (Appellant’s claim that the statute authorizes review of “all constitutional errors” ignores the statutory language.) Appellant cites to no authority from this Court, or from any other source, that remotely suggests that the claim he has belatedly identified implicates the statutory standard. Merely labeling a waived claim as one implicating the standard, as appellant does, does not make it so. Nothing in the statute, this Court’s practices, or this Court’s precedent suggests that our statutory review of death sentences for passion, prejudice or arbitrariness operates as an obligation to discover and raise any and all possible new defense claims and constitutional theories, such that a claim of <em>sub silentio </em>appellate court decision and “error” becomes available on reargument.</blockquote>
