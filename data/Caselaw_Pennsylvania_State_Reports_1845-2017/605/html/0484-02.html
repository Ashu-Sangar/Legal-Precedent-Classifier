The recorded deed included a restrictive covenant, consistent with an authorizing ordinance, memorializing the City’s commitment to preserve the property, indefinitely, as a golf course and/or for park purposes. The deed also formalized the parties’ agreement that the restriction was to run with the land.</p>

Indeed, in 2004, the governing body approved a multimillion dollar bond issue to perform improvements consistent with the original purposes. Shortly after the renovations, however — upon a change in City administration and in the face of economic challenges — the municipality permanently closed the golf course. Subsequently, the governing body authorized advertisements for sale of the property.</p>

At the ensuing hearings, City witnesses testified that the golf course consistently operated at a net loss; losses would continue into the foreseeable future; the municipality had found it necessary to borrow from its general fund to maintain the golf course’s operations; and it would likely have to continue to do so in the future to repay the multi-million dollar bond issue. <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>

According to the court, the italicized term served to limit the application of the entire Act solely to circumstances in which no formal record of acceptance appears. Thus, the court rejected the City’s contrary argument that the no-formal-acceptance proviso actually was intended to clarify that the DDPA applies, not only to fully-realized dedications, but also in circumstances where some degree of uncertainty might prevail concerning acceptance by a municipality.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The orphans’ court found support for a restrictive construction of the DDPA’s reach in a line of Commonwealth Court decisions. <em>See, e.g., Vutnoski v.

Here, the court reasoned that the Erie Golf Course was formally dedicated and accepted by the City for public enjoyment, evidenced by: the express language of the recorded deed; the ordinance accepting the dedication; the City’s continuous and exclusive use of the property as a golf course for over eighty years; its contribution of funds toward the maintenance and improvement of the property consistent with the designated purposes; and the public’s use of the property as such since 1926. Thus, the court determined that the public trust doctrine, and not the Act, controlled. Because the City held the property as a fiduciary for the benefit of the public, the court concluded that the municipality was prohibited from selling, conveying, or otherwise abandoning the specified uses, consistent with its recorded covenant.</p>

The court was not convinced, however, by the City’s financial evidence that the property no longer served the public interest, particularly as this evidence was substantially undermined upon adversarial testing. Likewise, the court indicated that the City failed to establish impracticability of the public-park use.

For this reason, both parties are able to advance colorable arguments that the Act includes, or excludes, dedicated property where there is a formal record. Moreover, the statute lacks definitions for central concepts, such as “dedication” and “purchase.” For instance, there is no guidance concerning whether “purchase” contemplates a fair-market-value exchange (as opposed to encompassing an exchange upon lesser or nominal consideration), and, particularly if not, whether the concepts of “dedication” and “purchase” are intended to be mutually exclusive.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> The difficulty is compounded by the somewhat obscure direction, in Section 6, that a political subdivision’s “control” is not limited or affected by the Act in purchase scenarios. 53 P.S. § 3386.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> This, in turn, <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>raises the question of whether property that in any sense of the word can be regarded as “purchased” is entirely excluded from the DDPA’s coverage.</p>

The present codification of the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine utilizes more mandatory terms relative to orphans' court approval. <em>See </em>20 Pa.C.S. § 7740.3 (prescribing that, upon a finding that original charitable purposes have become unlawful, impracticable, or wasteful, the court <em>“shall </em>apply cy pres to fulfill as nearly as possible the settlor’s charitable intention” (emphasis added)). Significantly, however, the DDPA utilizes the permissive phraseology, consistent with a wider conferral of discretion. Moreover, as Appellants stress, the <em>Goodman Appeal </em>decision upon which the Commonwealth Court relied is more nuanced than was recognized. <em>See Goodman Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/425/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="425 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="1906757" data-case-paths="/pa/425/0023-01">425 Pa. at 30-31</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=227%20A.2d%20816" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="227 A.2d 816">227 A.2d at 820-21</a>.</p>

Although Appellants’ position has not prevailed on the threshold issue, we note that the policy concerns raised by their <em>amicus, see, e.g., supra </em>note 11, are mitigated by appropriate recognition of the close review available to, as well as the discretionary prerogative of, the orphans’ courts.</p>

Instead, the Act speaks only to dedications formalized through offer and acceptance, and not to the destruction of independent property rights running with the land. <em>Cf.

Notably, as contrasted with recorded restrictive covenants, no particular formalities are necessary to accomplish dedication; all that is necessary are clear expressions of intention. <em>See Coffin, </em><a href="/pa/408/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="408 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="1308437" data-case-paths="/pa/408/0487-01">408 Pa. at 491-92</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=186%20A.2d%20906" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="186 A.2d 906">186 A.2d at 909</a>.</p>
