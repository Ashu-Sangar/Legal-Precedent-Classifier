On September 20, 2004, Claimant, who is a member of the passenger service employees’ union, injured his right knee in the scope and course of employment with Employer when he slipped on the back of a catering truck while preparing to load an aircraft. On November 8, 2004, Claimant filed a claim petition seeking partial disability benefits from September 20, 2004 through November 7, 2004, and total disability benefits thereafter. Also on November 8, 2004, for reasons unrelated to Claimant’s injury, Employer furloughed Claimant pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between Employer and its passenger service employees. As a result of the furlough, in accord with the CBA, Claimant began receiving a “furlough allowance,” which was based on accumulated years of service.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> R.R. 95a.

It is undisputed that from November 8 through November 16, 2004, Claimant received a furlough allowance from Employer in addition to workers’ compensation payments. At a hearing before the workers’ compensation judge (WCJ) on May 17, 2005, Employer asserted that it was entitled to a credit against the workers’ compensation payments for the furlough allowance, pursuant to Section 204(a) of the Workers’ Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 71(a), which provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>

    <p id="b639-7" data-blocks='[["BL_639.8",639,[209,1243,1156,846]]]'>34 Pa.Code § 123.2. The crux of Employer’s argument before the WCJ was that the furlough allowance it paid to Claimant was a “severance benefit” for which Employer was entitled to credit against the amount of the workers’ compensation payments. To prove this point before the WCJ, Employer offered the testimony of a labor and employment law attorney, who stated that within the labor and employment law setting, severance benefits generally include any wage loss benefits paid because of a separation from employment for any reason, including termination, reduction in force, layoffs, or plant closings, regardless of whether the separation is temporary or permanent. Claimant denied that Employer was entitled to credit, and argued that the furlough allowance could not be considered a severance benefit because, due to the Employer’s ability to recall the Claimant to work, Claimant’s separation from employment was not permanent.</p>

The WCJ concluded that neither the statute nor the regulation required that the separation from employment be permanent in order for a payment resulting from that separation to qualify as a severance benefit. According to the WCJ, the only pertinent inquiry was that directed by the regulatory definition of severance benefit, 34 Pa.Code § 123.2: whether the benefit was taxable to the employee and paid as a result of the employee’s separation from employment. Because the furlough allowance was taxable to the Claimant and paid by Employer as a result of Claimant’s separation from Employer, the WCJ concluded that the furlough allowance was a severance benefit and granted Employer credit for the furlough allowance. The WCJ found that there was no legal or contractual difference between the terms “furlough” and “severance” for purposes of the Act’s credit provision.</p>

The court agreed with Claimant that because the furlough allowance was paid during a non-permanent separation from employment, it was not a severance benefit under Section 204(a) of the Act. According to the court, a furloughed employee maintains an employment relationship with the employer, but that relationship is held in abeyance due to an employer’s lack of work or financial resources. The court continued that, distinct from a severance, an employee who is furloughed retains the prospect of returning to work with the employer, and, importantly, furlough does not affect his seniority.</p>

Employer argues that this Section was amended in 1993 and again in <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>1996 to expand the right of employers to take a credit against workers’ compensation payments, and, accordingly, the courts of this Commonwealth have construed the amendments to Section 204(a) to expand the credit possibilities for employers. <em>See Mosley v. W.C.A.B. (City of Pittsburgh), </em><a href="/a2d/937/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="937 A.2d 607" data-case-ids="8362313" data-case-paths="/a2d/937/0607-01">937 A.2d 607</a>, 609 (Pa.Cmwlth.2007) (“Ever since the 1993 amendments ... our courts have construed that language to expand the credit possibilities for employers by allowing offsets against all compensation awards ... ”). In fact, Employer notes that this Court, in <em>Kramer, </em>considered the legislative intent underpinning Section 204(a), and recognized that the provision served the legitimate government interest of reducing the cost of workers’ compensation benefits in Pennsylvania. <em>Kramer, </em><a href="/a2d/883/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="883 A.2d 518" data-case-ids="8908418,988622" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/0518-01,/pa/584/0309-01">883 A.2d at 536</a>. According to Employer, allowing a certain class of workers <em>(i.e., </em>those employees receiving a furlough allowance and workers’ compensation payments) to receive double recovery from their employer frustrates the purpose of Section 204(a), which is to control costs through enlargement of the scope of an employers’ right to credit.

According to Employer, whether the employee retains an employment relationship, such as the right to be recalled to work, is of no moment because the benefit was taxed to Claimant and paid by Employer. <em>See </em>34 Pa.Code 123.2 (defining severance benefit as being taxable to the employee and paid by the employer).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Further, referring to the regulation’s definition of “severance benefit,” which provides that such a benefit is one that is payable “as a result of employee’s separation from employment,” Claimant argues that “separation” is a permanent state resulting from, <em>inter alia, </em>the termination of a contractual relationship.

Thus, under the terms of the CBA, when Claimant was away from work he used this benefit, and when he returned he had to start accruing it as if he were a new employee.

Severance benefits are occasioned by severance from employment. They are payable only when a worker’s employment has been completely and permanently terminated. According to Black’s Law Dictionary, the term “severance pay” means “[m]oney (apart from back wages or salary) paid by an employer to a <em>dismissed </em>employee.” Black’s Law Dictionary (Bryan Garner, et. al. eds., 8th ed., 2004) (emphasis added). In contrast, furlough is defined as “[a] leave of absence from military or other employment duty.” <em><a href="/a2d/937/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="937 A.2d 607" data-case-ids="8362313" data-case-paths="/a2d/937/0607-01">Id.</a> </em>Therefore, according to Black’s Law Dictionary, a severance benefit, unlike a furlough, is contingent on the dismissal of an employee.</p>

A furloughed employee returns to employment with his seniority intact.</p>

The offset does not disadvantage the injured worker <em>vis-a-vis </em>his uninjured colleagues who also receive severance benefits because those workers do not receive a double benefit, in the form of workers’ compensation payments, from the employer. Because the employment relationship is the basis for providing both severance payments and workers’ compensation benefits (whether or not the compensation is paid through an outside insurer), the employer can avoid paying duplicate benefits for the same loss of earnings by using the offset. We conclude that the severance benefit offset bears a rational relationship to achieving the legislative goals.</blockquote>
