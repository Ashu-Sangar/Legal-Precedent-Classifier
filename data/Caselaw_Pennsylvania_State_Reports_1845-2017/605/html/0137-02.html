At the guilt phase, both men admitted to being present when Milano was killed, and each claimed that the other was the killer. Both were convicted on all charges, including first, second, and third-degree murder, as well as kidnapping. The jury found that the two aggravating circumstances — killing in perpetration of a felony, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6), and killing by means of torture, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(8) — outweighed the mitigating factors, and sentenced both defendants to death.

The court also vacated Appellant’s death sentence based on its finding of several constitutional errors, including that Appellant’s appearance before the capital sentencing jury in shackles violated his due process rights and that Appellant’s counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of Appellant’s traumatic childhood, substance abuse, intoxication, brain damage, and mental illness.</p>

The evidence adduced was similar to that introduced in the 1988 joint trial. On retrial, however, Appellant stipulated that he murdered Milano and, hence, the only remaining question for the jury was whether he acted with a specific intent to kill, thus making him guilty of first-degree murder. Appellant’s strategy was to forward a defense of diminished capacity resulting from extreme intoxication. In support of such defense, Appellant presented the testimony of several expert witnesses who opined that Appellant must have had a very high blood-alcohol content at the time of the killing and that this, together with brain damage sustained from a head injury earlier in his life, substantially impeded Appellant from forming the requisite intent to kill. The experts additionally developed that, given the amount of alcohol Appellant ingested during the hours leading up to the killing, he may have been acting in an “alcoholic blackout,” where he could appear to function normally but later have no recall of the time period in question. Indeed, some of the experts related that Appellant had told them he had no memory of the killing when they spoke to him immediately prior to the retrial. The district attorney sought <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>to cast doubt upon Appellant’s truthfulness in this regard by referring to his testimony at his first trial (which occurred five months after the offense) in which Appellant recounted his version of the events immediately before, during, and after the killing in significant detail. Ultimately, the jury found Appellant guilty of first-degree murder and set the penalty at death after unanimously concluding that the sole aggravating factor outweighed any mitigating circumstances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Milano had never met Appellant or Chester prior to that evening. During the next three hours, Milano, Chester, and Appellant drank alcohol and conversed together. The bartender testified that, at some point, Appellant and Chester began taunting Milano concerning his masculinity because they believed he might be homosexual. In this respect, Appellant used derogatory terms such as “fag” when speaking of Milano to others at the bar, and at one point expressed to the bartender that he (Appellant) was “sick and tired of these <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>people trying to infiltrate us.” Nevertheless, Milano agreed to give Appellant and Chester a ride home. Multiple witnesses testified that, during this time, and throughout the ensuing events, Appellant seemed coherent, was able to stand without swaying, and was not slurring his speech. Appellant, Chester, and Milano ultimately left the Edgely Inn just before 2:30 a.m. on December 15, with Milano driving his car and Chester and Appellant supplying directions.</p>
    <p id="b217-5" data-blocks='[["BL_217.5",217,[145,760,1151,950]]]'>Approximately one hour later, the three individuals, still in Milano’s car, proceeded to a wooded area of the township, stopped along the side of the road, and exited the vehicle. Chester then punched or kicked Milano in the head several times, causing him to fall to the ground. Appellant jumped on top of Milano, pinned him to the ground, and killed him by slashing his throat repeatedly with a box-cutter. The assailants ran toward the home of a friend, Rich Griscavage. En route, Appellant took off his shirt, wiped blood from his jacket with it and discarded it. Upon arriving at Griscavage’s house, Chester and Appellant were visibly agitated. Chester indicated to Griscavage that they had gotten into a fight with someone and “the dude is dead,” whereupon Appellant interrupted and instructed Chester not to discuss the matter. Soon thereafter, Griscavage gave Appellant a ride home on the back of his motorcycle. He testified that Appellant did not have any trouble keeping his balance or leaning into turns, so that the ten-minute motorcycle ride was unproblematic.</p>

She testified that he always carried his box-cutter with him, but that he disposed of it after the murder by throwing it into a creek. Additionally, Appellant asked her if she could “be an alibi,” repeated his instruction to Chester not talk to anyone about the incident, and stated, “no evidence, no crime.” Finally, the Commonwealth introduced a tape recording and transcript of a consensually intercepted telephone call between Chester and Appellant on December 20, 1987. During the <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>call, Appellant suggested that Chester leave town, indicated his intention to “hide until this blows over,” recommended ways of passing a polygraph test, commented on the district attorney’s inability to prove a case without evidence, and expressed his belief that criminal homicide is subject to a seven-year statute of limitations. Two days later, Appellant was arrested at a motel in Falls, Pennsylvania.</p>

As Appellant’s initial conviction was vacated due to trial error rather than evidentiary insufficiency, he does not predicate his argument on the fact that he was previously tried for first-degree murder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Rather, his theory is that, under Sec<a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>tion 109 of the Crimes Code, the Commonwealth was unable to retry him for first-degree murder in view of his subsisting convictions for second- and third-degree murder. In particular, Appellant observes that Section 109 bars a second prosecution based upon the same facts and “for a violation of the same provision of the statutes” as an earlier prosecution, where the first prosecution resulted in a conviction that has not been reversed or vacated. 18 Pa.C.S. § 109(3). As applied here, Appellant recites that his convictions for second- and third-degree murders have not been reversed or vacated, and contends that they resulted from a violation of the “same provision” as the present first-degree murder conviction. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(a), (b), and (c) (prohibiting first, second, and third-degree murder, respectively). This contention is in error, however, as the “same provision” phraseology of Section 109(3) refers to the same offense, and not merely the same section of the Crimes Code. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 109, official cmt. (clarifying that the purpose of subsection (3) is to codify the existing rule that “a former conviction of the accused bars a later prosecution of him for the <em>same offense” </em>(emphasis added)); <em>accord <a href="/a2d/729/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="729 A.2d 529" data-case-ids="11620439,607210" data-case-paths="/a2d/729/0529-01,/pa/556/0442-01">id.,</a> </em>§ 110(1) (affirming that Section 109 addresses a second prosecution for the same offense as a former one). Thus, because the three types of murder proscribed by Section 2502 constitute distinct offenses, Section 109(3) did not prohibit the Commonwealth from retrying Appellant for first-degree murder.</p>

At the first trial, the prosecutor and Appellant’s attorney both vigorously cross-examined Chester in a manner aimed at exposing inconsistencies in his version of the events and otherwise undermining his believability — and in the case of Appellant’s attorney, portraying Appellant as innocent of the murder. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T.

All right.”). During such cross-examination, moreover, which comprised 53 pages of transcript, both attorneys were interested in depicting Chester as unworthy of belief, and their questioning brought to light that: Chester had lied to the police on several occasions; his account of the assault could not be reconciled with the injuries sustained by the victim; and he eventually decided to cooperate with authorities by placing the intercepted phone call solely in an effort to obtain leniency for himself. In light of the above, Appellant does not claim that he lacked a fair opportunity for cross-examination; rather, his essential contention appears to be that no amount of cross-examination of Chester at the first trial would be sufficient to cure the present Confrontation Clause difficulty because the relevant issue in the second trial was whether Appellant lacked the ability to form an intent to kill at the time of the incident, and the cross-examination of Chester at the first trial did not address that question. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 30-31.</p>

It bears noting, as well, that Chester was not an expert witness, and as such, would not have been able to offer psychological or psychiatric expert testimony concerning a diminished capacity defense; indeed, Appellant neglects to specify exactly what Chester could have said during cross-examination that would have added material support to his diminished-capacity defense forwarded during the second trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

The Commonwealth requested that the trial court reserve judgment on the motion until after Appellant actually testified, and defense counsel stated that he would not oppose such a course of action. <em>See </em>N.T.

The court <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>then expressed its tentative view that the Commonwealth would probably be entitled to introduce the convictions, but qualified its position by observing that it did not know what evidence would be elicited at trial, and so it would permit Appellant to renew the motion at the conclusion of the Commonwealth’s case. <em>See id. </em>at 6.

The court was additionally cognizant that, as the trial developed, the defense might change its strategy and ultimately decide for independent reasons that it would be best for Appellant not to testify, thereby mooting the issue. <em>See id. </em>(reflecting the trial court’s statement that “I don’t know what’s going to be developed at trial, and I will allow as [sic] to renew this [motion] at the conclusion of the Commonwealth’s case <em>should you wish to renew it.” </em>(emphasis added)). Appellant does not presently argue that he was unable to renew his motion, or proffer any reason why the trial court was obligated to make a final decision at the December 13th pretrial hearing, nor has he elected to file a reply brief disputing the Commonwealth’s theory that he ultimately decided not to testify because he knew that any testimony supporting his diminished capacity defense was susceptible of impeachment with his testimony from the first trial.</p>

The Commonwealth also argues that, even though Appellant’s first-degree murder conviction and death sentence had been set aside, he stood convicted of second-degree murder at the time of his pretrial confinement, and hence, the county prison authorities were justified in housing him in the RHU because he was at a higher risk for escape and society’s need for protection from him was greater than with a prisoner convicted of a lesser crime.</p>

Pennsylvania’s capital sentencing statute used to require that this Court undertake such review in all death penalty cases: Section 9711(h)(3)(iii) of the statute required reversal of a sentence of death that was “excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3)(iii) (repealed). This portion of the statute was removed, however, nearly ten years before Appellant’s retrial. <em>See </em>Act of June 25, 1997, P.L. 293, No. 28, § 1.

Appellant called three forensic psychiatric and psychological expert witnesses who testified at length concerning his mental health difficulties, brain injuries, and heavy drug and alcohol usage. These experts opined, <em>inter alia, </em>that Appellant had a blood-alcohol content of approximately 0.45 percent at the time of the murder and that, given his brain damage, his ability to form a specific intent to kill with that level of intoxication would have been significantly impaired or non-existent. Indeed, there was no dispute at the retrial that Appellant was highly intoxicated at the time of the killing. Furthermore, during the defense case, counsel read to the jury a portion of a sworn declaration executed by Chester during Appellant’s PCRA proceedings in which Chester recounted Appellant’s severe intoxication on the night in question, ultimately concluding that " 'Rick was drunk out of his mind. By the end of that evening, Rick could barely walk.’ ” N.T. Feb. 8, 2007, at 14 (quoting Chester Declaration at ¶ 7). Accordingly, and as noted above, it is difficult to see how any omission in prior counsel’s cross-examination of Chester concerning Appellant’s present diminished capacity defense could have substantially impeded Appellant from developing that defense at his retrial.</p>
