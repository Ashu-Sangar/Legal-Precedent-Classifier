While the existence of the gas deposits in the area have been known for a long time, recent developments in drilling techniques have allowed for the potential recovery of dramatically larger quantities of natural gas. Estimates suggest that the area could contain over 489 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas, enough to supply the natural gas needs of the United States for fourteen years. The developments in recovery techniques and the proximity of the formation to the energy markets of the east coast cities has created a surge of interest in drilling in the area. Consequently, gas companies in the past few years have offered landowners much more lucrative lease terms than were present in older leases, given the increased competition for drilling rights. This has caused some landowners to review them older leases and question whether the terms provided therein comply with the GMRA.</p>

Likewise, Landowners assert that the plain language does not state that royalties should be calculated at the wellhead as argued by the Gas Companies. Landowners reject the Gas Companies’ contention that the word “royalty” has developed a technical meaning in the oil and gas industry. Instead, they maintain that the ordinary meaning of the term royalty should be binding in this case. Relying upon standard dictionary definitions, Landowners argue that the term “royalty” is ordinarily defined as “a compensation or portion <em>of the proceeds </em>paid to the owner of a right, <em>as a patent or oil or mineral right.” </em>Landowners’ Brief at 19 (emphasis in original). They note that “proceeds” are defined as the “total amount derived from a sale or other transaction.” Landowners’ Brief at 20.

Although acknowledging that Pennsylvania has not adopted the First Marketable Product Doctrine, Landowners argue that it can be assumed that the legislature was aware of the century-old duty to market doctrine when it enacted the GMRA in 1979, and thus, intended the GMRA to reflect the doctrine by requiring lessees to bear all the costs necessary to market the gas, which would include the post-production costs at issue in this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

In that act, the legislature defined a “royalty owner” as “any owner of an interest in oil or gas lease which entitles him to share in the production of the oil or gas under such lease or the proceeds therefrom <em>without obligating him to pay any costs under such lease.” <a href="/p2d/886/0652-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="886 P.2d 652" data-case-ids="10350078" data-case-paths="/p2d/886/0652-01">Id.</a> </em>(emphasis added).

Accordingly, they assert that when read together the two statutes provide that landowners “are entitled to the payment of one-eighth royalty of all oil, natural gas, or gas of other designations removed or recovered from the subject real property without obligating them to pay any costs under such lease.” Landowners’ Brief at 7.

Landowners contend that the GMRA is a remedial statute intended to prevent deception and exploitation of Pennsylvania property owners by developers. Therefore, Landowners assert that the statute must be interpreted in their favor, and the only way to guarantee the landowner a one-eighth royalty is to base the payment on the amount of money received by the gas company when it sells the gas at the prevailing market price, and not the illusory value of the gas “at the wellhead.” They argue that the market price is an easily determined amount that is not subject to corporate manipulation and inflation of costs. They emphasize that the definition of post-production costs as used in the net-back calculation in the current lease is “without limitation.” Moreover, they assert that use of post-production deductions will merely generate more litigation over the legitimacy of the deductions claimed by the Gas Companies. They contend that it satisfies the remedial purpose of the GMRA to read the statute to prevent the potential exaggeration of post-production costs, which would result in a diminished royalty.</p>

Therefore, to calculate the price of the natural gas at the wellhead (and thus the royalties), they argue that we must work backward from the value-added price received at the point of sale by deducting the companies’ costs of turning the gas into a marketable commodity.

Similarly, expenditures for transportation of the gas to the high-demand markets of the east coast cities can earn much higher sales prices than in the fields of Western Pennsylvania. Therefore, by deducting the expenses of production and transportation from the final sales price, one can fairly calculate the price for the unprocessed gas at the moment of removal. They dispute Landowners’ framing of the Lease as involving post-production deductions from the royalty rather than calculations that enable a determination of the royalty at the time of removal.</p>

Prior to the late 1980’s, the role of the producer was to explore for oil and maintain the wells. When the gas came out of the well, the producer sold it to the pipeline company at the wellhead for a federally regulated price. The pipeline company would then assume all the responsibilities of transforming the raw product (sour gas) into marketable natural gas (sweet gas) and trans<a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>porting it to the market place, where the gas was sold to local distribution companies. The pipeline company would sell the gas at a higher price, given the value added in the process of transforming and transporting it from sour to sweet gas. The producer, however, was paid a price for the natural product when it sold the gas to the pipeline company at the wellhead, and royalties for the landowner were calculated based on that “at the wellhead” price. Therefore, at the time of the enactment of the GMRA in 1979, the wellhead was the point of royalty measurement. Accordingly, the Gas Companies argue that the one-eighth royalty included in the GMRA was one-eighth of the unprocessed value of the gas at the point of removal. The Gas Companies also note that in 1979 almost all jurisdictions presumed that royalties were calculated at the wellhead.</p>

The federal government required pipeline companies to unbundle their transportation services from their own natural gas sales efforts and, in effect, provide common-carriage services to others, including gas producers, who wished to transport natural gas. This has been referred to as the deregulation of the industry. The Gas Companies argue that the Lease’s net-back calculation of royalties merely recreates the allocations that existed at the time the GMRA was enacted when royalties were calculated based upon the price of the raw/sour gas at the wellhead and not based upon the price of valued-added sweet gas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

They assert that valuation of the gas at the wellhead standardizes the royalties, consistent with the statutory language.

In 1979, the legislature was not faced with a choice of whether the calculation should be made at the wellhead or the point of sale because they were one and the same.

Landowners contend that the term royalty does not encompass a share of the actual product but only "money to be paid,” and thus suggest that the GMRA did not contemplate that a landowner would receive natural gas in-kind as the royalty. They also suggest that the concept of taking natural gas royalties in-kind is absurd, and thus against the rules of statutory construction, because natural gas is not usable when it is removed from the ground. Landowners, however, do <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>not acknowledge that, in addition to natural gas royalties, the GMRA governs royalties relating to oil, which can be taken in-kind.</p>

They argue that Landowners’ construction would result in a substantial increase in the royalties paid to the landowners without any indication that the legislature intended that result, or even foresaw the dramatic changes from deregulation.</p>

We note that the General Assembly is the branch of government best suited to weigh the public polices underlying the determination of the proper point of royalty valuation in the deregulated gas industry. However, until the General Assembly acts to specify the point of valuation, we must interpret the statute as written, prior to deregulation.</p>
