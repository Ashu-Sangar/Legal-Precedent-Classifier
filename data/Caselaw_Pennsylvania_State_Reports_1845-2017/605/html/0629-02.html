Roebuck, appeals from the order below, which denied his motion to amend and dismissed his petition to set aside the nomination petition of Appel<a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>lee/candidate, Bryant Brown, for State Representative from the 188th Legislative District in the May 2010 Democratic Party primary. Appellant had challenged numerous signatures in the nomination petition on the ground that the signatures belonged to voters who lived “out of district” and, therefore, were ineligible to sign Appellee’s nomination petition. The line-by-line table hsting the challenges referred to the “out of district” challenge as “OD” but in defining this designation, Appellant inadvertently referenced the 1st Senatorial District rather than the correct 188th Legislative District. Prior to the hearing in Commonwealth Court on the merits of his challenge, Appellant moved to amend his petition to set aside to refer to the correct electoral district. The trial court held such error was non-amendable, as it would constitute a new challenge after the expiration of the statutorily prescribed seven-day period for fifing objections. <em>See </em>25 P.S. § 2937. Appellant acknowledged that he could not sustain his challenge unless the amendment was permitted, and thus the trial court dismissed his petition to set aside. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b697-5" data-blocks='[["BL_697.5",697,[209,1393,1156,865]]]'>The trial court clearly erred in denying the dispositive motion to amend.

However, the authority is not unlimited. This Court has expressly recognized that the limits of such discretion are defined by the relationship between the attempted amendment and the timely-filed objections. <em>See Stuski, supra </em>at 238 n. 7 (holding that “as long as an objection has been made to signatures on the nomination petition, the challenging party can make other challenges to those signatures based on the Election Code during the hearing on the petition to set aside”); <em>Appeal of Beynon, supra </em>at 792 (holding that, “where, as here, there are general allegations of the specific grounds of invalidity which sufficiently advise the proposed candidate of the errors in his nomination petitions ..., it is not an abuse of discretion to allow an amendment”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>Here, Appellant’s petition was captioned and specifically pled in paragraphs three, four and eight that he was challenging Appellee’s nomination petition and placement on the ballot for State Representative in the <em>188th Legislative District. </em>Moreover, Appellee knows that he is seeking the Democratic Party’s nomination, from the 188th Legislative District for the office of State Representative in the General Assembly as this is the purpose in respect of which the nomination petition has been filed. As noted in <em>Beynon, supra, </em>the allegations must set forth the sufficiently specific grounds of invalidity to advise the proposed candidate of the errors in his nomination petitions so that he is in a position to present any defense he may have to such allegations. This standard was clearly met in the instant case. “Out of district” is a straightforward concept. As only qualified electors from that district can sign a nominating petition,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Appellee cannot credibly claim any confusion over Appellant’s challenge.</p>
