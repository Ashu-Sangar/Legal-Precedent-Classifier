In the Lawrence County proceedings, Appellant filed a motion to quash the charges, invoking the compulsory joinder statute, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 110, in light of the previous convictions.

According to the witness, Appellant and Ms. Miller left the children in the vehicle and walked away, with Appellant sliding a pistol-grip shotgun into his pants.

Police also testified to recovery of a small stain sample from Appellant’s clothes, which a forensic specialist identified as containing a genetic marker consistent with the victim’s blood.

As the Commonwealth develops, however, on cross-examination defense counsel asked the officer whether Appellant “g[a]ve you any problems at all?” N.T., Jan. 29, 2008, at 64. Accordingly, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to permit the Commonwealth to develop, on redirect, that Appellant gave a false name, since this bore relevance to the degree of Appellant’s cooperation. <em>Accord Reed II, </em>Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 96 of 2002, <em>slip op. </em>at 25 (“There was no error instantly in allowing the Commonwealth to more <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>fully develop Defendant’s cooperation at the time he was taken into custody.”).</p>

By way of background, some of the testimony provided by Jayla McKnight at trial was in tension with her preliminary-hearing testimony and her previous responses to a police officer, as reflected in his report. On redirect examination, the prosecutor asked the officer whether his report of the interview with Jayla was verbatim. <em>See </em>N.T., Jan. 30, 2008, at 9 (“It is not a written out verbatim statement?”).

Moreover, there is no serious challenge to the truthfulness of the officer’s testimony that the report was not a word-for-word account, which is consistent with common experience.
