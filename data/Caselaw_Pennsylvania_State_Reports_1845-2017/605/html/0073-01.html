Krewstown Park Apartments, </em><a href="/pa-super/385/0613-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="385 Pa.

But the statutory inclusion of “such beneficiary’s guardian” in the definition of beneficiary does not in any sense remove Emily from her status as a beneficiary in her own right.

The policy questions that are implicated focus not on parental duty but on protection of the public fisc in the provision of medical assistance to minors whose parents do not have the financial means to do so.

The presence of such allegations supports DPW’s argument that the “complaint asserted a claim for past medical expenses incurred during [Emily’s] minority, and that claim remained in the case at the time of settlement.” Brief for Appellant at 21.</p>

DPW is the agency responsible for administering medical assistance funds throughout the Commonwealth. When DPW provides such funds to a “beneficiary” because of an injury for which a third person (here, the doctor and hospital) is liable, DPW has the right to recover a reasonable value of funds paid to a “beneficiary.” 62 P.S. § 1409(b)(1). DPW may do so either by initiating proceedings, through the Attorney General, against the third-party tortfeasors, <em><a href="/a2d/933/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="933 A.2d 86" data-case-ids="8340648" data-case-paths="/a2d/933/0086-01">id.,</a> </em>or by asserting a first lien against the amount of any award or settlement received by the beneficiary. 62 P.S. § 1409(b)(7)®.

For the reasons that follow, I would affirm the Superior Court’s holding that Emily’s parents, and not Emily herself, were the beneficiaries of medical assistance payments during Emily’s minor years, and thus DPW cannot assert a lien against the settlement reached in this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a>

In that light, the Majority holds that “notwithstanding any other provision of law would seem to preclude reliance on any common law rule that might bar a beneficiary from recovering from his or her tortfeasors the monies that DPW expended on his or her behalf during minority.” Maj. Op. at 88, 987 A.2d at 690. This statement, however, puts the proverbial cart before the horse, because, based upon the plain language of the above-quoted statute, the subject person must first be a beneficiary before “any other provision of law” precludes him or her from challenging DPW’s lien against an award. As I cannot agree that Emily is a beneficiary, I do not believe that this generalized language should be employed to abrogate the long-standing principles concerning parents’ responsibilities to care for their children.</p>

For the reasons set forth herein, claims for minor-year medical expenses were Emily’s parents’ alone; and as the medical assistance payments relevant to this appeal relate only to Emily’s minor years, DPW’s redress was through the parents, as they were the true beneficiaries of the medical assistance payments made for Emily’s care during that time. Notwithstanding that these claims have long since expired, DPW cannot now attack the settlement for Emily’s adult-years’ care to satisfy its lien, when she was not the beneficiary of the subject funds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_11" id="ref_footnote_3_11">11</a> To be sure, the Majority’s permitting of such a course of action allows DPW to recover funds it spent for Emily’s care as a minor, from a settlement, which necessarily only includes monies for medical expenses incurred, and to be incurred, while Emily is an adult.</p>

Such actions themselves, however, have five-year statutes of limitation, which has also expired. 62 P.S. § 1409(b)(4); <em>Jordan v.

As noted by the Superior Court, an open question remains concerning whether Emily has received any medical assistance payments since she has turned eighteen. It is undisputed that, if she has, DPW can assert a lien against the settlement for recovery of that money. Thus, I would also agree with the Superior Court that a remand to the trial court is necessary to resolve this unanswered aspect of the litigation. Regardless, this appeal solely concerns medical assistance payments provided by DPW for medical care during Emily's minor years and, for a multitude of reasons, in my view, Emily’s parents were the true beneficiaries of the payments made during that time period.</p>

To that end, it is worthy of note that the trial court instituted a trust fund and appointed a trustee for the disbursement of funds out of the settlement with Dr. Clair and Centre Community Hospital. In my view, the appointment of a trustee to oversee the settlement proceeds lends even more credence to the suggestion that Emily was the sole beneficiary of the action's proceeds. If these funds were to reimburse Emily’s parents (or DPW) for monies spent on Emily’s care during her childhood, the trust would have been unnecessary, and the proceeds could have been distributed directly to the parents (or DPW).</p>
