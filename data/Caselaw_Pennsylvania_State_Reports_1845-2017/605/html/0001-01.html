Appellant was sentenced to death following his convictions for first-degree murder, rape, indecent assault, recklessly endangering another person, possessing an instrument of crime, and flight to avoid apprehension. These charges arose out of the stabbing murder of Appellant’s wife in November of 1995. We affirm.</p>

On November 18, 1995, Appellant and his wife, Sherry, left their two children, Barbara and Dennis, with Appellant’s mother, Agnes Miller, and went to a local bar called Trib’s Waystation where they drank some beer and <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>ingested methamphetamine.

Ms. Miller twice drove to Appellant’s home and observed that the doors to the residence were locked, no one answered the door, and that Sherry’s car was not there. On November 20, 1995, after speaking to Sherry’s mother and learning that she had not heard from Sherry, Ms. Miller filed a missing persons report with the Pennsylvania State Police. After the investigating trooper was unable to locate Appellant or his wife, he and other troopers went to their residence. Once there, they received permission from Ms. Miller to break into the residence. Upon doing so, they discovered the naked body of Sherry Miller lying on a bed in an upstairs bedroom. Her body was covered in blood, her legs were spread, her knees were bent, and there was a blood-covered pillow over her face. Upon discovering the body, the troopers left the residence to wait for a search warrant.</p>

At trial, the Commonwealth presented, <em>inter alia, </em>the testimony of Michael Torres who for a time was Appellant’s cellmate while he was incarcerated on the aggravated assault charge. Torres testified that Appellant often spoke of killing his wife and that on the day Appellant was released from prison he stated, “I’ll be back for killing my wife.” The Commonwealth also presented the testimony of forensic pathologist, Richard Callery, M.D., who testified that the victim died because of the numerous stab wounds she sustained, which caused severe internal bleeding. The doctor also opined that the victim died while being subjected to forcible intercourse. In his defense, Appellant presented the testimony of a witness who stated that Torres had fabricated his testimony. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court found Appellant guilty of the above enumerated offenses.</p>

At the penalty hearing the Commonwealth presented evidence on two aggravating circumstances, namely, that Appellant committed the murder during the perpetration of a felony, in this case rape, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6), and by means of torture, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(8). Appellant thereafter asserted that two mitigating circumstances applied: Appellant lacked the capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(3), and the “catch-all provision,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). At the conclusion of the penalty hearing, the trial court found one aggravating circumstance, Section 9711(d)(6), and one mitigating circumstance, Section 9711(e)(3). Upon weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the trial court fixed the penalty at death. The court formally imposed that sentence on October 27, 1997, together with a consecutive sentence of ten to twenty years incarceration on the rape conviction.</p>

In support of this claim, Appellant faults trial counsel for not calling during trial Dr. Gerald Cooke, a psychologist who had been retained by the defense for the penalty phase. Appellant claims Dr. Cooke would have opined that the killing was consistent with an explosive rage premised on Appellant’s “personality makeup, his drug use and everything he told [Dr. Cooke] about the incident”.

Appellant also contends <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>that trial counsel’s representation was deficient because he did not interview or call as witnesses several of Appellant’s family members. According to Appellant, these witnesses would have testified that Appellant and the victim had a tumultuous relationship that was fueled by drug and alcohol abuse, that the victim saw other men, that she was impregnated by another man and had an abortion, that knives were kept in the bedroom where the murder occurred, and that the bed was broken prior to the day of the murder. Finally, Appellant states that trial counsel should have presented expert testimony demonstrating that the manner in which the victim was killed (multiple stab wounds) was typical of a “very angry assailant, an emotionally charged assailant,” as well as testimony opining that the killing was committed in the heat of passion and that Appellant suffered from brain damage that affected his ability to appreciate the consequences of his actions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Appellant’s Brief, 21-22.</p>

The PCRA Court’s reasons for rejecting this claim were correct as they indicate that the court had considered and rejected the evidence submitted at trial by Appellant regarding his claim that the killing was committed in the heat of passion and that the additional evidence would have resulted in a different outcome. The reason for this is clear, namely, the additional evidence fails to establish that the killing resulted from a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation caused by the victim contemporaneously with the killing. Once Appellant refused to testify about the events surrounding the killing, he made it virtually impossible for counsel to convince the trial court that the killing was committed in the “heat of passion” insofar as the record lacked any evidence that the killing was the result of some provocative act committed by the victim or that Appellant killed the victim in the “heat of passion” as a consequence of the victim’s provocation of him.

While Appellant claims that the victim’s apparent infidelity and flirtatiousness, when coupled with his own mental state, were sufficient to cause him to act with sudden and intense passion, we note Appellant was well aware of his wife’s proclivities prior to the day of the killing and trial counsel introduced evidence establishing this. Thus, the evidence Appellant claims should have been introduced on this issue was merely cumulative of evidence already presented at trial. Moreover, the evidence shows that although Appellant and his wife argued while together at the bar, he calmed down and appeared to be in control of his faculties following the argument.

    <p id="b126-5" data-blocks='[["BL_126.6",126,[272,504,1160,1266]]]'>In this claim, appellant alleges that trial counsel’s ineffectiveness rendered invalid his waiver of his right to a jury trial and his right to testify. Appellant develops this claim primarily in terms of the jury waiver, faulting counsel’s advice to waive, and then, respecting the right to testify, merely states that “[t]he exact same [sic] reasoning applies to his waiver of the right to testify.” Brief of Appellant, 50. Although I join the Majority Opinion concerning this dual claim, I would also briefly note that in ruling on appellant’s claim of ineffectiveness related to his right to testify, the PCRA court concluded that the claim was without merit, since appellant opted not to testify despite counsel’s advice to the contrary. While the Majority notes this fact in passing, it intimates that we would have to “guess whether counsel’s ineffectiveness interfered with [appellant’s] right to testify” and that we will not engage in such speculation. Respectfully, I see no need to go that far, given that the PCRA court aptly pointed out that counsel cannot be deemed ineffective, since he encouraged appellant to testify, only to have appellant refuse. Thus, in this instance, any complaint regarding appellant’s decision not to testify is placed squarely on appellant’s shoulders and cannot support a claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness. Appellant inexplicably fails to account for this dispositive fact in asserting that his twin claims depend on the same reasoning.</p>

Observers can and do debate whether the court majorities in <em>Wiggins, Williams </em>and <em>Rompilla </em>were faithful to AEDPA’s deference standard — notably all of these decisions, involving a controlling question of whether a state court judgment was objectively reasonable, were sharply divided. What cannot be debated is that: (1) the cases did not purport to break new constitutional ground; and (2) the decisions bind us, and they are important because those cases, like the more recent pre-AEDPA decision in <em>Van Hook, </em>stand as the High Court’s directive as to what was commanded by <em>Strickland </em>itself. <em>See also Porter v.

      <em>Claim </em>2 — The majority next rejects the claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present expert testimony to rebut the Commonwealth’s assertion that the victim was raped, crediting trial counsel’s belief that “the evidence made it pellucidly clear to him that no rape occurred and ... his belief that anyone who reviewed the evidence would draw the same conclusion he did.” Majority Opinion at 26, 987 A.2d at 653. The difficulty with trial counsel’s, and the majority’s, position is that counsel’s beliefs proved to be demonstrably erroneous, as a Commonwealth expert witness described the killing as a “classic rape-homicide” and the fact finder correctly found “ample evidence to prove that a rape occurred even without Dr. Callery’s testimony,” PCRA Court Opinion, <em>slip op. </em>at 10, with this Court confirming on direct appeal that the verdict on the offense of rape was consistent with the evidence. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Moreover, hindsight is not required to question counsel’s confidence, as well as his corresponding decision to forego further preparation, in light of the circumstances surrounding Appellant’s crimes, where there was undisputed evidence of intercourse and substantial circumstantial evidence of forcible compulsion. Indeed, at least in the absence of the assessments provided by Appellant’s post-conviction experts, it is difficult to consider trial counsel’s belief that no fact finder would render a verdict of guilt on the rape charge to be rational, let alone reasonable.</p>
