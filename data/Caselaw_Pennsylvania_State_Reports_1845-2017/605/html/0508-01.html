Novosielski (“Decedent”), to inventory with Decedent’s estate the principal and proceeds of a United States Treasury account titled in Appellant’s and Decedent’s names. Because we conclude that both the Superior Court and orphans’ court misinterpreted relevant provisions of the act known as the Multiple-Party Accounts Act (“MPAA”), 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 6301-6306, and failed to properly apply the MPAA’s relevant provisions, we reverse.</p>

Decedent’s will, dated June 12, 1995, provided that in the event her husband predeceased her, her estate would be divided equally among her five sisters, <em>per stirpes. </em>At the time of Decedent’s death, only one sister was living, Helen Modzelewski, while others left surviving children.</p>

Assistance was also provided by caregivers hired by Decedent and supervised by Appellant. On August 25, 2000, Decedent appointed Appellant her attorney-in-fact under a duly executed power of attorney. The power of attorney was drafted by James E. Kopelman, Esq., who later testified at the hearing in this case that he was comfortable with Decedent’s decision to execute the power of attorney because he “felt that she had the capacity to do it[,] that she understood what she was signing[,] and that there was no undue influence.” Master’s Hearing, 11/16/05, at 396. Kopelman further testified that at the time, Decedent was “mentally ... still very, very sharp[,] ... knew what she wanted to do[, and] understood the Power of Attorney....” <em>Id. </em>at 394.</p>

The Tender further provided that a “Treasury Direct” account was to be created in the account name of “Alice 6. Novosielski or Thomas V. Proch.” The “Investment Kit” that accompanied the Tender, and which explained the process and ramifications of the investment, indicated that an account in the names of two people joined by the word “or” creates a conclusive right of survivorship.

Kopelman testified that Appellant had discussed with him the possibility of combining Decedent’s various accounts into a Treasury Direct account, and that Kopelman had advised Appellant that he “was on the right track” for two reasons: the relatively low FDIC insured limits on the other accounts, and ease of administration of one account. Master’s Hearing, 11/16/05, at 399. Later, the master specifically found as a fact that Decedent had directed Appellant to place the Treasury Direct account in the names of Decedent <em>or </em>Appellant after she had had an opportunity to review the Investment Kit prior to her executing the Tender, including that portion of the Investor Kit explaining the different ways of registering accounts and their ramifications.

At the conclusion of the final thirteen-week investment term, Appellant, acting under the power of attorney, unilaterally authorized a further one-year reinvestment of the account holdings without consulting Decedent.

Decedent’s surviving sister, Helen Modzelewski, filed objections to the account, contending that the Treasury Direct account should be listed as property of the estate. Appellant thereafter filed an amended first and final account of the estate; however, he continued to exclude from it the Treasury Direct account. In the interim, Helen had died, and John Modzelewski (“Appellee”), Helen’s son and administrator of his mother’s estate, filed objections to Appellant’s amended first accounting, raising the additional argument that Appellant had abused his role as attorney-in-fact by misappropriating or misusing approximately $90,000 of Decedent’s funds.</p>

The court reiterated its conclusion that the account was merely a "convenience account” for Decedent's care during her lifetime, and further determined that while testimony of record supported the conclusion that Decedent wished Appellant to have the account upon her death, the formal requirements for a testamentary disposition were lacking. <em>Id. </em>at 8.
