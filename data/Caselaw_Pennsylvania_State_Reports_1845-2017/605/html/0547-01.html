Appellants filed an answer and new matter, alleging that, if a bond remained unclaimed for two years after its maturity date, Appellants held the funds in a non-interest-bearing account for an additional five years, and then escheated them to the state, as required by law. <em>See </em>72 P.S. § 1301.6.

    <p id="b618-4" data-blocks='[["BL_618.6",618,[265,607,1160,1251]]]'>Appellants thereafter filed a third-party complaint, joining the Treasurer of Pennsylvania as an additional defendant, and sought to have the case removed to the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court on the basis that the Commonwealth was an indispensable party. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 761. During discovery, however, the Treasurer admitted that, when a holder of property remits it to the Commonwealth, only the amount listed in the bond needs to be forwarded; accretions and interest earned do not need to be remitted. The Treasurer ultimately filed preliminary objections, which were sustained by the trial court, a ruling that was upheld on interlocutory appeal to the Commonwealth Court. <em>See Delaware County v.

Rather, the Court stated, the present litigation only concerns whether the banks are liable to the County for damages sustained during the five years that they retained the funds beyond the initial two-year period, a question that does not implicate any property now in the Commonwealth’s possession. <em>See <a href="/a2d/827/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="827 A.2d 594" data-case-ids="9109502" data-case-paths="/a2d/827/0594-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/827/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="827 A.2d 594" data-case-ids="9109502" data-case-paths="/a2d/827/0594-01">at 599-600</a>.

Therefore, Appellants could not interpose the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense. <em>See Delaware County v.

Moreover, the court held that the Debt Act is clear: any interest earned on the deposits is for the County’s own use. The court observed that, since the County’s deposits are not assigned to any particular issued bond, they are used to pay all the bonds when they become due. Likewise, the court reasoned that, since the interest earned on the deposits does not follow any bond, it is used to help fund the repayment of all the bonds. As a result, the accrual of interest decreases the amount the County has to deposit for the payment of the bonds, and because Appellants failed to return the unclaimed funds, the court concluded that the County suffered damages by being deprived of income that it would have been free to use for any purpose before the funds had to be escheated. <em>See <a href="/a2d/929/1258-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="929 A.2d 1258" data-case-ids="8356315" data-case-paths="/a2d/929/1258-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/929/1258-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="929 A.2d 1258" data-case-ids="8356315" data-case-paths="/a2d/929/1258-01">at 1264</a>.</p>

Appellants thus argue that, in view of the unclaimed property statute’s unambiguous terms, any presumed gains the County might have enjoyed through possession of the funds during the five years in question would have been subject to escheatment, together with the funds themselves.

Therefore, the County argues, the present case does not implicate the portion of the statutory definition of property that subsumes interest and earnings, as that provision merely anticipates the potential transfer of earned income from the Commonwealth back to the rightful property owner in the post-escheatment time-frame. <em>See </em>72 P.S. § 1301.15 (“When property is paid or delivered to the State Treasurer under this article, the owner is entitled to receive income or other increments actually received by the State Treasurer.”). The County also emphasizes that the statutory definition of “property” makes the escheatable amount “subject to all legal demands” on the property in question, 72 P.S. § 1301.1, and proffers that this qualifier pertains, in the present case, to its right to benefit from the income on its deposits while they remain in the hands of the depositories, as well as its right to receive back the deposits, together with interest, two years after the bonds mature.</p>

While this argument is plausible, its weakness is that it focuses solely on the phrase, “together with any income, accretions, or profits thereof and thereon,” and overlooks the words that follow, “and all <em>other rights </em>to property.” 72 P.S. § 1301.1 (emphasis added).

In many instances, the interest earned on unclaimed principal does attach to the principal so that if the principal’s owner is determined, that person can claim ownership rights over the interest as well.

For this reason, we find that the County’s suggested interpretation is also reasonable. Thus, contrary to Appellants’ suggestion, it is not entirely clear from the face of the statute whether the Legislature intended unclaimable interest and other accretions to escheat along with the principal in every case.

Because the bondholder would not have been entitled to collect any income that would have been earned on the funds prior to escheatment, the justification for requiring escheatment of such income is substantially diminished. <em>See generally Kane v.

First, under a contrary interpretation — the one urged by Appellants — if a bondholder redeemed the bond one day before escheatment, the County would be permitted to keep all income earned on the monies up to the time of payment, but if a claim was lodged against the Commonwealth one day after escheatment, <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>all such interest would remain in the permanent possession of the state.

Thus, for example, local governments are permitted to create a single sinking fund for the aggregate, or more than one issue or series, of its genei*al obligation bonds and notes, <em>see </em>53 Pa.C.S. § 8221(a)(1), and they are entitled to use interest earned to reduce the amount that needs to be deposited.

Appellants had predicated that position on the Unclaimed Property Act’s definition of “property" as including “all real and personal property, tangible or intangible, all legal and equitable interests therein, <em>together with any income, accretions, or profits thereof and thereon, and all other rights to property, subject to all legal demands on the same." </em>72 P.S. § 1301.1 (emphasis added).</p>

Thus, no question concerning the implications of Section 1301.14 — which relieves a former property holder of "liability with respect to the safekeeping of such property,” <em>see supra </em>note 6 — is before this Court. <em>See First Union Corp., </em><a href="/pa/598/0545-02" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="598 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="3990254,3990997" data-case-paths="/pa/598/0545-02,/pa/598/0545-01">598 Pa. at 546</a>, <a href="/pa/598/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="958 A.2d 1038" data-case-ids="3989269,3990254,3990997,8206162,8206179,8206274" data-case-paths="/pa/598/0546-01,/pa/598/0545-02,/pa/598/0545-01,/a2d/958/1038-01,/a2d/958/1038-02,/a2d/958/1038-03">958 A.2d at 1038</a>.</p>

In the present case, if any benefit was realized, it was obtained by Appellants, as they placed the monies into non-interest-bearing accounts for several years before escheating them to the state. The above question is relevant to the issue of whether judgment on the pleadings was properly denied, however, as its answer determines whether the County suffered any potential loss by not having use of the funds prior to escheatment.</p>

This limitation also distinguishes the present situation from <em>Lessner, </em>relied on both by Appellants and Judge Colins in his Commonwealth Court dissent. In <em>Lessner, </em>the asset at issue was a ceitificate of deposit, and it was clear that the certificate’s owner would have been entitled to collect the interest earned on the deposited funds; thus, the identity of the interest's owner was viewed as evidence that the same person owned the certificate. In that context, this Court recited the general precept that "interest follows the principal in ownership.” <em>Lessner, </em><a href="/pa/527/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="527 Pa. 393" data-case-ids="1827729" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0393-01">527 Pa. at 401</a>, 592 A.2d at 682. Here, however, the income produced by unclaimed bond funds does not accrue to the benefit of the bondholder, but is instead available for use by the local government unit. Thus, interest does not necessarily follow principal under the present circumstances.</p>

The County argues that these aspects of the Debt Act constitute “legal demands” on the interest income in question which operate to exclude it from the definition of "property” under the Unclaimed Property Act. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee at 8-9. We need not address this specific contention because the issue is capable of resolution through interpretation of the initial part of the definition, as set forth herein.</p>

This conclusion is consistent with the position maintained by the Treasurer of Pennsylvania. <em>See generally </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(8) (permitting courts to consider administrative interpretations of statutes whose words are not explicit on the issue under consideration).</p>
