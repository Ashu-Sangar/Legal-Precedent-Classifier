Briefly, Allegheny Health, Education, and Research Foundation (“AHERF”), presently a debtor in liquidation under the United States Bankruptcy Code, is a Pennsylvania nonprofit corporation <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>which operated hospitals, medical schools, and physicians’ practices. From the late-1980s through the mid-1990s, AH-ERF management aggressively pursued acquisitions in furtherance of an integrated-delivery-system business model. Ultimately, this plan failed, precipitating the bankruptcy filing. Subsequently, a committee of creditors with authority conferred by federal bankruptcy law (the “Committee”) commenced various causes of action against officers, insiders, and PriceWaterhouseCoopers, LLP (“PwC”), as successor to AH-ERF’s auditor, Coopers and Lybrand (“C &amp; L”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

For example, the Committee contends that management overstated net income by more than $150 million and net unrestricted assets by more than $240 million in 1997.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> According to the Committee, the objective was to create the impression that management strategy was effective, thus concealing the corporation’s deepening insolvency and facilitating management’s continuation of a <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>ruinous business strategy while thwarting essential, remedial intervention by the board of trustees. <em>See </em>Committee Brief at 14 (“Had Coopers performed its audits in compliance with GAAS, AHERF’s trustees and its creditors could and would have intervened and put a halt to a growth strategy that could not be afforded.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The claims were predicated on theories, asserted under Pennsylvania law, of breach of contract, professional negligence, and aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty.

The core factual basis for its defense was the participation of AHERF officers in the asserted fraud, since they provided C &amp; L with false financial statements in the first instance. According to PwC’s theory, such fraud is properly imputed to the officers’ principal, AHERF. PwC then asserted that, regardless of whether or not C <em>&amp; </em>L’s own agents knew that the financial statements were false, where the culpability of the plaintiff (the Committee, standing in AHERF’s shoes) is at least as great as that of the defendant (PwC, standing in C <em>&amp; </em>L’s shoes), the action is barred by <em>in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis </em>(meaning in a case of equal or mutual fault the position of the defending party is the stronger one). <em>See generally Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. v.

Coopers failed to require AHERF to correct non-GAAP accounting and failed to make mandatory reports to AHERF’s Audit Committee. Coopers failed to report patent violations of GAAP accounting and other matters that directly called into question the integrity of AHERF’s financial management. Coopers’s failures resulted in audited financial statements that grossly misstated AHERF's financial performance and condition but carried Coopers’s clean opinions nonetheless.</blockquote>

As PwC develops, <em>in pan delicto </em>has also been referenced by courts in the negligence setting, for example, in cases involving personal injury or property damage. In this class of cases at least, however, the comparative negligence and contribution statutes serve to cover much of the ground formerly traveled by reference to the common-law maxim. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 7102(a) (prescribing, in such scenarios, "contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery by the plaintiff or his legal representative <em>where such negligence was not greater than the causal negligence of the defendant or defendants against whom recovery is sought, </em>but any damages sustained by the plaintiff shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributed to the plaintiff" (emphasis added)); 42 Pa.C.S. § 8324(a) ("The right of contribution exists among joint-tortfeasors."). Thus, where these statutes are applicable, it is only in unusual cases involving intentional wrongdoing on the part of a plaintiff in which <em>in pari delicto </em>may retain relevance.</p>

Indeed, under prevailing Pennsylvania law as presently established by the Superior Court, contributory negligence in the accounting context (as contemplated by <em>Jewelcor, </em><a href="/pa-super/373/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="210" data-cite="373 Pa.

This stands in stark contrast with the more flexible comparative negligence regime established by the Legislature to govern claims involving personal injury or property damage. <em>See supra </em>note 17. Permitting the use of imputation to support an <em>in pari delicto </em>defense in the negligent-auditor scenario relative to those who have proceeded in good faith, by way of comparison, represents a relatively modest allowance, particularly given the supporting requirement of at least equal fault.</p>

There was no indication of collusion on the part of the insurance company or its agents in the fraud.
