The presiding judge, former Judge Michael T. Conahan, simply adopted appellee George Banks’ counsel’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law wholesale as his purported “Determination on Competency Issues.” That performance violated this Court’s oft-repeated requirement of an autonomous judicial expression of the reasons for granting or denying post-conviction relief. <em>See, e.g., </em>

Conahan’s adoption of appellee’s proposed findings was doubly improper to the extent that the document includes findings as to questions that were well beyond the scope of the hearing as delineated in this Court’s December 28, 2007 opinion, which: reminded Conahan that he was to serve as this Court’s master to make two discrete competence determinations; specifically directed Conahan “not to be diverted by tangential motions and assertions by counsel”; and emphasized that “this Court retained] jurisdiction over such matters,” <em>Commonwealth v.

Accordingly, while continuing to retain plenary jurisdiction, we refer this matter to the Honorable Chester B. Muroski, President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County, for assignment to another judge of that court to hold a <em>de novo </em>competency hearing as expeditiously as possible. The trial court is referred to our decision in <em>Banks, supra, </em>concerning the very limited parameters of the hearing. <em>See supra. </em>A brief report on the progress of the proceeding is to be provided to this Court on a monthly basis.
