It is alleged that the Northern Harford Packing Association, through whom the plaintiffs obtained title, was a Maryland corporation; in other words, a foreign corporation, doing business in the state of Pennsylvania without having complied with the provisions of the act of assembly relating to foreign corporations doing business in this commonwealth. But the supply of materials to a foreign corporation for the purposes of this organization, and the purchase of such in this state, is not a doing of business within the meaning of the act of assembly. On the othei <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>hand, the defendants were members of the Maryland corporation residing in the state of Pennsylvania. If this Maryland corporation did not comply with the act of assembly, the question of law remains, whether these defendants can set up such a defence against the title of the plaintiffs, when the defendants are members of the corporation and were subject to its articles and by-laws. “No member shall at any time or place pack any goods which shall not be under the control of the board of directors of this company.” “All the goods packed by the members of this company shall be subject to the control of the board of directors of this company, and for sale in such manner as they deem proper.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b75-5" data-blocks='[["BL_75.5",75,[193,967,1190,924]]]'>In other words, whether a failure of the corporation to comply with the requirements of the act of assembly, and the prosecution of their business in the canning of goods in the state of Pennsylvania, and obtaining supplies for their trade from there, whether that is a doing of business within the state of Pennsylvania, within the meaning of the law which will render the contract of Smith &amp; Wicks void. There seems to be nothing in the act of assembly, in my opinion, which will render such a contract void under the circumstances.] 10 Or, the question may be this: Whether the defendants, being resident in Pennsylvania, and manufacturing goods in Pennsylvania, under the terms of their association with the Maryland corporation, can avoid their own contract with the corporation, and thus render void the contract of the corporation with Smith &amp; Wicks, and hold the goods against the plaintiffs in this writ. I must instruct you that they cannot do so and that the contract is not rendered void by the act of assembly. The defend ants’ own acts must estop them from such a defence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b75-6" data-blocks='[["BL_75.6",75,[198,1899,1188,510]],["BL_76.1",76,[290,349,1188,201]]]'>The case is one of ordinary title and ownership, though between persons of different sraies. And if you believe the testimony of the plaintiffs as to the sale of these goods, tne plaintiffs are entitled to the possession of them. The contract, under which the plaintiffs claim, was a Maryland contract, and if you believe the defendants held these materials or goods for the corporation and subject to its order, the fact of their being residents of Pennsylvania, and canning and packing their goods here, does not make void the contract between them and the Maryland corporation under the act of assembly, and they <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>cannot set up the act of assembly as a defence, and thus avoid their own acts which induced the purchase by the plaintiffs, and retain this property from the plaintiffs to whom they as a part of the Maryland corporation sold them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b76-5" data-blocks='[["BL_76.4",76,[288,556,1191,972]]]'>But, the defendants set up .another defence, namely, that in the transactions between them and the corporation in the business of furnishing supplies, the percentage on the same and the dividend declared by the corporation on a settlement of accounts between them are unpaid, alleging that the corporation is largely indebted to them, and the corporation then had no claim upon them. It is alleged that after the contract with Smith &amp; Wicks for the sale of all the canned goods in their possession, it was ready to prove that the corporation did no further business except disposing of some of the articles in their possession, that no dividend was paid after that, and that they paid no debts in the neighborhood, and that they were insolvent. It is alleged that by reason of this indebtedness of the corporation to them and their insolvency, they are justified in retaining the goods and in making a defence against the plaintiffs’ claim for these goods; that the plaintiffs, Smith &amp; Wicks, could obtain no better title from the corporation, than the corporation itself had, and if the corporation under the circumstances had no claim upon them, the plaintiffs had none.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b76-6" data-blocks='[["BL_76.5",76,[284,1537,1190,868]],["BL_77.1",77,[171,344,1186,198]]]'>I must instruct you that this is not correct. There can be no set-off in replevin, but if there is a charge or lien on the goods of the corporation, the defendants would be entitled to recoup the amount of that charge or lien against the plaintiffs’ claim to that extent, subject to any claims on.the part of the corporation. But whether there is such a charge or lien upon the goods in question, is to be determined by a consideration of the association of these defendants with the corporation. Article 13 of the by-laws provides that, “ The board of directors of this company shall on the first day of December of each year ascertain the average price obtained by them for all canned goods sold by them prior to that date.....And shall then pay to each member 90 per cent of the amount so ascertained as due him, first deducting therefrom the cost of all the materials, etc.....And the board of directors shall retain in the treasury of the company 10 per cent of the sales of all canned goods sold,” etc. By this it appears that on <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>stated occasions the value of the canned goods furnished by each member of the company was ascertained, and the member after it was ascertained was to receive 90 per cent of that amount and the association retained 10 per cent.</p>

But such an arrangement is subject to the claims of the creditors of the corporation. I use the language of a distinguished writer on corporations, which is appropriate: “ It was a regulation looking to the internal affairs of the company, to the rights of the stockholders among each other. These things are, even if they are provided for in the charter, mere contracts among the stockholders for the regulation of their rights to each other. They are contracts too, which any stockholder has a right to insist upon, even against every other; but if there be a dealing with third persons in which the stockholders acquiesce, or which they confirmed, they cannot plead when called upon to comply with their contract that it was ultra vires. The defendants cannot, therefore, set up any failure on the part of the corporation to pay them the amount due by the corporation on this arrangement between themselves:” Morawetz on Corporations, § 676.] 11</p>

    <p id="b80-7" data-blocks='[["BL_80.7",80,[250,1074,1187,613]]]'>This was an action -of replevin brought in the court below by the firm of Smith &amp; Wicks against the defendants for 1103 cases of canned tomatoes and 900 cases of canned corn, of the value of $3,004.50. The plaintiffs claimed title through the Northern Harford Packing Association, a corporation chartered by the state of Maryland, for the manufacture and sale of canned goods. The defendants claimed, and it was the principal ground of their defence, that the title of the plaintiffs derived from the said company was defective for the reason that said company was a foreign corporation, doing business in this state, and had not complied with the provisions of the act of assembly relating to foreign corporations.</p>
    <p id="b80-8" data-blocks='[["BL_80.8",80,[248,1693,1188,614]]]'>The defendants resided in York county, Pa., and were members of this corporation. Without going into a tedious detail of the business of said corporation, it may be stated that its members were to can their goods, and pack them, and hold them subject to the disposal of the corporation, which appears to have acted as a general agent for all its members in making sale of their commodities. On the 10th of January, 1885, a contract was entered into between the said corporation and Smith &amp; Wicks (plaintiffs below), for the sale of all the canned goods then held by the'association unsold at that time. A part of these, goods were those held by the defendants, and which are the subject of this controversy.</p>
    <p id="b80-9" data-blocks='[["BL_80.9",80,[249,2314,1183,98]],["BL_81.1",81,[191,348,1191,613]]]'>There can be no doubt as to the title of the plaintiffs to the property in question, unless, as contended by the defendants, <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>the transactions of the corporation were ultra vires by reason of its non-compliance with the law of this state. This defence is made by a member of the corporation. The firm of Smith &amp; Wicks do not set it up; they appear to have given a full consideration for their purchase, and as between them and the corporation there is no difficulty upon this point. Nor do the defendants appear to have regarded any portion of the transactions as ultra vires until it was seen that the arrangement was likely to prove unprofitable, and result in loss to themselves. It may be the latter circumstance sharpened their vision and enabled them to see what was concealed from them so long as the scheme held out alluring hopes for the future.</p>
    <p id="b81-5" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[201,969,1199,1184]]]'>The learned judge below was of opinion, and so instructed the jury, that the corporation in question was not doing business in this state within the meaning of the act of assembly. In this we think he was entirely right. It has never been held that a citizen of Pennsylvania may not be a member of, or stockholder in, a corporation of another state, or that a contract between such member and his corporation is ultra vires, because the latter had not complied with the provisions o£ the act of assembly. Nor do we think it material that an occasional meeting of the directors was held at Delta, a town partly in Maryland and partly in this state. Their acts are not necessarily void for such reason: Morawetz on Corporations, § 588. One of the objects of the act of assembly was to bring corporations, employing their capital in this state and doing business here, within the taxing power of the commonwealth. It does not appear that this corporation brought any' of its capital into this state. Its place of business was in Maryland. Its capital, if it had any, was there. It had contracts with some of its members, residing in Pennsylvania, by which they were to can their fruit and hold the same to be disposed of by the corporation. It was a kind of farmers’ co-operative association, located in Maryland, with its membership in both states. It has ended in insolvency; hence this trouble.</p>
    <p id="b81-6" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[214,2161,1190,249]],["BL_82.1",82,[233,356,1198,498]]]'>In any view of the case, the plaintiffs have not been parties to any illegal transaction. The title to the goods in question was in the corporation under its by-laws, which were signed in Maryland. The defendants were Pennsylvania stockholders who assented to those by-laws. The title was therefore in the <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>corporation by the defendants’ own act. How then can they be heard to object to the plaintiffs’ title after they had purchased the property in entire good faith, and given a full consideration therefor? The defendants are estopped from setting up such a defence. If there have been any irregular transactions on the part of the company, the defendants have participated therein and enjoyed the advantages thereof, and they cannot now set up their own wrong against good faith, parties, who, for anything that appears,' were in entire ignorance of all these matters.</p>
    <p id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[231,873,1187,94]]]'>We see nothing in the numerous assignments of error which requires further discussion.</p>
    <p id="b82-6" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[1004,977,367,46]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
