    <p class="summary" id="b595-5" data-blocks='[["BL_595.4",595,[152,462,1189,505]]]'>The questions raised by the exceptions filed to the report of the learned master, are chiefly, 1st, whether the mortgage of the defendant company to the plaintiff is fraudulent and void as against the claim of W. W. Reed; and, if not, 2d, whether plaintiff’s mortgage secures priority of payment for all the bonds covered by it, over the claim of W. W. Reed. That the mortgage is void as against Mr. Reed’s claim, is predicated on two grounds, 1st, Because of the resolution of January 21, 1843, P. L. 367, and 2d, because of § 7, Art. XVI., of the Constitution, and the act of March 13, 1873, P. L. 45.</p>

[A review of the evidence leads us to agree with the learned master, that the negotiations between the defendant company and W.. W. Reed ended, and a definite contract was made between them on August 15, 1882, and not before that date. Inasmuch as the plaintiff’s mortgage had been executed on July 12th, and recorded in the proper office on July 18th preceding, for the reasons given by the learned master, it does not fall under the ban of the resolution of 1843.] 8</p>

Moreover, the master has found that “ although this contract (between Reed and the defendant company) provides for the transfer to Reed of the entire capital of the railroad company, this was simply a device intended by the parties as a means of making said stock ‘ paid-up stock.’ ” If the stock was thereby made “ paid-up stock” it belonged to Reed, and practically, he then became the “ company ” which was from time to time disposing of the bonds secured by <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>plaintiff’s mortgage.] 3 But the learned master further finds: “ it was not meant that Reed should retain the stock as his own property. When it was subsequently transferred to him by making out the certificates therefor in his name, he immediately indorsed the certificates in blank and returned (he same to Steele and Blair. The real consideration which Reed was to receive for constructing the railroad was the cash payments stated in the contract.” This, of course, means that although the stock was not in fact paid up, Mr. Reed gave it the appearance and intended it to have the effect of “paid-up stock.” Whether he did this for the benefit of himself or of others is immaterial.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b596-5" data-blocks='[["BL_596.4",596,[243,979,1188,765]]]'>It is evident from the manner in which the stock was issued and transferred that Mr. Reed must have known the company got no funds from that source. [He must likewise have known that the only other source from which the cash he was to receive could come, was the bonds secured by this mortgage, of the existence whereof he had not only constructive notice, but actual knowledge at the time he entered into the contract with defendant company.] 4 From that source he did receive all the cash his contract called for, save the amount of his present claim. If, then, wrong were done under the act of assembly, Mr. Reed was a party to it and he received the benefit. Whether Mr. Reed were the owner of the stock of the company, or only participating in a scheme to give the stock a false appearance of being paid up, he cannot now complain of a violation of the law.</p>

The first question is perhaps the most important, but the latter is likewise of moment to the plaintiff and defendant, Reed, at this time. The future 'conduct of the claimants with respect to this property will doubtless be determined by the relative merits of their claims.

There are other reasons which lead to the same conclusion. A somewhat technical reason is to be found in the nature of the instrument by which the bonds are secured. , it is a deed of trust in the nature of a mortgage. It ' like a mortgage rather than a mortgage in fact.’ The essential distinction seems to be that it conveys to the trustee an actual legal estate, and not a mere mortgagee’s lien: 2 Washburn on Real Property, 78, § 11. The rights and duties of the trustee, the debtor and the cestuis (pie trust are to be found in the instrument itself: Ibid. 78-81; Bradley v. Chester Valley R. Co., <a href="/pa/36/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="36 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="992236" data-case-paths="/pa/36/0141-01">36 Pa. 141</a>; Ashhurst v.

It seems clear that the only decree a court of equity could make would be for the trustee to carry out his trust according to its terms, unless cause were shown, such as fraud, accident or mistake, to warrant a modification. No such ground has been shown. On the contrary, the facts this case presents are, a conveyance of the defendant company’s property in trust, to be reconveyed on the fulfillment of certain conditions, or on the happening of certain events to be sold, and the proceeds applied to the payment of the bonds held by the cestuis quo trust, all of whom are innocent purchasers for value ; the contingency has arisen whereupon the bondholder could require a sale of the property in order to pay their bonds. In the absence of facts showing a superior equity, it must be held that they are entitled to the proceeds of such sale.</p>

Where a mortgage is given to cover future advances by one man to another, it is not a matter of much inconvenience for the mortgagee to ascertain, from time to time, as he is called on for advances, whether there be intervening liens. It is therefore reasonable and just that he should do so, and is in harmony with the purpose of the mortgage. But a different case is presented where a public improvement is undertaken, requiring the <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>expenditure of large sums of money, and the floating of a debt of great magnitude. The debt is necessarily divided into small parts and carried into different and distant markets. It would be out of the question to ascertain the state of the record or of the company’s affairs each time a bond was about to be sold. If this were made the duty of purchasers, it would prevent the sale of such securities altogether, or at least confine their purchase to such large concerns as could buy in bulk after due and careful inquiry; even then the facts would be open to doubt at every subsequent sale. Thus their value would be entirely reduced. For these and similar reasons “ the whole issue of such bonds must be treated as of the date of the mortgage, without regard to the time when they were actually put out, unless the contrary is clearly expressed:” Claflin v.

    <p id="b601-7" data-blocks='[["BL_601.7",601,[164,1134,1187,1286]],["BL_602.1",602,[251,348,1188,406]]]'>In no point of view can the appellant claim the benefit of the resolution of January 21, 1843, P. L. 367. The deed of trust given by the corporation for $400,000, was executed on July 12, 1882 and recorded on July 18th of the same year. The construction contract with the appellant was not executed until August 15,1882. Of course it had no legal efficacy until it was executed. The proposition of July 7th was only a proposition. It was not acted upon until after that time and never became a contract until August loth. But, independently of this, the appellant has not brought himself within either the words or the meaning of the resolution of 1843. He did no work until after the date of the contract, and of course not until after the mortgage or deed of trust was recorded. Now the resolution by its very terms only protects debts or liabilities which have been incurred and remain unpaid prior to the execution of the “assignment, conveyance, mortgage or other transfer ” in question. That this is the true meaning of the resolution has been repeatedly decided: M’Broom’s App., <a href="/pa/44/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="44 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="484295" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0092-01">44 Pa. 92</a>; Fox v. Seal, <a href="/us/89/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="22 Wall. 424" data-case-ids="3409175" data-case-paths="/us/89/0424-01">22 Wall. 424</a>, adopted by this court in Tyrone and Clearfield Railway Company v. Jones, <a href="/pa/79/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="79 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="438418" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0060-01">79 Pa. 60</a>. Hence it follows that the appellant, all of whose work was done after the execution and recording of the deed of trust, and to whom no debt or liability of the company was due or remained unpaid prior to that time, can take no advantage of the resolution. His claim that he has an equitable lien which <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>gives him priority to the bondholders is altogether untenable. It is founded upon the allegation that as he did the work of construction, which gave value to the property of the company and tended to secure the bondholders, he has an equity in the nature of a lien sufficient to give him priority in the distribution. It is enough to say there is no such lien recognized at law or in equity. No authority is shown for the proposition, and we apprehend there is none.</p>
    <p id="b602-5" data-blocks='[["BL_602.4",602,[250,761,1188,1172]]]'>It is suggested in one of the assignments of error that the mortgage or deed of trust is void under the act of March 13, 1873, which prohibits the issuing of bonds in excess of the capital stock actually paid in. It is only necessary to say that no such question is raised by the pleadings in this case, and hence it is not before us. Moreover.it would not be practicable for the appellant to raise this question, because if any fraud or violation of the law was practiced in this respect he was himself a party to it. He received the whole capital stock ostensibly as part payment of the contract price of construction, but presumably for another purpose, because he immediately transferred it to others, and he therefore knew that the capital stock had not been paid in money. As a participant in the fraud he could not now be permitted to avail himself of his own wrong for his own benefit. The master has found that only twelve thousand dollars had been paid on the capital stock when the deed of trust was made. It was a clear and highly reprehensible violation of the law to execute a mortgage or deed of trust in such circumstances, and to put upon an innocent public a large amount of bonds whose validity might be very questionable, to say the least; but, as no question arising out of that consideration is raised upon this record, its discussion and decision are immaterial.</p>
