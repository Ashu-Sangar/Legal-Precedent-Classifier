XI., § 2, article VII., of the act of 1887, power was given to cities of the fifth class to grade, pave, macadamize and curb any public street, lane or alley, and to provide for the payment of the cost and expense of the same by the city, or by the owners of real estate abutting, by an equal assessment on said property in proportion to the number of feet fronting thereon; “ but councils shall not order any street, lane or alley, or part thereof, to be paved or macadamized at the cost of the owners .....except upon the petition of a majority in number of <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>such owners, or upon the petition of the persons owning a majority of the feet front on the street, lane or alley, or part thereof, to be improved, unless the ordinance for such improvement shall have been passed by a vote of two thirds of all the members of each branch of councils, in which case, councils may direct the improvement to be made at the cost of the owners, without petition.”</p>

Co., with sheet asphaltum, to the Barber Asphalt Paving Company, of Buffalo, 1ST. Y., at $2.75 per square yard, and for granite curbing at $1.50 per lineal foot, where new curbing was required. On August 8th, the select and common councils approved the foregoing action of the highway committee, and on the same day the board of viewers made its schedule of assessments of the cost of paving and curbing the street, by virtue of which the lien in this suit was claimed.

It is not even suggested that there was or is any other warrant for the entry of the lien. In an opinion just filed in Ayars’ Appeal, No. 3 July Term 1888, [ante, 266,] we have pronounced that act unconstitutional. That being so, it follows that the lien-was unauthorized and void, and the judgment cannot be sustained.</p>
