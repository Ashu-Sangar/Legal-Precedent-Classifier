About July 1, 1884, the plaintiff company was in full operation, having obtained subscribers for about sixty-four lights. At this time the entire stock and property of the company had passed into the hands of Mr. W. H. Spang, of Reading. Through Mr. L. N. Kramer, of Scranton, Mr. Spang entered into negotiations for the sale of the plant to Mr. W. W. Scranton. These negotiations were consummated about July 1, 1884, by the purchase of the entire stock, plant and property of the plaintiff corporation (the stock being assigned in blank) for the sum of $20,000, part of which was paid by Mr. Scranton’s assumption of certain debts owing by the company, part by the check of the Scranton Gas &amp; Water Company, of which Mr. Scranton was then the president, payable to Mr. Scranton and indorsed by him, and the balance by a note of the Scranton Gas &amp; Water Company, similarly indorsed. Thereafter, up to the present time, the officers and directors of the plaintiff company have been identical with the officers and directors of The Scranton Gas &amp; Water Company, and all its business has been transacted in the office of that company.</p>

At the time of this transfer, the plaintiff company were operating one circuit to supply lights until nine or ten o’clock at night, called the ten o’clock circuit, and another to supply lights until midnight, called the twelve o’clock circuit. The ten o’clock circuit was made to accommodate stores, which needed no light after that hour, and the rates charged were proportionally lower. For instance, at the time of the transfer, the rate for two lights on the twelve o’clock circuit was ninety cents per night, on the ten o’clock circuit seventy cents ; for three or more lights, on the twelve o’clock circuit <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>forty cents per light per night, and on the ten o’clock circuit thirty-two and a half cents. In November, 1884, four months, after the transfer, the whole system was changed. The ten o’clock circuit was taken off, and all lights wore put on the twelve o’clock circuit. The rates were made uniform at a slight advance on the former rates for the twelve o’clock circuit, as follows: A uniform rate of fifty cents per light per night was made for all lights, and discounts were allowed as follows: On one light two per cent, on two lights eight per cent, on three lights ten per cent, on four lights twenty per cent. The effect of this change was to make a very large increase in the rate for those who had been on the ten o’clock circuit, and the following increase on the twelve o’clock circuit:</p>

      <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>There is no direct evidence of any arbitrary taking out of lights previously in use, or of any refusal to supply lights when requested, nor of any clamorous public demand for increase of electric lights. But however desirous the company might be to prevent the use of their lights, it would hardly be expected that they would seek to attain that end by highhanded measures, which would have been a challenge to the public to seek a forfeiture of their charter. Their disposition toward the public is rather to be judged of from a consideration of their acts and the results which followed them, under the legal presumption that every one intends that which is the natural consequence of his acts.</p>

Within a few months, by change of circuits and increase of rates, a very important advance was made upon the rates of those who only needed the lights till ten o’clock, and a slight advance on nearly all lights. In a year the number of lights had decreased to fourteen, and seems never again to have reached twenty up to the time this suit was commenced. In the meantime, a reduction of 20 per cent was made in the price of gas. No energetic effort was made to increase the use of electric lights, and no machinery was procured to enable the company to furnish incandescent lights at all. Since the establishment of a rival company the plaintiff lias entered into a contract with the city for 180 or more arc lights, and have secured subscriptions to 100 or more lights from private individuals. In addition to this, the defendant company has placed 100 arc and 4000 incandescent lights in this city. However this great demand has been created, it cannot be denied that it exists, and it is evident that it began to exist from the moment that the plaintiff’s exclusive right to supply electric lights to the city of Scranton was successfully challenged.</p>

In the second section the purposes for which corporations may be formed under the act, are divided into two classes and each class is subdivided into numerous varieties. Those of the second class are divided into twenty varieties, of which the ninth is “The supply of water to the public,” and the eleventh, “The manufacture and supply of gas or the supply of light and heat to the public by any other moans.” Section 8 prescribes the means by which charters shall be procured, in which it appears that the purposes of the corporation are to be gathered from the certificate which is to be recorded both in the office of the secretary of the commonwealth and in that of the recorder of deeds of the proper county. Sections 4-26 define the general powers and duties of corporations and their officers, the methods of conducting their business, etc. Sections 27-40 prescribe the special powers and duties of the corporations of the second class, formed for the several specific purposes mentioned in section 2. Among the special powers so granted, is the delegation of the right of eminent domain within carefully prescribed limits, to such of the corporations and to such a degree as seemed likely to be required for the prosecution of their intended business. For instance, to road companies, ferry and bridge companies, and water companies, is given the right to'take and condemn lands, etc.; to telegraph and water and gas companies is given the' right to enter upon and occupy roads, streets or highways, the former for the purpose of erecting polos and stretching wires thereon, the latter for the purpose of laying down, altering or repairing pipes, etc. To many <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>of the corporations no such powers are given, such, for instance, as insurance companies, building and loan associations, iron and steel companies, etc.</p>

Emerson v. Commonwealth, 108 Pa. Ill, presents almost precisely a parallel state of facts. There the purposes expressed in general terms in the certificate of the company first chartered “to supply heat to the public from gas,” clearly included the purpose of the second company “to supply heat to the public by means of natural gas,” yet the Supreme Court held that the purposes were not identical. Though the proposed sources of supply for gas of the different companies in that case were different, the one being from within and the other from without the city, yet in the decision of the case that consideration was distinctly passed, and it was squarely decided that, independently of it, the purposes were not identical. A further consideration which leads to the same conclusion is that exclusive privileges are granted with an implied obligation to the public co-extensive with the grant. “The grant of state aid to enable a private corporation to accomplish a purpose of public interest is, therefore, always subject to the implied condition that the company shall assume an obligation to the state to fulfill the purposes of the grant. They would have no power to grant the aid of the state on any other terms. It is immaterial whether the aid he in the form of direct donation of funds or property by the state, or by a county or municipality, or in the form of a subscription for shares, or of a delegation of the power of eminent domain, or of an exemption from taxation, or of a monopoly. In each instance the acceptance of a grant of the public aid implies an assumption by the grantee of an <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>obligation in favor of the publicMorawetz on Private Corporations, § 1114, 2d ed.</p>

Will it be contended that if a demand should arise (if it does ■ not already exist) for the supply of heat by steam, that the plaintiff must go to the expense of procuring all the necessary machinery and appliances to meet that demand, or else forfeit its charter ? Suppose natural gas should be discovered in this region, would the plaintiff be compelled to provide for its supply to the city? Suppose the present considerable number of methods for the distribution of light to many points from a single centre should be indefinitely increased by new discoveries and new inventions, must the plaintiff hold itself ready to adopt every new method of whatever outlay, or violate its implied contract with the state ? Yet all these things are as clearly within the scope of the purposes declared by them as is thé supply of light by electricity, and if their chartered franchise covers these things, and they have an exclusive right, they may at any moment be forced by a public demand to provide for them.</p>

The right to collect toll from persons and things passing over their bridges, is the privilege or franchise which they have, and that right is rendered valuable by the prohibition to build other bridges within the limits designated.” So, in this case, the supply of light or heat is not the privilege or franchise granted, but it is a duty imposed upon the plaintiff, in consideration of which the corporate franchises are to be granted.</p>

The court held that at the time the original charter was'granted, railroads were unknown, and the case of a railroad bridge could not have been contemplated, and was not, therefore, included in the words prohibiting other bridges. Upon this principle it is forcibly argued that the provisions of the act of 1874 were not intended to cover the case of lighting and heating by electricity for the simple reason that such use of electricity was at that time only a matter of scientific experiment and not of general utility; and that the general words “ or the supply of light and heat by other means ” are properly restricted to such means as were in common use at that time. It matters not that such construction might defeat the charters of both companies. The plaintiff is seeking relief on the claim of an exclusive right and fails equally whether it is found that both parties have an equal right, or that neither has any right. Moreover the supplement of 1876 more distinctly covers this purpose, and there is no hint of exclusive privilege there.</p>

While corporations for the supply of light or heat by means other than gas, may be created under subdivision XL, of corporations for profit, as provided in § 2 of the act, it is a mistake to suppose that the charters of those for the supply of light by means of electricity, rest exclusively upon this section, so as to bring them within the purview of § ,34. In fact the act of 1874, nowhere provides for the franchises necessary and appropriate to such corporations. The companies having exclusive privileges by clause 3, § 34, are those described in clause 1, and given authority “ to supply with gas light,” not light generally, and to manufacture “gas, heat or light from coal or other material,” and to lay down pipes, etc., upon condition that they “ shall at all times furnish pure gas.” An electric light company does not furnish gas light; nor does it in any proper sense manufacture heat or light, or lay down pipes in streets for distribution. The new definition of <em>pipe </em>will not induce a violation of one of the simplest rules of statutory construction, to wit, that the words of a statute, if of common use, are to be taken in their natural, plain, obvious and ordinary signification: Phil. etc. R. Co. v. Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=53%20Pa.%2060" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="53 Pa. 60">53 Pa. 60</a>.</p>

The first legislative recognition of electricity as an agent applicable to useful purposes is in the supplementary act of May 1, 1876, P. L. 90, and it is under the fourth section of this act that the defendant company claims to have acquired <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>the right to erect poles and string wires in the public streets. The authorized permission of that section “ to erect poles or run wires on the same over or under any of the streets, lanes or alleys of said city, town or borough,” is equivalent to a legislative declaration that laying down pipes and erecting poles and running wires in public streets, are two separate and distinct franchises. Subsequent legislation sustains this interpretation. By the-act of June 10, 1881, P. L. 112, the provision that all companies given exclusive privileges conditioned upon furnishing “ at all times pure gas,” is extended to all gas companies incorporated under any of the laws of this commonwealth. The act of June 2, 1887, P. L. 311, goes even further in the same direction. In the face of such proof drawn from the legislative mind itself, how can it be that the legislature of 1874, when electricity for lighting-purposes was practically unknown and a thing of the laboratory only, intended to confer an exclusive grant of franchises which could not then even be defined ?</p>

The declared purpose of plaintiff corporation is “furnishing light and heat to the city of Scranton,” etc. By what means, is not declared. Whatever right, however, the corporation possesses, must rest exclusively upon the act of 1874; it can claim nothing from the act of 1876, for there is no purpose declared “ for the transaction of any business in which electricity may be applied to any useful purpose.” Now, the declared purpose of the defendant corporation is the “ manufacturing electricity, to supply the same through appropriate conductors in the city of Scranton, Pa., for lighting, heating and power, and to supply customers with necessary appliances to use the same.” Here the purpose is distinctly stated to be the supply of light, etc., by means of electricity, thus bringing the defendant corporation expressly within the class provided for by the act of 1876; so that its charter rests upon both the act of 1874 and the act of 1876, whilst 'that of the plaintiff depends exclusively upon the act of 1874.

But unfortunately for the plaintiff’s case, the master has found that neither in design nor execution was that purpose originated or carried out for the welfare of any one but the company. He finds, “ that from the first of July, 1884, until the commencement of this suit, the business of the company was managed wholly in the interest of the Scranton Gas &amp; Water Company, not with a desire and effort on part of its management to encourage the use of electric light, and to furnish the best and cheapest light practicable, but with the intention, as far as practicable, to restrict the use of electric light for the benefit of the said Gas &amp; Water Company, and depending upon the supposed exclusiveness of the plaintiff’s franchise for protection against competition.” This finding is sustained not only by the oral testimony but by the results. When W. W. Scranton, the president of the Gas &amp; Water Company, took charge of the Electric Company, it had already secured subscriptions for sixty-four arc lights, but within a year thereafter the number of those lights was reduced to fourteen, and up to the time of the establishment of the new company, that number was never increased so much as to exceed twenty. This result seems to have been occasioned by a change in the method of furnishing the electricity which produced an increase of cost, and also by a reduction in the price of gas. This latter result being beneficial to consumers, not only could not be complained of, but prima facie might be regarded as the cause of the falling off of the demand for electric lights. Tins explanation appears, however, from subsequent events, to be fallacious; for, since the establishment of the competing company, the plaintiff has secured contracts for 230 arc lights, and the defendant has placed 100 lights of the same character, together with 4000 incandescent lights. It is thus obvious, that by the operations of the plaintiff, the citizens of Scranton were purposely deprived of a valuable source of illumination without any corresponding benefit.</p>

According to tbe finding of the master, of this kind of fraud the complainant has been clearly guilty; it has become the mere instrument in the hands of the Gas &amp; Water Company to deprive by a false pretence, the city and citizens of Scranton of a very useful, if not absolutely necessary commodity. How then can it stand in a court of equity ? It is to no purpose to say that its charter cannot be attacked in this collateral proceeding. No one is attacking its charter, but it cannot interpose that charter as a cover for its own fraud. It has appealed to the equitable side of the court to suppress, for its own benefit, a competition that has arisen from its neglect of a charter duty, and without touching upon its legal rights or legal remedies, this, we think, cannot be done. Chancery 'deals oidy with consciouable demands, and with those that are unconscionable, whether through fraud or mere neglect, it will have nothing to do. Therefore, without further comment, we might affirm the decree of the Common Pleas, but as there is another important question involved in the case, we cannot properly pass it without comment.</p>

This claim may be regarded as sound, if in fact the said section does include electric lighting, but not otherwise. Did the legislature intend to embrace electric lighting in the language, “ companies incorporated under the provisions of this statute, for the supply of water to the public, or for the manufacture of gas, or the supply of light or heat to the public by <em>any other means. </em>” Before answering this question we must call attention to what has heretofore been regarded as an unalterable rule; that is, that a legislative grant to a corporation of exclusive privileges is, as said by Mr. Justice Git fes, in Emerson v. The Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/108/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="108 Pa. 111" data-case-ids="539253" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0111-01">108 Pa. 111</a>, to be construed most strictly, and we may add, that every intendment not obviously in favor of the grant must be construed against it. Monopolies are favorites neither with courts nor people. They operate in restraint of competition, and are hence, as a rule, detrimental to the public welfare ; nor are they at all allowable except where the resultant advantage is in favor of the public, as, for instance, where a water or gas company could not exist except as a monopoly. Applying then <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>the rule here stated to the case in hand, and we cannot pronounce the conclusion of the master and court below to be erroneous.</p>
    <p id="b200-5" data-blocks='[["BL_200.4",200,[262,510,1189,1797]]]'>In the case above cited the sharpest technicality of construction was adopted in order to defeat the extravagant demand of the corporation claiming the exclusive privilege to furnish the city of Pittsburgh with natural gas for the purposes of fuel. But in the case -before us it is apparent that the legislature did not, in the making of the act of 1874, intend to embrace lighting by electricity. It is true, that the language of this statute seems, at first sight, to be broad enough to embrace all methods of lighting and heating then known, or that might thereafter become known, yet, we suppose, it will not be contended that the intention was' to grant to this company the exclusive privilege of furnishing to the citizens of Scranton coal, wood, oil, and other well known and ordinary materials for lighting and heating. Not indeed, that the law-makers could not have conferred such power, but because it is not probable that they intended to confer a power so unreasonable. It is, therefore, obvious that we must consult not only the letter of the act, but also the intention of its makers. If, however, it were designed to embrace a method of lighting by electricity, a method not then in use for economic purposes, it is remarkable that the means necessary for its proper distribution were not provided for. Under the 84th section of the act, the only one upon which the plaintiff relies for its exclusive right, there is no power conferred to enter upon the public streets for the erection of poles and placing of wires, the privilege of so entering being confined to the laying of pipes only. From this it is clear that the legislature had in mind, not a then unknown process of public lighting and heating, but a process involving the use of gas, or some similar material, for the distribution of which pipes only were necessary. Having thus ascertained the intention of the law-making power at the time of the passage of the act of 1874, we cannot agree to extend the franchise of the plaintiff by construction, but are willing rather to concur in the decree of the court below, because the right so claimed, not only may be, but has proved to be detrimental to the public welfare.</p>
