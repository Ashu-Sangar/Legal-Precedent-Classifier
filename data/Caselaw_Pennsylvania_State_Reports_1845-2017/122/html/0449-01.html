The Clarion county line was managed by H. P. Loomis, as the superintendent for the company in that county. ' To supply consumers in the towns the gas was run into a gasometer and thence served by a low-pressure line.

He got up at two o’clock, and everything running all right he went to bed again. At half-past four he was up again, and, looking at the pressure-gauge connected with the boiler, he found the proper head of steam, about 55 pounds. There was a gas jet burning in the boiler-house. In a very few minutes after, as he was turned away, an explosion occurred, indicating that the boiler-house had suddenly filled with gas which had reached the burning jet.

    <p class="summary" id="b476-10" data-blocks='[["BL_476.9",476,[231,1486,1183,559]]]'>One of the important questions involved is that of contributory negligence on which the defendant relies to defeat a recovery. Contributory negligence in its legal signification is defined to be such an act or omission on the part of a plaintiff, amounting to a want of ordinary care, as, concurring or co-operating with the negligent act of the defendant, is a proximate cause or occasion of the injury complained of. To constitute contributory negligence there must be a want of ordinary care on the part of the plaintiff and a proximate connection between that and the injury. Besides these two, there are no other necessary elements.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b476-11" data-blocks='[["BL_476.10",476,[232,2052,1182,294]]]'>They are the two points of difficulty in the consideration of the question. Did the plaintiff exercise ordinary care under the circumstances? Was there a proximate connection between his act or omission and the hurt complained of? These are the vital questions when contributory negligence is the issue.</p>

Where this is the rule, the plaintiff has made out his case when lie has shown injury to himself and negligence on the part of the defendant which was a proximate cause of it. It then devolves upon the defendant to allege andxnove contributory negligence as a matter of defence, the presumption being in favor of the plaintiff, that he was at the time of the accident in the exercise of due care, and that the injury was caused wholly by the defendant’s negligent misconduct. This is the doctrine in Pennsylvania as decided by the Supreme Court in many cases, but in the later cases, the court inclines to the other rule, putting the burden of proof upon the plaintiff. But in all courts where contributory negligence is held a matter of defence, whenever the plaintiff’s own case raises a presumption of contributory negligence, the burden of proof is immediately upon him. In such a case it devolves upon the plaintiff as of course to clear himself of the suspicion of negligence that he himself has created. He must make out his case in full; and, where the circumstances attending the injury were such as to raise a presumption against him, in respect of the exercise of due care, the law requires him to establish his freedom from contributory fault.</p>

But in order to prove this latter part, the plaintiff must show that such injury was not caused in whole or in part by his own negligence; for, although the defendant was guilty of negligence, [if the <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>plaintiff’s negligence contributed essentially to the injury, it is obvious that it did not occur by reason of the defendant’s negligence. Therefore the plaintiff would not prove enough to entitle him to recover, by merely showing negligence on the part of the defendant; but he must go further and also prove the injury to have been caused by such negligence, by showing a want of concurring negligence on his own part, contributing materially to the injury. Hence, to say that the plaintiff must show the latter, is only saying that he must show that the injury was owing to the negligence of the defendant.]8 And as the defendant has the right to have the jury informed as to what facts the plaintiff must prove, in order to recover, it has a right to require the court to instruct them that it was incumbent on the plaintiff to prove a want of such concurring negligence on his part.</p>

The court instructs the jury that the rule of law is that every person must be held liable for all those consequences which flow naturally and directly from his act, or which might have been foreseen and reasonably expected as the result of his conduct, but not for those consequences which do not flow naturally and directly from his acts, or which he could not have foreseen or reasonably have anticipated as the result of his conduct.</p>

Although the jury may believe from the evidence that the injury complained of was occasioned by the acts of the defendant, still, if they further believe from the evidence that such injury was not the natural result of the acts of the defendant and could not have been foreseen or reasonably expected to result from its conduct, then the defendant would not be liable. In determining whether an act is the proximate cause of the injury, the legal test is: Was the injury of such a character as might reasonably have been foreseen or expected as the natural result of the act complained of ? A party is not in law chargeable with results which do not naturally and reasonably follow as the consequence of his conduct.</p>

Ordinary care depends upon the circumstances of each particular case, and is such care as a person of ordinary prudence and skill would usually exercise under similar circumstances. Slight negligence means the absence of that degree of care and vigilance which persons of extraordinary prudence and foresight are accustomed to use under similar circumstances. By gross negligence as used in these instructions is meant a wrongful act or omission wilfully and maliciously done or omitted, or wanton, reckless conduct, showing an utter disregard of the rights of others.</p>

Paxson, J., said: “The doctrine of this court has always been that if the negligence of the party contributed in any degree to the injury, he cannot recover. This is a safe rule, easily understood, and cannot well be frittered away by the jury. But if we substitute the word, material, for the word, any, we practically abolish the rule, for a jury can always find a way to avoid it.” True, at another place in answer to our fourth point, the court affirmed the correct rule on this subject. But the minds of the jury were then preoccupied by the erroneous qualification, twice stated, of “essentially and materially.”</p>

    <p id="b484-7" data-blocks='[["BL_484.6",484,[285,778,1186,818]]]'>This was an action for negligence alleged to have been the cause of the destruction of the plaintiff’s boiler-house. The allegations were twofold: first, that defendant had turned on the flow of additional wells of gas into the main pipe so as to increase the pressure to an extraordinary degree, thereby causing an explosion and the conflagration of the boiler-house; and second, that a stoppage in the pipe by freezing or other obstruction had set back the gas so that by its confinement and accumulation when let loose by thawing, it increased the pressure in the same degree, and notice should have been given. The defendant denied the first allegation, and claimed that as to the second, it was not necessary to give the notice; that on a high-pressure line with proper safety valves on the part of the plaintiff, all such irregularities are controlled with perfect safety; also, that by sleeping at his post the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>
    <p id="b484-8" data-blocks='[["BL_484.7",484,[286,1603,1184,83]]]'>The assignments of error are three, and we consider them in their order.</p>
    <p id="b484-9" data-blocks='[["BL_484.8",484,[286,1703,1187,460]]]'>The court below permitted the plaintiff to testify that at ten or eleven o’clock on the morning of the day on which the accident occurred, the explosion having taken place at four o’clock in the morning, he met the agent of the defendant company at Fern City, away from the scene of the accident, and said to him, “You must have turned on new wells,” and the agent said, “ They only opened the Nufer well — turned the Nufer well on.” It was objected that this was the declaration of an agent, not part of the res gestee.</p>
    <p id="b484-10" data-blocks='[["BL_484.9",484,[288,2169,1185,250]],["BL_485.1",485,[144,363,1186,549]]]'>In order to warrant the proof of admissions by an agent, one or more of the following facts must exist: It must appear that the agent was specially authorized to make them ; or his powers must have been such as to constitute him the general representative of the principal, having the management of the <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>entire business; or the admissions must have formed part of the consideration of a contract; or, if they are non-contractua] they must have been part of the res gestee. In the present case the evidence shows that Loomis was agent only for the line in Clarion county; that the general office of the company was in Venango. It was an attempt to show a negligent act in the nature of a tort. The accident occurred early in the morning; the agent was not there ; had not been there, knew nothing of it, and was accosted in Fern City by the plaintiff at ten or eleven o’clock in the forenoon when the alleged statement was made.</p>
    <p id="b485-5" data-blocks='[["BL_485.4",485,[150,931,1188,1335]]]'>It will be readily seen that the declarations are not brought within the rule. It is imperative in cases of alleged tortious conduct, such as negligence, unless the act is specially authorized, that the admissions of the agent must be part of the res gestae, otherwise they are hearsay. The agent himself can be called to prove the same state of facts attempted to be proved by his admissions. It will be seen that this statement of the agent was not specially authorized; he was not instructed to go and do the negligent act, nor did it appear affirmatively that he had charge of the whole business. It is true he had charge of the Clarion county line, but all the wells were in Venango county; the principal office of the company was there; the agent had an office in Clarion. While he undoubtedly had control to regulate the flow established for the Clarion line, shut on and off the different wells for that purpose, it does not appear that for a new well he had any authority to connect and open it until he received instructions from headquarters. The presumption would be the other way, he being a subordinate superintendent. His statement is no part of the res gestan It was made five or six hours after the occurrence complained of; he had not been there, knew nothing of it. If we give the whole of the conversation, it will be seen that it is really an attempt to impinge upon a declaration of the agent a theory of the plaintiff himself, expressed in a state of irritability and excitement, which is not borne out by a single item of testimony. The conversation is as follows :</p>

You had men out all night, and pretty near all day, doing something,” and I said, “ You must have turned on new wells.” And he said they only opened the Nufer well — turned the Nufer well on.</p>
    <p id="b486-10" data-blocks='[["BL_486.9",486,[270,1136,1189,1075]]]'>There is another reason why this declaration was not evidence. It was not in itself competent to prove what was claimed for it. It was offered for the purpose of showing that the accident was caused by additional wells being turned into the pipe; in other words, that the regular and continued flow of the pipe from which the plaintiff drew his gas was made up of one or more other wells, exclusive of the Nufer well. This, therefore, was a fact to be proved by the plaintiff in order to make the admission bear the construction attempted to be put upon it; — a fact, if true, easily proved. He did not show this. He did not include it in his offer. There is not a particle of evidence that the Nufer well had not always been one of those furnishing gas, previous and up to the time of the accident. On the contrary, the uncontradicted testimony is that it was one of those wells. It is true that the plaintiff said he had worked previously on connections which were intended at some time to furnish gas for the line, but that it had been connected was mere guess work. There was no evidence of that kind; the testimony was to the contrary. It is clear that this admission as proved may have had some effect upon the jury on that part of the plaintiff’s allegations.</p>
    <p id="b486-11" data-blocks='[["BL_486.10",486,[270,2219,1187,199]],["BL_487.1",487,[177,363,1187,706]]]'>The second specification of error contains the more serious mistake. It was assumed by the learned judge, in his charge to the jury, that the question of contributory negligence was an element in the case, whether that question was the suffi<a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>cieney of the regulator of the plaintiff, or the fact of his sleeping at his post on a high-pressure line. The assignment of error is to the general charge, and is as follows : The court charged that “ If the plaintiff’s negligence contributed <em>exsentially </em>to the injury, it is obvious that it did uot occur by reason of the defendant’s negligence. Therefore, the plaintiff would not prove enough to entitle him to recover by merely showing negligence on the part of the defendant, hut he must go further and also prove the injury to have been caused by such negligence, by showing a want of concurrent negligence on his own part, contributing <em>materially </em>to the injury. Hence, to say that the plaintiff must show the latter is only saying that lie must show that the injury was owing to the negligence of the defendant.”</p>
    <p id="b487-5" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[183,1089,1187,616]]]'>In this language the court below fell into the same error committed in Monongahela City v. Fischer, <a href="/pa/111/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="111 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="545444" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0009-01">111 Pa. 9</a>. The rule is that any degree of negligence on the part of the plaintiff. contributing to the injury, destroys his right to recover. The point not only required that the negligence should contribute materially, but essentially to the injury. The reason for the rule is fully stated in the case cited. It is safe and easy of application by the jury. It is the kind of action, not the quantity, on the part of the plaintiff, which prevents. the law from measuring between plaintiff and defendant their respective degrees of negligence when the former comes into a court of justice.</p>
    <p id="b487-6" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[187,1713,1185,456]]]'>In regard to the third specification of error, it may bo to-marked that as it is worded we discover no error. “ The usual and ordinary risks ” of a high-pressure line, would differ from those of a low-pressure line, and extraordinary risk$ in such a case would depend on testimony which carried the risks beyond this rule; and if they became such through the negligence of the defendant, it would not be error to affirm the point. The propriety of the language would depend on the facts of the particular case.</p>
