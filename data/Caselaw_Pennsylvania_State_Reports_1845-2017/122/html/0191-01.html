In September, 1882, Mr. Fulmer, the defendant, became the owner of a tract of land, also on the banks of the Lehigh river, adjoining the tract of Mr. Williams on the north,, which is up the stream. On that tract there was at that time,, and had been for years previously a slate quarry. The rubbish from the quarry was deposited between the quarry and Lehigh river. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, after he became the owner of the slate quarry property and before-the bringing of this suit deposited rubbish from the quarry, <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>consisting of earth, stones and offal of the slate, into the Le-high river, and thus obstructed the flow of the water, and impaired and in part destroyed the water power, which the plaintiff had enjoyed there before.</p>

The plaintiff’s property is directly opposite the island, and that of the defendant is partly opposite it. The alleged dumping place is perhaps nearly opposite the head of the island, and the defendant’s land extends further up the stream. It appears that the main channel of the Lehigh river is on the east side of the island. The plaintiff has shown that he is also the owner of the island, but I do not see now that that ownership by him will affect the case as presented; still it can be borne in mind and perhaps will enable you to understand certain portions of the testimony better than you otherwise could do.</p>

The Le-high river more than a hundred years ago was declared to be a public highway, and by the same enactment persons were prohibited from taking any water out of the stream for mills or water works. Ordinarily, where one man owns land on one side of a stream, and the stream is a boundary of Iris land he owns to the centre of that stream, but in the case of a public highway, such as the Lehigh river, the rule is different. The stream itself being a public highway belongs to the public. It appears that somewhere about the year 1822 the state, by legislative enactment, granted to the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company the right to improve and navigate the Lehigh river, and also granted them the right to the use of the water for water power purposes. That corporation is still a living corporation, and exercises rights over the Lehigh river.</p>

Between high- and low-water mark he has a right to the land <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>subject to the right oí the public, and by that is meant the right to navigate the stream. It is not unlawful for one who owns land on the shores of the river to make use of the ground between higli- and low-water mark, (at least not as against any other private citizen who complains,) unless it appears that such use of the space interferes with the navigation of the stream. The use of the ground between high- and low-water mark, as it is said the plaintiff made of it, (and it seems the defendant also made use of. it by dumping into the stream,) cannot he made a ground of complaint here, beeause neither of these individuals, as private citizens, can complain of that, and the commonwealth is not complaining of it, nor is the navigation- company complaining of it. Hence we say to you, that as against the defendant the plaintiff had a right to the river and its bed between high- and low-water mark, and any benefit or advantage that was to him, or any right of property he had in that, he was entitled to as against Mr. Fulmer the defendant. On the other hand we say to you, that so far as Mr. Fulmer dumped into the stream, not beyond low-water mark, he cannot be held liable for it in this action, even if that did affect the water power of Mr. Williams. And then, inasmuch as neither the state nor its grantee, the navigation company, conferred upon Mr. Williams the power to erect a dam or dams in the Lehigh river, it must he held that he had no property in the dam, nor in the water power which the dam or dams created. The dam at the factory of the plaintiff extended across the arm of the stream, and that arm is also a public highway, and necessarily, if it was beyond low-water mark he had no property in it; the row of stones which was thrown up from the head of the island by Mr. Williams, part way across to the east shore, in that also he had no vested right, because it is in the stream, which is a public highway.</p>

When we speak of high- and low-water mark we mean the elevation of the water at ordinary stages of high- and low-water. By low-water mark is <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>not meant the lowest stage of the water in great drought, but it means the height of the water along the shore when the water is at an ordinary stage; and by high-water mark is meant the line to which it extends where it is ordinarily high, and does not mean the greatest freshets that may occasionally occur.</p>

Of course, it would not be valuable when the water was low, because then there would be no water in that space, but it might be that when the water was higher it was of use to him. It may be that the water there between high- and low-water mark would not furnish a power at all seasons, but only at some seasons, and if it did so it was of value to the plaintiff then. It was explained to you how the shore shelved at that point directly opposite the plaintiff’s factory. The bank there,, or just above, I believe is rather abrupt, but at one point there is a slate rock, as I understand the testimony, shelving out into the stream, and I believe it is said there was a natural flow or ripple there; that a bed of slate extended across the stream. From the description of the property there, you will determine whether it is proved that the water power which was valuable between high- and low-watei- mark existed and was of value to the plaintiff. If that is not shown then the plaintiff has not established that any right of his was invaded. In that event you would find a verdict in favor of the defendant. If you find that there was a water power there in the-way I have mentioned, and that it was of value, and that the-defendant by dumping refuse into the stream beyond low-water mark deprived the plaintiff in whole or in part of that right and property, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover. . .</p>

The contention of the defendant is that the plaintiff had no-water power or anything else of value along his property between high- and low-water mark; and in the second place he contends that there was nothing done by the defendant which interfered with the plaintiff’s right, if he had one. It is contended that there was no material filling in of the stream by Fulmer in his time, and it is further contended that if tliero <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>was, it had. been partly filled in by Williams, while he still owned the property, because he owned it before Fulmer obtained it, and that therefore the defendant ought not to be held liable.

In certain actions of tort, trespasses, and the like, a jury may in addition to awarding to the plaintiff that which will compensate him add a further sum as punishment, which further sum awarded as damages is what we call in law exemplary or vindictive damages. It has been argued here that the defendant acted recklessly and maliciously, and in disregard of the plaintiff’s right, with the intent to injure him, and that from that you might infer, gentlemen, if you find for the plaintiff, that you might add a sum to punish the defendant. The act done by the defendant, if he did an unlawful act, was the making or erecting of what we call a public nuisance; that is, he put that which worked harm and inconvenience into a public highway, — the Lehigh river, — and for that act, if it was unlawful, he could be punished in a public prosecution on the complaint of the commonwealth. Any private citizen, who has special injury and who can show special damages, may bring a suit against the wrong-doer in such a case, but in the opinion, of the court he <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>can recover only the damages actually sustained, and if there is to be a punishing of the wrong-doer, that punishment must be inflicted in a suit by the public and not by a private individual. But where there is a public nuisance committed and any citizen can show that he had special damages in consequence of a wrong act, he may recover for that injury. And so as these questions affect the plaintiff’s case, I say to you that if you find that the defendant did that which was unlawful by obstructing the Lehigh river beyond low-water mark, and that David Williams was specially damaged, and he has shown what those damages are, he may recover them in this action.</p>

You would then consider, if the plaintiff had any rights to the water power there, under the law as it has been stated to you, that it affected the value of the manufactory, and consequently the real estate on which it was located. If you come to consider the amount of the damages estimated upon that basis, then you will consider how much the property was worth in the market at a fair sale affected by the injury, and how much it would have been worth at the same time if the injury had not been done. You are not to consider as a rule for estimating the damages purely how much it would cost per day or per year for an engineer, and to buy the fuel, which it seems was done after the water power is alleged to have failed; but you are to consider and find, if you reach that point, and if the evidence gives you the data to find it from, how much the factory and real estate of the plaintiff was worth in the market at a fair sale less than it would have been were it in the same condition as it was before.] 12</p>

From the cases cited, the following conclusions are drawn: Riparian ownership upon navigable streams, brings no greater rights than those incident to all the public, except access to the channel of the river, and wharfage to low-water mark. Any diminution of the ordinary flow of the river, or any diversion of its waters, not obstructive to the navigation of the stream, or destructive of its use as a navigable highway, is not actionable at the instance of a private party. Riparian owners cannot <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>use the waters of a navigable river as power to run a mill, without express authority from the state or its authorized agents.

Nor was it alleged in the pleading or proved at the trial that it shut off access to the navigable parts of the river from the plaintiff’s land. The defendant had the same rights as the plaintiff, but it is not pretended that as against the state or its grantee, the Lehigh Navigation Co., the defendant had the legal right to dump into the river. If he dumped into it so as to obstruct navigation, he would be guilty of maintaining a nuisance, which could be abated only by proceedings at the instance of the public, and if it appeared that such encroachment did not interfere -with navigation, there could be no conviction: Zug v.

The narr charged the diversion of the water from its usual course to such an extent that the plaintiff could no longer operate his factory by water power as he was wont to do. He had built a stone-row dam extending some distance northeast from the upper end of the island, and another between his factory and the island. The factory was run by a turbine wheel with the power produced by these dams, and this was the power alleged in the first count to have been interfered with by the defendant; the second count had been eliminated bj^ the court.

Have riparian owners, on navigable streams in Pennsylvania, any rights in relation to any part of the stream, by reason of their ownership of adjoining lands, as against other riparian owners ?

Can he divert the water from my land and leave its shores bare, or change an ample free flowing stream into a mere trickling useless rivulet ?

The main stream <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>of the river passed along the east side of the island. The defendant below, Fulmer, owned land on the bank of the river adjoining and next above the land of the plaintiff. He operated a slate quarry, and the plaintiff alleged and the jury has found that he has filled the stream, from his own land opposite-the head of the island, many feet beyond low-water mark, with the debris from his quarry, until he has in effect diverted the, water of the river from the plaintiff’s land and destroyed his. water power, the water now passing on the east side of the-island. The evidence shows quite clearly that the filling up of the channel below low-water mark was done with a deliberate and freely expressed purpose to depreciate the value of the plaintiff’s property and to destroy his water power.</p>

The plaintiff had no grant from the state or its grantee, theLehigh Navigation Company, of' the use of the water for any purpose. The defence set up the public character of the river and denied that the plaintiff had a title to the water power as; riparian owner or otherwise. The court instructed the jury that the plaintiff had no title below low-water mark, but that between low- and high-water marks he was the owner of the soil, and, subject to the right to navigate the stream by the-public, he had a right to use the water; and that he could recover for the destruction of the power so far as it grew out of the water flowing above low-water mark. The assignments of error are seventeen in number, but the case presents two principal questions : first, what are the rights of a riparian owner on the shore of a navigable stream between high- and low-water marks ? second, what are the rights of such owner in the water flowing over this strip of shore ? Both questions require to be considered: (1) As between the riparian owner and the public. (2) As between him and other riparian owners.</p>

From this it resulted naturally that royal or public streams, the bed of which belonged to the Crown, came to be distinguished from private streams, the beds of which belonged to the owners of the banks, by reference to the presence or absence of tide<a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>water. On this continent the early settlers found large rivers with navigable tributaries, forming-vast systems of internal communication, extending hundreds and in some instances thousands of miles above the reach of tide-water. The common law definition of a navigable river was unsuited to this state of things, and seems never to have been adopted in Pennsylvania; on the contrary, navigability in fact was made the test by which the character of a stream, as public or private, was determined, and the great but tideless rivers of the state were held to be navigable rivers, public highways, belonging to the state, and held for the use of all her citizens. The beds of such rivers, between the lines of ordinary low water, on their opposite sides, have not been granted out by the commonwealth to individuals, but continue to be held and controlled by and for the public: Carson v.

Between this line and high-water mark, the land of the grantee is, by the nature and necessities of the situation, subject to a servitude in favor of the public. The stream must run within its natural banks after as well as before the -grant. The grantee takes subject to the rights of the public in and upon the highway, and as between him and the public he may use his land below the line of high water for such purposes only as do not interfere with the free flow and navigation of the water that flows over it. As to neighboring riparian owners, the manner in which he may irse the shore becomes a question of private right. While, as citizens, they are all entitled to the unobstructed use of the highway, as individual owners of land along the stream, they are clothed with the rights and are subject to the duties that grow out of their ownership and their neighborhood. The maxim, sic utere tuo ut alienum non lsedas, is as clearly applicable to their water fronts as to their back lands. If a riparian owner places a structure upon his .own land between high- and low-water marks that impedes navigation, he infringes the public right, and subjects himself to liability therefor. His ownership of the land over which the water flows along the shore, will not <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>relieve him from the consequences of his act, for his title to the shore is subject to the right o£ the public in the stream. If he places the structure in such manner as to throw the current against his neighbor’s shore at such an angle as to wear it away and undermine and wash out his land, he inflicts a private injury upon his neighbor for which a right to compensation exists. In the case of a private stream, no one would doubt the right of an injured owner to maintain an action for the damages suffered by him by reason of a change in the current. But one has no more right to injure another with the water of a navigable stream than with that of a non-navigable, private stream. It is not the character of the stream, but the character and consequences of the act of the owner of the shore that determines the right of the injured party to compensation. As between themselves, riparian owners are owners of the soil, and are bound to observe the obligations that grow out of their ownership and their proximity. In Zug v. The Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/70/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="70 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1028180" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0138-01">70 Pa. 138</a>, it was held that an owner of the soil might use the river-bed between high- and low-water marks for his own private purposes if he did not interfere with the rights of the public. This declaration is, however, to be understood as qualified by the rule we have just considered, that he must not, in the exercise of his right as a riparian owner, inflict injury upon his neighbors. This rule sets limits to the manner in which property of every description may he used, and is unaffected by the accident of location.</p>

The water of a stream is not the subject of ownership in the ordinary sense of that word. If one is the owner of the land over which a stream flows, he is entitled to the use of the water because of his ownership of the bed in which it flows. He may not retain the water upon his land indefinitely or divert it from its natural channel or sell it to be removed; but, subject to the reasonable use of the water by him, lower owners have a right to the stream and he must deliver it to them. In the case of all navigable rivers the beds in which they flow belong to the public. The right to the use of water follows the ownership of the bed in which it flows. The commonwealth is therefore the owner of the rivers and <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>holds'them for the use of its citizens. They are public property — natural highways — open to all who may have occasion to use them: Carson v. Blazer, <a href="/binn/2/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="2 Binn. 475" data-case-ids="1788962" data-case-paths="/binn/2/0475-01">supra;</a> Poor v.

When the volume of the stream swells in time of high water,, its surface remains the surface of the highway and the riparian owner must do nothing that shall interfere with the use of the highway or any part of it by the public up to the line of high water. The fact that the water of the highway flows over his. land, when it rises above low-water mark, gives him no title to. it, for he holds his shore subject to tins servitude in favor of' the public. The stream is not divisible by the lines of riparian owners or susceptible of divided and hostile ownership, but is the same public highway in all stages of water, and belongs in all its breadth and depth to the public. The owner of the shore having no ownership in the water has as .between him and the commonwealth no greater right in it than any other citizen. He has no right to erect a dam to turn the water to his mill without a grant from the commonwealth of the right so to do, and if he erects such dam without a grant he is a trespasser and acquires no title to the water power resulting therefrom. He stands in the same position as an intruder upon a public road, without right, and liable to removal at any moment. He has an indisputable right as a. citizen to the use of the river as a public’ highway, but as a riparian owner he has no right to obstruct its flow, or to divert its waters except for domestic purposes and, within certain limits, for purposes of irrigation. If he does erect a dam and turn the water to his mill he, ordinarily, infringes the public right only. For such infringement he is liable to the public, and his dam may bo abated as a nuisance. But such use of the water is not necessarily an injury to other riparian owners, as such, especially to those who, like the defendant in the court below, are further up the stream. If the navigation is unobstructed, it is not easy to see what reason the owners living up the stream have for objecting to the use of the water as a power! The state, as the owner of the river, may object, and between her and the mill-owner the question is one of properly as well as one of interference with the right of navigation. The mill-owner must buy the power, if he would use it safely. Without such grant he is a trespasser upon the property of the public, and an ob<a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>structor of the public way. But to justify an objection by a neighboring riparian owner, as such, he must be able to show that he has suffered a private injury from the acts of the mill-owner.</p>

He had no title to the water, whether above or -below low-water mark, and he could have no legal right to the power resulting from the erection of his dam. Its destruction was, therefore, damnum absque injuria. The fact that he Was intending to acquire a title to the water power from the grantees of the commonwealth is quite immaterial. He had not in fact done so, and he had no better title to this water power than he had to any other property of the navigation company. The action was brought to recover for the loss of a power to which he could show no title, because he had none. It was not the case of an undershot wheel moved by the current in time of high water, but of a mill or factory provided with power by an unauthorized and illegal obstruction of the natural current, which could have been removed at any moment by the public authorities, or by the grantees of the commonwealth.</p>

Upon suitable averments he may recover for the damages he has sustained, as a riparian owner, from the illegal acts of his neighbor. The evidence shows that Fulmer has obstructed the stream far beyond low-water mark, and practically closed the channel between the island and the west shore. This deprives Williams of convenient access to and use of the current for many legitimate purposes. This has not been done under the authority of the commonwealth, or by an exercise of the right of eminent domain, but in obvious disregard of the rights of the public, as well as those of his neighbor. It appears by the evidence to have been done for the purpose, of compelling his neighbor to resort to steam, power for his factory, and to deprive him of the use of the water. Such invasion of the bed of the stream was an unlawful act, and if, in consequence of it, Williams was deprived of convenient access, to the river, for purposes of navigation, for fishing, for domestic <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>or other proper purposes, he is entitled to recover damages for the injury sustained.
