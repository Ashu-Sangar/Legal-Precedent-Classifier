It is admitted that William Josiah McMeen escaped from prison. It is admitted that a reward of $400 was offered for his recapture; and it is admitted that he was recaptured and returned to the jail of this county. The evidence shows that some four persons were present when the actual capture took place. The sheriff, his deputy, Mr. McDonald and Mr. Beashore were present, and the question is as to who was mainly instrumental in effecting this capture. The prisoner was in jail in the custody of the sheriff; it was his duty to keep him until legally removed; he escaped from jail, and when he did so it was the duty of the sheriff to have him recaptured and returned, if possible.</p>

[There were two other persons present who owed no special duty with regard to the recapture of this prisoner. It does not appear from the evidence that Mr. Beashore was present at the instance of Mr. McDonald or that he was invited by the sheriff, but it appears he was present at the invitation of Mr. Lapp, the deputy-sheriff.] 4 The sheriff testifies that on Monday evening, November 22, 1886, Squire McDonald, deputy Lapp and himself got into a two-horse carriage and went out to old Mr. Carter’s, and on the road going out they were talking about this matter, and Mr. McDonald told him ho had been with what was called Mr. Parker’s party to Henry Moist’s, and that he had a conversation with Henry Moist who asked him why they searched there and whether they blamed him with concealing McMeen. Henry Moist also stated that his feelings were against McMeen, but Mr. Moist said he had had a conversation with a party of men and one of them told him that he wouldn’t arrest McMeen if he did find him, but if ho had no overcoat he would give him his, and that man was William Kauffman ; and from that information Mr. Beashore, Mr. McDonald, the sheriff and deputy-sheriff proceeded to William Kauffman’s and effected the capture. Mr. McDonald also testifies that he had this conversation with Mr. Moist and was led <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>from that conversation, in connection with other things that came to his knowledge, to believe this escaped prisoner was to be found in the barn of Mr. Kauffman, and he so informed the sheriff, and it was at his instance the party was organized and went and effected the capture.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b142-5" data-blocks='[["BL_142.4",142,[231,623,1188,1787]]]'>If this statement is the true one, if the jury can rely upon that statement as the very truth of the case, and believe that Mr. McDonald was the party who mainly and principally succeeded in making this escaped prisoner’s recapture, then he would be entitled to the reward offered by the commissioners for the recapture and the jury should find a verdict in his favor. [But it is contended on the part of the defendant that Mr. McDonald was not the one principally and mainly influential in effecting this capture, and it alleges that the sheriff was the one who succeeded in doing so and that the others were merely his assistants, and to sustain this they rely upon some contradictions and conflict in the testimony of some of the witnesses.] 5 They have called Mr. Henry Moist and he, while not positively denying the fact, testifies that he has no recollection of having had any such conversation with the plaintiff, in which he told him anything in regard to what Mr. Kauffman had said. Mr. Abraham Moist also denies that the occurrences took place at his barn, as they were testified to by the sheriff and Mr. McDonald. The latter stated that they had gone to Mr. Moist’s simply to satisfy the clamor of the public ; that they did not expect and did not believe that the prisoner was in the barn of Mr. Moist, but that simply because the people were urging them to go in search of the prisoner they went, in obedience to the clamor of the public, without any expectation or hope of finding him there, and they testify as to the circumstances and incidents attending their arrival at the barn and the conversation occurring between them and Mr. Moist. On the contrary Mr. Moist testifies that the sheriff and Mr. McDonald came there and the sheriff said to him, after trying to convince him that the prisoner was there, “We know that he is here and you may as well give him up,” and that Mr. McDonald also said, “We know he is here and you may as well give him up.” From this it is contended on the part of the defendant that there is a conflict in the testimony between Mr. Abraham Moist and the sheriff and Mr. McDonald.</p>

      <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>[It is also contended on the part of the defendant that, if the testimony of Mr. Daniel Beashore is relied upon, as the very truth of the case, it would go very far toward showing that, instead of the plaintiff being the one mainly and principally instrumental in effecting this capture, he was simply assisting the sheriff; that the sheriff was the principal; the organized party was under his control and management, and they were the assistants to obey his will. Mr. Beashore testifies that he was one of the party and that when they arrived at the Basin, adjoining this town, Mr. McDonald asked, “ Where shall we go ? ” and the sheriff said, “ To Kauffman’s barn! ” that the sheriff was riding with David Hetrick and that, when they were passing an old vacant house, Mr. Lapp asked the sheriff whether they should search this building, and the sheriff replied “No, go on to Kauffman’s barn!” If you should find that this was the fact it would be very strong evidence to indicate that it was the sheriff who was directing the manner in which this search should be made and the place to which their attention should be directed; because, if it be true that Mr. McDonald asked him in the first place where they shoidd go and the sheriff replied that they should go to Kauffman’s bam, it would undoubtedly be the sheriff who had the knowledge'of the locality and whereabouts of the prisoner, and he was the one who was directing and managing those who were in search of the prisoner; that Mr. McDonald was simply inquiring as to his duties and as to where he should go, being obedient to the commands and directions of the sheriff.] 6 . . . .</p>

If the plaintiff has satisfied your minds by the preponderance or weight of the evidence that he was mainly instrumental in effecting this recapture then you should find for him the amount offered by the commissioners, and, if you see proper, with interest from the date that the demand was made and refused by the commissioners; as to the question of interest you can do as you think right and proper.

That was, in addition to what the court did state, that the conduct of the plaintiff, after becoming on Monday as fully satisfied of the hiding place of Mc-Meen, as he alleges he was, and not going to Kauffman’s barn to search it until the middle of the afternoon on Tuesday, strongly discredited his claim and testimony.

    <p id="b145-8" data-blocks='[["BL_145.8",145,[207,1286,1190,1028]]]'>This case was tried upon an entirely false theory. It seems to have been taken for granted, both by court and counsel, that if in fact McDonald, the plaintiff, gave to the sheriff such definite information as to enable him to discover the escaped criminal, he, the plaintiff, was entitled to the inward offered by the county commissioners. A reading, however, of the offer made by those commissioners ought to have corrected the mistake, and led to a proper trial and judgment. “ The commissioners of Juniata county will pay, for the capture and delivery of the above-named W. Josiah McMeen to the jail of Juniata county, the sum of four hundred dollars.” A mere reading of this paper settles the whole controversy; the reward was not offered for information as to the prisoner’s whereabouts, but for his capture and delivery. How then could one be entitled to that reward who neither captured nor delivered him? Admitting then, that the plaintiff gave the sheriff accurate information as to where the culprit could bo found, and that he went with him and acted as one of his posse, yet on that officer fell the duty of arrest, and the plaintiff was relieved of all responsibility.</p>

But a greater mistake than this could not have been made, for the sheriff was bound by law to make that arrest at all hazards just as soon as from any source he discovered the place of Mc-Meen’s concealment; hence he was not, and could not have been acting for McDonald, but rather for himself. Under this theory of the case we must sustain the second assignment of error, though possibly the offer, for the purpose intended, was irrelevant, yet in fact, and for another purpose, it was relevant, that is, to show that the sheriff was the person active in making the arrest, and that McDonald and others were acting under hiin. Under the circumstances above narrated we feel ourselves constrained to reverse this case, and as under the conditions of the reward offered by the commissioners, the plaintiff’s claim cannot be sustained, we must do so without ordering a new venire.</p>
