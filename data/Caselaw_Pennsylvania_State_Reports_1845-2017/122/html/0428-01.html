      <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>The whole question then is, had Ross S. Beatty a right to surrender the benefit certificate which he had- taken out in the name of his wife and delivered to her as her own property, and take out this one of September 17, 1880, in the name of and for the benefit of his mother without the knowledge or consent of his wife. This depends upon whether he had made such a disposition of it as vested an absolute title in her. I think it clear that the mere fact that a member of this society had designated his wife or mother as the beneficiary, did not take away his legal right to change it from one to the other, or even to give it to some third person, if he saw fit to do so. But whenever by sale or assignment of any kind, for value, he creates a legal or equitable right in the transferee, he then lost his right to further change the beneficiary. While this is not like a policy of life insurance, taken out for the benefit of a third party whose name is designated in the policy, but may be changed from time to time in accordance with the regulations of the society, so long as the beneficiary named has no vested interest in it, or, in other words, so long as nothing has been done further than to take out the certificate in his or her name, and the member still retains the possession or control over the certificate, yet I think that it may be the subject of a gift to the beneficiary named, and that such gift will be in legal effect executed by a delivery of such certificate to the beneficiary with the intent duly expressed at the time to give her the sole use, control and ownership in it. If this is so, then Ross S. Beatty made a gift of this certificate to the plaintiff which he had no power to avoid without her consent, and therefore as between the plaintiff and defendant', Mrs. Amanda Beatty, the former is entitled to receive the amount due and payable by the Supreme Commandery, United Order of the Golden Cross of the World, the other defendant.</p>

In that case the benefit certificate issued to Mrs. Fisk was made payable to her husband, was delivered into his possession, and he assumed and actually paid all the fees and assessments thereon. She subsequently obtained possession of the certificate, surrendered it without the knowledge or consent of her husband, and received a new one in its stead, naming four other persons beside him as beneficiaries. The original certificate expressly provided that she might change the beneficiary at any time by surrendering it and taking out a new one; and this court affirmed her right to do so, notwithstanding the previous delivery to the husband and the payment of the money by him.

H. Beatty, paying the assessments. In the spring of 1883, Ross Beatty was married, and soon after his marriage he obtained possession of the certificate, and without his mother’s knowledge or consent surrendered it and took out another, payable to his wife Clara, and delivered it to her. In 1886 he was in failing health, and his mother nursed and attended on him. In September of that year he surrendered certificate No. 2 and procured a new one, payable, as the original one had been, to his mother, and delivered it into her possession. This was done without the knowledge or consent of his wife. He died in the following May. The mother is now seeking to recover the money due to her upon certificate No. 3, which was made payable to her.</p>

An effort is made to distinguish it from that case by reason of the master’s findings. He found as a fact that in certificate No. 2, Ross Beatty “had named his wife as the beneficiary in the certificate and delivered the same into her possession and control.” From these facts he concludes as matter of law that he had made “ an absolute gift to her, and his subsequent surrender thereof without his wife’s <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>knowledge and consent was void,” and as a consequence certificate No. 3 was void. If the conclusion thus drawn by the learned master follows legitimately from his facts, it shows very clearly that certificate No. 2 was also void, and Clara Beatty had no title whatever, for in 1878 Ross Beatty named his mother as the beneficiary in the certificate No. 1 and delivered it into her possession and control. From these facts it would follow that he made an absolute gift of the certificate to his mother, and that the surrender of it without her knowledge and consent was void. But the conclusion does not follow from the facts found in either case, for the reason, so clearly stated in Fisk’s Case, that “ whoever becomes a beneficiary in such a certificate has notice upon the face of the paper that it is held subject to the right of the insured to surrender it and name _ another beneficiary at will.” The decree must, therefore, be reversed and the injunction dissolved.</p>
    <p id="b459-5" data-blocks='[["BL_459.4",459,[199,1197,1190,974]]]'>But wc do not see how a court of equity has any jurisdiction in this case. The defendant in the court below is the beneficiary named in the certificate which she seeks to collect. She is the only person who can sue upon it. Clara Beatty is a stranger to it and neither claims nor could claim under it. On the contrary, she denies its validity and asserts that it is void. If this be so, it is probable the insurance company will defend for that reason at the proper time, but it will be in a court of law. Why, then, should not Amanda Beatty be allowed to proceed against the company on her certificate ?
