To discharge the obligation thus created, the overseers of the poor of Plumcreek township borrowed from the plaintiff the sum of $440, giving him a negotiable note for that amount, dated January 28, 1884, payable one year after date, and signed by “ John F. Bell and Jacob Clark, Overseers of the Poor of Plumcreek township.” The money thus obtained was at once applied to the payment of the decree made in favor of Rayne township. Afterwards, as it was made to appear, the overseers of Plum-creek township obtained an order of removal of the same paupers to Washington township, in Indiana county. This order of removal was sustained by the court on proceedings attacking it, and Washington township was decreed liable and paid to the overseers of Plumcreek township the sum of $420. In addition to the foregoing, the overseers of Plumcreek township, probably before the money had been received from Washington township, directed a tax to be levied to meet this same expense, which tax was collected and something like $700 came into the hands of the overseers of the poor of Plum-creek township.</p>

They have no right under any circumstances to exceed the powers conferred upon them by the law. They are not authorized under the general law to negotiate loans. They are authorized to take care of the poor and to see that tax rates are levied sufficient for the purpose of defraying the expenses connected with their duties as overseers of the poor for their respective townships, but they have no right under the law to go beyond that duty. The duties of overseers of the poor, school directors and supervisors of roads, are limited, because as lias well been said by the counsel arguing this case on behalf of the defendant, if in one case an overseer of the poor could contract an honest debt and borrow money and give an obligation that would bind the township, he could also contract a dishonest debt and give an obligation that would bind the township to the same extent and with the same force, and no tax payer could know the amount of taxes he might be called upon to pay or how far his property lying within that township would become liable for the debts thus contracted by officers exceeding their powers. If an overseer of the poor can contract such debts in such a manner, by giving the obligation of the township, then school directors would have a right in the same way to do so, and supervisors of the roads in the same way, and all would be at sea as to what the actual responsibilities of the township might be, or what the individual responsibilities of the citizens of the respective townships might bo. The law, therefore, is exacting, that these officers shall be limited in the exercise of their powers, and shall go no further than it authorizes them.</p>

If the city obtain money of another by mistake, or without authority of law, it is her duty to refund it; not from any contract entered into by her on the subject, but from the general obligation to do justice, which binds all persons, whether natural or artificial. If the .city obtain other property which does not belong to her, it is her duty to restore it; or, if used by her, to render an equivalent to the true owner, from the like general obligation; the law, which always intends justice, implies a promise.

The facts of the case as they appear from the evidence, are as follows:</p>

      <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>On June 4, 1877, an appeal was taken from an order of removal of a pauper to the said district from the Rayne Township poor district, in the county of Indiana. This appeal was finally determined by the Quarter Sessions of Armstrong, against the Plumcreek district, and on taxation of the costs and charges due Rayne they were found to amount to $420.86, which sum the court ordered the defendant to pay, and for this purpose the money, as above stated, was borrowed from the plaintiff. The counsel for the defendant insists that this borrowing was not-the result of the joint action of the overseers, but the act of one only. This fact, however, if fact it be, we pass as of no moment in the final disposition of this contention, for the material question, and the one on which the court below put its decision, was that which involves the power of the overseers to bind their district for borrowed money.</p>
    <p id="b588-4" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[263,1178,1192,963]]]'>The powers of these officers are very strictly limited by the various acts of assembly relating to the maintenance of the poor, and, except in rare and special cases, they cannot step beyond the letter of those acts. We agree, however, with the counsel for the plaintiff, that occasionally circumstances may arise when, in order to give effect to the statutes, we must go beyond their letter. But such is allowable in special emergencies only, as where medical aid or other assistance is imperatively required before a relief order can be obtained, examples of which may be found in Directors of the Poor v. Worthington, <a href="/pa/38/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="38 Pa. 160" data-case-ids="994102" data-case-paths="/pa/38/0160-01">38 Pa. 160</a>, and Directors of the Poor v.

But even then the rule of the law is only partially relaxed, for without a subsequent order no action can be sustained against the poor district. We will not undertake to say that in cases of necessity the overseers might not contract for supplies, or even borrow money, but without the approval of two justices they would not be allowed to collect such money or the cost of such supplies from the tax payers of the district.</p>

His case is not backed by an order of relief, nor did he aid the defendant when laboring under an imperative emergency. He must depend alone oh the order of the court; but this order created no such pressing necessity as required the overseers to contract a debt <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>in relief of their district. It constrained them to proceed only within the strict lines of the statute, that is, to levy a tax in order to pay the debt, and the Quarter Sessions would doubtless have imposed upon them no undue urgency or haste. From what we have said it follows, that the action of the overseers in borrowing the money in controversy from the plaintiff was without warrant of law and cannot bind the district, Whilst the case is a hard one for the plaintiff: who honestly advanced his money for, as he supposed, the relief of the township, yet it would be out of all character to allow the officers of a minor municipality, like the defendant, without the authority of the court, people, justices, or auditors, to saddle the citizens of their several districts with debts which ought not to have been contracted, or which, when contracted, should be provided for in the manner prescribed by tlie statute.</p>
