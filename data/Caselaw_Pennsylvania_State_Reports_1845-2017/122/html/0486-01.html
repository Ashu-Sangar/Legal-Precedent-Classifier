      <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>On April 19, 1886, Silas Wingett made an assignment of all his estate for the benefit of creditors. A sale of his real estate discharged of liens, made under an order of the court, was confirmed on November 8, 1886, and on November 80th, the assignees filed their account showing a balance of $5,473.05 for distribution, composed entirely of the proceeds of real estate, which at the date of the assignment was subject to liens to an amount larger than said balance. No exceptions having been filed to said account, on February 26, 1887, an auditor was appointed to report distribution.</p>

M. </em>Dickson, filed on August 26, 1887, it appeared that the land producing the fund had been devised to Silas Wingett, the assignor, by the will, dated December 15, 1849, of his father Reuben Wingett, who died on March 29, 1850. The testator by his said will bequeathed to Jane Wingett his daughter, two legacies of $500 each, one payable when she should arrive at the age of twenty-five years, and another when Silas should arrive at the age of twenty-five years. lie also bequeathed to the Concord church $300, the interest of which was to be expended annually for missionary and benevolent purposes. His son Silas was to have possession of the farm devised to him when he became twenty-live years of age, which occurred in September, 1864, but he was to be without authority to sell the farm during the lifetime of his mother, nor under any circumstances until he should he thirty years of age. Rev. Stephen Wingett and Col. Albert Squier were appointed executors of said will, and tlio guardians of the persons and property of all the testator’s children, the will, referring to said appointment, concluding: “ T give them full power to take charge of all my real and personal property and manage the same according to their discretion for the best interest of the heirs and the family, to take charge of the farm and lease or rent the same or have it worked as they shall deem best, and have a general supervision of the whole estate until the above legacies shall have been paid, and the whole estate settled according to the above directions.

    <p class="summary" id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[170,649,1194,1494]]]'>It is undoubtedly true, as stated by him, that statutes of limitation are presumed to be waived, if not specially pleaded or due notice given that they will be relied upon for a defence. But this rule cannot be applied to this case, because the statute referred to cannot in any proper sense be called a statute of limitations. It is a mere statutory rule of evidence analogous to the presumption of payment arising from 20 years delay in pursuing a claim under seal. It never was necessary to plead specially that the presumption was relied on. Under the plea of payment, alone, the defence was available and, without more, upon presentation of such a claim on a trial, if there was no evidence offered to show non-payment, the court would direct a verdict for defendant. This distinction between statutory bars, and the legal presumption arising from delay, is clearly indicated in Foulk v. Brown, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.%20215" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 W. 215">2 W. 215</a>, where it is said: “The court will not encourage the laches or indolence of parties, but will presume after a great length of time, some composition or release to have been made. The length of time does not operate as a positive bar, but as furnishing evidence that the demand has been satisfied. But it is evidence from which, when not rebutted, the jury is bound to draw a conclusion. . . . Within twenty years the onus of proving payment lies on defendant. After that time it devolves on the plaintiff to show the contrary by such facts and circumstances as will satisfy the jury that there are other .reasons for the delay in the prosecution of the claim, than the alleged payment. Slighter circumstances are sufficient to repel the presumption, than are required to take the case out of the statute of limitations.” See, also, Peters’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=106%20Pa.%20343" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="106 Pa. 343">106 Pa. 343</a>.</p>

McGaw, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.%20161" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 W. 161">2 W. 161</a>, it was held that the six years statute of limitations did not bar the recovery of a legacy, the court saying, “ The legatee may be ignorant of the bequest, or absent in other states. If acquainted with it, he is not bound to demand it within the statutory period, unless the will imposes that condition.” The doctrine of this case is affirmed in Etter v.

The course of reasoning by which the conclusion is reached, that legacies charged on land by a will are not within the purview of the statute referred to, operates with equal or greater force to exclude them from the operation of the act of 1855.</p>

Clearly they are not within that act, unless included in tin; clause, other charges upon real estate, therein. In Pratt v.

Sharswood, J., said: “My opinion is that the act should have a liberal construction, and be held to apply to all kinds of charges upon real estate to which the ordinary presumption of payment applied, making such presumption to be juris et de jure. Upon this question the members of the court are divided in opinion.” As Justice Sharswood’s opinion was not adopted, it is manifest a majority of the court was adverse to it. That case is the nearest approach to the determination of the question, and from it, as well as from the wording of the act, we conclude that the act applies only to ground-rents, annuities and other charges ejusdem generis; that is, charges which from their nature require the annual payment of a specific sum of money, without reference to any principal debt upon which it is computed, and where he whose duty it is to make payment has it not in his power to cause such payments to determine, and to release himself or his lands therefrom.</p>

The requisites necessary to remove the bar of the six years statute of limitations and that of the act of 1855, are almost identical. In both cases the bringing of a suit stops the running of the statute. In both cases the new life runs from the date of the last promise, declaration or acknowledgment. The only substantial difference is in the time necessary to bar a claim. Prom a comparison of the two statutes, it will appear that the distinction between a statute of limitations and a statutory rule of evidence is more fanciful than real. In Pratt v. Eby, <a href="/pa/67/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="67 Pa. 396" data-case-ids="1022431" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0396-01">67 Pa. 396</a>, the court treated the act throughout as a statute of limitations.

The will was probated and letters testamentary issued in April, 1850. -The first legacy fell due in 1851, and the last payment on the last legacy became due in September, 1864, when the farm on which it is sought to charge the legacies came into the full possession of Silas Wingett, under the terms of the devise to him. At that time the possession of the farm passed out of the executors, who were also trustees under the terms of the will, and vested in Silas, the devisee. He continued to own and occupy it until November, 1886, when it was sold by bis assignees, he having become insolvent. The proceeds of this sale are the fund for distribution, and the contest over it is between the legatees under the will of Reuben Wingett, and the lien creditors of Silas, the devisee.</p>
    <p id="b517-6" data-blocks='[["BL_517.6",517,[163,1239,1192,1173]]]'>For more than twenty-two years, after reaching the age of twenty-five years, Silas had been the owner and occupant of the farm, and during all that time, as well as the sixteen years dining which the executors were in possession, it is alleged that nothing bad been paid upon the legacies. What, then, was the effect of the act of 1855 upon the legatees ? Did it put the burden of showing the circumstances necessary to relieve against the bar of the act upon them? This is answered by a glance at the act itself. It provides that any one claiming the payment of any ground-rent, annuity, or other charge upon real estatp, which has been due for twenty-one years, must show some “piayment, claim, or demand,” on account of the alleged lien, or some “ declaration or acknowledgment of the existence thereof,” made within the twenty-one years by the owner of the premises, subject to such charge. It is very clear, therefore, that if the person claiming payment of such charge or lien is able to show neither a claim or demand of payment made by him on the owner of such real estate, nor a payment upon or an acknowledgment of the existence of such lien or charge by such owner within the statutory period, then the act operates to raise a conclusive presumption of the release or extinguishment of the demand, and declares that it shall “thereafter he irrecoverable.”</p>

Proof of mere non-payment is not enough. The non-payment must be accounted for consistently with a positive assertion of the demand on the one hand, or an explicit acknowledgment on the other.</p>
    <p id="b518-5" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[263,882,1186,446]]]'>In this case it appeared that Silas Wingett had been owner and occupant of the farm for more than twenty-one years. The legacies had remained due all that time. Before the legatees could come in on the fund, it was incumbent on them to show their formal demand of payment made upon Silas, or his part payment or acknowledgment, while still the owner of the farm, of its liability to this charge. Failing to do this the act became operative upon the legacies and they became “thereafter irrecoverable.”</p>
