M. train from Philadelphia to Lancaster, the place of their residence. They both had been drinking. The approach of the train to Lancaster was announced, and the conductor as he passed through the car spoke to Gibson who said he would get Bell off at the station. After stopping the usual time at Lancaster, the train passed on and the conductor found Bell and Gibson still in the cars. Gibson explained that when he had awakened Bell he got angry and that lie had not been able to get him off, when the conductor said he would let them off at Landisville. The train reached Landisville about 11:15 p. M. when Bell was removed from the train and carried to the platform in front of the station. Gibson got off himself, and the two were left there. They afterwards went into the waiting room.</p>

The station building, used for both roads, stands in the angle south-east of the crossing, and is about 12 feet from the defendant company’s tracks, and about 24 feet from the tracks of the Reading &amp; Columbia railroad. The space between the station building and the tracks of both roads is covered with planking. This planking on the south side of the defendant company’s tracks extends 393 feet west of the station door and 355 feet east of it. Beyond the crossing from the station and in the south-west angle of the crossing, stands a watch-box, which is 7 feet 2 in. from the defendant company’s tracks and 35 feet 5 in. from the station building. The defendant company’s road is a straight line for about 2400 feet west of the station and for some distance east of it. Opposite the watch-box was a signal light over the tracks, fifteen or twenty feet from the ground, showing either a red light or a white light. There were other lights about the watch-box and at the station building, and there was a little snow upon the ground.</p>

The whistle and the bell of the train were sounded; the headlight of .the locomotive threw the light 800 feet or more along the track, and the head-light was visible for more than 2300 feet from the station. The engineer saw the signal light and as he slowed up to stop, Bell and Gibson walked with linked arms westward from where they had been standing, and when they were at or near the Reading &amp; Columbia tracks, they got close to the track upon which the train was approaching, and Bell was struck by a projecting part of the engine. The train stopped within about 20 feet from the place of the accident. Bell was taken to his home in a sleigh and died on February 7th following.

We there held that a person who was about to cross a railroad track, stepped upon the track and was struck by a passing engine, could not recover, although he testified that before stepping on the track he stopped and looked and listened, but neither saw nor heard any approaching train.

And burning? A. Yes, sir.” This witness <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>was a watchman at the station, and was on duty at the time of the accident.</p>
    <p id="b90-4" data-blocks='[["BL_90.4",90,[247,442,1187,817]]]'>It was proved by a number of witnesses for the defendant, and not at all contradicted, that the track at and near the station is on a straight line, and that a man standing six or seven feet from the track could see an approaching train for half a mile. It is beyond all question, under all the testimony, that if the deceased had really looked for the approaching train at a perfectly safe distance from the track, he could not possibly have failed to see the train as it approached, in ample time to avoid danger. If he came out just as the train arrived, he was equally in default for advancing immediately upon the train. The fact of collision was the result of his purely voluntary act of placing himself so close to the track as to be struck by the passing car, and in such circumstances, the facts being entirely undisputed, there cannot possibly be a recovery in damages without violating the plainest and most familiar legal principles.</p>
    <p id="b90-5" data-blocks='[["BL_90.5",90,[245,1269,1183,401]]]'>We are clearly of opinion that the defendant’s fourth and fifth points should have been affirmed upon the plaintiff’s own testimony. There was not a particle of evidence that the deceased stopped and looked or listened, although it was affirmatively proved by the principal witness for the plaintiff that he and the deceased were warned of the approach of the train and went out of the station for the express purpose of getting upon it.</p>
