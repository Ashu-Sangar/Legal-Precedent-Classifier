Nor did the amendment made by the plaintiffs entitle them to take judgment. The action was a joint action, and it is clear that it could have been proceeded in against the husband, notwithstanding the wife’s defence of coverture. Hence the amendment was unnecessary. But the amendment in effect was the filing of a new declaration charging the defendant alone with the debt, and, being made after return day, the record does not show that there was notice to the defendant, to entitle the plaintiffs to judgment. Moreover, such proceedings were had in the cause that the right to require an affidavit was waived: O’Neal v. Rupp, <a href="/pa/22/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="22 Pa. 395" data-case-ids="413730" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0395-01">22 Pa. 395</a>.</p>

An action cannot be maintained against both husband and wife, upon a promise alleged to have been made by both during coverture; for, as to the wife the promise is void and in law is considered as the promise of the husband: Husband’s Married Women, § 186. The credit of a married woman is nothing in the eyes of the law; when she does contract, the law esteems her the agent of her husband, and the debts created are his debts, not hers: Heugh v.

If, as urged, the plaintiffs’ rights against the husband were not enlarged by the amendment, what is the force of the position that he had no notice of it?

What meritorious defence is disclosed on this record? By his utter silence for six years the defendant’s liability and the justness of the plaintiffs’ claim are admitted.

The opening of the judgment against the husband in 1879 was not the plaintiffs’ act. After that opening no affidavit of defence was ever filed, and no step was taken by the plaintiffs that could in any way mislead the defendant. The motion for judgment was the next regular step in the cause. In O’Neal v. Rupp, <a href="/pa/22/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="22 Pa. 395" data-case-ids="413730" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0395-01">22 Pa. 395</a>, an affidavit of defence had been filed, and plaintiff moved for judgment after he had ruled the defendant to plead and after a plea had been entered.

Gudykunst and Margaret his wife, jointly, upon an itemized statement of account for goods sold and delivered amounting to $664. The copy of account filed ■ shows the charges to have been made against the husband and wife jointly, and the declaration, which was upon the common counts only, was for a joint debt and contained no averments' charging the separate estate of the wife. Margaret Gudykunst filed an affidavit of defence alleging coverture at the time the debt was created, and that the debt was not contracted by her, .nor by any one for her. Thereupon on December 10, 1879, judgment was entered against the defendant, E. S. Gudykunst, for want of an affidavit of defence, for $658.15; on January 29, 1880, however, the judgment was opened and the defendant let into a defence. Whether the judgment was opened on application of the plaintiff, or of the defendant, or by the court upon its own motion, does not appear. The record remained in this condition for six years and more, when on August 9, 1886, without notice to the defendants, or either of them, the record was amended by striking out the name of Margaret Gudykunst as a party defendant, <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>and judgment was again entered against E.

The only question is, whether or not the court, under the circumstances stated, had any authority to enter the judgment for want of an affidavit of defence; we think not. By the pleadings originally filed, E. S. Gudykunst was charged jointly with his wife ; in this form of proceeding he made no defence, relying perhaps upon the joinder of his wife and the force of her affidavit, as a defence against the plaintiff’s recovering against him. Whether he knew of the judgment of December 10, 1879, does not appear and perhaps that is not material. But it is plain that when the pleadings were so amended as to make him the only defendant, he had a right to notice of the fact before an affidavit of defence could be required of him, if an affidavit was required of him at all. It is admitted that under the pleadings, as originally filed, coverture being admitted therein, the joint action against the husband and wife could not be sustained. When the time arrived for judgment, under the rule of court, the plaintiff therefore was not entitled to judgment; the judgment which was then erroneously entered was in a few days thereafter opened, and he could not put matters in a better position, under the rule, by any subsequent amendment, excepting, perhaps, upon thirty days’ notice to the defendant or his attorney, and then judgment could only have been entered upon motion in open court. The defendant had a right to content himself with the condition of the record at the time fixed by the rule, until further notice. The judgment was without doubt erroneously entered, and the same is therefore</p>
