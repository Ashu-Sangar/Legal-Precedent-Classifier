An examination of these acts shows that on the 14th day of May, 1777, the only part of the act of 1700 then in force was the first clause, which provides: “That all cornfields and grounds, kept for inclosure within the said province and counties annexed, shall be well fenced.” In the case of Gregg v.

Prior to the framing and adoption of the constitution of 1874, special or local legislation had become an evil of great magnitude, and it required and received special attention upon the part of the convention moulding the organic law, in order, if possible, to effectually prevent the recurrence of the public wrongs and evils which had been perpetrated by such special and local legislation in the past. The earnest endeavors of the members of the convention to effectually eradicate all special or local legislation, thenceforth, from our statute books, is evident by the fact that they not only prohibited such legislation in plain, unmistakable language, thus: “ The general assembly shall not pass any local or special law,” etc., but to emphasize their intention that no more of the vicious legislation <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>should in an indirect manner be enacted, in another clause they farther extended the prohibition as follows: “Nor shall the general assembly indirectly enact such special or local laws by the'partial repeal of a general law,” etc. Our Supreme Court, in their construction of acts apparently in conflict with these wise provisions of the constitution, have rigidly adhered to such an interpretation as carried into effect the intention of its framers, and upon every occasion have placed their seal of condemnation, not only upon every open violation, but also every secret attempt to evade the wise provisions “ under the attempted disguise of a general law:” Scowden’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=96%20Pa.%20425" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="96 Pa. 425">96 Pa. 425</a>.</p>

In the light of this definition of what constitutes local or special legislation, let us examine the act of 1885. If the 1st section stood alone, there would be no difficulty, for it simply repeals the 1st section of the act of 1700 ; but the 2d section is inseparably connected with the 1st. The 1st is a dead letter upon the statute books, dependent upon the provisions of the 2d section being carried affirmatively into effect; further, the 1st section expressly provides that the 1st section shall not take effect until the provisions of the 2d are fully consummated. The two sections must, therefore, respectively be construed and passed upon as a whole.</p>

The 2d section commences: “ That it shall be the duty of the sheriff of any county, on the request of the county commissioners thereof,” etc. The whole law is to be put in operation at the request of the county commissioners. Suppose the commissioners should refuse to act, how would they be compelled? I am aware that the word “may,” in some cases where the public interests are at stake, has been construed as <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>“ shall,” but I do not now remember of a single case where a simple request has been enforced by mandamus. I am informed, whether correctly or otherwise, that, in the mountainous counties of the state, the citizens are largely opposed to the law; whether true or not, matters not; the principle is the same. Each separate county in the state may accept of the provisions, or may reject them. The act contemplates the division of the state into counties; each one to act by itself, and for itself. In one or more the popular vote may be in favor of “ the repeal,” and in such county or counties it is provided that “ the act shall take effect forthwith,” and thenceforth therein the common law is the rule of action. And every owner of cattle in such county would be held responsible for any damages arising from their trespasses. Other counties may vote “against the repeal,” qr not vote at all, and in such counties the first clause of the act of 1700 still remains the law. Thus it is seen that we have different laws upon the same subject-matter, bounded and defined by distinct territorial limits.</p>

It matters not that every county in the commonwealth may accept the provisions of the act of 1885; the vice in the act consists in that any county may reject it. In Scranton Sch.

In other words, a majority of the members of the city council, in any city of the third class, may impose upon the inhabitants of that city a method of taxation which may not prevail in any other city of this commonwealth. A law which authorizes this to be done, in our judgment, is clearly obnoxious to the 7th section of article III. of the constitution, which prohibits the general assembly from passing any local or special <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>law regulating the affairs of counties, etc.....The circumstance that the power to determine the question is delegated to another body does not at all affect the question. The practical result is the same ; the law of 1875 will be limited to the one or more cities that do accept, and that makes it local.

The act as passed and approved is complete-. Only the question as to whether its provisions are desirable or expedient is left to the electors of the several counties. “When the legislature calls to its aid only the means of ascertaining the utility of a measure, and does not delegate the power to amend the law, it is acting within its powers: ” Locke’s App., <a href="/pa/72/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="72 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="434662" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0491-01">72 Pa. 491</a>.

It is self-evident that the whole machinery of the act of 1885 is to he put into operation by the county commissioners acting as such, and not in their individual capacity; the sheriff, by virtue of his office, must satisfy the requirements as to publication ; and lastly, the qualified electors of the particular county decide whether or not the act shall take effect in that county. Thus the legislature recognizes the proposed regulation of the fence law of 1700 by the act of 1885, as a regulation of county affairs. The act is therefore unconstitutional.</p>

It would seem difficult to frame an act which could more generally concern the people. Moreover, it prescribes certain duties to the sheriff, the commissioners, and all the election officers.

It is to be observed that the first section, repealing the act of 1700, does not go into effect in any county by its own force. If it did, we might sustain it even if the rest of the act were unconstitutional. But the first section is tied to the second section by an umbilical cord. If we cut it they both perish. The first section is only effective after a vote of the people in each county. If a majority in any county vote in favor of it, then the act takes effect in such county ; if the majority should be against it, the act does not take effect. Thus it may very well happen that Venango county may vote in favor of the repeal and its adjoining counties vote against it. We would then have one law in Venango county regulating fences, and a different law in the adjoining counties, both local laws, the very thing prohibited by the constitution. Nor would it make any difference were every county in the state to vote the same way. The test is not results, but possibilities. The machinery to test the sense of the people can only be put in operation by the county commissioners, and when so moved, the fact that it may be renderedlocal in its effects is fatal to the bill.

The practical result is the same; the law of 1875 will be limited to the one or more cities that do accept and that makes it local. All our recent decisions are to the effect that if local results either are or may be produced by a piece of legislation, it offends against this provision of the constitution and is void ; ” citing Commonwealth v. Patton, supra, and other cases. Scranton School D.’s App., is upon all fours with the case in hand. The act of 1875 there referred to was an act for the assessment, levy, and collection of all taxes authorized to be collected in certain cities, and to which by the proviso of the fifth <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>section no city of the third class shall become subject until . they are accepted by ordinance of councils, approved by the mayor, and it was held that the first five sections thereof were thus limited to the one or more cities that accept, and were therefore local and in conflict with § 7, article III. of the constitution.</p>
