Since 1857 the portion annexed by the town council extends in each direction from the former limits, increasing the area of the borough and its population perhaps one third of its originaL dimensions. 1 have not been advised of any other possible means by which the borough of Ebensburg now exists and has existed for the last thirty years, than under the. provisions of the act of 1851.</p>

But, having acted ostensibly under this authority and continued so to act, with the entire acquiescence of the constituted authorities and the inhabitants of the borough for upwards of thirty years, the defendant cannot complain of the absence of the record of the Quarter Sessions.

But, assuming that the borough of Ebensburg is within the provisions of the act of 1851, is the burgess a member of council? This must depend entirely on the construction of that act of assembly. In our earlier legislation each borough was a law unto itself. Each community desiring a borough procured a charter of incorporation for itself from the legislature. This became its own municipal law. The act of 1834 was the first general law which 1 have noticed. In 1851 it was supplanted by the act of April 3d of that year. This act bears the impress of careful preparation, and is much more extensive in its provisions than its predecessor of 1834. The draftsman seemed to carry the idea of national and state government into municipal affairs, and separated the legislative from the executive power. It plainly and specifically sets out <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>the duties of the burgess, and notwithstanding the eighth section of the act 1834 was before the legislature, it is dropped out.

    <p id="b577-7" data-blocks='[["BL_577.7",577,[162,617,1193,601]]]'>1. The silence of the records of the Court of Quarter Sessions, as to the alleged extension of the act of 1851 to the borough of Ebensburg, is sought to be supplied by evidence aliunde. This is not permissible in a collateral proceeding and the evidence taken for that purpose should not have been received and considered. If evidence of this character were even admissible for the purpose offered, the testimony of James Myers, in conjunction with the memoranda found in the minute book, would clearly be insufficient to establish as a fact the allegation that the act of 1851 had been extended to the borough of Ebensburg by proceedings in the Court of Quarter Sessions.</p>
    <p id="b577-8" data-blocks='[["BL_577.8",577,[169,1238,1190,710]]]'>2. The borough of Ebensburg was incorporated by the special act of January 15, 1825, 8 Sm. L. 854. The powers and duties peculiar to the burgess, are found in the sixth and tenth sections of that act. In the sixth section it is provided as follows : “ The burgess and council to enact ordinances, assess, apportion and appropriate taxes determined by them; to appoint town clerk and other officers,” and in the tenth section thereof, “ in all meetings the burgess to preside.” It is quite evident that T. Mason Richards, burgess, in no manner transcended or exceeded the powers vested in him, by the original charter of the borough. That he is plainly warranted in the exercise of these functions .and in the performance of these duties unless deprived of such powers by subsequent legislation, must be conceded.</p>
    <p id="b577-9" data-blocks='[["BL_577.9",577,[168,1961,1190,456]],["BL_578.1",578,[235,352,1190,459]]]'>3. But assuming that the act of April 3,1851, had been legally extended to the borough of Ebensburg, would that result in the curtailment of any of the powers vested in the burgess under the original charter? Such a condition could only arise when the previsions of the one would be in conflict with the provisions of the other. In the 38d section of the act of April 3, 1851, P. L. 325, is contained this proviso: “ That upon such application being confirmed by the said court, the provisions of the former charter shall be annulled <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>by the decree of the court, so far as they are in conflict with the provisions of this act.” It is a well settled principle that if the several statutes relating to boroughs can stand together, the prior are not abrogated by the posterior: McFate’s App., <a href="/pa/105/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="105 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="454288" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0323-01">105 Pa. 323</a>. Now, the net of 1851 in none of its provisions expressly declares that a burgess is excluded from either presiding at the meetings of council or voting for clerk and other officers; and it is entirely silent as to who may preside at such meetings.</p>
    <p id="b578-5" data-blocks='[["BL_578.4",578,[234,818,1188,818]]]'>4. It cannot be successfully urged that the extension of the act of 1851 to a borough that liad been previously incorporated by act of assembly, would result in the entire obliteration of its charter conditions. But if such were the case it would seem that the act of 1851 should he taken and construed in conjunction with the act of April 1, 1834, P. L. 163. These two enactments form the general borough law of Pennsylvania, the one being but a supplement to the other; and, where the former is not changed, altered or supplied by the latter they are taken together: McFate’s Appeal, supra; Price v. Beale, <a href="/citations/?q=34%20Leg.%20Int.%20243" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="34 Leg. Int. 243">34 Leg. Int. 243</a>. In the 8th section of the act of 1834, defining the duties of burgess, this clause is contained: “The burgess shall be president of the town council and shall have and exercise all the rights and privileges of a member thereof; but in case of the absence of the burgess, the members present may elect one of their number to preside for the time being.”</p>

The act of 1851 arranges for the organization of the borough in plain language, prescribing the duties of the council to make ordinances, lay out streets and impose fines and penalties, and the duties of the burgess to enforce the ordinances, preserve order and to maintain the peace of the borough. That the eighth section of the act of 1834 was omitted from the act of 1851, authorizes a strong inference that it was <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>designedly omitted. Moreover, the legislature with the knowledge of the fact that the act of 1851 did not confer such powers on the burgess, provided, by § 2, act of June 2, 1871, P. L. 284, that the courts having jurisdiction, “may, in granting an incorporation or upon application made to them for that purpose, iix or change the charter of any borough so as to authorize the burgess or chief executive officer thereof, to serve as a member of the town council with full powers as such, and to preside at the meetings thereof.” The court below properly made the injunction perpetual.</p>

An answer would appear to have been drawn, under oath, on April 7, 1888, but it does not appear when it was filed, whether before or after the decree, or, indeed, whether it was filed at all. The decree is in the form of a filial decree, but, as the testimony was taken and the argument had on the motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction, the action of the court thereon was presumably intended as an order for the continuance of the preliminary injunction until final hearing.</p>

At the hearing on the motion to dissolve, the plaintiff attempted to show the execution and loss of this record, and by secondary evidence to establish its contents. To this it was objected that a lost record could not in this way be established by parol; that the record should first be supplied under the provisions of the twenty-sixth section of the act of April 25, 1850, P. L. 573. Whilst doubtless this is the better practice, where there is opportunity to pursue it, there can be no question that after proof of the loss, its contents may be proved, like any other document, by any secondary evidence, where the case does not from its nature disclose the existence of other and better evidence: 1 Greenl.

The loss may not he discovered until the trial is progressing. There would be no time then to file a bill on the chancery side of the court, to perpetuate the proof necessary for a foundation from which to supply the record; and it might he disastrous to one or other of the parties to delay the cause for such a purpose.”</p>
    <p id="b580-5" data-blocks='[["BL_580.4",580,[240,1797,1192,611]],["BL_581.1",581,[164,353,1187,292]]]'>But, assuming the power of the court in this respect, it must he conceded that the evidence offered was wholly inadequate for the purpose. To authorize memoriter proof of a lost document or record, the witness must have read it, or otherwise have actual knowledge of it, and be able to speak at least to the substance of the contents : 1 Whart. Ev. § 140; Coxe v. England, <a href="/pa/65/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="65 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="430691" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0212-01">65 Pa. 212</a>. The same kind and measure of proof is required as in the case of the loss of other documents. We will not refer to the evidence in this case, nor discuss it. We merely call attention to the character and quality of the proof required, in order that the case may be properly presented on final hearing. The question upon the construction of the act <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>of April 3, 1851, as to the duties and powers of the burgess, under the evidence, is not presented in this case. The testimony taken by the examiner, treated as injunction affidavits, is wholly insufficient. We give no opinion upon the construction of the act o£ 1851, until the question is properly raised for our consideration.</p>
    <p id="b581-4" data-blocks='[["BL_581.5",581,[434,665,920,199]]]'>The decree is reversed, and the preliminary injunction dissolved, without prejudice to the right of the plaintiff to proceed upon his bill to final hearing and decree.</p>
