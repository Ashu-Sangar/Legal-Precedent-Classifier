To this writ, on June 14, 1886, Hoobaugh made answer in substance that after the confirmation of his account, being advised that the judgment upon which the first execution attachment had issued had been fully paid and discharged, he paid to J.

Beaver, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20R.%20128" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 R. 128">2 R. 128</a>; Lathrop’s App., <a href="/pa/1/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="949910" data-case-paths="/pa/1/0512-01">1 Pa. 512</a>; Yard v. Patton, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Pa.%20286" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="13 Pa. 286">13 Pa. 286</a>. We think it will hardly admit of a doubt, that if the second judgment had been held by a second plaintiff, he would have been entitled to demand that the fund subject to the first attachment be applied to the first judgment in relief of the second, or that he he subrogated to the rights and securities of the first plaintiff. It is said by Gibsobt, C. J., in Ramsey’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.%20232" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 W. 232">2 W. 232</a>: “But if there is any rule or principle of equity plainly, positively and incontrovertibly established on the basis of reason and authority, it is that he who may at law control the application of two or more funds, shall not be suffered to use his legal advantages in a way to exclude the demand of a fellow creditor, whose legal recourse is but to one of them.” In the case before us the plaintiff in the first judgment had the control of two funds, one in the hands of the garnishee and the other in the hands of the sheriff. The plaintiff in the second judgment (in the case supposed) had legal recourse only to the latter; he would have been entitled to claim such disposition of the attached fund as would extinguish, pro tanto, the defendant’s indebtedness and reduce his own judgment. Can it make any difference that the plaintiff in the two judgments is the same ? Shall the mere accident that the second lien creditor is the same as in the first judgment operate to defeat the collection of his debt? Surely <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>it would be a grievous wrong, perpetrated in tlie name of justice and sanctioned by her ministers, if a defendant were permitted thus to put money in his pocket and defy his creditor!</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b115-5" data-blocks='[["BL_115.4",115,[195,518,1193,1179]]]'>To permit this now to be done would work a serious injury to the plaintiff, originating in perhaps an undue anxiety on part of the court to prevent injustice to the garnishee or to the defendant. As the facts now appear they could, neither of them, have been injured; nor can they be injured now by entering a judgment against the garnishee on the first attachment. The defendant cannot be injured, because he is thus simply having discharged so much of his legal indebtedness. The garnishee cannot be legally injured, because he is but paying, in accordance with the directions of the law, money originally owing from him to the defendant, and which was attached in his hands and thereby became subject to the law’s final process. It would be without practical difference to the parties whether judgment be now entered on the first or second attachment. But we are of opinion that the fund in the hands of the garnishee was bound by the first attachment, and still so continues, notwithstanding the judgment upon which it issued may have been satisfied at law: Ege v. Koontz, <a href="/pa/3/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="400658" data-case-paths="/pa/3/0109-01">3 Pa. 109</a>. It is the legal right of the plaintiff to collect his debt by one or more executions, and when effect has been given to both executions his claims against the defendant will not be Lilly paid, and we think regularity requires judgment to be entered on the first attachment and thus both attachments will be disposed of.</p>

There was no time from October 14,1885, to June 1,1886, when Minick was entitled to judgment upon the answer made by Hoobaugh. The answer was contingent, and as to the amount admitted was dependent upon the confirmation of the final account of his trust. A plaintiff is not entitled to judgment upon an answer which admits the property in hand, dependent upon a contingency; the answer must be unqualified and clear: Kerr v.

The reason to be gathered from the cases is, that the plaintiff will not be allowed to make his money twice, nor when indemnified by a seizure of one kind of defendant’s property, to tie up other property. We urge, then, that there was a complete extinguishment of the first execution attachment on the application by the sheriff of the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale, regardless of any act upon the part of the plaintiff.</p>

Sausaman on the first of which an execution was issued and <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>levied on defendant’s real estate. On same day an attachment execution was issued and served on appellant, who in answer admitted that, as executor of an estate then in process of settlement, he had funds in the distribution of which defendant would be entitled to participate, to the extent of about $90, on final settlement of the estate. No further action was then taken on the attachment, but the real estate levied on as above stated was shortly afterwards sold by the sheriff and the proceeds applied to payment in full of debt, interest and cost of the judgment, on which both execution processes were issued, and the residue of $265.01 to the other or second judgment, on account. The money, thus rightly appropriated by the sheriff, first to the costs, and then to the judgments, as first lions, in the order of their priority, was received by appellee, plaintiff in the executions, without objection. Some months after-wards appellant filed his account as executor, and, after the same was confirmed, paid Sausaman $119.14, the distributive share to which he was entitled. This he appears to have done in good faith, believing that payment of the judgment and costs was a satisfaction thereof in equity as well as in law, and of course an end of all proceedings thereon.</p>
    <p id="b117-5" data-blocks='[["BL_117.4",117,[199,1419,1182,915]]]'>Some ten days after Sausaman’s distributive share was thus paid, appellee issued an attachment execution on the second judgment, and appellant having been served as garnishee answered according to the facts, saying among other things, that the judgment on which the first attachment issued having been fully paid and satisfied, and Sausaman being entitled to his distributive share of the balance in his hands, he did on June 1, 1886, after confirmation of his account, pay the same, so that there is now nothing in his hands, etc. Without undertaking to controvert any of the facts set forth in the answers of the garnishee, the plaintiff below insisted on judgment against him, and the court, being of opinion “ that the fund in garnishee’s hands was bound by the first attachment and so continued notwithstanding the judgment upon which it issued, may have been satisfied inlaw,” judgment was accordingly entered against him, on his answers, for $119.14 in the first attachment, but to be applied, when paid, to the second judgment, as a credit thereon and in satisfaction of both attachment executions, etc.</p>
    <p id="b117-6" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[245,2348,1135,46]],["BL_118.1",118,[259,326,1187,872]]]'>Without questioning the correctness of the equitable principle <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>invoked by the learned judge in support of that conclusion, we think it is inapplicable to the undisputed facts in this ease. ' In the first place, it does not appear there was any other creditor than the plaintiff in the two judgments and hence there could be no equities to adjust between different lien creditors of a common debtor; and in the next place the payment and consequent satisfaction of the first judgment resulted, directly from appellee’s own voluntary act. He proceeded and sold defendant’s real estate and out of the proceeds accepted payment in full of the judgment, debt, interest and costs. This was an equitable as well as a legal satisfaction of the judgment and processes issued for the collection thereof. It was as full and complete satisfaction as if he had accepted payment in cash from Sausaman himself and acknowledged the same on the record. On what principle of equity, the judgment, under such circumstances, could have been kept alive for the benefit of the plaintiff, it is impossible to conceive.</p>

This left nothing to support the attachment. The debt, for the collection of which it was issued, was fully satisfied, the fund which theretofore had been bound by it in the hands of appellant was at once released from its grasp, and while so freed it was paid to the party entitled to receive it. There was therefore nothing, actually or constructively, in appellant’s hands on which the second attachment could operate. In view of the undisputed facts, as they appear on the record, the court erred in entering the judgment.</p>
