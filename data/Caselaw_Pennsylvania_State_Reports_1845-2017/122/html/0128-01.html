We think it rules this case, and renders any discussion on our part unnecessary. In that case the plaintiff had been chosen treasurer of The Rescue Hook and Ladder Company. He had positively declined to accept said office unless the company would agree not to enter up his bond. The company had agreed not to do this, and had in breach of this agreement in bad faith entered up the bond without the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff. Yet it was held to be immaterial whether the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the judgment or not. Mr. Justice Paxson delivering the opinion of the court says : “That the risk was increased by the entry of this judgment is assumed by the terms of the policy. It is not, therefore, an open question. The company has not received the premium for this increase of the risk, and not being itself in default is not bound to indemnify without receiving the consideration for such indemnity. This position is fully sustained by the authorities. It is sufficient to refer to Brown v. Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/41/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="41 Pa. 187" data-case-ids="480049" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0187-01">41 Pa. 187</a>; Insurance Co. v.

The agreement to pay an additional premium, if an incumbrance fall, is declared to make the incumbrance an increase of the risk, per se, and to close the question as to whether in fact it is an increase of the risk or not. The principle is, risk increased or not in fact, if the incumbrance falls, the additional premium must be paid or the policy is avoided. In the present case, there is no stipulation to pay an additional premium if an incumbrance falls; no notice of the incum<a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>brance is to be given in writing; the only notice the company covenants for, is that which will come through an application by the insured to incumber or allow the policy to continue, after an incumbrance has already fallen.</p>

By the plain reading of the policy, the insurer says to the insured, “ If you want to incumber or if an incumbrance has fallen, and you want your policy to continue, you must make application to us.” In the one case, the insured must intend to incumber, and in the other, he must know of the incumbrance fallen, in order to make the application. How is the assured to make such application if he do not know of the incumbrance and has no reason to believe it exists ? Surely the assured covenanted to apply for consent only when be knew or ought as a prudent man to have known of the incumbrance. Moreover, the object of the inquiry as to incumbrances, is to ascertain the interest the assured has in the property, in order to know how great the motive for its preservation: May on Insurance, § 290; Brown v. Insurance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=41%20Pa.%20194" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="41 Pa. 194">41 Pa. 194</a>.

The covenant in this case was against subsequent incumbrances — not that he might incumber, give notice thereof, pay additional premium and hold the policy in full force, but that if the property became incumbered the <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>entire policy should become void “ unless the written consent of the company at the Baltimore office is obtained; ” and the company covenants that “in cáse consent is applied for and refused, the company will pay to the assured the unearned premium.” Thus it is clear the company might, at its option, exact an additional premium because of the after hicumbrance, or impose other terms as a condition precedent to continuing the policy in force, and upon failure of assured to comply, cancel the policy and return to the assured the unearned premium.</p>

The claim that the verdict of the jury as to the loss on personal property should be sustained, is an odd one. • Incumbrances in the nature of judgment liens were entered against assured by virtue of his personal confession of judgment or warrant of attorney, i. e. because of his act; he gave no notice thereof to the insurance company, as he had covenanted to do, and the “ entire policy and every part thereof ” became void. It is not a question of what agreement assured made with his creditor. This insurance company was no party to that, could not be affected by it, and the court could not consider it as an element in the case. The facts being that the subsequent judgment liens were entered of record and no notice thereof given to this company defendant, ended the case; plaintiff could not go behind or beyond these facts. It was error to admit the evidence, cured however, by the judgment as entered by the court below upon the points reserved.</p>

In the present case, as in Insurance Company v. Schmidt, the assured alleged that he had no knowledge of the entry of the judgment in question; that in point of fact the holder thereof had agreed, not to enter it. That is a matter between the assured and the person who entered a judgment against him in violation of his agreement. What has the company to do with this ?
