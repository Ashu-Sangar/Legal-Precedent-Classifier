This principle certainly requires that, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, especially after so long a lapse of time, the entry of the Hempfield Railroad Company is to be taken as having been made in compliance with law. The entry, if made without doing one of two things, either paying or securing compensation, would be unlawful, a trespass. As a trespass is never presumed, it must be assumed that the law was complied with. True, the submission for the assessment of damages entered into five years after the entry, shows that payment did not precede the entry; the presumption therefore must be that the other alternative, security, was adopted and observed.</p>

There are many eases in which it is held that if a railroad company enter upon land in the presence of and with the knowledge and consent of the owner, and expend its money in making its railroad thereon, the owner is estopped to deny or revoke the parol license upon the faith of which the defendant has expended its money. He cannot allege that the possession is unlawful, either in an action of ejectment or trespass; his remedy is confined to seeking payment of the damages done : Chicago etc. R. Co. v.

Damages arising from the appropriation of land under the right of eminent domain, belong to the person who is the owner at the time.

The plaintiff, therefore, holding the eight ninths of the legal title, subject to the easement of the defendant, cannot be allowed to use the same to eject the defendant from its easement, if it fail to ‘make payment of moneys of which the plaintiff is entitled to but the one ninth. Moreover, as it is plain that the defendant may retain possession upon making payment of the award, it is necessary for the court, in order to make the judgment a security for the whole award, erroneously to assume to adjudicate upon the rights of persons who are not parties to the action at all.</p>

The proof of a legal title by the plaintiff, presumes only that the defendant’s possession is illegal against the plaintiff, until shown to be otherwise. But the entry by a railroad company, duly incorporated to construct a railroad, is, “ not the case of a trespass by one having no authority to enter, but of one representing the state herself, clothed with the power of eminent domain and having a right to enter ” upon certain well defined conditions: Justice v.

Moreover, the presumption which the defendant seeks to set up, that security by a bond was. given, must be a presumption of fact, if any at all. Now, though defendant had statutory authority to enter, upon conditions, and though its entry was not by a strong hand, or by fraud, or as a tort-feasor in any way, and was continued peaceably, it is not at all a necessary inference that security was accepted or tendered. No logic whatever can raise such an inference from the facts in evidence. But the defendant, by a logic the force of which we cannot see, presumes a bond into the case, and then seeks to put the plaintiff out of court, because he does not proceed upon the bond. If this logic be good for the defendant, it is good for the plaintiff, and suppose the plaintiff had sued upon a bond, not given and lost, but presumed to have been given!</p>

As the plaintiff’s right to recover depended upon his enjoyment of a perfect legal title, unaffected by the unlawful possession of the defendant, and not upon the extent of his interest in the award made in 1860, then, even if the answers to the defendant’ s second and third points were erroneous, the defendant cannot complain, as it was the defendant alone that asked that the condition be attached to plaintiff’s judgment if he recover one : See the defendant’s seventh point.

The only method by which this company, or its predecessor, could acquire any right whatever in lands, was by making composition with the owner or owners thereof, or by the tender of a bond with sufficient security to cover the damages which might result from its entry and occupancy of the premises, and without so making or securing payment it was absolutely prohibited from such entry or occupancy. Prom this it follows that there could be no presumption in favor of the company: it must affirmatively show its right or fail in its defence. The award of October 24, 1860, was its only escape from a peremptory and immediate ejectment. By that award, and the agreement on which it was founded, it exhibited an equity which properly reduced the judgment to a conditional one, and thus relieved the defendant from a total loss of its improvements. That the plaintiff had the right to maintain this suit there is no doubt. He was the owner of the legal title ; hence, was the proper person to <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>enforce tlie award.
