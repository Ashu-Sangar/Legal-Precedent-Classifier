And it is hereby agreed that said action shall be dismissed, and no other claims,” etc. Now, that is equivocal, to say the least.

[Then the question is, from all this evidence, whether that was a settlement not only of the suit, but a settlement of the claim of the plaintiff. The plaintiff denies that, here, and his oath, therefore, stands against the oath of the defendant; the one stands against the other. It is for you to reconcile this testimony; but if you cannot reconcile it, you will say whom you will believe. If you believe the testimony of the. plaintiff, he is entitled to a verdict for $70, with interest.] 8 If you believe the testimony of the defendant, who says that it was a settlement in full of the whole claim here, then the plaintiff cannot recover.....Therefore, the whole case is for you to determine, and you will say whether this defendant should have the $70, or how much he should have, or whether he owes for the interest from the time of the last transaction. [It is a question of fact for you under the evidence. There is no law in the case.] 3 We may say this: when a man owes, money, he is bound to pay it, unless he proves he has paid it.

Assuming that the agreement for acceptance contained in the receipt was duly authorized by the plaintiff, and that the $130 was paid in pursuance thereof, the contract would seem to have been fully executed between the parties, and as there was some sort of dispute existing at the time in reference to the plaintiff’s claim, we think the transaction might perhaps be sustained as a compromise and settlement of the plaintiff’s entire claim. There is no testimony, however, by the defendant, nor by any other witness,, that the writing was made by the personal direction or with the consent of Bernard Brockley. On the contrary, if the latter is believed, he never saw or had any knowledge of it whatever; he says that $130 was all the money the defendant had, that it was received in part payment only, and that tlio defendant said he would pay the balance. The whole case therefore rests upon the authority of Clark to make the composition, and all the authority he had was by virtue of the relation of attorney and client, which existed between him and Bernard Brockley.</p>
