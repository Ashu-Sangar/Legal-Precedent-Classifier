They therefore pray for an injunction to restrain the defendants from organizing as aforesaid, upon the grounds that the proposed action of the defendants will be .an illegal usurpation of the functions of the select and common councils of the city, and that, if they are permitted to proceed, great confusion will result in the government of the city, in levying and collecting its taxes, in maintaining law and order within its limits, and irreparable damage will result to the citizens in their persons and estates ; and, in short, the bill denies the right of the defendants, or any of them, to organize and act as councilmen of the city after the date mentioned.</p>

That the provisions of said act relating to the election and installation of .common and select councilmen cannot go into effect and become operative until the terms of all the members of the present council, in office at the date of the approval of the act, shall have fully expired, which will not be until the first Monday of April, 1890.</p>

The suggestions made in support of the second proposition are well worthy of consideration, but after a most patient study of the act we cannot escape the conclusion that it was intended to apply, not only to cities hereafter to be incorporated and to cities heretofore incorporated, operating under the act of 1874 and its supplements, but also to cities operating under special charters, and to repeal inconsistent laws whether general or special. There is strong reason for questioning whether the title of the act clearly expresses, and gives notice <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>of, all the subjects of legislation embraced in it, but we do not think this is true as to the particular provisions required to be considered in tins case. An entire act is not necessarily unconstitutional because its title fails to give notice of some particular matter contained therein : Dewhurst v. Allegheny, <a href="/pa/95/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="95 Pa. 437" data-case-ids="492967" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0437-01">95 Pa. 437</a>.

    <p class="summary" id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.4",294,[260,810,1190,1232]]]'>2. It is now too late to question the power of the legislature to classify cities according to population, and to legislate, upon some subjects at least, for each class separately: Wheeler v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/77/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="77 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="436265" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0338-01">77 Pa. 338</a>; Kilgore v.

It is argued, however, that such classification must be reasonable and justified by necessity, otherwise it will be in violation of § 7, article III., of the, constitution. But who is to decide as to the reasonableness of, and necessity for, the classification, and by what rule or standard are these questions to be determined ? Conceding it to be a matter resting primarily in the discretion of the legislature, is their discretion unlimited, and their judgment conclusive ? We think not. Where classification is carried to such an extreme as to leave no room for doubt, that, in purpose and effect, it is a mere cover for special legislation, we believe the courts have the power, and should declare that the constitutional limits have been passed. The question whether this is such an act is of the gravest importance, and no good purpose is to be served by postponing its decision, but, as we now view the case, it is not absolutely required to be made at the present time. Furthermore, while the inferior courts have the power, and in a plain case should exercise it, to declare an act unconstitutional, yet there is impropriety in doing so, except where the case is very clear and the emergency great.</p>

From all the deliverances of this court, the following propositions may be regarded as established: (1) Classification of cities and counties by population only, for purposes of legislation may be permitted in cases where actual and imperative necessity exists. (2) Legislation for such classes will be tolerated only when no member of the class is excluded. (3) The action of the legislature in passing classification acts is not conclusive on the question of the necessity for such acts.

The act of 1887 bears upon its front incontestible evidence of want of necessity in this: It groups four classes of cities, the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th, and with trifling exceptions makes the same law for all. If the same act is to apply to all, why then should not all be in the same class ? What excuse, or reason, or necessity, can be urged for separating cities that , can without separation be as well governed under one act ? That these cities can be governed by one law, is undeniable, because but one law is provided for them. The only departures from a general act covering all these classes, were introduced to cover special existing conditions in some cities, and thus remove objections to its passage: See article vm., § 1, which makes the number of councilmen representing a ward, different in cities of the 4th class, to accommodate Scranton city, the only 4th class city where they fear that the rule of representation applied to other cities might not suit them.</p>

Article ix. is certainly in violation of the constitution, both as special legislation on a subject upon which only general legislation is permissible, and also because the subject of schools is not alluded to in the title of the act. Article xix., entitled, Taxation and Municipal Claims, is also special legislation on the subject <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>of collecting taxes, creating and continuing liens, etc. But, admitting that the articles which are clearly unconstitutional might be eliminated without disturbing the remainder of the act, the point here made is, that this excessive classification can be sustained only on the ground of necessity, and that necessity must be found in the different wants of the different classes. Who can suggest a valid reason for a difference in the charters of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, Allentown and Reading, Carbondale and Corry, Easton and York? They aren all inland towns, inhabited by substantially the same kind of people, engaged in the same class of pursuits. The functions of city government are the same in all, — to open and grade streets, care for the public health, protect the public peace, and levy and collect from each inhabitant his share of the public burden, etc.</p>

Wilkes-Barre is a city of the 5th class under the act.

For reasons given at length in the opinion of its learned president, the court below rightly held it had not, — “ that the provisions of said act relating to the election and installation of select and common councilmen cannot go into effect and become operative until the terms of all the members of the present council, in office at the date of the approval of the act, shall have fully expired, which will not be until the first Monday of April, 1890.”</p>

That subject was also briefly considered; but, while the court appears to have inclined to the opinion that the act is unconstitutional and void, it was not deemed necessary to decide the question, because, for the reason above stated, the bill was prematurely brought and could not therefore, in any event, be sustained.</p>

On the contrary, it is distinctly recognized, for certain purposes. For example, article IX., section 1, declares, “All taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and shall be levied <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>and collected under general laws.” Thus, hy necessary implication, authority is given to classify property for the purpose of taxation, but by express mandate of the last clause above quoted, all taxes must be levied and collected under general and not special or local laws.</p>

This was by no means exceptional. The pernicious system of special legislation, practiced for many years before, had become so general and deep-rooted and the evils resulting therefrom so alarming, that the people of the commonwealth determined to apply the only remedy that promised any hope of relief. Doubtless, it was a proper appreciation of the magnitude of these evils, as much as anything else, that called into existence the convention that framed the present constitution and induced its adoption by an overwhelming vote. One of the manifest objects of that instrument was to eradicate that species of legislation, and substitute, in lieu of it, general laws whenever it was possible to do so. This is so clearly apparent that no unbiased mind can contemplate the 7th section of article III., and kindred provisions, without reaching thar conclusion. That section contains a schedule of nearly fifty prolific subjects of previous special and local legislation, and ordains that “ The general assembly shall not pass any local or special law ” relating to either of them. As an additional safeguard, in cases where special legislation is not expressly prohibited, the next section declares, “bio local or special bill shall be passed unless notice of the intention to apply therefor shall have been published,” etc.</p>

Repeated and pointed admonitions of that fact were given in subsequent cases involving the general subject. In 1878, an act was passed, the sole object of which was to provide specially for holding courts in the city of Titusville in the county of Crawford. For the purpose of individuating that city and county and limiting the operation of the act to them, without mentioning either by name, the following ingenious but deceptive periphrasis was employed: “ In all counties of this commonwealth where there is a population of more than sixty thousand inhabitants; and in which there shall be any city incorporated, at the time of the passage of this act, with a population exceeding eight thousand inhabitants, situate at a distance from the county seat of more than twenty-seven miles by the usually traveled public road, it shall be the duty of the president judge or additional law judge, or either of them, to make an order providing for the holding of one week of court, at each regular term of court for said county, for the trial of civil or criminal cases in said city.” In Commonwealth v.

In pronouncing that act also unconstitutional, this court said: “ It is no part of our business to discuss the wisdom of this legislation. However vicious in principle we might regard it, our plain duty is to enforce it, provided it is not in conflict with the fundamental law. It requires but a glance at the act to see that it is an attempt to evade the constitution. It is special legislation under the attempted disguise of a general law.

D.’s Appeal, supra, it was said by our brother Gkebn : “ All our recent decisions are to the effect that if local results either are or may be produced by a piece of legislation, it offends against ” the article prohibiting iocal or special legislation. In Philadelphia v. Haddington Church, <a href="/pa/115/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="115 Pa. 291" data-case-ids="551787" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0291-01">supra,</a> an act giving to a scire facias the effect of extending municipal liens in cities of the first class, was pronounced unconstitutional for similar reasons. In Weinman v. Railway Co., supra, it was held that an act providing for the incorporation and regulation of street railway companies, in cities of the second and third classes, was both special and local legislation and therefore unconstitutional, — special, because it relates to only a few of the general class known as <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>street railway companies, and local, in that its operations are confined to specified localities. In that case our brother Williams, referring to the subject of classification, said: “For purposes of local government the state is subdivided into counties, townships and other municipal and quasi municipal corporations. Each class of these subdivisions has purposes to subserve that are peculiar to it, and needs to be invested with the powers necessary to that end. Generally speaking, all the members of each class have the same local functions to perform. Classification, therefore, on that basis has been recognized, and a statute relating to all the townships, all the school districts, or all the members of any particular class of the municipal divisions of the state, has been held to be constitutional. It has been found desirable to divide cities into classes upon the basis of their population. The needs of a great city with half a million or more of people are somewhat different, in many respects, from the needs of a city with ten thousand. The organization of their local governments and the management of their municipal affairs will be quite unlike. Each of these classes requires legislation peculiar to itself, but such legislation must be applicable to all the members of the class to which it relates, and must be directed to the existence and regulation of municipal powers and local government.”</p>

On the contrary, the underlying principle of all' the cases is that classification, with the view of legislating for either class separately, is essentially unconstitutional, unless a necessity therefor exists, — a necessity springing from manifest peculiarities, clearly distinguishing those of one class from each of the other classes, and imperatively demanding legislation for each class, separately, that would be useless and detrimental to the others. Laws enacted in pursuance of such classification and for such purposes, are, properly speaking, neither local nor special. They are general laws, because they apply alike to all that are similarly situated as to their peculiar necessities. All legislation is necessarily based on a classification of its subjects, and when such classification is fairly made, laws enacted in conformity thereto cannot be properly charac<a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>terized as either local or special. A law prescribing the mode of incorporating all railroad companies is special, in the narrow sense' that it is confined in its operations to one kind of corporations only; and, by the same test, a law providing a single system for organization and government of boroughs in the state, would be a local law; but every one conversant with the meaning of those words, when used in that connection, would unhesitatingly pronounce such statutes general laws. But, as was said in Scowden’s Appeal, supra, “ classification which is grounded on no necessity and has for its sole object an evasion of the constitution ” is quite a different thing.</p>
    <p id="b306-5" data-blocks='[["BL_306.4",306,[227,911,1188,352]]]'>The purpose of the provision under consideration was not to limit legislation, but merely to prohibit the doing, by local or special laws, that which can be accomplished by general láws. It relates not to the substance, but to the method of legislation, and imperatively demands the enactment of general, instead of local or special laws, whenever the former are at all practicable.</p>
    <p id="b306-6" data-blocks='[["BL_306.5",306,[221,1272,1192,1129]],["BL_307.1",307,[209,343,1184,95]]]'>The act of 1874, dividing the cities of the state into three classes, viz.: those containing over three hundred thousand population, those containing less than three hundred thousand and" exceeding one hundred thousand, and those containing less than one hundred thousand and exceeding ten thousand, was sustained, as to such of its provisions as have been involved in adjudicated cases,, because it was considered within the spirit if not the letter of the constitution. As to the number of classes created, that act appears to have covered the entire ground of classification. It provided for all existing as well as every conceivable prospective necessity. It is impossible to suggest any legislation, that has or may hereafter become necessary for any member of either class, that cannot, without detriment to other members of same class, be made applicable to all of them. If classification had stopped where the act of 1874 left it, it would have been well; but it did not. Without the slightest foundation in necessity, the number of classes was soon increased to five, and afterwards to seven: and, if the vicious principle, on which that was done, be recognized by the courts, the number may at any time be further increased until it equals the number of cities in the commonwealth. The only possible purpose of such classifica<a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>tion is evasion of the constitutional limitation; and, as such, it ought to be unhesitatingly condemned.</p>
    <p id="b307-5" data-blocks='[["BL_307.4",307,[210,446,1195,1066]]]'>The fact that the extended classification of 1876, and more especially that of 1887, is unnecessary, and therefore unwarranted, is manifest from an inspection of the acts themselves. With very few and quite unimportant exceptions, the charter powers of the fourth to seventh classes, inclusive, under the latter act, are precisely similar. There is nothing in either of the points of difference that can possibly be regarded as essential. Aside from the improper consideration that five classes furnish greater facilities for special legislation than one class would do, there is nothing to prevent the last four classes from being included in the third class established by the act of 1874, which comprises all cities of more than ten and less than one hundred thousand population. Their needs are all so similar that no charter power required for either of them would be unnecessary or detrimental to any of the others. The larger cities of such a class, that is, a class embracing all cities over ten and less than one hundred thousand population, would doubtless require a larger representation in each branch of councils, but that of course would be easily regulated by the adoption of a suitable ward and population basis of representation.</p>
    <p id="b307-6" data-blocks='[["BL_307.5",307,[220,1532,1189,868]],["BL_308.1",308,[246,348,1189,134]]]'>Reference might also be made to several special provisions of the act of 1887, such as those relating to public schools, taxation and municipal claims, creation and continuance of tax liens, and sales of real estate therefor, etc., but it is unnecessary. In greater or less degree, they all offend against provisions prohibiting special legislation. In addition to that, the subject of public schools is not even hinted at in the title of the act. Moreover, school districts, as quasi corporations belonging to the public school system, have no necessary connection with municipal government. It is expressly required, as we have seen, that “ all taxes shall be levied and collected under general laws ; ” and, it is impossible to suggest any valid reason why they should not be thus levied and collected. When the present constitution was adopted, local and special laws relating to public schools, assessment and collection of taxes etc., were in force in some of the cities and remained unaffected by that instrument; but that fact will not justify the <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>substitution of other local or special laws in their stead. When new legislation is resorted to, it must conform to the requirements of the constitution.</p>
    <p id="b308-5" data-blocks='[["BL_308.4",308,[243,501,1192,558]]]'>It has been suggested that such provisions of the classification acts, as are not in harmony with the constitution, may be eliminated without destroying other provisions thereof; but, that is no answer to the crowning vice of unnecessary and excessive classification which stands out in bold relief on the face of both acts, and of which nearly all their provisions are predicated. Those acts doubtless contain many wise and wholesome provisions, but they are so interwoven with and dependent on others that are unconstitutional and void, that neither of the acts of 1876 or 1887 can be sustained, even in part.</p>
    <p id="b308-6" data-blocks='[["BL_308.5",308,[239,1068,1192,1331]],["BL_309.1",309,[218,348,1198,1025]]]'>It has also been suggested that the question of necessity for classification and the extent thereof, as well as of what are local or special laws, is a legislative and not a judicial question. The answer to that is obvious. The people, in their wisdom, have seen fit not only to prescribe the form of enacting laws, but also as to certain subjects, the method of legislation, by ordaining that no local or special law relating to those subjects shall be passed. Whether, in any given case, the legislature has transcended its power and passed a law in conflict with that limitation is essentially a question of law and must necessarily be decided by the courts. To warrant the conclusion that the people, in ordaining such limitations, intended to invest their law-makers with judicial power and thus make them final arbiters of the validity of their own acts, would require the clearest and most emphatic language to that effect. No such intention is expressed in the constitution, and none can be inferred from any of its provisions. That those limitations were designed to establish a fixed and permanent rule cannot be doubted; but, if the ultimate application of that rule were to rest solely in the judgment of the body on which it was intended to operate, nothing could be more flexible. As was well said in Pell v. Newark, <a href="/njl/40/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="40 N.J.L. 71" data-case-ids="356131" data-case-paths="/njl/40/0071-01">40 N. J. L. 71</a>, 80: “ No standard could be established by which the law-maker could be guided, and what’ might be rejected at one session as improper might become a law at. the next, and thus the rule would fluctuate with the ever changing membership of that body. The valid<a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>ity of an act would depend not so much upon the fixed rule of the constitution as upon the liberality or strictness with which successive legislatures, under the pressure of local influences, might determine to interpret the restraint upon their own action. . . . : . That the legislature would act in good faith, must be presumed. Purity of motive and a desire to keep within the prescribed limitations must be conceded to its members at all times; but that the people should have deliberately framed and imbedded in their organic law a provision to prohibit special legislation where general laws might be passed, and, at the same time, should have intended to put legislative action beyond review, where there was a clear infraction of the prohibition, is a proposition to which it seems impossible to assent.” No such proposition can be entertained by the courts without abandoning one of the most important branches of jurisdiction committed to them by the fundamental law, viz.: the power to ultimately determine whether or not a given law is local or special and has been passed in disregard of the constitutional limitation that has been placed upon the power of the legislature.</p>
