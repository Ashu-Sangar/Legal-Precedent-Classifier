It is not denied that there is an express direction to sell, contained in the will, and that it produced, therefore, a constructive conversion; yet it was a conversion not “ to all intents,” hut only for the purposes of the will. There are no words indicating a disposition of his estate other than according to the provisions of the will, and there is no residuary legatee ; nor is there any indicated intention that, on the failure of any o£ its provisions, the will is “to prevail as between the persons on whom the law casts the real and personal property of an intestate.” We submit that it is the general rule that “ if the proceeds of real estate directed to be sold be disposed of in a certain event which does not happen, the beneficial interest comprised in the contingent gift which thus fails devolves to the heir.”</p>

In the will before the court, two of the bequests, comprising three fourths of the whole estate, were upon contingencies which did not happen. The bequest to Adeline of one half the proceeds failed, because she took the bond in preference to the bequest. Clearly, taking the whole will together, there was an intestacy as to this part of the estate. And so also, the bequest to the widow was upon a contingency, to wit, her right to accept or refuse, and as she infused the contingency did not happen and there was an intestacy as to the bequest to her. If this be so, there being no residuary legatee, and no one to take except under the intestate laws, then the plaintiff takes his interest in the estate of the widow under the intestate laws and not under the will. And there was no merger of his interest in the widow’s estate by the deed of the executors to Jacob Leiser, through whom defendant claims title, as the law made it subject to her estate. The statutory share of the widow was not only a charge in her favor for the annuity but also for the principal sum, for those entitled under the intestate laws: Jarman on Wills, ed. 1850, 214; Dougherty v.

The error, as we conceive it, in plaintiff’s contention, arises from a misconception of the effect of the widow’s election not to take under her husband’s will, and of the nature of <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>her interest or estate in the lands of the testator in consequence of such election, and the plaintiff’s rights with respect to such interest or estate.

Sullivan, the testator named in the History of the Case, to recover from the terre-tenant the principal, sum charged on the land of the testator as the share of his widow, in lieu of dower.” From this statement, read in connection with the will, it is clear that the plaintiff had no case at all, and that the court properly directed a verdict for the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b165-6" data-blocks='[["BL_165.8",165,[187,1020,1184,656]]]'>“ I give and bequeath,” is the languages of the will, “ the income of the remaining one fourth of my estate to my beloved wife Sarah, during her natural life.” “ I will and bequeath that after the decease of my said wife that the said one fourth part of my estate, the income of which was bequeathed to her, go to my son William,” etc. The testator further directs, that his executors shall, as soon as they conveniently can after his decease, “ sell and dispose of all my personal and real estate to such person or persons, and for such price or prices as may reasonably he gotten for the same,” conferring upon them at the same time the power to make deeds and conveyances for the said property when so «sold as directed.</p>
    <p id="b165-7" data-blocks='[["BL_165.9",165,[191,1693,1181,459]]]'>ISTow the devise of the one fourth was of the whole estaie, whether real or personal, for and during the widow’s life, and, without more, she would have taken a life estate in the said one fourth of the land, and the remainder would pass at her death to William. On this, however, the plaintiff does not and cannot insist, for she refused to take under the will, and in consequence retained her statutory dower, which being; merely a life estate was necessarily extinguished at her death, and could go over to no one.</p>
    <p id="b165-8" data-blocks='[["BL_165.10",165,[193,2158,1182,253]],["BL_166.1",166,[265,343,1188,705]]]'>How then this devise to Sarah Sullivan could by any possibility be and remain a charge on the testator’s land, after slio had renounced, is to us incomprehensible. But even had she not renounced, it is certain that the testator did not intend to charge this devise on the realty, and this because, had ho so <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>intended, he would not have imperatively directed his executors to convert his whole estate into money. There is no condition annexed to the direction to sell: “I do order and direct my executors hereafter named shall.....sell and dispose of all my personal and real estate.” Hence, it is clear that by the terms of the will there was a conversion; the whole estate became personalty, and as such the executors were bound to dispose of it. What, then, remains is this : when the executors sold to William A. Leiser, the grantor of the defendant, they, so far as the will and its devises were concerned, sold the unincumbered fee ; but, as the widow had renounced, and retained her statutory dower, Leiser took subject to her life estate in the one third of the premises, which life estate expired at her death.

    <p id="b166-7" data-blocks='[["BL_166.4",166,[263,1067,1187,507]]]'>We have not adverted to the agreement between Dr. Marr and Leiser, for it in no wise concerns the issue. Marr agreed that the widow’s dower should be deducted from the last payment coming to him, but that was a matter between themselves, with which the estate of Sullivan had nothing to do, and by which it could not be affected. On the other hand, the executors, Henderson and Candor, for the full consideration of six thousand three hundred and fifty dollars, by a deed in fee and without condition of any kind, conveyed, as by the will they were empowered to do, the land to Leiser.</p>
    <p id="Ap" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[912,1584,488,44]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
