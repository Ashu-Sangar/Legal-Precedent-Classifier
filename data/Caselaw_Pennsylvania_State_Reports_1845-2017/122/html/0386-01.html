These cases consider the act of congress of 1792 as it affects steamships engaged in commerce between the states, and are manifestly dealing with a different subject from that now before us. . They decide that a steamship owned and registered in New York and engaged in carrying freight and passengers between New York and other states, or between ports in other states, may not be taxed by such other states, and rest their reasoning upon the act of Congress and the commercial clause of the federal constitution. No such state of facts is now presented. The scows and dredges in question are not engaged in commerce and are not among the ships or vessels required to be registered by the act of 1792. They, and the tug which moves them, are merely tools, and like other personal property may at one time be used within the state, and may at another be used beyond its limits. We can see no difference in principle between the case in hand and those to be found in the note to 5 Pa. C. C. R., 90. The question would be the same if the defendant’s business were to excavate upon land and not under water. The scoops and shovels in the former would correspond to the scows and dredges in the latter, for all these implements are simply means by'which excavation is done, and it would seem clear under the authorities just referred to, that the capital stock of an excavation company, representing that part of its plant employed for example in Iowa, would not be taxable in this commonwealth. The fact that scows and dredges must be moved and used upon the water, does not change their character as tools or make them “ ships or vessels ” within the act of 1792.</p>

This is not because of the technical principle that the situs of personal property is where the domicil of the owner is found. This rule is doubtless true as to intangi<a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>ble property such as bonds, mortgages, and other evidences of debt. Bub the better opinion seems to be that it does not hold in the case of visible tangible personal property permanently located in another state. In such cases, it is taxable within the jurisdiction where found and is exempt at the domicil of the owner. Goods and chattels, horses, cattle, and other movable property of a visible or tangible character are liable to taxation in the jurisdiction of the state wherein the same are, and are ordinarily kept, irrespective of the residence or domicil of the owner. Legal protection.and taxation are reciprocal, so that such personal property and effects of a corporeal nature, or that may be handled and removed, as receive the protection of the law are liable to be taxed by the law where they are thus protected: Borer on Inter-state Law, 204, and cases there cited; Potter on Corporations, §§ 189, 190; Pierce on Railroads, 472. No fault is found with this principle, but does it apply to the facts of this case ?</p>
    <p id="b415-4" data-blocks='[["BL_415.5",415,[187,1240,1194,864]]]'>It must be conceded that the property in question must be liable to taxation in some jurisdiction. If it were permanently located in another state, it would be liable to taxation there. But the facts show that it is not permanently located out of the state. From the nature of the business, it is in one place to-day and in another to-morrow, and, hence, not taxable in the jurisdiction where temporarily employed. It follows that if not taxable here, it escapes altogether. The rule as to vessels engaged in foreign or inter-state commerce is that their situs for the purpose of taxation is their home port of registry, or the residence of their owner, if unregistered: Pullman Palace Car Co., <a href="/citations/?q=29%20F.%2066" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="29 F. 66">29 Fed.

These vessels, if they may be so called, were not registered. Hence, their situs for taxation is the domicil of the owners.
