There has been no act passed since then, evincing a change of purpose in the legislative mind regarding it.

Experience in enforcing these classes of laws shows the necessity of using general terms in legislating thereon, so that it shall be unnecessary to allege in the indictment and prove upon trial the sale of any particular kind of liquor. If a sale be proven of a kind of liquor embraced within either of the general classifications contained in the act, that is a violation of the law. If the act in terms prohibited the sale, for instance, of whiskey, gin, ale, beer, wine or cider, it would be necessary ' to charge and prove the sale of the particular kind of liquor. But under such a law as that of May 13, 1887, P. L., 108, under which this prosecution was had, prohibiting in general terms the sale without a license of vinous, spirituous, malt or brewed liquors, an indictment such as the present would undoubtedly be sustained by proof of sale of either whiskey, brandy, gin, ale, beer or wine : State v.

The term vinous liquors, is used to cover that large class of intoxicating liquors which are not the product of the distillery or brewery.

Without stopping to refine upon the meaning of the word “ intoxicating,” or the degree of alcoholic admixture which is necessary to render any liquid intoxicating, it is only necessary to say that the intoxicating quality is not the one which is prohibited by the act, and hence an issue upon that question does not arise under the indictment. If however any liquor which is sold without license, is either vinous or spirituous, it comes within the prohibition of the act. But the question whether cider is vinous or spirituous is not a question of law to be decided by the court, but a question of fact to be determined by the jury. Of course if there is no evidence on the trial that a liquor is either vinous or spirituous, malt or brewed, it would be the duty of the court to say so to the jury and direct an acquittal for that reason. But if there is evidence on that subject, more than a scintilla, it is for the jury and not. for the court to decide upon it.</p>

Note. The word was formerly used to signify the juice of other fruits and other kinds of strong liquor except wine, but it is now appropriated to the juice of apples before and after fermentation.” Certainly in common acceptation cider is not understood to be either a vinous or a spirituous beverage, yet when fermented it doubtless. contains a percentage of alcohol sufficient to bring it within the fair meaning of the term “ vinous ; ” and, although not the product of distillation, it may, when mixed with spirituous liquor and sold in that condition under the name of eider, be regarded as “ spirituous ” within the meaning of the prohibition.</p>

We think there was evidence sufficient to carry to the jury the question whether the cider sold by the defendant was a vinous or spirituous liquor. We attach no importance to the argument adduced from a consideration of other acts of assembly. This is a criminal statute and must be strictly construed. If the article sold was a vinous or spirituous liquor the defendant was guilty; if not, he was innocent and should be acquitted: but whether it was or not, was a question for the jury and not for the court. We do not mean to intimate that the mere unfermonted juice of the apple is in any circumstances to be regarded as either a vinous ox spirituous liquor, but we do not know and cannot say, as matter of law, that its character may not be so changed by fermentation as to bring it within the meaning of the term “ vinous.” Of course an admixture with spirits might render the compound “ spirituous.”</p>
