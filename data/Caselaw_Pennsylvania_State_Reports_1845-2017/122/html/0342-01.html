Of the purchase money, $7,000 was paid in cash and for the balance twenty-eight joint and several bonds in $500 each were executed and delivered by the grantees secured by a joint mortgage of the same date in the penal sum of $28,000.

R. Eby. It was then shown by the record of a suit to No. 170 January Term 1878, J. R. Eby, for use of Christian Long, against W. K. Cowden, that on October 4, 1880, in an action of debt upon one of these three bonds, a verdict and judgment had been had by the defendant, upon the ground that after the execution and delivery of the bonds and mortgage the grantees of the land had been compelled by proceedings at law to yield to the assertion of an easement of way over the property under a grant made by the plaintiffs in 1859, the damages to the grantees therefrom being in excess of the amount due upon the bond sued on. This record also showed that during the trial of the case, the pleas <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>of defalcation or set-off, and payment with leave, were withdrawn, and the plea of failure of consideration substituted. The defendants in the present case then gave in evidence the grant of a right of way over the lot from the grantors in the deed (the grantees in the mortgage), executed and acknowledged December 13,1859, and duly recorded; also the records of certain actions of trespass against the grantees in the deed (the grantors in the mortgage), brought in 1872 and resulting in judgments against the defendants therein, establishing the right of way over the premises twenty feet wide opening on Market street. They then offered evidence of the injury to the lot caused by the existence of the private way, when the plaintiffs objected, and interposed evidence to sustain the objection, that the verdict and judgment in Eby for use of Long against Cowden, No. 170 January Term 1878, was a bar to the offer made as a defence in this case. The objection was overruled. The defendants then adduced evidence of damage to the property' from the existence of the easement, and rested.</p>

They called Lerue Metzgar, who testified that in 1870 or 1871, he had to do with the negotiations between the plaintiffs and defendants for the purchase of the lot; that a contract was prepared, but unexecuted because the proposed purchasers had learned of the existence of the right of way ; and, that an adjustment was reached by a deduction of $1,000 or $1,500 made from the purchase money as first fixed upon, when the conveyance, the mortgage and bonds, were delivered for a consideration less the deduction made. Witnesses had testified for the defendants that the existence of the easement was not an injury to the property. It was then shown by the plaintiffs that after the verdict and judgment, in the action of Eby for use of Long against Cowden, No. 170 January Term 1878, there being then $6,000 of the bonds outstanding, Mr. Cowden, .owning the lot bound by the mortgage securing them, made a proposition, as follows:</p>

It was laid out in favor of the land lying to the westward, and imposed upon the Cow-den lot what is known as a servitude, — that is the legal name of it — a burden put upon this lot in favor of the others. It is in evidence, and it is not seriously denied, that from that time, or shortly afterwards, at least, — the date is a matter the jury must determine, — the road was in actual use upon the ground, and that from that time on it has been continuously in use by the persons occupying these other lots to the westward, — perhaps by others, but certainly by them.

Mr. Metzgar has testified that during the pendency of the negotiations between Mr. Cowden and his associates and the gentlemen who owned the property, the existence of this road was talked about, and that Cowden and his associates refused to take it at the price which had been suggested, insisting that some deduction must be made. Mr. Metzgar then goes on to say that an allowance of $1,000 or $1,500 was made for this road, and thereupon a deed was made, and mortgage, etc., executed. Upon that there is some testimony. There are among other things, certain declarations said to have been made by Mr. Eby, admitting that before the deed was executed Mr. Cowden and his associates had been assured that there was no road. This, of course, is in contradiction with the view as asserted by Mr. Metzgar, and if there be any other testimony bearing on that point, the jury must consider it. You must determine how that fact is, and we say to you that if upon the evidence you find that an allowance was made for this road, and that $1,000 or $1,500 was thrown off for the injury which it did to the property, then the defendant cannot set up again that defence in this suit, and the plaintiff is entitled to recover one thousand dollars, with interest from the date from which it begins to run. In other words, if the story told by Mr. Metzgar is true, the. plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount of the two bonds. If you find it is not true, then you come to the question, what was the condition of the ground at the time of the deed; what was the condition of this road at the time this deed was made ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b370-5" data-blocks='[["BL_370.4",370,[249,1860,1188,560]],["BL_371.1",371,[190,372,1182,97]]]'>. There is testimony that in 1871 this road was plainly marked upon the ground as a road in actual use. That would of course put anybody desiring to purchase the property upon notice that there was such a road there; that probably there was that incumbrance there, and then, if a deed was made without any reference to the road, without any express agreement against it or any promise to be responsible for the damage it might cause, there would be no remedy. That is, no remedy under the implied contract arising from the words, grant, bargain and sell. In other words, if you find from all the evidence that that road was plainly marked upon the ground, showing <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>it to be a burden upon this property, an easement upon the ground, the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b371-5" data-blocks='[["BL_371.4",371,[193,475,1191,1079]]]'>If, however, that was not so, then you come to the other question in the case, and that other question is simply the question of how much. For if the property was taken without the notice I have spoken of, then there is a covenant in the deed against any such incumbrance as a road would be. It was broken, and then the question would be how much should be paid by the grantors, the people who made the deed; and, of course, the answer to that is found when you answer the question, how much actual damage was done. That will be the first question, when you come to the question of damages, to be determined, and that will be answered by answering this question: What was the value of the property without the road, and what was the value of the property with the road on it; and the difference between these two sums would represent the injury, and that you must estimate as of the time when the road was taken, when the right to have the road was enforced and the defendants were compelled to give up that much of the property for the use of the road; and, since the evidence is uncontradicted as to the use from that time down to the present, we say they should also be allowed interest upon that sum from that time to the present.</p>

It took the form of a proposition from Mr. Cowden, and the uncontradicted evidence in the case is that it was accepted by three of the gentlemen named in this mortgage, viz.: Mr. J. D. Cameron and Mr. Zimmerman, who held the legal title to the bonds which Mr. Cameron and Mr. Calder owned. As I said, the proposition was accepted by these three interests and carried out. Therefore we say, that this paper was a settlement of the difference then existing with reference to this road, between Mr. Cowden and these three interests. It says, “I propose as a compromise” to do certain things, and that proposition was accepted. Now there is not a particle of evidence in the case to show that there was any other litigation except that arising out of the construction of <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>this road, and we say to you that this compromise was a settlement of the difficulty arising out of this road.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b372-5" data-blocks='[["BL_372.4",372,[257,462,1191,1594]]]'>I do not want to be understood as saying that there could be an apportionment of these bonds under a defence of this kind. The parties themselves apportioned, and it is not we who are now doing it, but simply declaring, in the interpretation of this agreement, what they themselves actually did. This did not affect Mr. Eby, because he did not agree to it. His name does not appear and he is not bound bj^ it; neither can he set it up in his own behalf. Therefore, as I understand the matter, if any damages could be set up by Mr. Cowden, the one fourth part of it would be available to him as against the bonds now in suit. That is, it would be available if it is more than the amount which he has already had the benefit of. You recollect that a suit was brought by Christian Long who was an assignee of another of these bonds, and in that suit this same defence was set up. That was a bond of Mr. Eby. The bonds were drawn in a peculiar way, and instead of being made to all the grantors, they were made to the grantors separately. Mr. Simon Cameron got so many, Mr. Calder got so many, and the rest all having the same amount. In the trial upon this bond of Christian Long, this defence was set up, and there was a verdict for the defendant; that is, he got the benefit or just as much as was due upon that bond. That is a simple calculation, and amounted to some seven hundred dollars. Therefore, if the one fourth part does not exceed the sum of seven hundred odd dollars, there is nothing to be set up in this suit, and the defendant would be.entitled to recover one thousand dollars, with’ interest, from that date. If the one fourth part is greater than the sum of this seven hundred odd dollars, the excess can be set up against the claim here, and if that be as much as the whole claim of the plaintiff, then the verdict goes for the defendant.</p>

It was both admitted and proved that the defendant in the suit of Eby for use of Long had defeated a recovery by setting up the existence of the same easement. If an action of covenant be brought upon an article of agreement for the sale of land, to recover a part of the purchase money due when suit is brought, and defendant sets up as a defence defect of title because of incumbrances, he cannot set up the same matter of defence in a subsequent action for the residue of the purchase money: Kane v.

But the plaintiffs introduced witnesses to prove an open, notorious roadway used continuously from 1859 to 1871, and that therefore the defendants knew of the incumbrance when they purchased. Under the testimony the defendants could not say otherwise than that the plaintiffs broke the covenants of their deed, but it by no means followed that the defendants purchased with a knowledge of the incumbrance ; this was a question for the jury, and the instructions were favorable to the plaintiffs. Moreover, it was in evidence that at least two of the grantors, one of whom was the plaintiff, believed and asserted that the road had no existence.

The consideration of the conveyance was $21,000, one third in hand, and the residue, $14,000, evidenced by twenty-eight bonds of $500 each, secured by the mortgage in suit. Seven of the bonds were made payable to each of the four vendors individually, as his share of the deferred purchase money.</p>

In the meantime the mortgage debt was reduced to $6,000, represented by three $500 bonds to each of the four mortgagees. Further payments having been refused, suit was brought on one of the bonds in the name of the payee, Jacob R. Eby, against Wm. K. Cowden, one of the obligors, who by conveyance from his three co-tenants had become sole owner of the mortgaged premises. The pleadings were so amended before verdict that the sole defence was failure of consideration, resulting from the easement above mentioned. The result was a verdict for defendant and judgment thereon. Matters then remained in statu quo until January, 1882, when Cowden, then sole owner of the lot, proposed to the several bondholders to settle their dispute as to failure <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>of consideration, etc., by paying the face of the eleven outstanding bonds, without interest. This proposition was accepted by three of the bondholders, and thus nine of the bonds were paid; but the holder of the two remaining bonds, both payable to Jacob R. Eby, declined to accept the proposition of compromise. In the meantime Mr. Eby died, and these bonds, which had been assigned by him, were re-assigned to his administrator, and this suit was brought to recover the $1,000 (two bonds of $500 each), residue'-'of purchase money and interest. On the trial, the defence and evidence in support thereof were substantially the same as in the suit on the $500 bond above mentioned, and the result was also the same, viz.: a general verdict in favor of defendants, mortgagors, and judgment thereon.</p>

This point was substantially affirmed, the learned judge saying: “ If the jury find from the evidence that at the time of the purchase the land was openly and plainly subject to this easement; that the physical condition of the ground was openly and plainly affected thereby, then, since' there is no express agreement or covenant relating thereto, the continuance of the easement would not be a breach of the covenant against incumbrances, and plaintiffs would be entitled to recover $1,000 and interest thereon.” In the general charge he also said: “ There is testimony that in 1871 this road was plainly marked upon the ground as a road in actual use. That would, of course, put anybody desiring to purchase the property upon notice that there was such a road there; that probably there was that incumbrance there, and then, if the deed was made without any reference to the road, without any express agreement against it, or any promise to be responsible for the damage it might cause, there would be no remedy; that is, no remedy under the implied contract arising from the words, 4 grant, bargain, and sell.’ In other words, if you find from all . the evidence that the road was plainly marked upon the ground, <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>showing it to be a burden on this property, an easement upon the ground, the plaintiff is entitled to recover. If, however, you find it was not so, then you come to the other question in the case,” viz.: the question of damages or compensation for failure of consideration, etc. The attention of the jury had previously been called to the declarations of Mr. Eby, “ admitting that before the deed was executed, Mr. Cowden and his associates had been assured that there was no road,” and other evidence bearing on the question.
