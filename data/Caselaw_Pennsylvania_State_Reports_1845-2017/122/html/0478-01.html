The second question is raised here for the first time. In the former case, it was held that under the deed from John Carmichael to Aaron Carmichael dated April 16, 1854, the grantee took the land in a special, active trust, and hence the deed from Phoebe and Elijah Thompson, the cestuis que trust, was inoperative. This decision was affirmed on writ of error by the Supreme Court.</p>

The learned counsel for plaintiff asks a contrary ruling, and cites in support of his position certain authorities, the strongest in his favor being Keyser’s App., <a href="/pa/57/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="57 Pa. 236" data-case-ids="1010394" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0236-01">57 Pa. 236</a>. That was a case where a testator devised an estate in fee simple, with all the incidents of ownership in the cestuis que trust, but provided that it should not be liable for their debts. This was held to be a dry trust, and the provisions as to debts fell. In this case there is an equitable interest for life given to Phcebe Thompson and her husband. Elijah, with contingent remainder to the heirs of the body of Phoebe. .For as the heirs of the body of Phoebe could not take by inheritance the entire estate limited to Phoebe and Elijah Thompson, the rule in Shelley’s case would not apply: 1 Washb. on Real Prop., 105, et seq. *77, *78, *79. Hence this case is within the distinction recognized in Keyser’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=57%20Pa.%20241" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="57 Pa. 241">57 Pa. 241</a>. But aside from the distinction, the facts of the case at bar are covered by the later decisions of the Supreme Court in Rife v. Geyer, <a href="/pa/59/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="59 Pa. 393" data-case-ids="426935" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0393-01">59 Pa. 393</a>; Phila. Trust etc. Co. v.

To say nothing of the affirmance of the opinion rendered on these identical facts, if the deed from John Carmichael to Aaron Carmichael created an active trust, the seisin would be in the trustee: 2 Washb. Real Prop., 457, 488. The cestuis que trust would not, strictly speaking, have an estate : Pomeroy’s Equity, §§ 153, 374, but the legal title, not being affected by the statute, would remain in the trustee. Hence the deed from Phcebe and Elijah Thompson to John Carmichael, being an attempt on the part of the grantors to convey an estate which they did not have, was invalid.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b506-6" data-blocks='[["BL_506.5",506,[260,1143,1192,1167]]]'>In considering this question it is to be borne in mind that there was no implied trust under the conveyance to John Carmichael made in 1858. That deed was not made by the trustee, but by the cestuis que trust, and was in effect an assertion of the latter’s right to convey and denial of the trustee’s title. It was in proper form to convey the estate, if that had been in the cestuis que trust. But its operation was prevented for the very reason that the estate, and the seisin incident to it, were in the trustee. When John Carmichael took possession of the land under this deed it was a disseisin of the trustee. He had an immediate right of entry in order to protect the land for the trust. It is true the cestuis que trust had an interest, but it was one they could work out only through the trustee. They had no remedy except to procure the trustee to bring an action upon his legal title to recover possession: 1 Perry on Trusts, § 346. But they, as well as the trustee, apparently recognizing John Carmichael’s title, neglected to disturb Ms possession until long after twenty-one years had run from the time it began. After this length of time the trustee’s right of entry was gone under the statute of March 26, 1785, 2 Sm. L. 300, and as the interest of the cestuis que trust was dependent upon the right of the trustee to recover possession, it would likewise be lost.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b506-7" data-blocks='[["BL_506.6",506,[269,2328,1184,95]],["BL_507.1",507,[164,385,1198,1070]]]'>This question is hardly open, in view of what was said in Smilie v. Biffle, <a href="/pa/2/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="951222" data-case-paths="/pa/2/0052-01">2 Pa. 52</a>. There a defective conveyance of <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>land was made by one of several trustees. The cestuis que trust for life was a feme covert. Possession was taken and maintained for the length of time required by the act of 1785 to give title. On suit brought, after the death of the feme covert, by a child who was a cestui que trust in remainder, the point was submitted, “ That if Jane Craig, the feme covert, died within the twenty-one years, the plaintiff could recover.” But the Supreme Court said in reply: “When the cestui que trust and trustee are both out of possession, for the time limited, the party in possession has a good bar against both. It would strike me to be an anomaly that the owner of the legal estate should be barred, and the owner of the equitable title, whether his interest be an interest in possession or by way of remainder, should, nevertheless, be entitled to enter. Equity follows the law, and courts of equity have adopted the act of limitations by analogy. If a trustee is negligent of his duty (as he may be), the cestui que trust is not without remedy. That there are exceptions in favor of infants in cases of implied trusts may be conceded. But this is not a case of that description, and there is nothing to exempt it from the operations of the rule.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b507-5" data-blocks='[["BL_507.4",507,[179,1475,1190,653]]]'>This decision was recognized and affirmed in Mans v.

The ground of it takes in this case; for il' the interest of a cestuis que trust in remainder would not survive an adverse possession, maintained against the trustee for twenty-one years, neither would the interest of a cestuis que trust for life, even though she were feme covert. It follows that the defendant has lost her interest in the land in suit. The justice of this conclusion is made clear by the fact that defendant conveyed the land to defendant’s ancestor in title in 1858, for a valuable consideration, to wit: $300, presumably all it was then worth. Judgment is accordingly given in favor of plaintiff and against defendant for the land described in the writ and costs.</p>

It was held to he an active trust and the title in the trustee. The defendant was a feme covert when she executed the deed of January, 1858, and remained so until December, 1888, when her husband died. She then had and now has heirs of her body living. The sole question before this court in this controversy is whether the possession of the plaintiff and those under whom he claims, continued for twenty-one years and upwards, would give title under the statute of limitations of March 26, 1785. It is claimed by the plaintiff in error that <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>the possession must be continued during thirty years, under the act of April 22, 1856. The learned judge of the court below held that title was acquired under the former statute, and in this he was clearly right. The legal title was in the trustee &lt;5f Phoebe Thompson. Both he and she, through him, had a remedy at law to assert and maintain her rights. The possession of John Carmichael under the deed of 1858, was a disseisin of the trustee, and being kept up for twenty-one years it ripened into a perfect title. So far as Phoebe was concerned, she was really under no disability; she could look to her trustee, and-through him regain her lost possession within the proper time. In the case of Huffman v. Huffman, <a href="/pa/118/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="118 Pa. 58" data-case-ids="556743" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0058-01">118 Pa. 58</a>, cited by the learned counsel, there was no trustee, and the legal disability existed as contemplated and guarded by the act of 1856.</p>
