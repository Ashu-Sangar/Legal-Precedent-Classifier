The plaintiff’s claim is based upon the position that a testamentary guardian is not a guardian of the estates of the minors, but only of their persons ; and that Mrs. Sullivan being guardian only of the persons of her children, could not receive their estates as guardian, and hence the testator in directing that the money should be paid to her could not have meant, to her as guardian of the estates of his children, and therefore must have meant her individually. To this there are two complete answers. The first is the language of the will itself. The direction is to “ pay the proceeds over to my wife, Susan Catharine, to be held by her as guardian of our children.” It is evident from this language, even if it be taken in connection with what immediately follows in the will,, that the testator was not making provision for his wife alone, but for his children. It is immaterial that she is called “guardian.” She might have been called trustee, protector, curator, or any other name which would have expressed the thought that she was to hold for their use. That is the thought which he most certainly intended to express ; and, if it be conceded that she was not and could not be the guardian, in its technical-sense, of her children, yet it remains evident that the money was to be held by her for the use of her children. That being evident, the money when paid to her, could not become her own absolutely, but should have been held for the children under the other directions in the will. The second answer is-that a testamentary guardian is a guardian of the estate of the ward, devised or bequeathed by that testator. The 8th and 9th sections of the statute of 12 Charles II., c. 24, was reported by the judges to be in force in Pennsylvania. The 9th section of that statute has not been supplied or repealed. It enacts. <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>“ that such person or persons to whom the custody of such child or children hath been or shall be so disposed or devised, shall and may take into his or their custody, to the use of such child or children, the profits of all lands, tenements and hereditaments of such child or children ; and also the custody, tuition and management of the goods, chattels and personal estate of such child or children.” See this statute and the decisions under it in Robert’s Digest, 812* to 815*. This is the recognized law in Pennsylvania : Hollingsworth’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=51%20Pa.%20521" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="51 Pa. 521">51 Pa. 521</a>.</p>

But it does not follow that when she took the deed from Charles McCandless as executor, the equitable title to the lauds vested at once in her children. There is no evidence, and no claim, that when the conveyance was made to her there was any actual purpose on her part or on the part of the executor to defraud the children. The deed was made under the mistaken belief that she was entitled to the proceeds of the sale of the land in her own right. and hence that she could take the land in lieu of its proceeds. If there was fraud in the transaction it was a legal fraud. But whether legal or actual, the result is perhaps not changed by that fact. She had a right to the proceeds of the sale of this land, to be “ used in such judicious manner as she may deem most beneficial to herself and her children.” Now, it might, well be that she might deem that part of the fund could be most judiciously used by investing it in real estate, not for the purpose of acquiring the title to the land for her children, instead of the money, but as an investment, the land to be again sold and the money obtained for the children. I do not mean that she intended to do that, but only that she might have intended it. Our inquiry now is, whether she could invest the money in land, by a purchase, or take land instead of the money, without the equitable title to the land becoming vested in the children. The fact that she took land from the executor instead of the money, would not have any other effect in this case than would have resulted had she received from him the money which she believed to be her own and with it puichased land. If she had done that — had used money which in <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>fact belonged to her wards in purchasing land in her own name and then had learned that it was a misappropriation of the money, it is difficult to see why she could not have resold the land, repossessed herself of the money and thereby righted the wrong she had done.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b666-4" data-blocks='[["BL_666.4",666,[240,600,1195,1582]]]'>When a trustee purposely buys land with a trust fund which he has no right to use in such a way, and thereby commits an intentional fraud, it does not follow that the title to the land so bought vests, as a matter of law, in the cestui que trust. It is true that if he be sui juris he may elect to take the land, but he may also elect not to take it, and in that case the title remains in the trustee. It is not the fact of the purchase by the trustee fraudulently, but the fact of the election by the cestui que trust that gives him the title. His right is to have the money, and he cannot be deprived of that right, or forced to take land in lieu of the money without his consent, and he cannot have both. That is, he cannot take the land and also compel the trustee to pay him the money. When one pays money for the purpose of buying land, and the title is taken to another, a trust always results, because it is presumed that he who purposely pays for the land intends to own it. But that is not our case. Here the trustee took a conveyance of the land in her own name instead of the trust fund, and there could not be, properly speaking, a resulting trust, but a constructive trust after the cestui que trust should elect to make it such. Between these there is a substantial difference. “ In the former, the trustee will be compelled to execute the trust by a conveyance of the land; in the latter, chancery will raise the money out of the land by a sale of the whole or such part of it as may be necessary to produce the sum withdrawn from the fund.” See opinion of Gibson, J., in Wallace v. Duffield, 2 S. &amp; R. 529. If chancery would raise the money improperly invested by a sale of the land, can it be that the trustee would not be permitted to do the very same thing, particularly if the sale be made before the cestui que trust elects, and hence before the title vests in him ?</p>

Other arguments' are not lacking, but these are enough to illustrate the line of reasoning which has led me to the conclusion, that no title vested in the children by mere operation of law, and that eo instanti Mrs. Sullivan took the legal title from the executor, -without any act or election on their part, she, as holder of the legal title, could sell the lot and pass a good title to the purchaser, if she sold it for a full valuable consideration, and thus obtain and have the very money which it was her duty to hold and use for the benefit of herself and her children. This conclusion has nothing to do with the question of the liability of the guardian or of the executor to the children, in case they were injured by the transaction.</p>

If he had paid full value for the lot, as much as the executor could have realized had he sold it, then the trust fund would not have been diminished, no one would have had cause to complain, and his title would have been perfect. Taking it, as he did, without paying anything, he took it, of course, subject to all the claims which might have been made against it in his mother’s hands. Bxit the fact that he paid nothing cannot affect the plaintiff, because the mortgagee had no notice or knowledge of that fact. There is no evidence, or allegation, that either the mortgagee or the plaintiff knew he had not paid full value. The deed and the record of it showed the consideration paid, and it is not pretended that the consideration expressed in the deed and receipted for, was not the full value of the lot at the time Charles A. Sullivan took possession of it. The trust which might have attached to the title as held by him, because of the want of consideration paid, was a secret one and cannot affect the mortgagee without notice of the trust brought home to him. He and the plaintiff under him stand in the position of purchasers for value.</p>

Sullivan, and still adheres to it; that the defendant is now, by means of the quit-claim deed, the owner of that trust, and the plaintiff cannot recover; that is to say, that the children of Charles C. Sullivan owned the lot, and the defendant now owns if, because their money bought it. Such a trust is within the operation of the statute quoted: Roy v.

Sullivan went into possession of the lot in 1873. At that time all the cestuis que trust were of age, except Matilda, and she became of age in November, 1874. They all lived in Butler, with their mother, when Charles was building his house. That was their home when Charles moved into his house, and also when he got his deed from his mother on April 7, 1877. The deeds were on record in Butler county. Moses Sullivan, an attorney, had actual knowledge of all this and assisted in securing the loan to his brother Charles and in having the mortgage given to secure it. The other children knew, because they must have known, that Charles was occu<a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>pying the premises as his own. If they did not know all about the facts, that their mother had taken the title from the executor of their father's will, and had made a deed to Charles without consideration, they could by reasonable diligence have learned these facts before the beginning of the year, 1880. Yet no action is commenced, nothing is done, until September '9, 1883, almost eleven years after the youngest child became of age. Then a quit-claim deed was made to the defendant. Before that deed was made the statute had perfected the title in Charles A. Sullivan, and his mortgagee had a right, and under him the plaintiff has a right, not only to all the title which he had when the mortgage was given, but to all the title which he subsequently acquired. The quit-claim deed did not release or assure any title or claim to the defendant, because at the time the releasors had no valid title ox claim to be released. The fact that Charles A. Sullivan signed that deed can have no effect. He could not by that act prejudice the title he had granted by the mortgage. Neither can the fact that he appears to have surrendered the possession to the defendant on April 1, 1886, as against the then purchaser under the mortgage, avail the defendant. Such acts tend only to raise a suspicion of bad faith on his part and on the part of the defendant towards the plaintiff.</p>

The land was not given away, it was accepted by Mrs. Sullivan instead of the money; not as land, however, but as money. The land, having been directed to be converted into personalty, must be regarded and treated as personalty: it was certainly not in the widow’s power by any act or agreement of hers to <a id="p651" href="#p651" data-label="651" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*651</a>convert it into realty: Willing v. Peters, <a href="/pa/7/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="7 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="957806" data-case-paths="/pa/7/0287-01">7 Pa. 287</a>; Evans’s App., <a href="/pa/63/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="63 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="1019067" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0183-01">63 Pa. 183</a>. In the widow’s hands, as respects the trust, it was personalty still, and the children had as yet acquired no right which would support an ejectment. If the executor had sold the land to Mrs. Sullivan at its actual value and received the money, she would have been entitled to receive it back again, and after going through this routine the condition of the parties would not he different in any respect from what it is now. This mode of executing the power was not perhaps in strict compliance with the directions of the will, but the same strictness has never been required in the execution of a power to sell, as is required in the execution of a power to appoint. Hacker’s App., <a href="/pa/121/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="121 Pa. 192" data-case-ids="561263" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0192-01">121 Pa. 192</a>, is therefore not in point. If MeCandless had conveyed to Mrs. Sullivan for full value paid in hand, no one would doubt the valid execution of the power; and practically, this was just what was done, for as we have said, the condition of the parties would not have been changed if that had been done. The executor may have supposed, and doubtless did suppose, this mode of sale “most to the interest of the estate,” whilst the widow, who was solely entitled to the money, doubtless deemed this use of it “a judicious” one, and “most beneficial to herself and children.” And if they, acting in good faith, agreed as to this, there was no one to take any exception to the transaction.</p>
    <p id="b675-5" data-blocks='[["BL_675.4",675,[165,1616,1189,504]]]'>At a public sale of this land by the executor, no one would question the widow’s right to buy, representing her interest and the interest of the children, in order to prevent a sacrifice of the property; and, if she might buy at a public sale, there is no good reason why she might not take the title, for a like purpose, at a private sale. A purchase of.the property, under such circumstances, could rvork no conversion, so as to prevent the widow from disposing of it by sale and conveyance in due form: Billington’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=3%20R.%2047" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="3 R. 47">3 R. 47</a>; Oeslager v.

The children having no interest in the land as such, the mother was free to dispose of it as she chose, accounting to the children, when the time for accounting came, for the proceeds or for what it was reasonably worth. It follows that the deed <a id="p652" href="#p652" data-label="652" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*652</a>to her son was a conveyance of the legal title to him, and, whether the consideration expressed therein was to be treated as an advancement, in the subsequent distribution of the trust estate, or was a simple gratuity on her part, is of little consequence. Taggart, the mortgagee, had a right to suppose that the transaction was just as it appeared upon the face of the deed. There was nothing to put him upon inquiry, and it is not pretended that he had any notice of the nature of the transaction between Mrs. Sullivan and her son, or of the consider-, ation which passed between them. On the contrary, Challes A. Sullivan entered into the exclusive possession of the lot in 1873; erected thereon a dwelling-house, barn and other out buildings, of the value of $10,000 and upwards. In the fall of 1874 he moved into this house and kept it as his own, receiving the conveyance from his mother in 1877. At this time all of the children were, and for three years had been, of full age, and had been residing in the town of Butler. The possession and improvement of the property were wholly consistent with the exclusive ownership of Charles A. Sullivan under the deed.</p>
    <p id="b676-5" data-blocks='[["BL_676.4",676,[270,1394,1186,559]]]'>It is said that the parties in interest might elect to forego a sale under the provisions of the will and take the land in lieu of the proceeds. It is sufficient to say in reply to this that the parties in interest did not do so. This they could do only by agreement or by some decisive act. For nearly eight years after the execution of the mortgage to Taggart, the conduct of the children was consistent only with the exclusive ownership of Charles A. Sullivan. It was not until September 9, 1885, that any word was spoken or any act done indicating a desire of the heirs to take the land instead of the money, and then the property had passed out of their control.</p>
