The 56th section of the act of 1876 refers to a certificate by the officers of a company that an assessment has been made, and such certificate is not required to be under oath.

It is merely a condition precedent to the right to issue execution. The first statement filed is entirely out of the case, as the plaintiff asked for no execution upon it. The point that the second statement is defective because the amount received from premiums is not itemized, is not well taken. The language of the act is, the amount of premiums received, not amounts. It is ruled in Barker v.

    <p id="b322-6" data-blocks='[["BL_322.6",322,[261,1004,1194,969]]]'>The defendant in the court below when he took his policy and gave his premium note became a member of the company. As such he had a right to attend the meetings of its members and to vote at the elections of directors. If the directors were extravagant, incompetent, or careless of their trust, they were nevertheless his representatives in the management of the affairs of the company and their acts done within the scope of their authority bind him. He should have investigated the situation of the company and the character of the management before giving his note and subjecting himself to contribution toward the payment of salaries that bore no relation to the value of services actually rendered, and to the payment of losses on outstanding risks when the income of the company was rapidly falling off. But having become a member of the company and given his premium note he is entitled to insist that his liability shall not be extended beyond his contract. He is liable to contribute to losses arising after he became a member of the company but not to those which had occurred before : The Peoples Fire Ins. Co. v. Hartshorne &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/90/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="90 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1065642" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0465-01">90 Pa. 465</a>.</p>

In this particular the statement is defective. It does not show that the amount received was appropriated to the payment of demands arising after Koehler became a member of the company and gave the note upon which the assessment is levied. The exhibit of the expenditures is sufficiently detailed in all respects except as to the date of the claims to which the money was appropriated. It should be amended also in its statement of the amount of money received, by separating that received from premiums from that which was derived from other sources. When so modified it will support an execution, as it now stands it will not.</p>
