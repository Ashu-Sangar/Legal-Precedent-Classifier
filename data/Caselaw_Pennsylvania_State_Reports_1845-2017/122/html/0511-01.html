But more than all, the attempt is not simply to cross the yard and tracks with a common use, but absolutely to take from plaintiff a portion of their yard for the sole use of defendant. The issue is not in what mode defendant shall cross plaintiff’s property, but solely whether it can cross at all. The right of a raiiroad company to corporate rights being established or ad- . mitted, the right to cross if necessary or convenient in reaching its terminus is absolute, and the court can only ascertain the mode.

It is argued by plaintiff that the only question which should be determined in this proceeding is as to the right of defendant to take the ground appropriated and claimed by it at the time this bill was filed, and that the court has no right to Inquire whether the defendant may not have the right to appropriate some other portion of the defendant’s yard property.

The defendant’s engineer thinks there is no present need for the accommodations plaintiff has provided itself with, while the testimony of the plaintiff is positively the other way, but all seem to agree that all of the appliances, with the exception of a part of the coal arrangements will be needed in the future. The defendants, however, urged that even assuming all their structures to be necessary, they could by a change of location be so arranged as to answer plaintiff’s purpose just as well for all time to come, and still leave room enough for defendant to build its tracks along the river bank as indicated by a plan proposed by its engineer. The master finds that “ it does not appear that the original location (by the company), would have interfered in any way with any of the essential franchises of plaintiff, or with the operations of its railroad, and that defendant might well have insisted upon such location.” This seems to me clearly wrong, but if correct it should have been followed by a decree to that effect.

On the contrary, the master finds that <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>another route, suggested, by defendant’s engineer, but, so far as appears, without any authority from the board of directors, would answer defendant’s purposes, and recommends that it be decreed to take that.

That it would be extremely expensive is equally clear. [But 1 do not understand that one railroad company is to be deprived of its rights and franchise simply because another wants to build another and competing road, which otherwise will cost more than the latter can afford to pay.] 6 While competition is to be encouraged, corporate rights are to be maintained. 1 think, with judge MoKennax, that “every reasonable intendment should be made in favor of the primary rights of the complainant in such cases as this, at the points of the alleged conflict. No actual encroachment upon these rights can be sustained or allowed, and. in measuring their extent, there must be a liberal consideration for the future as well as for the present necessities of the complainant; the use of existing tracks, the construction of additional ones, the convenient storage of the freight at all seasons, and the unembarrassed transaction of its business:" L.

The defendant is a railroad corporation created and organized under the act of April 4, 1868, and its supplements. The plaintiff acquired the property in dispute long before the organization of the latter company, and uses it for the purposes of its yard. It is occupied with numerous tracks, coal trestles, ice house, round-house, and other buildings convenient and necessary for its business. The defendant is about constructing a railroad from its main line, at the foot of Thirty-sixth street, in the city of Pittsburgh, extending along the left bank of the Allegheny river to a point at or near the mouth of Negley’s run, and also a like branch along the left bank of the Allegheny to a point at or near the foot of Eleventh street in said city. In pursuance of this object it surveyed and located a route through the plaintiff’s yard, cutting through the coal yard, repair yard, and about twenty-four feet of the coal chute. Not being able to agree with the plaintiff the defendant filed its bond in the court below in accordance with the act of assembly. Whereupon the plaintiff filed this bill to restrain defendant from further proceeding to lay its track upon the location in question. The court below granted a preliminary injunction, and, upon final hearing, made the injunction perpetual.</p>

The master proceeded to re-locate the road in accordance with the plan submitted by the defendant. He held that such action was justified under the act of June 19, 1871, which provides that if, “in the judgment of such court, it is reasonably practicable to avoid a grade crossing, they shall, by their process, prevent a crossing at grade.” Upon exceptions to the master’s report the court below held that the act of 1871 had no application, for the reason that it referred to railroad crossings alone, while this was not a case of crossing at all in the proper sense of the term. In this we think the <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>learned judge was clearly right. The act of 1871 relates “to crossings of lines of railroads by other railroads.” There was no attempt here to cross the line of plaintiff’s road. It was an attempt to run through the plaintiff’s yard, and the crossing of some of its yard tracks and switches which were merely incident to the use of its main line. As was well observed by the court below: “ The attempt is not simply to cross the yard and tracks with a common use, but absolutely to take from plaintiff a portion of their yard for the sole use of the defendant. The issue is not in what mode the defendant should cross plaintiff’s property, but solely whether it can cross at all. The right of a railroad company to corporate rights being established or admitted, the right to cross, if necessary or convenient in reaching its terminus, is absolute, and the court can only ascertain the mode. But the court must inquire and ascertain whether unnecessary injury will be done by crossing in the manner proposed, and also whether a grade crossing can reasonably be avoided, and decree accordingly: P. &amp; C.

A power to build a railroad of a single track, without the means of passing the trains or of leaving the track for the shifting of cars, or of repairs at the shops and yards, and without standing room for the cars not in motion, would be clearly wanting in all that is necessary to safety, convenience, and utility, and would be vain and nugatory.” See, also, Boston and Maine R.

    <p id="b554-5" data-blocks='[["BL_554.4",554,[244,1233,1189,1175]]]'>It was urged, however, on the part of the defendant, that the yard of the plaintiff is larger than is necessary for its present use, and that it could be so re-arranged as to accommodate defendant’s tracks and without serious detriment to the plaintiff, either in the present or the future. The evidence upon this point is conflicting, and we will not discuss it. The plaintiff contends that the arrangements of its yard cannot be changed without inconvenience and loss in the handling of its business, and that its area is not greater than will be required in the near future. We are of opinion that a railroad company has a right to consider the needs of the future, and to construct its road and make its plans with reference to those future needs. Upon this point the language of McKennan, J., in L. S. &amp; M. S. R. Co. v. N. Y. C. &amp; St. Louis R. Co., <a href="/f/8/0858-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="8 F. 858" data-case-ids="6742433" data-case-paths="/f/8/0858-01">8 Fed. R. 858</a>, is sound and sensible: “ Every reasonable intendment must be taken in favor of the primary rights of the complainant at the points of the alleged conflict. No actual encroachment upon these rights can be sanctioned or allowed, and in measuring their extent there must be a liberal consideration for the future, as well as the existing necessities of the complainant, the use of the existing tracks, the construction of additional ones, the convenient storage of its freight at all seasons, and the unembarrassed transaction of all its business.”</p>
    <p id="b555-4" data-blocks='[["BL_555.3",555,[153,361,1197,1898]]]'>
      <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>We are not embarrassed with the question that would arise if the defendant company could not build its road without laying its track through the plaintiff’s yard. The location claimed for defendant is a matter of. economy, not of necessity. It can construct its road and reach its terminus by another route. It is true, it would be expensive, but it is a mere question of money and engineering skill. It is not entitled to run through the plaintiff’s yard and cripple its facilities for handling its business, merely to save money. Upon this point the language of our brother Gordon, in Pennsylvania Railroad Company’s Appeal, supra, is so clear and forcible that I may well repeat it here: “ This plea of necessity is so frequently used to cover infractions of both public and private rights, that, prima facie, it is suspicious, and must be closely scrutinized, especially when it is used to carry corporate privileges beyond charter limits. This plea, in the first place, must be tested by the rule, now of universal acceptation, that all acts of incorporation and acts extending corporate privileges are to be construed most strongly against the companies setting them up, and that whatever is not unequivocally granted must be taken as withheld. This rule is to be taken in all its rigor when the attempt is so to construe a corporate grant as to interfere with a previous grant of the same kind: Packer v. The Railroad, <a href="/pa/19/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="19 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="970541" data-case-paths="/pa/19/0211-01">19 Pa. 211</a>. It is true that a franchise is property, and as such may be taken by a corporation having the right of eminent domain; but in favor of such right there can be no implication, unless it arises from a necessity so absolute that, without it, the grant itself would be defeated. It must also be a necessity that arises from the very nature of things, over which the corporation has no control; it must not be a necessity created by the company itself for its own convenience or for the sake of economy. To permit a necessity such as this to be used as an excuse for the interference with or extinction of previously granted franchises would be to subject these important legislative grants to destruction on a mere pretence, in fact, at the will of the holder of the latest franchise.”</p>
