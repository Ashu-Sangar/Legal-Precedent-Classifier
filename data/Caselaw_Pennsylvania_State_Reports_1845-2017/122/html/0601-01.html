Butler on the way. The mare had been ridden to the place of Mr. Phillips, and was to be harnessed with harness belonging to Wm. Butler and to be hitched in the latter’s buckwagon. The horse on which the harness was used was about the size of plaintiff’s mare. While the plaintiff was talking with Huston Phillips, the mare was harnessed and hitched by a neighboring farmer, who called out that everything was ready. The plaintiff then got into the wagon and drove some distance, when John F. Butler entered the wagon with him. Nothing occurred indicating that the mare had any difficulty working in the harness.</p>

On the left side, going in the direction they were driving, there was a steep declivity, extending thirty or forty feet from the edge of the road to projecting rocks which hung over a stream. At the top of the slope was a fence four or five rails high, of old rails, staked, with a single rider. The worm of the fence lay along the slope of the hill from the edge of the road; that is, the bottom rail was on or near the ground at each end with nothing to keep the fence in position, if thrust against from the roadside, except the stakes, insufficient for that purpose on account of the slope of the ground on which they stood.</p>

From the tree onward there was a slight up grade of about one degree.

You will carefully consider all the testimony bearing upon each of the alleged defects ; you will take into consideration the location of the road,,the extent and kind of travel over it, the season of the year and all the relevant surrounding circumstances and then determine, first, whether the township, by its proper officers, has been guilty of negligence in that they failed to have this road, on March 30, 1886, in a condition to afford a reasonably safe passage for the traveling public along it at this point; and, second, whether this negligence, if you find it, was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries. For it would make no difference how negligent the township had been or was, in not repairing and keeping the road in good condition, if the accident was not the direct result of this negligence. To illustrate : Considerable has been said about this large oak tree that stood in the side of the road, and, conceding that allowing that tree to remain there would be a neglect of duty on the part of the township, endangering the traveling public, still this negligence cannot be made the basis of the plaintiff’s claim in this suit, unless the existence of the tree at that point contributed to the accident.</p>

A traveler has a right to presume that roads are in a safe condition, but it is nevertheless his duty to keep his eyes about him and see that his wagon, horse and harness are in a condition for making the journey he proposes to make or is making, and that his horse is not allowed to go where he pleases on the road, but that he is properly driven. The driver must keep a lookout for the condition of the road over which he is driving; in other words, he must attend to the business in which he is then engaged. The degree of care required of a traveler in these matters that I have just been speaking of, is a degree of care that would be exercised by an ordinarily prudent or cautious man under the surrounding circumstances. Now, did the plaintiff in this case exercise this care? The defendant says not. They claim that the plaintiff’s mare choked; that the accident would not have happened if the mare had been properly collared and had not choked.</p>

[Now, gentlemen, you will consider all the testimony bearing on this point, and determine whether this- collar was too small, and whether its use resulted in choking the mare at the time of the accident.

On the facts disclosed in this case, the want of a barrier higher and stronger than the fence along the lower side of the road where Mr. Phillips was injured, was not, in any legal or practical use of the phrase, the cause of the. accident. The natural and ordinary way of accounting for his injury would be to say that his mare was choked off her feet. The blind violence of the mare in the extremity of suffocation, was the supervening and proximate cause. In the nature of things the jury could not know what a frantic horse might do when being1 choked off its feet, and therefore would not know that the accident could not have occurred if there had been a barrier at the <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>point such as the plaintiff claims there should have been.

Philosophically, every injury, of the nature of the one discussed, may have several efficient causes, one of which is primary in the order of time, another proximate in its relation to the injury. Por instance, without negligence of a driver, his team may receive a push from another, and an injury occur through the narrowness of a highway unprotected by barriers at a steep declivity. A fright to a horse ordinarily gentle and trained, may be followed by a like injury. An axle may break under careful conditions with like result. Now, the push, the fright, the break, though they are efficient causes and are combined with the negligence of the township in producing the result, yet they are primary, and not proximate; they do not intervene between the negligence and the injury, but the negligence intervenes between the injury and them, and without the negligence the injury would not have occurred.</p>

Merkhoffer, <a href="/pa/71/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="71 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1031214" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0276-01">71 Pa. 276</a>, the primary causes of the injury were the excavation by the Allentown Iron Co. and the shying of the skittish animals; yet the negligence of the township in not providing the barrier was the proximate efficient cause. So, in Pittston Bor. v. Hart, <a href="/pa/89/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="89 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1063226" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0389-01">89 Pa. 389</a>, the fright of the horse by the locomotive engine, was primarily efficient, yet “the direct cause of the injury” was the want of barriers. So, and with more force in this connection, in Hey v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/81/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="81 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="1044154" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0044-01">81 Pa. 44</a>, an illustration is found; and again, in Carlisle Bor. v.

In that case, the primary efficient cause of the injury was the negligence of Coruman, who undertook to drive the plaintiff around as a friend, but in the “eye” of the law the proximate and culpable cause was the negligence of the defendant.</p>

The steam thresher was <em>the </em>primary cause, and its presence upon the road a culpable negligent act of a third <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>party, but the proximate cause was the negligence of the township in not providing barriers. In short, in all such cases, the primarily efficient cause, the choking in this instance, assuming that it existed, was but, the casus or condition under which the proximate cause, the negligent act, had its operation: See Wharton, Negligence, 2d ed., §§ 85, 86. As was said by Marston, J., in Mich. Cent. R. Co. v. Burrows, <a href="/citations/?q=33%20Mich.%2015" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="33 Mich. 15">33 Mich. 15</a>: “ The law cannot enter upon an examination of, or inquiry into, all the concurring circumstances which may have assisted in producing the injury and without which it would not have happened.

If the principle of the case, as stated and criticised there, be sound, the Pennsylvania cases cited by us could not have been - decided as they were. But in Maine as well as in Massachusetts, they seem to have a rule like that quoted by the defendant from Marble v.

Points are presumed to be put for instructions, and answers to be made to them in view of the case presented on the evidence. There was no direct testimony whatever that the collar was too tight and that the mare choked and fell from that cause. The direct testimony was all the other way. And to what weight are the declarations, alleged to have been made by the plaintiff entitled, when they were made, if made at all, when he was suffering great pain, and, especially, in view of the positive testimony that the collar was not too tight at all? Declarations made in casual conversations are the weakest of all evidence : Bender v.

It is equally certain that the wagon was upset by the sudden falling of the animal that was drawing it. What caused the mare to fall is not clear, and is not explained by the plaintiff’s testimony. She did not take fright, she was not running away, bitt on the contrary was moving very slowly through a mud puddle. She got entirely through, and then to use the language of the plaintiff in his testimony, “the mare just fell over and fell with her head and neck right across the fence.” The fence gave way and the plaintiff was precipitated down the bank by the side of the road and was injured. Of course, the fence, whether sufficient or insufficient to sustain the force of the fall, had nothing to do with producing the fall.</p>
    <p id="b635-5" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[168,1026,1191,1390]],["BL_636.1",636,[258,358,1188,139]]]'>The defendant alleged, and gave evidence to prove by the declarations of the plaintiff to a number of witnesses, that the mare was harnessed with a collar too small for her, and that it choked her, and this choking was the real cause of the mare’s falling. If this was the true cause of the falling of the mare, it is difficult to understand how the defendant could he held responsible either for the fall or its consequences. The defendant in the fourth point asked the court to charge the jury, that if the accident was caused by the uncontrollable struggle of a choking horse, or from this cause concurring with a defect in the highway, their verdict must be for the defendant. To this the court replied, “ Refused, unless the plaintiff by bis negligence contributed to, or was the cause of the uncontrollable struggle of the horse.” The vice of this answer is, that the court confounded the effect of an independent cause of the accident, with the effect of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence, and really held that it required a combination of the two in order to relieve the defendant from responsibility for the accident. Now, the contributory negligence of the plaintiff alone and by itself, if it existed, was sufficient to discharge the defendant from all liability. So, also, if the accident was produced by an intervening and independent cause for which the. defendant was not responsible, that too would relieve the defendant from liability, and this was the meaning and substance of the point. The point should have been affirmed as it stood. It was, however, refused, unless the independent cause was combined with another <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>and quite different agency, to wit, the plaintiff’s contributory negligence, and in this there was error. The first assignment of error is therefore sustained.</p>
    <p id="b636-5" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[253,512,1193,1908]]]'>The same idea though in a somewhat different form was repeated in the portion of the charge covered by the third assignment. The court there said, “ If you conclude that the collar was too small and choked the mare and that this choking was the immediate cause of the accident, then you will determine from all the circumstances in the case as they appear from the testimony bearing on this point, whether the plaintiff knew that the collar was too small and took upon himself the risk of using it, or, if he did not know it, whether under all the circumstances he ought to have known it.” Here, again, although the choking of the mare, resulting from a too tight collar, was “ the immediate cause of the accident,” it is practically held to be no defence unless the plaintiff had knowledge of it, or ought to have known it. In other words, unless his concurring negligence was combined with “ an immediate cause of the accident ” for which the defendant was not responsible, there could be a recovery. As we have already seen, this was clear error. This error is more conspicuous because of the answer to the defendant’s fifth point. In that point the proposition was presented that the defendant was not liable if the horse choked from a collar too small for him and became uncontrollable and plunged over the bank and would not have done so but for the choking, and this the court affirmed. But if this be so, as it certainly is, it was both inconsistent and erroneous to say that in addition to this there must be concurrent negligence of the plaintiff. If the tight collar produced the choking which caused the horse to fall, and thereby caused the accident, it is certainly of no consequence whether the plaintiff knew that the collar was too tight or not. Whether he had or had not knowledge of the smallness of the collar, and that it was choking the horse, the effect of the choking, as productive of the accident, would be precisely the same, and hence, if as an independent producing cause of the accident, it would suffice to relieve the defendant from responsibility, it would accomplish that result without any reference to the plaintiff’s knowledge. The judgment is reversed on the first and third assignments of error.</p>
