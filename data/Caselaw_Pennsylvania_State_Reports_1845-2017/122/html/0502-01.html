I readily perceive that this plaintiff had what occurred to the court to be a valid claim against this insurance company; but there seems to have been in the policy of insurance that was issued by this Kittanning Ins. Co., a provision which we hold is binding in this ease. It is this : That the insurance company shall have ninety days after complete proof or adjustment of loss has been made, within which to pay the amount that may be adjusted, the amount that they may, after examination of the proofs of loss, etc., determine is due to the assured. Noav then, it is possible that the original proof of loss, if it stated the loss, or the original notification as giAren to the Kittanning Ins. Co., if it stated the loss, might be sufficient upon Avhich to base a recovery as claimed by the plaintiff’s counsel. [But there may be <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>Waivers by both parties, and the evidence in this case clearly ■shows that the plaintiff did not stand upon that original notification of his loss.] 6 Subsequent to that, they had an adjustment of the value made by appraisers mutually chosen. That appraisement was made on February 18, 1886. It was made upon agreement, or under an agreement of submission, for the specific purpose, to two appraisers, and that submission was to the effect that those appraisers should estimate the actual damage to the property of David Snowden. They estimated the actual damage to the property of David Snowden at $300, and so made their return on February 18, 1886, to the insurance company.</p>

And there comes the dispute as to that, at least it is apparent from the evidence, that the insurance company did not accept that amount as the actual amount due from them, and the authorized agent of the plaintiff, then, Without any reason for the act, withdraws and takes away those proofs of loss after having actually submitted them to the company. [We say to you that those proofs of loss submitted to the company were a part of the agreement on the part of this plaintiff before he could recover anything from this insurance company, and after having submitted those proofs •of lossj it was his duty to wait the term of ninety days before he brought suit.]4 He failed to do so, and brought his suit before the time that he had agreed in accepting this policy of insurance, had expired, and within which the company are to adjust the loss. This suit was actually brought within that time, and we must hold with the view we take of it [if there was anything on the part of the insurance company waiving the filing of proofs of loss, the plaintiff did not take advantage of that waiver],5 but stood upon the agreement of his policy and actually filed and submitted to them his proofs of loss, which was done on March 8th, and then brought his suit within the time the company was allowed, by virtue of their policy, to make an adjustment and payment, and having done so we have to <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>say to you, that we believe this suit is prematurely brought, and under all the evidence the plaintiff cannot recover.

The plaintiff endeavored to manufacture a waiver out of his own testimony. When boiled down, it is that the adjuster said, when the appraisers met, that the company would pay the loss as soon as the amount was fixed. This remark misled no one. The plaintiff afterwards prepared and presented formal proofs of loss as required by the policy. As was well said by the court below, his own subsequent conduct was a waiver of his right to set up .any such defence. Having presented formal proofs of loss to the company he was bound to abide by his covenant that no payment should be made until ninety days thereafter. Having disregarded this part of his agreement he must abide by the consequence and ought not to complain of the court in holding that his action was prematurely brought.</p>

On October 26th, Snowden, by letter addressed to the company, gave notice that his house had caught fire and on the 23d was burned, and the result was a total loss. It is contended on part of the defendants, and this is the only defence set up against the plaintiff’s recovery, that the suit was prematurely brought; that the loss was not payable “ until ninety days after complete proof and adjustment thereof,” in accordance with the terms of the policy; that the proofs were not furnished until March 8, 1886, whilst the suit was brought on May 22d, thereafter, seventy-five days only intervening, the proofs which were furnished having in the meantime been withdrawn. On part of the plaintiff, however, it is contended that the furnishing of the proofs was waived by the company; that the proofs which were furnished were, under the agreement of the parties, unnecessary and were therefore withdrawn.</p>

It has always been held competent for insurers to waive performance of a formal condition introduced into a policy solely for their own benefit; such waiver need not be expressed but may be inferred, either from the acts of the insurers evidencing a recognition of their liability, or from their denial of obligation exclusively for other reasons: Buckley v. Garrett, <a href="/pa/47/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="47 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="485517" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0204-01">47 Pa. 204</a>; Ins. Co. v.

    <p id="b534-5" data-blocks='[["BL_534.4",534,[247,755,1201,1387]]]'>Was there any evidence of such a waiver of the preliminary proofs .in this case? It appears that hi November, about the middle of the month, Crawford, the company’s agent, was sent out to adjust this claim. He told Snowden the house was insured for more than it was worth, and proposed that Snowden should choose one carpenter and the company another, and “ whatever these two carpenters would agree upon the company would pay.” This offer, although not agreed to at the time, was afterwards accepted by Snowden in an interview he had in Kittanning with Brown, the superintendent of the company, and Crawford, the company’s agent. The agreement was reduced to writing and signed by the parties, and King and Morrow were therein authorized “ to appraise at its actual cash value the damage claimed to have been caused by the fire to the property insured.” Snowden says the understanding and agreement was that the company would ■ “ pay whatever these two appraisers would make; ” “ they were to pay the money right away; ” “ as quick as the value was made.” The appraisers were sworn, and on February 18, 1886, returned an appraisal or award in which they state, “that after having-taken into consideration the age, condition, and location of the premises previous to the fire, and making proper deduction for the walls, materials; and portions of the buildings saved,” they appraise and determine the damage to be $300. This adjustment of the loss was completed on February 18, 1886. The suit was not brought for more than ninety days thereafter, ' and if the proofs of loss were waived the suit was not premature.</p>

If the company through their special adjusting <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>agent agreed to pay at onee after the adjustment was made, as ■stated, what was the necessity for prehininary proofs or for plans and specifications ? In that case the adjustment of the loss was dependent wholly upon the action of the appraisers. The question of waiver was, therefore, for the jury, and the court erred in not submitting tbat fact for their consideration. The principle governing this case is, therefore, readily distinguished from that stated in German American Insurance Company v. Hocking, <a href="/pa/115/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="115 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="551732" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0398-01">115 Pa. 398</a>. It was argued here that as the company by tbe policy were not liable for a greater sum than two thirds of the actual cash value of the building burned, if a recovery could be had in this case at all it would only be for two thirds of the amount fixed by the appraisers. B at it will be observed tbat tbe appraisement was not of tbe value of the building; it was of tbe damage done; and a proper deduction was made for the walls, materials, and portions of the buildings saved. The appraisers did not value the building; they were not selected for that purpose.</p>
