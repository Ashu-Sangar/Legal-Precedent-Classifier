On August 25th, the wheat was shipped to Lessig &amp; Co., Ash-land, and billed to the defendants, upon whom the plaintiff drew at sight for the value, bill of lading and freight bill attached to draft. On August 26th, the defendants wrote to plaintiff that the car of wheat was at Ashland, but it was musty and their customer refused to take it: “We cannot pay your draft, and cannot pay you full price for same.” The plaintiff replied, August 27th, “ 1 can take an oath that the wheat was all sound when loaded, with the exception of about 100 bushels that was at sweating, and probably gave it. a little smell on handling it; that all came on top, it will be better below.” On August 28th, the defendants wrote plaintiff, saying inter alia: “ When we received word from our customer that the car of wheat was out of condition and was damp, we at once have sent our agent to see same and advise him to compromise with our customer, for we knew that if he did not receive it, we would have to lose heavy, because it would have to be reshipped to some other point at a local rate, and would have to sell it for musty wheat, and being wheat could be bought for much less money we tried to get out the best way possible. We therefore make a deduction of five cents per bushel or $29.90. Now you can make another draft on us for the amount of your bill, less the above amount, $29.90, and attach a receipt in full for car No. 9889.....However, we have made an arrangement with our customer that in case you should want the wheat that he would reload it for you and then leave it for your disposal. You can therefore see at once that he was not anxious to have it at the deduction made him. If yon want the wheat answer at once and we will advise our customer to load the same wheat; he has it all in one bin and he is willing to reload it, if we cannot settle with you as per statement. . . .</p>

If they did that, they would be liable and bound to pay that sum: if they refused to do so, and returned the wheat, they would be liable for the difference in price between that sum and the sum it was fairly sold for in market, at the time of the refusal.

In the first of these, the articles are ordinarily sold upon inspection and the sale is completed by a delivery of the property, made at the time of sale. To this class of sales the rule of caveat emptor is properly applicable. If a warranty is desired by the purchaser he must stipulate for it before the sale is completed, otherwise he will be held to have bought upon his own judgment of the quality and value of the thing purchased. In the second class, the sales are made by sample or by description, the goods not being seen by the purchaser until they have been selected and forwarded by the seller in pursuance of the previous contract or order from his customer. The rule in these cases is not caveat emptor, but caveat venditor, for the duty of selecting and sending the article ordered by description or from sample is on the seller. The buyer is dependent on his good faith in the premises. If the article selected and forwarded by the seller is not of the kind ordered, or if, being of the kind ordered, it is not merchantable in quality, the buyer may refuse to accept it and give notice to the seller.</p>

In executory sales the seller warrants <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>that the article shall be of the kind ordered, and merchantable in quality. This is the rule laid down in Borrekins v.

As was said by this court in Dailey v. Green, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20Pa.%20126" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="15 Pa. 126">15 Pa. 126</a>, “ When the contract is executory, as it always is when a particular article is ordered without being seen, from one who undertakes it shall be of a given quality or description, and the thing sent as such is never completely accepted, the buyer is not bound to keep it, or pay for the article on any terms, though no fraud was intended by the vendor.”</p>

The obligation to accept or reject the article arises, however, only upon an actual delivery. It is when the articles come under the observation of the purchaser and he is able to see whether they are such as he has ordered, that he is bound to elect whether to accept them or not. It is not his duty to go to the point where delivery is made to the carrier, to inspect the articles before their shipment; for he has a right to rely on the good faith of the seller who has undertaken to fill his order, according to its terms, and ship to him by the ordinary modes of transportation, and when the articles reach him is the first time at which examination is practicable, and is the time-contemplated by the contract. If the articles upon reaching their destination are not found to be such as the contract calls for, the seller has not performed on his part, and has no right to ask performance to any extent from his vendee. It was his own folly or fraud to ship an article not ordered, and he has no claim upon his vendee for freight, any more than he has for the purchase money of such an article. If the vendee has just ground for refusing to accept the performance offered, it is very clear that he is under no other obligation to his vendor than that of giving notice promptly of his refusal.

The instruction complained of in the second assignment of error is the logical-result of that just considered. The court said, “The law would not permit the purchasers to take it to Allentown or Ashland, or any other remote place for examination and acceptance or refusal.....The delivery on the track at Millway was all they could require him under his contract to do; the freight to and from any other place to which they took it, the law would require them to pay.”</p>

If, after the wheat reached Ashland, the point of actual delivery, the defendants had transported it to some other place, such transportation, not being within the contemplation of the contract, would have been at the cost of him who ordered it, but the defendant’s order was for wheat to be sent to him at Ashland. If the seller sent something not ordered and which the buyer refused to <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>accept, it imposed no more obligation upon the buyer than if he had sent nothing. The seller failed to perform his contract. Whatever expenses were incurred in an ineffectual effort at performance he must pay. If the wheat had been injured on the journey an entirely different question would he presented, but the evidence shows that Brubaker, having loaded 500 bushels of good wheat into the car, put one hundred bushels in to fill it up, which had begun to heat and was musty. The condition of the wheat was not changed on the journey. The allegation was that the whole was rendered unmerchantable by the admixture. The question of performance was therefore properly raised, and the jury should have been instructed that if the wheat was not merchantable as “No. 1, long-berry red wheat,” the defendants had the right to reject it; and, the plaintiff having failed to perform tire contract on his part, had no right of action against the defendants for the freight or other expenses incurred by him.</p>
