The executor of Thomas joined in the deeds, but did not receive any of the money. The individual debts of Thomas F. Gallagher have all been paid in full. The creditors unpaid (including appellants) are creditors of the firm, and they allege that said real estate was not partnership property, hut was held by the firm as tenants in common, and that the one half of the proceeds (the share of Thomas) should have been distributed pro rata among the creditors. The distribution appears to have been made by the surviving partner under the belief that the firm was solvent, whereas it now appears that both the firm and the individual members thereof were insolvent. It thus happened that some creditors have been paid in full while others have been paid in part only. There is nothing to raise an inference that any fraud was intended.</p>

Yet we find nothing in this record by which such fact can be determined with judicial certainty. It is not found by either the auditor or the court below. The former does not refer to it, and the latter does not find the fact. Nor is there a particle of evidence upon the subject so far as the same has come up to us. The only matter that throws any light upon it is the will of Thomas F.
