The next point to which I call your attention is that undue influence will not be presumed. It must be proved. I do not mean that it must be proved by direct and positive testimony, for that would scarcely ever be possible; but it 'must be established by affirmative evidence of facts, from which, if satisfactorily proved, undue influence results as an unavoidable inference. You are not at liberty to infer that the will and codicils in controversy were procured by undue influence, from the mere fact, if it be a fact, that Jackson had the confidence of his father, the testator, and that the testator deferred to him in matters of business, even though it be accompanied by the additional fact that under the will and codicils, Jackson takes almost the entire estate, to the exclusion of his brothers and sisters. It is not unlawful, nor is it uncommon, for parents to have favorites even among their own children, nor is the selection of favorites always wisely made. But when the relation is established, it must, as we have seen, be allowed to produce its natural results. [If one of these results should be the entire disherison of all of a testator’s children, except the lucky favorite or favorites, it must be submitted to, no matter how much it may shock our sense of propriety, provided the testator was of a sound and disposing mind, and provided he was not unduly influenced to make his will in that way.]19</p>

J., says: “ The will of a man who has testamentary capacity cannot be avoided, merely, because it is unaccountably contrary to the common sense of the country. His will, if not contrary to law, stands for the law of descent of <em>Ms </em>property, whether his reasons for it be good or bad, if, indeed, they be his own, uninduced by unlawful influence from others.” Even more emphatic is the language of Paxson, J., in Cauffman v.

But neither moral nor physical constraint is to be inferred from mental weakness alone. That undue influence, which suffices to destroy an alleged will, is distinct from weakness and has no necessary connection with it: ” Eckert v. Flowry, supra. If, therefore, there were nothing more before you than the alleged fact that old Mr. Herster’s mind was weak, and the alleged fact that he confided in and deferred to-Jackson, supposing these facts to be proved to your entire satisfaction, coupled with the additional admitted fact that the-will and codicils give to Jackson almost the whole of the testator’s property, it would be your duty to return a verdict in favor of the defendants; but these circumstances are legitimately before you, and you are to give to them, in connection with the other evidence, such weight as you think them entitled to.</p>

That question is-not before you at all, for the plaintiffs admit that the testator, in the absence of ,undue influence, was entirely competent to-make a will. The only purpose of the evidence, introduced by the plaintiffs as to the condition of the testator’s mind, is to show that his mind had become so weakened by disease and. old age as to make the testator an easy prey to the alleged, machinations of Jackson and Jackson’s wife, to have the will and codicils made as they were made.

The declarations of the testator were made at times either remote from the testamentary acts, or introduced generally, without limitation as to time. But when the declarations were made <em>to </em>the testator, of which <em>his </em>unsworn declarations are sought to be made the proof, and which were the exercise of the influence alleged, there is not a syllable of proof. Most of the facts asserted in the declarations of testator arc proven to be true; but, assuming them all to be false, the principal devisee and his wife deny under oath the communication to him.

The will was made and executed June 13, 1874; the first codicil August 29, 1878, and the second May 7,1880. Andrew Herster died May 27,1882, at the age of eighty-four years, possessed of an estate estimated at $200,000, leaving to survive him six children, viz.: Daniel Herster, Jacob Herster, Susan Keiper, Eliza Reich, Andrew J. Herster and William Henry Herster. Of these Andrew J. Herster is the principal devisee and proponent of the will, and William Henry Herster and Eliza Reich are the contestants. The only matter in issue, under the pleadings, is whether or not the will and the codicils, or any of them, were procured by fraud or undue influence ; the contestants, who were plaintiffs below, maintaining the affirmative and the proponents the negative of that issue. That Andrew Herster was, at the time of making the will and codicils, of sound and disposing mind and memory, is therein assumed; no question can be made as to this; the only proper matter for consideration being whether that mind and memory were, in these testamentary acts or in <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>any of them, led captive by the artifice and undue influence of Andrew J.

It is only necessary, therefore, to consider the case upon the more comprehensive question of undue influence, for this will embrace all sorts of artifice, imposition, or bad faith which characterize acts of fraud. Undue influence exists wherever through weakness, ignorance, dependence or implicit reliance of one on the good faith of another, the latter obtains an ascendency which prevents the former from exercising an unbiased judgment. To affect a will, it must, in a measure at least, destroy free agency, and operate on the mind of the testator at the time of making the will. The rule is well and forcibly stated by our brother Goedoít in Tawney v.

The proponents of the will, on the other hand, contend that the testator was of a strong, robust and resolute mind; that, although advanced in years and afflicted to some extent with the disease stated, he conducted business, successfully and extensively, throughout the whole period of his affliction and until within two weeks of his decease; that he was engaged extensively and profitably in the purchase and sale of cattle; that he kept his own accounts, made his own calculations, and drew his own checks in payment, until the month in which he died; that within a year prior to his death he paid to three of the witnesses alone, for cattle, over $26,000, and within four months and one half before his death, had paid out with his own checks, to different persons, for cattle, over $11,000; that it was the result obtained in his various business transactions after the making of his will, which made further testamentary provision necessary; that Jackson, his son, had been a good boy, had remained at home with his parent, and had rendered him valuable and important services; that the old man had a high opinion of his son’s business capacity, and, on that account, often deferred to his judgment in <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>business matters, and that the provisions in his will and the codicils in his favor, were a free and voluntary act of his father, prompted, perhaps by his affectionate regard for his son, and a consideration of his personal services and worth, It will be seen therefore, that undue influence is the substantial fact affirmed on one side, and denied on the other; imbecility or weakness of mind being a collateral or extraneous question arising out of the proofs.</p>

So, in Hoshauer v. Hoshauer, <a href="/pa/26/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="26 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="977348" data-case-paths="/pa/26/0404-01">26 Pa. 404</a>, the testator’s mental capacity was not disputed; the will was made in 1853; to show undue influence, the contestants offered to prove that in 1855, the testator said he had “made a will;” that he bad “made it as John wanted it;” that he had “ to make it as J olm wanted it,” and that he “ knew it was wrong.” Tho offer was rejected and upon error it was held that it was rightly rejected. Mr. Justice Lowbie, delivering the opinion of the court, said: “ This could not prove fraud in procuring it, though nearly all the estate was given to John’s children, himself getting a dollar. An instrument, that for two years remained subject to change or cancellation at tho maker’s pleasure, cannot be set aside on such a declaration. A man who is competent to make a will can so easily correct any of its provisions, however obtained, that it is hard to imagine any kind of declarations of his that would prove it to be fraudulent, when any considerable time has intervened between its execution and his death.” So also, in McTaggart v. Thompson, <a href="/pa/14/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="14 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="405984" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0149-01">14 Pa. 149</a>, where the validity of a will was questioned both for want of testamentary capacity and for exercise of undue influence, the contestants offered to prove the testator’s declarations, made after tho execution of the will, to the effect that in the making of it he had been imposed upon by those in whose favor it was made. The offer was refused, and upon that ground the case was removed to this <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>court. “The court appears,” said Mr. Justice Rogers, “to have excluded the testimony, because they chose, contrary to the offer, to suppose it was designed to prove duress, for which, purpose it would be clearly inadmissible. But the court had no right to act on the supposition that the testimony was proposed in bad faith. As it was offered for a legitimate purpose, for that purpose it ought to have been received. If attempted to be used for a different purpose, the correction was in their own hands; the counsel would subject themselves to the severest censure.

There is, in the concluding clause of the opinion referred to, enough perhaps to give the impression, that the declarations of the testator made a few days prior to his death, as to his unsuccessful attempt to get possession of his will from Lynn, followed by his exclamation on the day of his death, “ Mein Gott in Himmel, es is alies letz, alios letz,” my God in heaven, all is wrong, all is wrong, were deemed proper evidence of undue influence.' But the law is too well settled on this point to admit of any doubt. The testimony was admissible, perhaps, but it was for the consideration of the jury only in a certain event, and then for a special purpose, to show the state and condition of the testator’s mind; and as the declarations were made eight years after the execution of the will, and four years and two years after the making of the codicils respectively, and then were uttered almost in the last moments of the testator’s life, they were, it must be conceded, of little force or inferential effect, under the circumstances, even as to that. We then said in advance we could not “say that the answers to the proposed questions would not indicate the exercise of undue influence,” etc. Now that the answers are before us, we can without any hesitation say that they are not. The defendants’ counsel, by a point more particularly directed to this branch of the evidence, might have directed the attention of the court to the proper application of this part of the evidence in a more direct manner than appears to have been done; but we think the question is raised in the answers to the defendants’ fifth and sixth points. Although these points were not directed to the precise question now under consideration, yet the answers of the court proceed plainly upon the assumption, that the testator’s declarations might be regarded as indicating undue influence, or present constraint, operating upon the mind of the testator in the testamentary act; and upon this ground the judgment must be reversed. .</p>

The testator went to Mr. Lynn, who had been his attorney and counsellor for fourteen or fifteen years, and, in the absence of all his children, with the greatest deliberation arranged for the preparation of his will. That Jackson was a son was certainly in his favor; that he was intrusted with his father’s business and, in this respect, occupied a confidential relation towards him is also a circumstance in his favor, if he performed his duty faithfully and well, and did not take advantage of his position, or abuse the confidence reposed in him in the procurement of the will.

It is only when the will is grossly unreasonable in its provisions, and plainly inconsistent with the testator’s duty to his family, that, in case of doubt, the inequality can have any effect on the question of undue influence.

He says: “ I told him, ‘ Daddy, you did not come up to see my place.’ He said, ‘No, I did not;’ then he said something about having a fall and hurt his thumb or finger, I forget what it was, and he couldn’t get up, but that his son Jake told him that the property was cheap, and they might as well buy it, because they had the money lying idle; but he said ‘I’ll see Jack first; ’ and then he called Jack, and he told Jack about it and said, ‘ Here’s Frey about that lot on College Hill; Jake says it is cheap and we might as well buy it; ’ Jack said,' ‘ No father, we have got enough borough property; if we want to buy property, buy farms.’ Then the old gentleman said, ‘Well, if you say so, all right,’ and that ended the matter.”</p>

There is, in our opinion, no evidence from which a jury would be justified in inferring fraud, duress or undue influence in the making of this will. In an issue devisavit vel non the question of mental unsoundness, or of undue influence, ought not to be submitted to the jury where the evidence is of such unsatisfactory character that the court would not sustain a verdict upon it: Wilson v. Mitchell, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20Pa.%20505" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="101 Pa. 505">101 Pa. 505</a>. “ A court of law,” says our brother Paxson, in Cauffman v. Long, <a href="/pa/82/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="82 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1047992" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0072-01">82 Pa. 72</a>, “has a higher duty to perform than merely to answer points of law. It is its duty to.see that the law is faithfully administered, and such administration requires that a man’s will, the most solemn instrument he can execute, shall not be set aside without any sufficient evidence to impeach it. There is no redress here for an erroneous or improper verdict. But where a case is submitted to a jury upon clearly insufficient evidence, such as no court ought to sustain a verdict upon, it is our plain duty to reverse : Sartwell v. Wilcox, <a href="/pa/20/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="20 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="972369" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0117-01">20 Pa. 117</a>; Lower v. Clement, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20Pa.%2068" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="25 Pa. 68">25 Pa. 68</a>; Silveus v. Porter, <a href="/pa/74/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="74 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="1034699" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0448-01">74 Pa. 448</a>.” “This court has indicated in a number of cases,” says our brother Green, in Herster v. Herster, <a href="/pa/116/0612-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="116 Pa. 612" data-case-ids="554389" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0612-01">116 Pa. 612</a>, “ a rule by which to determine the granting of an issue, and it is equally applicable in determining whether a cause of this kind ought to be withdrawn from the jury. It is thus expressed in a recent case: If the testimony is such that after a fair and impartial trial resulting in a verdict against the proponents of the alleged will, the trial judge, after a careful review of all the testimony would feel constrained to set aside the verdict, as contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, it cannot be said that a dispute within the meaning of the act has arisen. On the other hand,, if the state of the evidence is such that the judge would not feel constrained to set aside the verdict, the dispute should be considered substantial and an issue to determine it should be directed. This simple and only safe test is supported alike by reason and authority: ’’ Knauss’ App., <a href="/pa/114/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="114 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="549988" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0010-01">114 </a><a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a><a href="/pa/114/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="114 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="549988" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0010-01">Pa. 10</a>.” Applying this rule, which would seem to be well settled, to the evidence in this cause, it must be conceded, we think, that it is wholly insufficient. Upon a careful review of all the testimony this verdict could not be sustained; the court should have set it aside as contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. And if this is so it is, on an issue devisavit vel non, good ground for reversal here.</p>
    <p id="b289-5" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[191,703,1195,1648]]]'>The facts exhibited in evidence in this ease to establish undue influence’ are, in general, of the most trivial character. The most grievous matters alleged are that Jackson said Eliza Reich’s husband stole a cow, and that Dan was a drinking man — facts, however, which do not seem to be seriously denied. It does appear that Henry never had a piano, and it is probable that the old man knew that he had not, as he was actively engaged about the house for five years after this alleged misrepresentation. Statements to the effect that Jacob’s children were “ running around spending their money; ” that Henry’s were “ out on the streets nights ” and that Mrs. Keiper’s were a “ stuck up set,” are criticisms that may have been well or ill founded, according to the stand point from which their conduct was observed and the peculiar notions and temper of the observers. At the best, however, they have little, if any force in establishing fraud or undue influence in the procurement of this will or of the codicils. And especially is this true in view of the fact, that the alleged declarations were not only made after the will was executed, but several years after. There is some evidence of mental' impairment, but the testimony is overwhelming that notwithstanding this impairment the testator retained a business capacity rarely found among persons of his age, who have never been afflicted as the testator was. There is no evidence whatever of any statements made by Jackson or his wife to the prejudice of his brothers and sisters at, or at any time before, the making of the will. In order to invalidate a will there must be evidence direct or circumstantial of a present operating restraint at the time of making it: Eckert v. Flowry, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%2052" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="43 Pa. 52">43 Pa. 52</a>; Wainwright’s App., <a href="/pa/89/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="89 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="1063238" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0220-01">89 Pa. 220</a>. Influences which do not appear to be connected with the testamentary act are not sufficient to impeach a will: McMahon v. Ryan, <a href="/pa/20/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="20 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="972319" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0329-01">20 Pa. 329</a>.</p>
