No other warrant for the entry thereof is even suggested.</p>

That point was refused by the court below, and the question thus presented becomes vital and controlling. The same question has been before us in Ayars’ Appeal, No. 3 July Term 1888. In an opinion just filed in that case [ante 266], the act above referred to has been pronounced unconstitutional. For reasons there given, and which need not be repeated, it follows that the lien in question, based on the act, was unauthorized and void. The 19th and 21st specifications are therefore sustained.</p>
