There was evidence that his father had permitted the plaintiff to make the contract for his own benefit and to receive the consideration as his own. As the consideration for the employment, on March 18, 1865, Andrew Brame executed his bond in the sum of $1,000, payable to Franklin J. Spangler on March 18, 1866, which bond was delivered to Emanuel Spangler, the father, for safe-keeping while the plaintiff was in the service. On April 1, 1865, the obligor paid to Emanuel Spangler $500 on account of the bond. The plaintiff returned from the army in August, 1865, and in March, 1867, the remaining $500 was paid to him by Brame, and the bond, which had been in the possession of the father until that time, was surrendered and cancelled. Emanuel Spangler died testate on August 25, 1886, and on September 6th following letters testamentary were granted to his widow, Sarah Maria Spangler.

This, however, cannot be so in any point of view. The evidence is still that of a stranger testifying to a conversation with himself, and not with the creditor, and the only difference is as to the character of the conversation. In the one case the declaration of the debtor is that he will pay tlie debt, and this when made to a stranger does not bind the debtor, not because it is not a promise of a sufficiently definite and binding character, but because it is made to one who has no interest. In the other case the declaration is by the debtor that he told the creditor he would pay. This is no higher grade of promise than tlie former, and the medium of proof being of the same vicious character as the former, to wit, a declaration made to a stranger, its effect, as establishing an obligation, can be no greater. We are of opinion that the declarations received in evidence were not sufficient to toll the statute, and that the defendant’s first point should have been affirmed.
