L. 539], with its supplements, in regard to the alteration of the lines of any two or more adjoining townships.” The act of 1834, referred to, authorizes the proper court “ to alter the lines of any two or more adjoining townships so as to suit the convenience of the inhabitants thereof, and to cause the lines or boundaries to be ascertained and established,” which language mates it plain that in altering the line of any township, it is to be so changed as to take in only territory that is adjacent thereto. It is clear that the petitioner’s land does not adjoin Stowe township. Moreover, the report was defective in that it did not contain an explicit opinion as to the expediency or propriety of granting the prayer of the petitioner: Limestone Tp., <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Pa.%20271" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="11 Pa. 271">11 Pa. 271</a> ; Sewickley Tp.

The purpose of the act was to meet the wants of people unfortunately situated in relation to school privileges ; to invest the courts with power to adjust the rights of isolated taxpayers, such as the petitioner and many more among the sparsely populated hills and valleys of our state, and to promote the education of the children of the poor, who depend on public schools, by an act that must necessarily leave large discretion to the judge construing it, so as to fit a great variety of cases. The legislature does not <a id="p656" href="#p656" data-label="656" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*656</a>place the unnecessary limitation of physical adjunction; they do not use the word, annex, in any such a forced sense ; and the word, adjoining, if used in any of the statutes referred to in relation to townships, should not be imported into the act of 1876, whereat does not appear, as it would place a limitation to the power of the court which was never intended.</p>

The effect of the decree, therefore, would be to make that school district consist of two detached bodies of land, entirely separated from each other by an intervening portion of Robinson township school district. Such a result was- never contemplated by the act; nor, indeed, can it be accomplished without ignoring, in part at least, the mode of proceeding prescribed by the act. The object of the petitioner was not to so change the boundary line of the school district as to include his farm, and thus make a single district composed of a compact body of adjoining lands. That would be susceptible of accomplishment in case his farm adjoined the <a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>district to which he sought to have it attached, but not otherwise.</p>
