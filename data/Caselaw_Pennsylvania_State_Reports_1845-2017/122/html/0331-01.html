    <p class="summary" id="b359-5" data-blocks='[["BL_359.5",359,[219,447,1189,717]]]'>I am of opinion that H. M. F. Von Stamp was a citizen of Pennsylvania on May 4, 1885, and thenceforward; that John Lee Chapman at the time of his death was a resident of Baltimore, having his domicil there ; that there was the principal administration and here the auxiliary. I think also, that the evidence does not warrant the auditor’s 14th finding of fact “that the payment of $10 by John Lee Chapman was upon this particular note.” Chapman’s letter of October 8, 1880, does not refer to any note. lie simply says, “ I send you $10, I cannot send more at this time.” The indorsement of a credit for $10 in Von Stamp’s handwriting as of October 9,1880, does not identify this note as the claim on which the $10 was paid, for it is not shown that it was made before October 1, 1882, when the six years expired.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b360-5" data-blocks='[["BL_360.4",360,[264,493,1194,1439]]]'>What is the nature of the lien and whence derived ? SinceÍ688 lands have been liable for debts. Until the act of 1705-was passed, it is said the administrator could sell real estate, for payment of debts as he could personal estate at common law, without any order of court, or else the creditor could take it in execution. In 1705, the administrator was authorized to-sell for payment of debts under the rule and direction of the Orphans’ Court. The lien of the creditor on the decedent’s; land springs from these old acts, which make his land liable-for debts and a fund for their payment. And the hen means, nothing more than “the right of subjecting the decedent’s, land to execution after his death either by common law process or in the Orphans’ Court: ” Lead. Art., 6 W. N. 545, 546; 2 Trickett on Liens, 516. In other words it means that the decedent’s land is a fund for the payment of his debts. Until 1794, there was no limit to the time during which the debts of a decedent continued to bind his land. But the act of' April 19, 1794, reciting that “inconveniences may arise from the debts of deceased persons remaining a lien on their lands, for an indefinite period of time after their decease, enacts that no debts unless secured, etc., should remain a lien on the land longer than seven years after the decease of 'the debtor. The act of 1797 is the same. The act of February 24, 1834, P. L. 77, enacts that no debts of a decedent, unless secured, etc.,, shall remain a lien on his lands after his death longer than five years, etc. Thus these acts do not create a lien, but limit a. lien before indefinite. And that lien is the liability of the lands, to answer for the debts for five years.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b360-6" data-blocks='[["BL_360.5",360,[265,1940,1194,458]],["BL_361.1",361,[208,352,1200,1283]]]'>But the personal estate is also answerable for the debts, and this does not prevent the running of the statute. Let us suppose that the acts limiting the lien of the debts, had not been passed or unrepealed, and the lien was indefinite. Then a claim not barred at the decedent’s death, might lie in wait for twenty years, until the presumption of payment would arise to shut it up in its lair. The lien would not prevent the presumption arising, and for the same reason it would seem ought not to prevent the bar of the statute, both having regard to-<a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>loss of means of proof of payment. Suppose a man to die leaving a personal estate ten fold enough to answer every claim, and lands besides. A claim, not barred at his death, is barred afterwards under Yorks’ Appeal, and cannot come in on the personalty. Can the creditor ask that the lands of the heirs be sold to pay his claim, because he had a lien on the land ? The personalty is the primary fund for the payment of debts. Can the personalty be relieved by the plea of the statute, and the lands remain bound ? Campbell v. Fleming, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20Pa.%20245" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="63 Pa. 245">63 Pa. 245</a>. But further, the contention is that the lien saves the claim, though the statute of limitations bars it. And the reason is because it was an existing, good, enforceable debt at the death of the debtor. But is not that the question ? The debt ought to be proved, but cannot be pressed after the six years. The debt of a decedent is a lien, but is the creditor’s claim a debt of the decedent? We must not assume that; it is matter of proof: See Trinity Church v. Watson, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20Pa.%20526" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="50 Pa. 526">50 Pa. 526</a>. The creditor, presenting his claim before the auditor after the six years have run, finds it barred by the statute. If he says it was a valid claim at the debtor’s death, the answer is, we cannot tell. You have allowed the claim to sleep until the evidence to disprove it is lost. A debt barred before death is not a debt of the decedent saved by the act of 1834, because it cannot be proved. For the same reason, a debt barred after his-death, would seem not to be saved by the act.</p>

My attention is called to the fact that Yorks’ Appeal was decided May 1,1885; McClintock’s Appeal, November 9, 1885; and the opinion on the re-argument of Yorks’ Appeal on January 4, 1886. It is said truly that McClintock’s Appeal— the old case in <a href="/pa/29/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="29 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="982770" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0360-01">29 Pa. 360</a> — was not overruled in the first case, but on the motion for a re-argument, and was not referred to in the case of McClintock’s Appeal of November 9,1885, by court or counsel. But though Guthrie for the appellant made a point on the statute of limitations, Stewart (contra) rested wholly on the lien, as did the Supreme Court in its opinion. The ease fits ours at all points, and Yorks’ Appeal does not affect its principal. But as Yorks’ Appeal shows that before a debt is seated on a trust it must be established as a debt, and in <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>that the statute of limitations has its operation, so I thought that before a debt would be protected by a lien, it must be proved, and in that the statute would be a bar: Yorks’ App., <a href="/pa/110/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="110 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="543759" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0069-01">110 Pa. 69</a>, 77.

    <p id="b362-10" data-blocks='[["BL_362.9",362,[272,1322,1193,919]]]'>1. The error of the court below in determining the case upon the authority of McClintock’s App., 1 Cent. R. 635 (3 East. R. 416), was in not placing that case within its proper historical period. It belongs to the interregnum, which, beginning with the earlier McClintock’s App., <a href="/pa/29/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="29 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="982770" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0360-01">29 Pa. 360</a>, continued for a period of twenty-eight years, and then closed very appropriately with the later case of the same name. But Yorks’ App., <a href="/pa/110/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="110 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="543759" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0069-01">110 Pa. 69</a>, 77, followed, and with it came the restoration of legitimate authority and the reinstatement of the act of assembly. The case at bar is to be decided in the light of the restoration. Yorks’ Appeal, decided two months after McClintock’s App., 1 Cent. R. 635 (3 East. R. 416), brushed aside McClintock’s App., <a href="/pa/29/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="29 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="982770" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0360-01">29 Pa. 360</a>; Mitcheltree v.

It is fixed and established as a debt only when legally proven to be a debt; until then it exists only as a claim. Admitting <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>the trust character of the estate in the custody of the administrator, the claim is seated on the trust only when it has been legally established as a debt. The same reasoning excludes mere claims from the protection of the statutory lien on lands. Their character as good “ debts at the time of the decedent’s death ” must first be established, and this can be done, if the protection of the lien is desired, by proceeding at law within the statutory period. The late case of Arndt’s App., <a href="/pa/117/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="117 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="555826" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0120-01">117 Pa. 120</a>, sustains the position here taken, if not in express terms, yet by inference as unmistakable.</p>

In his 14th finding of fact, the auditor had the acknowledgment of the existence of the indebtedness to Margaret Lee Chapman; the letter inclosing the $10 money order and the original money order; the note itself with the indorsement of the credit upon it, and the testimony of the claimant that the credit was there the instant after the testator’s death. The auditor’s ruling upon the admissibility of the claimant’s testimony is sustained by Rothrock v. Gallaher, <a href="/pa/91/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="91 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="487570" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0108-01">91 Pa. 108</a>.

Our law assumes that land will not be required for debts; but when required, the true point of time at which a debt must be provable, as against land, is the death of the debtor.

    <p id="b364-8" data-blocks='[["BL_364.8",364,[252,1234,1198,921]]]'>This was a question of the statute of limitations. The note-in controversy bears date July 10, 1876, and is payable eighty days after date. Unless taken out of the statute it was barred October 1, 1882. The maker died November 18, 1880. The-order of sale for the payment of debts was granted May 5-, 1885, and the sale was confirmed .on the 8th of September following. The note was presented to the auditor appointed to-make distribution, who allowed the claim upon two grounds,, viz.: (a) That the note was taken out of the statute by reason of a credit appearing on the back of the note; and (5) Because the note remained a lien upon the real estate of the decedent for five years after his death, and the claim must be-allowed out of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate, regardless of the fact whether any payments were made on the note or not. See his second conclusion of law. Upon exceptions filed, the learned court below reversed the auditor upon the first ground, but sustained him upon the second, and decreed the payment of the note out of the fund.</p>
    <p id="b364-9" data-blocks='[["BL_364.9",364,[253,2163,1191,292]]]'>The learned judge was clearly right as to the first proposition. It is true the auditor found the fact that the payment of the.$ 10 in question was made upon the note in controversy. He found it, however, upon insufficient testimony. There was not enough to submit to a jury. This question does not require discussion.</p>
    <p id="b365-4" data-blocks='[["BL_365.3",365,[209,373,1196,1026]]]'>
      <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>The court sustained the auditor upon the second question with evident reluctance. Indeed, the learned judge has given us a very excellent argument why the plea of the statute should be sustained, but was constrained to decide the other way by McClintock’s Appeal, 1 Cent. R. 635 (3 East. R. 416). This was one of the line of cases following the ruling of McClintock’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/29/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="29 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="982770" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0360-01">29 Pa. 360</a>, and which fell with the decision of Yorks’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/110/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="110 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="543759" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0069-01">110 Pa. 69</a>. It is not necessary that we should reiterate what was said in the last named case ; it is still fresh in the minds of the profession, and we have no idea of departing from it in the slightest degree. We there pointedly overruled McClintock’s Appeal, McCandless’s Appeal, and the ■entire line of cases following them. The later McClintock’s Appeal, upon which the court below relied, was decided between the first decision in Yorks’ Appeal and the subsequent ■decision upon the motion for a re-argument. The latter is really the decision in that case, and it occurred two months •after McClintock’s App., 1 Cent. R. 635 (3 East. R. 416), was •decided. The latter case fell with the decision in Yorks’ Appeal.</p>

It is to be observed, however, that the act of 1834 did not create a lien. It merely limited the extent of a lien, at one time indefinite, and by the act of 1794 restricted to seven years, to the period of five years. It will be noticed, moreover, that the act refers only to debts due by a decedent; it has no reference to mere claims against his estate. A debt established or admitted is a lien against the real estate of a decedent for the period of five years after his decease; a mere claim is not a lien until first established as a debt. When, therefore, a claimant demands the benefit of the statutory lien, he must first show that he has a debt. A debt barred by the statute is no debt at all, and it is begging the question to say that it was a debt at one time, or that the statute had not fully run at the death of the decedent. In the latter case the statute may be tolled, and the lien preserved by commencing a suit within the statutory period. It would be an anomaly to hold that a.claim barred by the statute and, therefore, inca<a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>pable of coming in upon the personal estate, which is the primary fund for the payment of debts, could years afterwards be allowed out of the real estate in the hands of the heirs or devisees.</p>
