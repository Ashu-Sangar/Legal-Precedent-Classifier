Is a property subject to unnecessary hardship when the evidence demonstrates that it is burdened by obsolete buildings, deed restrictions on conversion or demolition of many of the buildings, severe environmental contamination, more than half a century of physical decay and over a decade of severe difficultly in leasing space to tenants, such that the property owner cannot even service the mortgage payments on the property?\n2.
