The primary substantive disagreement involved DPW’s interpretation of moratorium regulations restricting payments relative to new or additional nursing facility beds, <em>see </em>55 Pa.Code § 1181.65(c), as disallowing depreciation and interest relative to associated moveable equipment. <em>See DPW v.

Specifically, DPW’s position was that Oakmont’s claims should be litigated in its Bureau of Hearing Appeals, with judicial review confined to the appeals process prescribed in the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. §§ 101-754. <em>See </em>55 Pa.Code §§ 1101.84, 1181.101.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Indeed, in connection with its promulgation of regulations governing provider agreements, DPW explained publicly that “[t]he Department views its relationship with providers as a contractual one between buyer and seller of services with each party deciding whether or not it wishes to enter into a contract.” <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Pa.%20Bull.%203655" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="13 Pa. Bull. 3655">13 Pa. Bull. 3655</a> (Nov. 19, 1983).

Oakmont reasons that “but for” the MA provider agreements, caregivers would have no right to payment, and therefore, their rights clearly have a contractual dynamic; moreover, it contends, an action seeking payment for services rendered is classically contractual. Furthermore, Oakmont advances Judge Leavitt’s position that an action does not cease to sound in contract merely because it involves the application of incorporated statutory prescriptions and/or administrative regulations to determine the contractual entitlements. <em>Accord Caritas Services, Inc. v.

To account for this aspect of federal law, Oakmont has posited that the Bureau of Hearing Appeals’ process and the Board of Claims forum should be regarded as a “dual-track system,” with the forum selection option falling to MA providers. Oakmont further acknowledges the divestiture of Board of Claims jurisdiction over MA provider reimbursement claims that occurred in 2003, but contends that, by way of the same enactment, the General Assembly also expressly protected the Board’s jurisdiction over previously-filed claims such as Oakmont’s. In this regard, Oakmont highlights that the effective date of Act 2002-142 was delayed pending the Department’s implementation of procedural protections relating to provider appeals. <em>See </em>Act 2002-142 § 22. According to Oakmont, if the Legislature had believed that providers had no rights in the Board of Claims, it would have disapproved all further litigation there immediately, particularly given <em>River Street, </em>which was final several months prior to the passage of Act 2002-142 (upon this Court’s denial of the provider’s request for allowance of appeal).</p>

As the Department highlights, the jurisdictional provisions of the Board of Claims Act are as much a part of the statutory scheme as the provisions governing procedure. Thus, to the extent that those requirements are not met, the claims cannot be litigated before the Board in accordance with the enactment.

These equities are offset, however, to some degree at least, by Oakmont’s awareness of the Department’s consistent position since the late 1980s, and the ready availability of a federally-prescribed, alternative forum with associated judicial review that would have alleviated the jurisdictional component of the conflict. Centrally, by maintaining the attempt to pursue these claims outside the administrative appeals process and in the forum of its own choice, Oakmont bore the risk that the Department’s position concerning jurisdiction might ultimately, prevail in the ensuing litigation. Additionally, and as such, we reject Oakmont’s argument that DPW should be estopped in light of a general position that it abandoned nearly twenty years ago and prior to the time that Oakmont’s claims had accrued and been asserted.</p>
