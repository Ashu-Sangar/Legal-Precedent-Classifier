The two men went to Santos’ car where Santos obtained a gun from underneath one of the seats. The men then got into the car and followed the vehicle that had hit Santos’ car.

Santos threw the gun in a nearby alley and fled from the scene. Three days later, Felicia died from the gunshot wound. Around the same time, Santos fled to the Dominican Republic, where he was apprehended seven years later.</p>

Indeed, our courts have consistently held that malice is present under circumstances where a defendant did not have an intent to kill, but nevertheless displayed a conscious disregard for “an unjustified and extremely high risk that his actions <em>might </em>cause death or serious bodily harm.” <em>Young, </em><a href="/pa/494/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="494 Pa. 224" data-case-ids="1769070" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0224-01">431 A.2d at 232</a> (emphasis added) (citations omitted).

Despite the fact that Ms. Soto explicitly warned him to put the gun away because of the children who were playing in the area, Santos disregarded this warning and not only continued to manipulate the <em>loaded </em>gun, but did so with the barrel facing the young children. Furthermore, Officer Rone’s testimony was that Santos must have had his hand on the gun’s trigger while he was pulling the gun’s slide because only a pull of the trigger could have caused the fatal shot that hit Felicia’s head. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as we must when reviewing a trial court’s order granting a petition for habeas corpus, the Commonwealth clearly presented sufficient evidence to support a <em>prima facie </em>finding that Santos “consciously disregarded an unjustified and extremely high risk that his actions might cause death or serious bodily injury.” <em>Young, </em><a href="/pa/494/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="494 Pa. 224" data-case-ids="1769070" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0224-01">431 A.2d at 232</a> (citations omitted); <em>compare Taylor </em><a href="/pa/461/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="461 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="483886" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0557-01">337 A.2d at 548-49</a>; <em>Scales </em><a href="/pa-super/437/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="648 A.2d 1205" data-case-ids="707168,7882995" data-case-paths="/pa-super/437/0014-01,/a2d/648/1205-01">648 A.2d at 1207</a>; <em>Urbanski, </em><a href="/pa-super/426/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="426 Pa.

While <em>Taylor, Scales, </em>and <em>Urbanski </em>all involved deaths caused by a defendant’s use of a motor vehicle, we note that a loaded gun is just as much of a deadly instrument as a motor vehicle, if not more so. Thus, as with a motor vehicle, a defendant can certainly be found to have acted with malice when the evidence shows that he recklessly used a gun in deliberate disregard of the danger posed to others.</p>
