The Wegners were awakened to find appellant in their bedroom, walking around their bed. When appellant exited the house, the Wegners called emergency services, and Officer Christopher McKim of the Ephrata Borough Police Department was dispatched to the scene of the crime. After arriving at the Wegners’ residence, Officer McKim found appellant hiding on the Wegners’ porch and ordered him to put his hands up, at which point appellant fled. <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>Officer McKim gave chase and eventually subdued and arrested appellant.

The trial court agreed with appellant and, in addition, further reduced appellant’s sentence because it found that he had rebutted the presumption of “high risk dangerousness.” Accordingly, the court imposed a sentence of five to ten years imprisonment for the burglary charge; a concurrent sentence of two to four years imprisonment for the aggravated <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>assault charge; a consecutive sentence of two years probation for the resisting arrest charge; and restitution in the amount of $12.00.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The Commonwealth filed a timely notice of appeal to the Superior Court.</p>

Appellant suggests that we read the statute as a whole and interpret it consistently with the recidivist philosophy of sentencing, which the General Assembly intended. He submits that such a reading reveals that, in order to be sentenced as a third-time offender under the statute, the defendant’s two predicate convictions must have occurred “sequentially.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Moreover, appellant argues that requiring prior convictions to be sequential “is necessary to serve the statute’s aim—to impose a stiffer penalty on the incorrigible criminal who has been unaffected by prior punishments.” Appellant’s Brief at 13. The Commonwealth counters that the Superior Court was correct in remanding the matter for resentencing based on the plain meaning of the statutory text which dictates that appellant be sentenced as a third-time offender. We granted allocatur to consider whether the recidivist philosophy influences or controls the interpretation of the three strikes law.</p>

      <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>As a preliminary matter, we note that this appeal does not involve a challenge to the discretionary aspects of appellant’s sentence, over which this Court would lack jurisdiction. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9781(f) (“No appeal of the discretionary aspects of the sentence shall be permitted beyond the appellate court that has initial jurisdiction for such appeals.”); <em>see also Bradley, </em><a href="/pa/575/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="834 A.2d 1127" data-case-ids="630409,9083893" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0141-01,/a2d/834/1127-01">834 A.2d at 1131</a>. Rather, as was the case in <em>Bradley, </em>appellant’s present claim raises a question of statutory construction, which is a pure question of law and which, under the circumstances, implicates the legality of appellant’s sentence. This is so because, in the absence of the twenty-five year mandatory minimum sentence provided for in Section 9714(a)(2), appellant would have been exposed to a maximum sentence of only twenty years of imprisonment for the burglary conviction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
      <em>See Bradley, </em><a href="/pa/575/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="834 A.2d 1127" data-case-ids="630409,9083893" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0141-01,/a2d/834/1127-01">834 A.2d at 1131</a>.

Zoning Hearing Bd., </em><a href="/pa/566/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="566 Pa. 180" data-case-ids="706223" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0180-01">566 Pa. 180</a>, <a href="/pa/566/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="778 A.2d 1205" data-case-ids="706223,9498084" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0180-01,/a2d/778/1205-01">778 A.2d 1205</a>, 1210 (2001). Our task is guided by the sound and settled principles set forth in the Statutory Construction Act, including the primary maxim that the object of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a); <em>see also Commonwealth v. MacPherson, </em><a href="/pa/561/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="561 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="93698" data-case-paths="/pa/561/0571-01">561 Pa. 571</a>, <a href="/a2d/752/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="752 A.2d 384" data-case-ids="11509602,93698" data-case-paths="/a2d/752/0384-01,/pa/561/0571-01">752 A.2d 384</a>, 391 (2000). In pursuing that end, we are mindful that “[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). Indeed, “[a]s a general rule, the best <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>indication of legislative intent is the plain language of a statute.” <em>See Bradley, </em><a href="/pa/575/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="834 A.2d 1127" data-case-ids="630409,9083893" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0141-01,/a2d/834/1127-01">834 A.2d at </a>1132 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

In reading the plain language, “[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage,” while any words or phrases that have acquired a “peculiar and appropriate meaning” must be construed according to that meaning. 1 Pa.C.S. 1903(a). However, when interpreting non-explicit statutory text, legislative intent may be gleaned from a variety of factors, including, <em>inter alia: </em>the occasion and necessity for the statute; the mischief to be remedied; the object to be attained; the consequences of a particular interpretation; and the contemporaneous legislative history. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c). Moreover, while statutes generally should be construed liberally, penal statutes are always to be construed strictly, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1), and any ambiguity in a penal statute should be interpreted in favor of the defendant. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s argument highlights the potential for absurdity or unreasonableness here. At the time of his concurrent sentencing for his three prior burglaries in 1997, appellant was not, in fact, sentenced as a second-time offender. Indeed, because he committed all of the prior burglaries before he was convicted or sentenced for any of them, he could not have been sentenced as a second-time offender in light of our holding in <em>Dickerson, </em><a href="/pa/533/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="533 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="1837506" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0294-01">621 A.2d at 992</a> (previous conviction must occur prior to commission of subsequent offense).

The unreasonableness of that result is made more apparent when considering the disparity between the sentence appellant received upon his first sentencing contact with the criminal justice system—an aggregate term of lijé to 23 months of imprisonment in a county facility—and that which the Superior Court panel majority deemed statutorily required upon this, his second sentencing contact with the system—a minimum term of 25 years of imprisonment.

Notably, the Crimes Code definition of burglary does not mirror that found in Section 9714(g). The Crimes Code defines burglary, in relevant part, as follows: "A person is guilty of burglary if he enters a building or occupied structure with intent to commit a crime therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the actor is licensed or privileged to enter.” 18 Pa.C.S. 3502(a) (emphasis added). An "occupied structure” is defined as ”[a]ny structure, vehicle or place adapted for overnight accommodation of persons, or for carrying on business therein, whether or not a person is actually present.” 18 Pa.C.S. 3501 (emphasis added). Burglary is a felony of the first degree, <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>unless each of two facts are present: (1) "the building, structure or portion entered is not adapted for overnight accommodation”; and (2) "no individual is present at the time of entry,” in which case it is reduced to a second degree felony. 18 Pa.C.S. 3502(c). Under Section 3502, therefore, a defendant can properly be convicted for burglary as a first degree felony even where no one was present, and there will not necessarily be a finding as to that fact. Notwithstanding that procedural reality, the three strikes law classifies "burglary of a structure adapted for overnight accommodation in which at the time of the offense any person is present” as a "crime of violence.” As a result, a defendant potentially is exposed to the qualification of a present and/or predicate first degree felony burglary as a "crime of violence” even though the factfinder did not necessarily find that a person was present at the time of the offense. Appellant here does not challenge the characterization of his present or prior burglaries as qualifying "crimes of violence;” thus, no issue is presented concerning the disconnect in the definitions.</p>

Although this Court set forth the normal sequence of events, namely, first offense, first conviction, first sentencing, second offense, second conviction, second sentencing, we did not <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>address the present scenario. Instead, <em>Dickerson </em>may be differentiated on the basis that the second offense occurred prior to the first conviction. Read within the plain language of Section 9714, at the time of the commission of the second offense, Dickerson had not been convicted for a prior offense. In that case, Dickerson had committed a second rape on the same day as the first rape. Accordingly, this Court stated that “a conviction cannot be a previous conviction for purposes of [Section] 9714(b) unless the conviction for the first offense occurs prior to the commission of the second offense.” <em>Dickerson, </em><a href="/pa-super/404/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="404 Pa.

In part, the Majority reasons that the concurrent nature of the prior sentences resulted in a single opportunity for reform. However, unanswered by the position set forth by the Majority is the question that must be answered. If Appellant had been sentenced consecutively, it is asked if a single stretch in prison counts as two opportunities to reform. I believe that the distinction between the two is irrelevant because in both scenarios Appellant has received multiple warnings and opportunities to reform.

Moreover, it is possible to interpret the statute as purely punitive in nature, creating a harsher penalty not in the <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>interests of rehabilitation of the offender, but because of a defendant’s repeated commissions of criminal acts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

Although recidivist in nature, the language is clear, and the other sections cited by the Majority do not persuade me to override that language as clearly contrary to the purpose of the statute.</p>

There may be some dispute over whether the two crimes committed on February 2, 1997, within one and one-half hours of each other would count as two separate convictions. However, Bradley, would lead one to believe that these two crimes would count as separate transactions, making this Appellant’s fourth strike. Moreover, even if we were to consider the two February crimes to be one previous transaction, the 1996 criminal event is clearly separate and Appellant would be on his third strike.</p>

A twenty-five year mandatory minimum for a seemingly minor offense of burglary of $76.00 and a brassiere is extreme. However, no challenge is before us concerning the constitutionality of the punishment. <em>See Ewing v. California, </em><a href="/us/538/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="538 U.S. 11" data-case-ids="9030344" data-case-paths="/us/538/0011-01">538 U.S. 11</a>, <a href="/us/538/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="538 U.S. 11" data-case-ids="9030344" data-case-paths="/us/538/0011-01">123 S.Ct. 1179</a>, <a href="/us/538/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="538 U.S. 11" data-case-ids="9030344" data-case-paths="/us/538/0011-01">155 L.Ed.2d 108</a> (2003) (holding, in a five to four decision, that a twenty-five year minimum sentence for stealing three golf clubs pursuant to California’s three-strikes law did not violate the Eighth Amendment, and that any criticism for the statute is properly directed at the legislature) (citing <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em><a href="/us/445/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="445 U.S. 263" data-case-ids="1777320" data-case-paths="/us/445/0263-01">445 U.S. 263</a>, <a href="/us/445/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="445 U.S. 263" data-case-ids="1777320" data-case-paths="/us/445/0263-01">100 S.Ct. 1133</a>, <a href="/us/445/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="445 U.S. 263" data-case-ids="1777320" data-case-paths="/us/445/0263-01">63 L.Ed.2d 382</a> (1980), in which a life sentence was given for a three-time felon where the underlying offense was obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses). However, there is precedent for finding an Eighth Amendment violation for an unduly harsh penalty imposed pursuant to a three-strikes law. <em>See Crosby v.
