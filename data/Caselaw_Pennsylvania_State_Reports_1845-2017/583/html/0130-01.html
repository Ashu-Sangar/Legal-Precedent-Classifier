Appellant also alleges that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise trial counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to object to the language of the jury charge. Accordingly, Appellant has sufficiently pled this claim for our review. <em>McGill, supra. </em>However, we cannot review this claim for a different reason. The claim Appellant forwards to this court is fundamentally different from the claim raised to the PCRA court. In that court, Appellant raised this claim only as an issue of trial court error.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Thus, Appellant did not give the PCRA court the opportunity to entertain this ineffectiveness claim in the first instance. Therefore, the ineffectiveness claim he presently raises is waived. Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (“Issues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.”). Appellant attempts to avoid a finding of waiver by asserting that there was no need to develop the ineffectiveness claim before the PCRA court since the trial court had already reviewed and rejected this issue in its post-trial opinion and “by virtue of [the trial court’s] prior adverse resolution of those issues, the [PCRA] Court will necessarily deny Peti<a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>tioner’s separate PCRA claim that appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to appeal that adverse resolution.” <em>See </em>PCRA Petition dated January 2, 1997 at 8 n. 3. Appellant fails to recognize that the trial court, which entertained the post-verdict motions and the PCRA court are distinct courts and must be treated as such. Accordingly, this claim is waived.</p>

Appellant adds that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this claim on direct appeal. This claim is distinct from the “layered” claim discussed previously, since the allegation is that appellate counsel was ineffective in his own right—for failing to raise a preserved claim of trial court error. Accordingly, resolution of this claim is not governed by this court’s decision in <em>McGill, </em><a href="/pa/574/0573-02" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="832 A.2d 1014" data-case-ids="587990,588049,9088752,9088766" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0573-02,/pa/574/0574-01,/a2d/832/1014-01,/a2d/832/1014-02">832 A.2d at 1020-26</a>.

The Majority notes that the PCRA<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> court dismissed this <em>Batson </em>claim without addressing it in its opinion. The Majority vacates the dismissal and remands for the PCRA court to consider the <em>Batson </em>issue in the first instance, including consideration of appellant’s request for an evidentiary hearing. I respectfully dissent from the vacatur and, in addition, I write because I have some concerns respecting the Majority’s inaccurate portrayal of the claim for PCRA review purposes.</p>

In order to further this salutary requirement, the Court need only to remand for the trial court to file a supplemental opinion addressing the collateral claim arising from jury selection. Because it is premature to vacate the denial of relief on the claim, however, I dissent from the vacatur.</p>

If this were so, the ordered remand is futile, for appellant unquestionably waived any <em>Batson </em>claim when he failed to raise it at trial and on direct appeal. As Justice Eakin correctly notes, for purposes of this collateral attack, the only cognizable and non-waived claim arising out of jury selection is a layered claim sounding in the ineffective assistance of prior counsel.</p>
    <p id="b339-4" data-blocks='[["BL_339.4",339,[173,741,1155,1007]]]'>This case was tried long before <em>Batson </em>was decided. Counsel did not foresee that decision and did not preserve a Batson-type claim. As a matter of Sixth Amendment law, it is beyond cavil that counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to anticipate a change in the law such as <em>Batson. Commonwealth v.

Given these immutable facts, as well as the other obvious deficiencies in appellants proffer, there is much to be said for Justice Eakin’s view that appellant’s claim of counsel ineffectiveness respecting <em>Batson </em>should be rejected now rather than later, so that his new penalty hearing may proceed apace. Indeed, upon remand for supplemental opinion, the PCRA court need say little more than what I have noted, given that the claim turns upon an attempt to secure, via the guise of ineffectiveness, the retroactive benefit of a non-retroactive decision.</p>
    <p id="b339-5" data-blocks='[["BL_339.5",339,[176,1788,1152,251]]]'>The Majority vacates, rather than merely remanding for a supplemental opinion. The Majority also fails to make clear that the claim upon which it vacates sounds in ineffective assistance of counsel, and not in <em>Batson qua Batson. </em>I therefore dissent from the Court’s mandate.</p>
