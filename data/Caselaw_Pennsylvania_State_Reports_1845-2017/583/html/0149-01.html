For the reasons that follow, we hold that PUTMA superseded the common law requirement that donative intent must exist in order to have a valid <em>inter vivos </em>gift under PUTMA, therefore rendering the intent of the donor irrelevant to the validity of a gift made pursuant thereto.

More specifically, the Majority holds that a transfer of property into a custodial account established pursuant to the Pennsylvania Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (“PUTMA”), 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 5301-23, is the irrevocable property of the minor beneficiary of the account, regardless of the transferor’s intent at the time of the transfer. In my view, however, the words of PUTMA clearly and unambiguously make the transferor’s intent relevant. I believe that this is so because PUTMA provides that “[a] person may make a transfer by irrevocable gift ...,” 20 Pa.C.S. § 5304, and in order to make a gift, there must be donative intent. Here, since Father transferred funds into his daughter’s PUTMA account, intending the transfers as gifts to her, the transferred funds were irrevocable gifts under PUTMA.

Therefore, under PUTMA, when property is transferred in compliance with Section 5309, such compliance demonstrates completed delivery of the property and <em>prima facie </em>evidence of donative intent on the part of the transferor. Once this <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a gift is established, a rebuttable presumption arises that the gift is valid, and the burden is on the party challenging the validity of the gift to rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence. Because the clear and unambiguous words of Section 5304 require that a transfer be by gift and because, in order for a gift to be valid, an alleged donor must have had donative intent, this burden-shifting analysis applies when a party challenges a transfer of property by gift into a PUTMA account.</p>

First, by employing a literal interpretation of Sections 5309 and 5311(b) in holding that a transfer of property into a PUTMA account is the irrevocable property of the minor beneficiary of the account regardless of the transferor’s <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>intent, the Majority has given no force to Section 5304, specifically to that section’s use of the phrase “by irrevocable gift.” Such an interpretation is counter to the presumption “[t]hat the General Assembly intends the entire statute to be effective and certain.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(2).</p>
    <p id="b361-4" data-blocks='[["BL_361.4",361,[174,640,1154,1228]]]'>Second, if the Legislature did not intend to require donative intent in order for a gift to be valid under PUTMA, then the application of PUTMA would lead to absurd and unreasonable results. It is not difficult to imagine how a person could transfer funds into a PUTMA account without donative intent. For instance, while banking on-line, one could intend to transfer funds into his or her personal account, but due to a mistaken click of the mouse, the person accidentally deposits the funds into his or her child’s PUTMA account. Similarly, an intended transfer by gift of funds into one child’s PUTMA account could be transferred erroneously into the PUTMA account of another child. Under the Majority’s interpretation, the money transferred under these circumstances would be the irrevocable property of the minor beneficiary of the PUT-MA account into which the transfer was made, regardless of the transferor’s lack of donative intent. Majority Opinion at 159-60, 876 A.2d at 910 (“The plain and common meaning is that money transferred into a custodian account pursuant to PUTMA is irrevocably the property of the minor.”) (citations omitted). Such results are patently unreasonable and absurd and ran contrary to the presumption that the General Assembly does not intend results that are absurd or unreasonable. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1).</p>
