In addition, Dr. Weiner reviewed appellant’s medical records from Mayview Hospital and interviewed appellant on July 4, 2000. In a letter to the trial court dated July 6, 2000, Dr. Weiner informed the court, in detail, that in his opinion appellant was competent to stand to trial.

The trial court held a hearing on that same date, at which the court heard testimony from Dr. Weiner, who stated that although appellant’s medical history records were available for review, it was necessary for him to interview appellant in order to form an opinion on his mental status at the time of the crime. Following the testimony, the court issued an order directing that appellant cooperate with the interview process.</p>

N.T., 5/22/01, at 5, 8. The court directed the interview process to continue that evening and the next day if necessary.</p>

Defense counsel countered that appellant, in fact, had been complying with the court’s order. After hearing testimony from Dr. Weiner in support of the Commonwealth’s position, the court conducted a record colloquy of appellant to ensure that he understood his duty to comply in order to be able to pursue an insanity defense. Appellant evidenced his understanding, and the court thereafter permitted Dr. Weiner to continue the interview process.</p>

Later that same day, the court issued an order, in which it noted that it had compelled appellant to participate in a psychiatric examination; that Dr. Weiner had, in fact, examined appellant for a total of six to eight hours; and that appellant had substantially complied with the examination process. Thus, the order denied the Commonwealth’s request to bar appellant from raising the defense of insanity.</p>

Appellant, who is black, grew angry because he thought that Kroll and DeWitt were taking too long. Appellant called DeWitt a “racist white pig” and “dirty white trash,” and DeWitt replied by stating that people like appellant are the cause of racial tension. N.T., 11/1/01, at 88. As DeWitt kneeled, picking up his tools from the floor in the hallway outside appellant’s apartment, appellant stood directly over him. Because appellant looked angry, DeWitt rose to his feet with a hammer held at his side. Appellant asked: “You think you’re pretty tough?” Appellant walked away but then returned and stated to DeWitt, “You’re a dead man ... You have to come back to this building ... You’re a dead man.” N.T., 11/1/01, at 91-92. DeWitt and Kroll then went to the apartment building’s basement, at which point DeWitt left Kroll to attend to another resident’s maintenance request. Kroll remained in the basement with another maintenance worker, Andrew Williams, who is black.</p>

Thus, his general attack on Section 9711(a)(2) must fail. As to appellant’s more specific argument that the evidence in <em>this </em>case was so extensive and repetitive as to call the penalty verdicts into question, we note first that the text of Section 9711(a)(2) does not purport to set limits on the amount of allowable victim impact testimony. Furthermore, our decisional law has not purported to fashion a bright-line rule limiting the quantity of victim impact testimony or the number of victim impact witnesses who may testify at a capital sentencing hearing. On the contrary, it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to ascertain the appropriate nature and extent of victim impact evidence which ultimately is placed before a jury. <em>See Williams, </em><a href="/pa/578/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="854 A.2d 440" data-case-ids="1329406,1329413,1329438,9214713,9214742,9214779" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0504-01,/pa/578/0503-01,/pa/578/0504-02,/a2d/854/0440-01,/a2d/854/0440-02,/a2d/854/0440-03">854 A.2d at 447</a>.

Here, appellant does not argue with any specificity why it was that the sheer number of witnesses called, or the nature of their testimony, or the facts of this case prove an abuse of discretion. Instead, he relies primarily on the sheer number of witnesses and the dissent’s general concerns in <em>Means. </em>We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the Commonwealth to introduce the challenged testimony, the nature of which was allowed by Section 9711(a)(2) and the extent of which was logically permitted by the circumstances of appellant’s multiple crimes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a>

      <em>Mitchell </em>is controlling here. As in <em>Mitchell, </em>appellant’s counsel has diligently attempted to fashion a persuasive <em>Atkins </em>argument by taking mental health testimony out of the <em>non-Atkins </em>context in which it was presented. But the record was not developed in such a way as to make out an <em>Atkins </em>claim. Moreover, the parties’ arguments are similarly deficient, as both are focused solely on the issue of whether appellant satisfied the “definition” of mental retardation, apparently proceeding upon the assumption that the criterion plucked from the definitions cited in the <em>Atkins </em>opinion are controlling as to that question. That presumption is erroneous, as the <em>Atkins </em>Court did not purport to adopt any standard, but rather, as we noted in <em>Mitchell, </em>left to the states the task of implementing the restriction banning the execution of the mentally retarded. <em>See Mitchell, </em><a href="/pa/576/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="839 A.2d 202" data-case-ids="16743,9056715" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0258-01,/a2d/839/0202-01">839 A.2d at 209</a>.</p>

Furthermore, I join the analysis that Justice Castille sets forth except for that part of the opinion addressing the admissibility of Dr. Weiner’s expert testimony. I agree with the majority’s statement <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>of the well-settled principle that the admissibility of evidence, including the admission of rebuttal evidence, is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See </em>Majority opinion at 929; <em>Commonwealth v. Weiss, </em><a href="/pa/565/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="565 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="124681" data-case-paths="/pa/565/0504-01">565 Pa. 504</a>, <a href="/a2d/776/0958-01" class="citation" data-index="119" data-cite="776 A.2d 958" data-case-ids="11083104,124681" data-case-paths="/a2d/776/0958-01,/pa/565/0504-01">776 A.2d 958</a>, 967 (2001). I distance myself, however, from the remainder of the majority’s analysis of this issue.</p>
    <p id="b401-4" data-blocks='[["BL_401.4",401,[171,672,1150,628]]]'>As mapped out by the majority opinion, this issue arose because during the pre-trial phase the Commonwealth contended, both before the trial court and on appeal, that Appellant should be precluded from offering any evidence of mental infirmity, including the presentation of the insanity defense, because Appellant impeded the interview process with Dr. Weiner. Due to this pre-trial argument, Appellant extrapolates that Dr. Weiner did not have a sufficient basis for his expert testimony and, thus, argues that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting this testimony at the penalty phase. In essence, Appellant is attacking the sufficiency of the foundation for Dr. Weiner’s expert testimony.</p>
    <p id="b401-5" data-blocks='[["BL_401.5",401,[172,1324,1154,681]]]'>The majority opinion disposes of Appellant’s argument regarding the admissibility of Weiner’s testimony, attributing any such deficiency in Dr. Weiner’s testimony as a result of Appellant’s “non-cooperation” or “recalcitrance.” Majority opinion at 929. The majority apparently adopts the Commonwealth’s position that Appellant impeded the interview process concluding that Appellant cannot challenge the admissibility of the evidence. I cannot agree with this reasoning because it contradicts the trial court’s order finding that Appellant “substantially complied” with the interview process. Indeed, the majority uses the trial court’s order to refute Appellant’s argument that Dr. Weiner had an insufficient basis for his testimony. The majority cannot have it both ways.</p>
    <p id="b401-6" data-blocks='[["BL_401.6",401,[174,2029,1152,362]],["BL_402.1",402,[277,347,1162,193]]]'>I also am not persuaded by Appellant’s arguments because they do not accurately reflect what occurred during the pretrial litigation of this matter. Contrary to Appellant’s implications, the Commonwealth did not represent that Dr. Weiner could not testify regarding Appellant’s mental state because of the lack of face-to-face interview time, but asserted that Appellant should be precluded from offering any evidence of <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>mental infirmity because he did not cooperate with the interview process. Thus, the parties are talking apples and oranges, and I would not adopt either party’s analysis of this issue.</p>
    <p id="b402-5" data-blocks='[["BL_402.4",402,[273,579,1165,742]]]'>Rather, I join the result of the majority opinion on this issue simply because the Commonwealth laid an adequate foundation for Dr. Weiner’s rebuttal testimony at the penalty phase. Specifically, Dr. Weiner testified before the trial court, without the jury present that he had reviewed “[a]t least 211” sources of information in preparing his report for the penalty phase, N.T., 11/10/2001, at 1074; and that these sources of information included police reports, interviews with medical personnel, and reports from medical personnel, <em><a href="/a2d/776/0958-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="776 A.2d 958" data-case-ids="11083104,124681" data-case-paths="/a2d/776/0958-01,/pa/565/0504-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/776/0958-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="776 A.2d 958" data-case-ids="11083104,124681" data-case-paths="/a2d/776/0958-01,/pa/565/0504-01">at 1081, 1084-85</a>. Furthermore, he stated that he- could render an opinion without the aid of the interviews with Appellant. <em><a href="/a2d/776/0958-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="776 A.2d 958" data-case-ids="11083104,124681" data-case-paths="/a2d/776/0958-01,/pa/565/0504-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/776/0958-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="776 A.2d 958" data-case-ids="11083104,124681" data-case-paths="/a2d/776/0958-01,/pa/565/0504-01">at 1074-75</a>. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this testimony and the weight to be accorded such testimony was for the jury.</p>
