This language, according to the majority, distinguished prior case law and other policies regarding collapse from the policy at issue, and required a different result.

Investors Insurance contends that under well-established Pennsylvania case law by this Court, the term “collapse,” as contained in an insurance policy, has been interpreted to require the actual falling down of the wall. Here, the wall did not collapse, and in the absence of such a collapse, Fourth Street is not entitled to coverage. Furthermore, according to Investors Insurance, the terms “risks” and “involving” neither removed this case from our prior controlling case law nor did they expand coverage, and by engaging in a tortured construction of the policy language, the Superior Court improperly broadened coverage by not requiring an actual collapse. Additionally, Investors Insurance maintains that the Superior Court ignored that the policy specifically excluded from coverage “bulging” and that on this basis, Fourth Street is not <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>entitled to relief. Finally, Investors Insurance echoes Judge Orie Melvin’s concern that insurers would now be subject to numerous claims seeking recovery for every defect based on an infinitesimal risk of collapse, regardless of the imminence of the danger, thus, turning the insurance policy into a maintenance policy.</p>
    <p id="b648-4" data-blocks='[["BL_648.4",648,[274,671,1163,1053]]]'>Fourth Street counters that the Superior Court majority properly interpreted the policy language which covered Fourth Street’s “risk of direct physical loss involving collapse,” when the wall of the building was in danger of collapse. As the term “collapse” was not defined by Investors Insurance, it was for the court to construe. According to Fourth Street, the term “collapse,” as well as the phrase “risks of direct physical loss involving collapse,” is ambiguous, and a growing majority of courts have defined the term “collapse” as “any serious impairment of structural integrity.” Thus, the policy language reasonably includes not just when a wall actually falls, but also when a wall is in imminent danger of falling. Furthermore, unlike the policies at issue in prior case law, the language which includes the terms <em>risk </em>of direct physical loss <em>involving </em>collapse provides broader coverage to Fourth Street. Finally, Fourth Street offers that it would be against public policy only to find insurance coverage when an insured’s building actually falls to the ground, as it would endanger the lives of persons in and around the building as well as surrounding properties.</p>

Investors Insurance argues that the terms “risks” and “involving” neither remove this case from our prior controlling case law nor did they expand coverage. Fourth Street offers that the policy language includes when a wall is in imminent danger of falling and that, unlike the policies at issue in prior case law, the language which includes the phrase <em>risk </em>of direct physical loss <em>involving </em>collapse provides broader coverage.</p>

Albeit not argued in any meaningful fashion by Investors Insurance, we also find that the exclusion from the definition of the term "collapse" for "bulging” does not compel summary judgment in favor of Investors Insurance. Although an insurance contract may state that a collapse did not include settling, cracking, shrinking, bulging, or expansion, it is difficult to imagine a collapse that would not include some of these attributes. Thus, the term "collapse” can reasonably be interpreted as not including minor settling, cracking, or bulging, but includes settling, cracking, or bulging that result in the collapse or, pursuant to the language of the policy provision at issue here, immediate collapse, of the structure. Indeed, coverage under the policy language at issue <em>sub judice </em>would be illusory and contrary to the intent of the parties if bulging was part of an imminent collapse and yet this condition was excluded from coverage. <em>Accord American Concept Ins.

Likewise, summary judgment is proper in cases in which "an adverse party who will bear the burden of proof at trial has failed to produce evidence of facts essential to a cause of action or defense in which a jury trial would require the issues to be submitted to a jury." Pa.R.Civ.P. 1035.2(2). In considering the merits of a motion for summary judgment, a court views the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact must be resolved against the moving party. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>SEPTA, </em><a href="/pa/565/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="565 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="124712" data-case-paths="/pa/565/0211-01">565 Pa. 211</a>, <a href="/a2d/772/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="772 A.2d 435" data-case-ids="11093519,11093586,124712,124767" data-case-paths="/a2d/772/0435-01,/a2d/772/0435-02,/pa/565/0211-01,/pa/565/0210-01">772 A.2d 435</a>, 438 (2001). In considering whether there exists a genuine issue of material fact, the court does not weigh the evidence, but determines whether a reasonable jury, faced with the evidence presented, could return a verdict for the non-moving party. It is only after a non-moving party survives the motion for summary judgment that the finder of fact on remand weighs the evidence and determines whether the party has proven each element of its claim. <em>Accord, Redland Soccer Club v. Department of the Army, </em><a href="/pa/548/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="548 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="960588" data-case-paths="/pa/548/0178-01">548 Pa. 178</a>, <a href="/a2d/696/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="696 A.2d 137" data-case-ids="12021120,960588" data-case-paths="/a2d/696/0137-01,/pa/548/0178-01">696 A.2d 137</a>, 147 (1997).

We recognize that after the Superior Court determined that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the insurance policy, it was not necessarily proper for the Superior Court to continue and to speak to whether or not there was a genuine issue as to material fact regarding imminent collapse, and instead, should have remanded the matter for consideration by the trial court in light of its determination.

While I agree that the term “risks of direct physical loss” is intended to reflect a broad form of coverage, its basic function is to extend coverage to a range of fortuitous events (such as fire, lightning, explosion, windstorm, hail, and smoke), <em>see generally </em>Lee R. Russ, 10 Couch on Insurance § 148.50 (2003), but not to protect against losses occasioned in mere anticipation of future events of these sorts. Indeed, in the policy at issue, “risks of direct physical loss” is not an isolated phrase confined to the collapse provision, but rather, stands as the central conception delineating the basic coverage provided, as it is specifically designated as being coterminous with “Covered Causes of Loss.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

      <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>The way collapse is handled in the policy at issue is that it is subject, in the first instance, to a specific exclusion from the broad conferral of coverage, and thus, removed from the range of covered causes of loss (or the applicable risks of direct physical loss). <em>See </em>Policy, Cause of Loss—Special Form ¶ B(2)(k), R.R. 2a. The policy then affords specific coverage for collapse as “additional coverage,” but subject to several express limitations. <em>See </em>Policy, Cause of Loss—Special Form ¶0. In connection with this treatment, the language relied upon by the majority to extend coverage relative to future events in fact merely functions to restore collapse to the category of covered causes of losses, thereby reflecting the policy’s treatment of such risk as a defined one in an otherwise all-risk policy. <em>Accord Ramsden v.
