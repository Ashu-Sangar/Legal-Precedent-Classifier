In light of the discerned tension between these jurisdictional provisions, the Court proceeded to select the appropriate forum based upon its evaluation of relevant policy considerations, emphasizing that the Commonwealth Court was conceived in an effort to provide a forum for the uniform and consistent resolution of questions of statewide importance. <em>See CRY, </em><a href="/pa/536/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="536 Pa. 462" data-case-ids="1843154" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0462-01">536 Pa. at 473</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="640 A.2d 372" data-case-ids="1843154,7861709" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0462-01,/a2d/640/0372-01">640 A.2d at 378</a> (quoting <em>Action Coalition of Elders v.

Thus, the Department contends that the case squarely implicates the same sorts of fundamental attributes of an administrative agency’s power that were at issue in <em>CRY, </em>namely, its enforcement authority and discretion. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 21 (“It is hard to think of anything of greater statewide importance to executive administrative agencies in general, or the Pennsylvania DEP in particular, than limiting and directing an agency’s enforcement actions.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a>

      <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>The Department appears to be correct that the uniformity concern that controlled the outcome in <em>CRY </em>centered upon the consistent and regular application of standards governing Commonwealth agencies over and across the range of cases implicating their enabling statutes and governing regulations, and not on the statewide significance of discrete aspects of individual cases, such as the number of citizens or counties that happen to be immediately affected by a particular instance of litigation. Accordingly, I believe that <em>CRY’s </em>rationale is pertinent in resolving the jurisdictional dispute in the present case. Moreover, application of the rationale offered by the Commonwealth Court to distinguish <em>CRY </em>would result either in identical citizen-suit provisions being construed differently in two parallel statutory schemes, or, alternatively, in an vague jurisdictional scheme in which the appropriate court of original jurisdiction would be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the reviewing court’s assessment of the importance of the particular litigation to the general public interest.</p>

Specifically, <em>CRY </em>relied on an asserted conflict between a general statutory provision, 42 Pa.C.S. § 761(a)(1), and a particular one, 85 P.S. § 691.601(c), to justify reliance on a policy-based assessment to give effect solely to the general provision. Such approach, however, contravenes the General Assembly’s prescription that, in the event of an irreconcilable conflict between general and particular statutes, <em>the particular </em>statute is to be afforded precedence. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1933. Moreover, in discerning a conflict in the first instance, <em>CRY </em>also failed to give meaning or effect to the Clean <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>Streams Law’s express conferral of jurisdiction in the courts of common pleas “[a]ny other provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding.” 35 P.S. § 691.601(c). In light of these deficiencies, although I acknowledge the legitimacy of DEP’s efforts to invoke <em>CRY’s </em>reasoning in light of its status as prevailing precedent, as well as the Department’s valid and substantial concern about the uniform and consistent treatment of administrative agencies, I conclude that the plain language of the BMSA establishing jurisdiction in the common pleas courts must control.</p>
