Specifically, we are asked to determine whether a purchaser of real property has constructive notice of a mortgage when the mortgage is properly recorded but defectively indexed. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the applicable statutory authority mandates that a purchaser in such an instance is deemed to have constructive notice. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b662-8" data-blocks='[["BL_662.8",662,[273,1293,1164,742]]]'>First Citizens National Bank (“First Citizens”) bought a piece of real property, which had been owned by J. Joel Turrell as Trustee for Genevieve Van Noy (“Turrell”), by virtue of a Sheriffs Deed. Prior to the purchase, First Citizens searched the mortgage index and discovered no encumbrances. After the sale was completed, First Citizens learned that Turrell had executed a mortgage in favor of Arthur W. Sherwood (“Sherwood”). The Bradford County Recorder of Deeds had properly recorded the Sherwood-Turrell mortgage. The mortgage was misindexed, however. Instead of being indexed under Turrell’s name, it was indexed under Van Noy’s name. Apparently, First Citizens had not cross-checked the mortgage index under Van Noy’s name as well as Turrell’s and thus did not discover the mortgage.</p>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of First Citizens. It held that when a lien had been improperly indexed, subsequent purchasers would not be deemed to have constructive notice of the lien. Accordingly, as the Sherwood-Turrell mortgage had <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>been improperly indexed, the trial court concluded that First Citizens would not be deemed to have constructive notice of it.</p>

The Superior Court, relying heavily on case law from other jurisdictions, reasoned that a subsequent purchaser shall not be deemed to have notice of a prior lien so long as a “diligent search” would not have uncovered the lien. <em>First Citizens Nat’l Bank v. Sherwood, </em><a href="/a2d/817/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="817 A.2d 501" data-case-ids="9365837" data-case-paths="/a2d/817/0501-01">817 A.2d 501</a>, 504-05 (Pa.Super.Ct.2003). The Superior Court held that the question of diligence is a factual one, dependent upon how accessible the records were at the time the search was conducted. Of import to the Superior Court was whether the particular county’s records were computerized or not. As the trial court had not conducted a factual inquiry into how accessible Bradford County’s records were, the Superior Court remanded this matter to the trial court for further proceedings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The first states that when a written agreement relating to real property is recorded, “[t]he legal effect of the recording of such agreements shall be to give constructive notice to subsequent purchasers....” 21 P.S. § 357.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Section 357 goes on to state <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>that “the rights of the subsequent purchasers ... shall be limited thereby with the same force and effect as if said subsequent purchasers ... had actually joined in the execution of the [mortgage].... ” The second statute applies in those instances when a mortgage is properly indexed, and provides that such proper indexing “shall be notice to all persons of recording of the same.” 16 P.S. § 9853.</p>
    <p id="b664-4" data-blocks='[["BL_664.7",664,[279,756,1157,524]]]'>In applying these statutes to the matter <em>sub judice, </em>we are guided by the principles of our Statutory Construction Act. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1501 <em>et seq. </em>The polestar in construing statutes is that where the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, we must apply them as written. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). The judiciary is not granted the liberty to disregard the plain words “under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” <em><a href="/pa/571/0637-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="813 A.2d 659" data-case-ids="1070133,9380819" data-case-paths="/pa/571/0637-01,/a2d/813/0659-01">Id.</a> </em>Furthermore, in the event that two statutes are in conflict, “the statute latest in date of final enactment shall prevail.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1936.</p>
    <p id="b665-3" data-blocks='[["BL_665.3",665,[174,343,1151,678]]]'>
      <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>In applying these principles, we conclude that the language of 21 P.S. § 357 is plain and unambiguous. Per § 357, the legal effect of the recording of a written agreement such as a mortgage is to give subsequent purchasers constructive notice of the mortgage. There is no ambiguity in the statute. There is no scope for us to read into that statute an equitable exception whereby a subsequent purchaser may be excused from constructive notice when the mortgage was properly recorded but improperly indexed. In applying 21 P.S. § 357 to the matter <em>sub judice, </em>First Citizens must be deemed to have constructive notice of the Sherwood-Turrell mortgage as it is beyond cavil that the Sherwood-Turrell mortgage was properly recorded.</p>
    <p id="b665-4" data-blocks='[["BL_665.4",665,[174,1044,1153,574]]]'>First Citizens attempts to avoid this conclusion via two separate arguments. First, it argues that 16 P.S. § 9853 supports its position that a subsequent purchaser has no notice of a mortgage where that mortgage is improperly indexed, regardless of whether the mortgage was properly recorded. As noted by First Citizens, § 9853 states that a properly indexed mortgage shall be notice to all persons of the recording of the mortgage. First Citizens argues that if a proper indexing is notice to all persons, then the obverse is true: a subsequent purchaser presumptively has <em>no </em>notice where a mortgage is improperly indexed.</p>
    <p id="b665-5" data-blocks='[["BL_665.5",665,[174,1642,1150,202]]]'>This argument fails. First, 16 P.S. § 9853 does not create a negative inference—namely, § 9853 does not stand for the proposition that a subsequent purchaser <em>per se </em>lacks notice where a mortgage is improperly indexed.</p>
    <p id="b665-6" data-blocks='[["BL_665.6",665,[175,1868,1153,518]],["BL_666.1",666,[277,347,1161,203]]]'>Furthermore, even if this were a logical interpretation of 16 P.S. § 9853, First Citizens would still not be entitled to relief. This is because such an interpretation of 16 P.S. § 9853 is squarely at odds with 21 P.S. § 357’s dictate that proper recordation of a mortgage constitutes constructive notice of the mortgage to subsequent purchasers. Accordingly, even if we were to adopt First Citizens construction of 16 P.S. § 9853, then we would have to find that 21 P.S. § 357 and 16 P.S. § 9853 are in conflict with each other. Were we to find that the two statutes were in conflict, 21 P.S. § 357 would prevail <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>in any contest between the two because it was the statute enacted later in time.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
      <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1936 (stating that in the event that two statutes are in conflict with one another, “the statute latest in date of final enactment shall prevail.”).</p>
    <p id="b666-4" data-blocks='[["BL_666.4",666,[275,577,1161,365]]]'>First Citizens’ next argument is that we cannot follow the plain language of 16 P.S. § 357 because it conflicts with <em>Prouty v. Marshall, </em><a href="/pa/225/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="225 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="965327" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0570-01">225 Pa. 570</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=74%20A.%20550" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="74 A. 550">74 A. 550</a> (1909). In brief, this Court in <em>Prouty </em>declared that where a mortgage is defectively recorded and wrongly indexed, a purchaser of the mortgaged premises without actual notice is not chargeable with constructive notice of such a mortgage.</p>
    <p id="b666-5" data-blocks='[["BL_666.5",666,[273,968,1162,628]]]'>
      <em>Prouty </em>does not support First Citizens position. First, the factual scenario in <em>Prouty </em>was quite different from that in the matter <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Prouty, </em>the mortgage in that instance was not only improperly indexed but also defectively recorded. In this matter, it is without question that the mortgage was properly recorded. Furthermore, even if <em>Prouty </em>could be read to stand for the proposition that a subsequent purchaser will not be deemed to have constructive notice of a properly recorded but improperly indexed mortgage, it does not control the outcome of this matter as such a putative holding was effectively abrogated when the Legislature promulgated 16 P.S. § 357.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

This concept is that we should adopt First Citizens’ position because it is sensible.

    <p id="b668-5" data-blocks='[["BL_668.6",668,[271,588,1161,635]]]'>First, § 357 does not apply to mortgage recording at all. It is found in Title 21 of Pennsylvania Statutes, titled “Deeds and Mortgages.” Statutes involving these two related but quite independent subjects are then subdivided into separate chapters: Chapter 1 is entitled “Deeds and General Provisions”; Chapter 2 is entitled “Mortgages.” Section 357, which the majority interprets and relies on to resolve this mortgage question, is found in Chapter 1, not Chapter 2. For issues regarding mortgages, Chapter 1 and § 357 do not presumptively or automatically control. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1924 (headings prefixed to chapters of statute shall not be considered to control but may aid in construction).</p>

The Deeds Chapter places § 357 under the heading and sub-heading, respectively: “Registration and Recording: Necessity of Recording and Compulsory Recording.” Under this same sub-heading is § 356, which the majority properly notes “establishes the scope of those documents to which § 357 applies. ...” Majority Op. at 469 n. 2, 879 A.2d at 180 n. 2 (citing <em>First Citizens Nat’l Bank v.

A mortgage is not such a conveyance, for <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>a mortgage is not of a permanent nature—it is a document encumbering a property until a specified debt is repaid. While the average homeowner may come to think of their mortgage as almost permanent, it is at most a limited and provisional transfer.</p>
    <p id="b669-4" data-blocks='[["BL_669.4",669,[172,642,1158,963]]]'>Once the debt is paid, the encumbrance is gone—it is not “of a permanent nature.” As this requirement is clear and unambiguous, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b), it must be applied. Thus, the majority’s approval of the Superior Court’s statement that § 357 applies to “all writings relating to real property,” Majority Op., at 469 n. 2, 879 A.2d at 180 n. 2 (citation omitted), including mortgages is far too sweeping—it ignores the very words of the section itself—the writings must convey rights <em>of a permanent nature. </em>If we are to interpret this statute, let us not start with a truncated reading of the statute’s terms—to give effect to all the statute’s terms, as we must, we must ask if mortgages convey permanent rights in the property. Simply and most basically, they do not—when the obligation is paid, the mortgage is satisfied and terminated (on pain of statutory penalty, <em>see </em>21 P.S. §§ 681, 682). Consideration of the entirety of § 357 shows unambiguously that it does not speak at all to the recording of mortgages, which are not and cannot be deemed “of a permanent nature.”</p>

The purpose of recording a mortgage is to give notice to the world that a property is encumbered, but proper recording necessarily implies proper indexing, for that is where the world must go to get that notice. Imperfect indexing is imperfect notice-to hold that the mere recordation of a mortgage without proper indexing places an innocent party on constructive notice puts an undue, nay impossible, burden on that party. A subsequent purchaser simply cannot look at every one of the thousands of mortgages filed in the Recorder of Deed’s office. That is why it is a longstanding principle that “the record is notice of just what it contains, no more and no less. The obligation of seeing that the record of an instrument is correct, must properly rest upon its holder.” <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>

A reading of § 9852 shows that the General Assembly intended recording and indexing to go hand in hand. <em>See Penn Title Ins. Co. v. Deshler, </em><a href="/a2d/661/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="661 A.2d 481" data-case-ids="7873136" data-case-paths="/a2d/661/0481-01">661 A.2d 481</a>, 487 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995) (“We construe [§ ] 9851 to require three (3) elements in the recording of deeds and mortgages by a [recorder of deeds] ...: 1) name of the grantor, 2) name of the grantee, and 3) volume and page of the recorded instrument.”). Even if “proper recording” can be otherwise interpreted to require less than proper indexing, this is only “proper” insofar as it may protect one’s title to land or priority of liens; however, it is not notice to the world. To hold that the recording of a mortgage without proper indexing is sufficient to give constructive notice to those who search the index produces an indefensible result. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922 (presumption in ascertaining intent of General Assembly in enacting statute is that result is <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>not intended to be absurd, impossible of execution, or unreasonable).</p>
    <p id="b671-4" data-blocks='[["BL_671.4",671,[166,465,1157,947]]]'>The duty of indexing mortgages and deeds is placed on the Recorder of Deeds, but as between the parties, the mortgagee ultimately bears the risk of improper indexing. Section 9853 specifically addresses the subject of notice: “[t]he entry of recorded deeds and mortgages <em>in said indexes, </em>respectively, shall be notice to all persons of recording of the same.” 16 P.S. § 9858. Clearly, the absence of good indexing cannot be good notice. In order to protect its interest and place those who may later search on constructive notice, <em>see Globalnet, supra, </em>the mortgagee must bear the burden of checking the proper indexes after recordation to insure that the Recorder of Deeds properly indexed and recorded the mortgage. This is a small burden indeed for the mortgagee—it is an impossible burden to place on the public. It is the mortgagee who asks for the mortgage in return for advancing money. It is the mortgagee that files the mortgage in order to protect its security interest. <em>Prouty, </em>at 551 (“[A mortgagee] cannot hide behind the mistake of the recorder.”).</p>
    <blockquote id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.5",671,[207,1432,1113,793]]]'>It is an easy matter for a mortgagee, or a grantee in each particular instance, either in person, <em>or by a representative, </em>to look at the record, and see that the instrument has been properly entered.... There is every reason why it should be made the duty of the mortgagee to see that his instrument is properly recorded. This will not in any way interfere with the principle that, when the instrument is certified as recorded, it shall import notice of the contents from the time of filing; but that must be understood as in connection with an instrument properly recorded. As said above, the record is notice of just what it contains, no more and no less. The obligation of seeing that the record of an instrument is correct must properly rest upon its holder. If he fails to protect himself, the consequence cannot justly be shifted upon an innocent purchaser.</blockquote>

Allowing improper indexing to serve as notice to the world is illogical, and the conclusion that 16 P.S. § 9853 conflicts with § 357’s plain meaning is erroneous. In fact, the majority’s abridged reading of § 357 actually renders 16 P.S. § 9853 meaningless.
