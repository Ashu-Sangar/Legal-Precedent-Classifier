    </p>
    <p id="b634-5" data-blocks='[["BL_634.5",634,[275,556,1162,512]]]'>PHA owned the residence at 2114 Taney Terrace (“the residence”), a low-income housing unit constructed prior to 1978 that contained lead-based paints. Louise Pringle (“Pringle”) began leasing the residence on November 19, 1990, and lived there with her children until November 1994. Although required to, PHA did not notify Pringle of the lead paint in her residence and the associated dangers. Further, PHA did not maintain the premises, allowing paint to peel and chip. The paint was loosening in areas throughout the interior of the residence, specifically on chewable and high-friction surfaces.</p>
    <p id="b634-6" data-blocks='[["BL_634.6",634,[273,1090,1162,829]]]'>Appellee Tyree Ford (“Ford”) was born on October 26, 1991, and lived with his mother, Pringle, at the residence. He would ingest the paint chips that had fallen off the walls and surfaces of his home. As early as one-year-old, Ford tested positive for childhood lead poisoning. His chronic lead poisoning continued for three years, and in September of 1994, his blood lead level became dangerously elevated. He was admitted to the hospital and began three weeks of treatment to reduce the level of lead in his blood. On August 5, 1994, PHA received notice that Ford had elevated blood lead levels. On September 22, 1994, PHA received a second notice when Ford experienced another heightened blood lead level. PHA then contracted for lead testing of the residence. After receiving the test results, PHA notified Pringle of the presence of lead in the residence. As a result of the lead exposure, Ford suffers from brain damage.</p>

Ford and Pringle were awarded damages of $210,000.00 on the negligence claim and of $5,832.00 on the breach of implied warranty of habitability claim.

      <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>On appeal to the Commonwealth Court, PHA contended that the trial court erred in denying its Posh-Trial Motion because: (1) Pringle failed to timely file a notice of claim within six months from the date of the injury as required by Section 5522(a)(2); (2) no evidence was presented that PHA’s negligence caused Ford’s lead exposure; (3) the trial court erred in awarding damages for breach of an implied warranty of habitability because contract damages were not the damages that were suffered by Ford, and no implied warranty of habitability cause of action exists in federally funded housing; and (4) the trial court erred in awarding damages because Ford did not prove all of the essential elements for such a cause of action.</p>

    <p id="b639-5" data-blocks='[["BL_639.5",639,[164,561,1155,686]]]'>It is apparent to me that the question presented by PHA is one that this Court should address. It is an issue of first impression. Further, the Commonwealth Courts decision conflicts with previous decisions of that court and with decisions of the Superior Court. It is equally clear that where we have found that the words “exercising the public powers of the Commonwealth as an agency thereof’ signify that the government entity in question is a part of the Commonwealth government, we are bound by that reasoning. Thus, I believe the obvious conclusion in the instant matter is that PHA is a Commonwealth agency and benefits from the immunity afforded to all such components of the Commonwealth government pursuant to 1 Pa.C.S. § 2310.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a>
