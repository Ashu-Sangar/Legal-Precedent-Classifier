Additionally, we are called upon to determine whether the trial court erred in granting Appellee Gregory Ludwig’s Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus based upon the Commonwealth’s failure to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case under Section 2506. For the reasons that follow, we hold that Section 2506 is not unconstitutionally vague and that the applicable mental state for a conviction under the statute is malice. We further conclude, however, that the Commonwealth has failed to establish ¿ <em>prima facie </em>case of malice under Section 2506. Accordingly, we affirm the order of the trial court, granting Ludwig’s Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus with respect to the charge of Drug delivery resulting in death.</p>
    <p id="b206-8" data-blocks='[["BL_206.7",206,[270,1522,1163,799]]]'>The facts underlying this appeal are not in dispute. On the evening of May 17, 2001, fifteen-year-old Brandy French (Brandy), eighteen-year-old Paula Wilson (Paula), and seventeen-year-old Michelle Maranuk (Michelle) discussed with one another their desire to consume the drug Ecstasy at an all-day concert that they would be attending the following day. After the conversation, Michelle contacted a recent acquaintance, nineteen-year-old Ludwig, and informed him that she was interested in purchasing Ecstasy for herself and two of her friends. Ludwig replied that he would be willing to sell Michelle three Ecstasy pills at a price of $20 a pill and offered to meet her at the local Dairy Queen later that evening. Michelle relayed that information to Brandy and Paula, and the girls then arranged for Paula’s boyfriend, Robert Sontag, to drive them to the Dairy Queen to meet Ludwig.</p>
    <p id="b207-4" data-blocks='[["BL_207.3",207,[168,353,1153,313]]]'>
      <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>Upon arriving at the Dairy Queen, Ludwig entered the girls’ car, and the entire group took a short drive. During the drive, Michelle took $20 from Paula and Brandy and handed Ludwig $60. In return, Ludwig supplied Michelle with three tablets of white double-stacked Mitsubishi Ecstasy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Michelle kept all of the pills until the next day.</p>
    <p id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[167,698,1154,583]]]'>At approximately 4:00 p.m. the following afternoon, the three girls met in the ladies’ room at the concert to take the Ecstasy. Michelle gave Paula and Brandy each a pill, but advised them to take only one-half of a pill, because it was double-dosed, and neither Paula nor Brandy had previously taken Ecstasy. The girls then ingested their pills, Michelle taking her whole pill and Paula and Brandy taking one-half of their respective pills. Paula and Brandy, however, believing that they had not experienced the full effects of the Ecstasy, returned to the ladies’ room a short while later and consumed the remaining halves of their pills.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b207-6" data-blocks='[["BL_207.5",207,[167,1311,1154,365]]]'>Soon after consuming the second half of her pill, Brandy began to vomit. She also complained of a severe headache and became sluggish. After discussing the situation with some other friends they had met at the concert, Michelle, Paula, and their friends decided that they would take Brandy to the home of Lewis Hopkins (Lewis), a friend of Michelle’s cousin, whom they had met at the concert.</p>
    <p id="b207-7" data-blocks='[["BL_207.6",207,[164,1708,1156,356]]]'>Upon arriving at Lewis’ home, the group carried Brandy, who was by that time semi-conscious, into the house and put her in a bed. The group then left Brandy in the bedroom and went to another part of the house. Lewis’ mother, who was home at the time, inquired into Brandy’s condition, but was told only that Brandy had been drinking at the concert and had become ill.</p>

      <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>At approximately 9:30 p.m., Brandy began to have difficulty breathing. Although it was suggested that someone call an ambulance, an ambulance was not called because Brandy’s breathing seemed to return to normal and Lewis’ mother objected to an ambulance coming to her home for fear that it would tarnish her reputation. More than an hour later, however, Paula noticed that Brandy again was having difficulty breathing. Realizing that Brandy needed immediate medical attention, Michelle, Paula, and Lewis decided to take Brandy to a hospital. Brandy, however, stopped breathing when the group reached Lewis’ driveway. At that point, Lewis’ mother telephoned 911. After their arrival, police and paramedics took Brandy to a hospital. Subsequently, on May 20, 2001, Brandy died; an autopsy determined that Brandy’s death was due to an overdose of Ecstasy.</p>
    <p id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.4",208,[283,1161,1158,308]]]'>As a result of these events, the Allegheny County Coroner’s Office held an Open Inquest into Brandy’s death. In August of 2001, the Coroner’s office ultimately recommended that the District Attorney file charges of murder against Ludwig and Michelle. Subsequently, Ludwig was charged with one count of drug delivery resulting in death pursuant to Section 2506.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The trial court granted Ludwig’s petition on both grounds and dismissed the charge premised upon Section 2506. <em>See Commonwealth v.

According to Ludwig, this lack of a clear standard leads to a risk of arbitrary governmental action. Conversely, the Commonwealth takes the position, employing a statutory construction approach, that by declaring a violation of Section 2506 to be “murder of the third degree” the Legislature intended to require a <em>mens rea </em>of malice. According to the Commonwealth, this is so because murder of the third degree has historically been defined by our Court to require proof of malice, citing to <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. Like the Commonwealth, the Attorney General, who has filed a brief as amicus curiae in this appeal, also contends that Section 2506 does not fail for vagueness, but offers that 18 Pa.C.S. § 302 provides a culpability element when the General Assembly does not prescribe an applicable <em>mens rea. </em>Interpreting this provision, the Attorney General maintains that the required <em>mens rea </em>for conviction under Section 2506 is “intentional, knowing, or reckless conduct.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 302(c).</p>

The law is clear and well-settled regarding the <em>mens rea </em>for third degree murder.

Indeed, malice aforethought is the essential distinguishing factor between murder and manslaughter in Pennsylvania. John Burkoff, Criminal Offenses and Defenses in Pennsylvania 267(4th ed. 2001). Likewise, other language in the Crimes Code also makes evident that malice is the appropriate mental state required to prove murder of the third degree. Specifically, in Chapter 26 <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>of the Crimes Code, the General Assembly clarifies that a degree of “Murder,” whether under Chapter 26 or Chapter 25, includes malice. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 2602 Definitions (“‘Murder.’ As used in this chapter, the term includes the same element of malice which is required to prove murder under Chapter 25 (relating to criminal homicide)”).

Moreover, we find that the Legislature, through these provisions has articulated the applicable <em>mens rea </em>with sufficient definiteness. <em>Kolender, </em><a href="/us/461/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="461 U.S. 352" data-case-ids="11298570" data-case-paths="/us/461/0352-01">461 U.S. at 357</a>, <a href="/us/461/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="461 U.S. 352" data-case-ids="11298570" data-case-paths="/us/461/0352-01">103 S.Ct. 1855</a>. Furthermore, by providing a <em>mens rea </em>of malice, the Legislature has supplied minimal guidelines regarding the elements necessary for a conviction pursuant to Section 2506 that are sufficiently definite.

Moreover, the parties’ actions demonstrate that all involved had a common understanding of the nature of the transaction and that the girls in fact sought out the transaction.

If there was any evidence that Ludwig had concealed the fact that it was a double dose, or evidence that Ludwig surreptitiously increased the double dose to a triple dose while offering it to the girls in the packaging of a double dose, it at least might be arguable that it is indicative of a wickedness, hardness of heart, cruelty, and recklessness; however, these are not the facts of the case.</p>

Thus, the General Assembly enacts strict liability offenses only in limited circumstances, such as for public welfare offenses, which "do not fit neatly into any of such accepted classifications of common-law offenses, such as those against the state, the person, property, or public morals.” <em>Morissette v.

"[TJhese offenses are not in the nature of positive aggressions or invasions, with which the common law so often dealt, but are in the nature of neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it imposes a duty.” <em>Morissette, </em><a href="/us/342/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="342 U.S. 246" data-case-ids="641097" data-case-paths="/us/342/0246-01">342 U.S. at 255</a>, <a href="/us/342/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="342 U.S. 246" data-case-ids="641097" data-case-paths="/us/342/0246-01">72 S.Ct. 240</a>. Furthermore, “violations of such [offenses] result in no direct or immediate injury to person or property but merely create the danger or probability of it which the law seeks to minimize.” <em><a href="/us/342/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="342 U.S. 246" data-case-ids="641097" data-case-paths="/us/342/0246-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/342/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="342 U.S. 246" data-case-ids="641097" data-case-paths="/us/342/0246-01">at 255-56</a>, <a href="/us/342/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="342 U.S. 246" data-case-ids="641097" data-case-paths="/us/342/0246-01">72 S.Ct. 240</a>. Another characteristic of these offenses is that they tend to impose relatively small penalties and conviction “does not grave[ly] damage ... an offender’s reputation.” <em>Id.) see also </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 302(a)(1) (excepting summary offenses, which are offenses for which a convicted person <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>may only be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 90 days or less, from default culpability provision). Notably, none of these characteristics concerning strict liability offenses are present with respect to the offense of drug delivery resulting in death. Unlike typical strict liability offenses, the offense of drug delivery resulting in death concerns a crime of aggression in which another person is fatally injured as a direct result of consuming an illegal substance sold to her by the person charged with violating the offense. Moreover, the offense imposes a stringent penalty of at least five years of imprisonment and a fine of $15,000. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 2506(b). Accordingly, under these circumstances, I agree with the apparent conclusion of the majority that the General Assembly did not intend the offense of drug delivery resulting in death to be a strict liability offense.</p>

Notably, the trial court also found that section 2506 was unconstitutionally vague because it does not provide sufficient guidelines regarding the element of causation. However, I also disagree with the trial court's conclusion in this regard because, just like section 302 of the Crimes Code provides the culpability element for section 2506, section 303 of the Crimes Code clarifies the element of causation for section 2506. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 303.</p>

Indeed, I note that if the elements of the offense of third-degree murder were automatically bootstrapped into any separate offense classified as a type of third-degree murder, there would be no need to separately create such an offense because the conduct qualifying as third-degree murder under the separate offense would also constitute third-degree murder under the general offense of third-degree murder. Thus, the separate third-degree murder offense would simply be superfluous.</p>

Fochtman, the director and chief toxicologist in the Forensic Laboratory Division of the Allegheny County Coroner’s Office, explained during the Open Inquest that Ecstasy pills are illicitly manufactured, meaning "that they are not being manufactured under any standards of good laboratory practice or good manufacturing practice."

Dr. Fochtman further testified that because these drugs are produced in such a manner, some pills might contain double or triple the quantity of Ecstasy that another pill might contain and some pills may also include other drugs besides Ecstasy. <em>See <a href="/us/342/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="342 U.S. 246" data-case-ids="641097" data-case-paths="/us/342/0246-01">id.</a> </em>at 72a, 80a. In explaining the effects of Ecstasy, Dr. Fochtman stated that "when the drug increases in concentration, then it will produce anxiety, agitation, it could provide-it could produce convulsions or seizures, it can cause a dystonia, where the person’s muscles become very firm and very rigid, and it also could cause a CNS depressant effect, which would depress the respirations, and in addition to that, it can have an arrhythmic effect, or cause the heart to beat irregularly.” <em><a href="/us/342/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="342 U.S. 246" data-case-ids="641097" data-case-paths="/us/342/0246-01">Id.</a> </em>at 81a. According to Dr. Fochtman, there are multiple ways that death can result from these effects of the drug. <em>See <a href="/us/342/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="342 U.S. 246" data-case-ids="641097" data-case-paths="/us/342/0246-01">id.</a> </em>at 82a.</p>

Any assertion by Ludwig that he was unaware that someone other than Michelle would ultimately consume the drug loses any potential viability when viewed in light of the Commonwealth’s evidence that Michelle informed Ludwig that she was purchasing two pills for her friends, and that those friends were present when Ludwig sold the pills to Michelle.</p>
