In 1997, OHCD initiated the Settlement Grant Program, designed to provide grants to middle and low income families to assist with the purchase of new homes. To qualify under the Program, an inspection of the home was required. Under the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between OHCD and the American Federation of State, Local, and Municipal Employees, Local Union No.1971, those inspections were to be performed by Union employees. At the inception of the Program, the Union had two “housing rehabilitation inspectors” among its 38 employees, capable of performing such work.</p>

In addition, the Union sought an award for the loss of work opportunities. On September 10, 1998, the Union filed a Demand for Arbitration, requesting an arbitrator “[m]ake all affected employees whole or, if no employees were adversely affected, make Union whole for loss or intrusion of jurisdiction.” Demand for Arbitration, at 1. The parties stipulated the issues to be submitted for arbitration, although OHCD argued the outsourcing did not violate the CBA.</p>

The arbitrator also found the “viability” of the Union had been damaged as a result of OHCD’s breach. Although finding no Union employees were injured, the two Union inspectors having been working full-time throughout, the arbitrator awarded the Union an “amount representing the number of inspections contracted <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>times the cost of bargaining unit inspectors to perform that work for the period of time in which OHCD [ ] retained [the] contractors.” <em>Id. </em>In other words, the monetary award equaled the wages Union workers would have been paid for performing the inspections.</p>

That court, citing its “circumscribed” role in reviewing arbitration awards, denied OHCD’s petition and affirmed the arbitrator’s award. OHCD then appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which reversed the award, finding “the arbitrator’s remedy did not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.” <em>City of Philadelphia Office of Housing and Community Development v.

With only two qualified housing inspectors in the Union at the time, who undisputedly remained fully employed throughout the period, it is speculative how many additional members could have been recruited into the Union to undertake this workload; the Union had not added any additional inspectors for the preceding five years.

Noting that government agencies have long been exempt from the imposition of punitive damages, <em>see Hermits of St. Augustine v. County of Philadelphia, </em>4 Clark 120, 7 Pa.L.J. 124 (1847), our Court echoed the concerns of the United States Supreme Court that punitive damages imposed on a municipality were, in effect, a windfall to a fully compensated plaintiff and are likely accompanied by an increase in taxes or a reduction of public services, citing to <em>Newport v.

Rather, it appears to me that the arbitrator was faced with a situation in which, pursuant to an express make-whole-remedy submission, he found it appropriate to compensate the Union for an injury that he legitimately deemed to be substantial. The difficulty, in my view, is not that the arbitrator set out to punish the City or that his make-whole objective was outside the scope of the collective bargaining agreement or the submission, but rather, that the arbitrator lacked any effective <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>methodology for quantifying damages in relation to the harm suffered by the Union. I therefore regard the courts’ characterization of the award as punitive as merely representing a judicial pronouncement grounded in speculation on the same order as that engaged in by the arbitrator.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

Prof. Ass’n (PSEA-NEA)), </em>560 Pa.135, <a href="/a2d/743/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="743 A.2d 405" data-case-ids="11487623,95778" data-case-paths="/a2d/743/0405-01,/pa/560/0135-01">743 A.2d 405</a>, 413 (1999). Indeed, like Justice Saylor, I see no evidence in the record that the arbitrator’s intent in fashioning the remedy at issue was punitive. To the contrary, it appears clear that the arbitrator was merely attempting to make the union whole for injuries it found the union to have suffered as <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>a result of the City’s violation of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement. As such, while I might agree in principle that the award was excessive, I nevertheless conclude that it was “rationally derived from” the collective bargaining agreement and must therefore be upheld. <em><a href="/a2d/743/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="743 A.2d 405" data-case-ids="11487623,95778" data-case-paths="/a2d/743/0405-01,/pa/560/0135-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/743/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="743 A.2d 405" data-case-ids="11487623,95778" data-case-paths="/a2d/743/0405-01,/pa/560/0135-01">at 413</a>.</p>

District 2, United Mine Workers of America, </em><a href="/pa/578/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="578 Pa. 347" data-case-ids="1329366" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0347-01">578 Pa. 347</a>, <a href="/pa/578/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="852 A.2d 299" data-case-ids="1329357,1329366,9230707,9230770" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0346-01,/pa/578/0347-01,/a2d/852/0299-01,/a2d/852/0299-02">852 A.2d 299</a>, 308 (2004). It is important to note that this Court has typically only applied this modified test in situations in which an arbitrator has reinstated an employee whom the public employer has discharged in furtherance of its core public functions. <em>See, e.g., Greene County, supra </em>(modified test applies when arbitrator reinstates employee whom Children and Youth Services has discharged for poor record-keeping practices); <em>City of Easton v.

Moreover, I would not apply it here, where the arbitrator did not reinstate a discharged employee and it simply cannot be said that the City’s actions in entering into three competitively-bid inspection contracts with non-Union firms was in proper furtherance of its core public functions.</p>
