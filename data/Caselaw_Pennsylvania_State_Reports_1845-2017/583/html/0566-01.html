Briefly, the essential facts are that on the evening of December 11, 1993, Appellant and his co-defendant, Rasheed Miller, pulled their car in front of the vehicle driven by Zachary Jackson. Appellant ordered Jackson out of his car at gunpoint and demanded money. Jackson refused, and Appellant shot him in the legs and torso four times. Appellant then retrieved another gun from his car and when Jackson continued to refuse Appellant’s demand for money, Appellant fatally shot Jackson one more time in the abdomen. Appellant and his co-defendant fled the scene. Appellant subsequently was arrested on unrelated charges whereupon he confessed to shooting Zachary Jackson.</p>

The jury found the existence of one aggravating circumstance, that the killing occurred during the perpetration of a felony (robbery), 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(6), and the existence of one mitigating circumstance, that Appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(1). After weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances found, the jury returned a penalty of death. On direct appeal, this court affirmed the judgment of sentence. <em>Washington, supra. </em>Appellant filed a petition for relief under the PCRA in July of 1998. Counsel was appointed and an amended petition was filed in April of 1999. The PCRA petition was supplemented with various affidavits in September, October, and November <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>of 1999.

As for the claims that were not previously litigated, the Commonwealth asserts those claims are waived and cannot be considered under the umbrella of relaxed waiver. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Furthermore, in that Appellant attempts to avoid waiver by raising all of his current claims as ineffectiveness of counsel, all that Appellant does in that regard is utter a boilerplate assertion that previous counsel were ineffective, which the Commonwealth argues is insufficient to warrant this court’s review of the claims.</p>

However, since a layered claim of ineffectiveness is typically a nested claim, the focus of the analysis turns on the ineffectiveness of trial counsel. In those cases in which the PCRA petitioner has properly pled and presented argument pursuant to the three-pronged test of <em>Pierce </em>on the question of trial counsel ineffectiveness, but failed to raise allegations, which even if accepted as true do not establish entitlement to relief on that underlying claim, there is no reason to remand for development of the claim of appellate counsel ineffectiveness per <em>McGill, </em>because the petitioner -will never be able to establish entitlement to PCRA relief. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s brief, however, does not fully meet the criteria set forth in <em>McGill </em>for properly pleading, presenting, and proving a claim of appellate counsel ineffectiveness. As Appellant does plead and present argument on each claim in accordance with the three-pronged test of <em>Pierce </em>as to trial counsel ineffectiveness, review of these claims is appropriate to determine if Appellant has proven trial counsel ineffectiveness, and if a remand is necessary to allow Appellant the opportunity to comply with <em>McGill. </em>With these standards in mind, we turn to a consideration of the substantive claims presented in the current PCRA appeal.</p>

Although we do not accept Appellant’s interpretation of the duty of loyalty owed from counsel to a client, nor his related assertion that the breach of that duty of loyalty would constitute per se prejudice, we do acknowledge that a claim of this nature is cognizable under the Sixth Amendment. An allegation of ineffectiveness put forth in this manner is disturbing as it asserts a total disintegration of the function of trial counsel, implying a violation of the ethical standards of the profession, a dereliction of counsel’s duty to the court, and a profound failure to the client.

Merely alleging that “my lawyer doesn’t like me,” would not be sufficient to require further consideration of a Sixth Amendment violation; however, in this case, because of the handwritten message by trial counsel depicting Appellant as “the banality of evil,” we are presented with more than a simple complaint that “my lawyer doesn’t like me.” This case raises a perplexing question as to the dynamics of the attorney-client relationship and the impact of that relationship upon counsel’s ability to act in a manner designed to effectuate the best interests of his client.</p>

This claim is presented by current counsel in hyperbolic terms which are more appropriate for pulp fiction than a legal pleading. The actual “factual” basis for the breach of loyalty claim is a letter that trial counsel wrote to a prospective defense psychiatric witness at the pre-trial stage, in which counsel stated that he hoped that appellant had “some redeeming qualities,” but feared that appellant “may epitomize the banality of evil.” This no doubt is a fear shared, if not often expressed or committed to writing, by many lawyers.</p>

In an even greater leap in logic, appellant then declares that counsel’s hatred “treacherously” led him to seek to undermine the defense so as to ensure a verdict of first degree murder and a death sentence. Appellant further declares that the litany of other deficiencies he has now belatedly discovered concerning counsel’s trial performance prove that counsel deliberately undertook to “sabotage” his defense, because of his animus.</p>

Thus, I join the Majority in its recognition: that the Sixth Amendment does not establish a right to a “meaningful” or “interpersonal” relationship between an accused and his counsel; that in order to sustain an ineffectiveness claim premised upon a breach of the “duty of loyalty,” the accused must show an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected the outcome of the case; and that prejudice cannot be presumed in this area.</p>

I respectfully disagree that this overwrought, bald proffer entitles appellant to an evidentiary hearing so that he may explore counsel’s reference to Arendt’s subtitle. It is notable that, although appellant has prepared a lengthy Ap<a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>pendix which contains numerous “declarations” from witnesses, he includes no proffer from trial counsel or direct appeal counsel with respect to this claim. Instead, appellant’s “case” against trial counsel is entirely a function of bringing his lawyer’s imagination to bear upon counsel’s letter. The Majority’s remand essentially allows appellant to engage in a fishing expedition with trial counsel, in the hopes that he might find something to substantiate what is at present merely rank, reckless and implausible speculation against another member of the Bar.</p>
    <p id="b782-4" data-blocks='[["BL_782.4",782,[270,891,1166,1376]]]'>If counsel had made this reference to his client during his examination of a witness at trial, or in remarks to the jury, appellant’s claim might warrant a hearing. When such a remark is made privately to a prospective defense professional witness, however, it simply does not warrant the Majority’s current assumption—as a matter of law—that the attorney must have deliberately sought to “sabotage” the defense. Lawyers are not required to have even an iota of affection for their clients in order to perform competently; indeed, if that were a requirement, many criminal defendants would be hard-pressed to secure adequate representation. Persons working in the criminal justice system, and particularly those working on the most serious of cases, may perforce become somewhat jaded. In this day and age, where merely robbing and shooting a person are not enough, but a gratuitous coup de grace is too often delivered, it is not surprising to think of the increasing banality of such evil acts. But the mere fact that a lawyer perceives this fact, and privately gives expression to the perception, does not prove that attorney’s “disloyalty,” much less does it prove “disloyalty” to the extent that counsel should be presumed to have ignored his professional responsibilities and deliberately sought to “sabotage” his client’s case. Appellant has leveled a very serious charge of professional misconduct here, and there should be some support for the charge beyond fevered speculation before an evidentiary hearing is awarded.</p>

A lawyer’s animosity toward his client, standing alone, is no basis for any collateral attack: as the Majority recognizes in setting forth the parameters for review, whether counsel was ineffective depends upon his actual performance, not his subjective beliefs or the “political correctness” of his correspondence. Nor is the purpose of PCRA evidentiary hearings to chastise lawyers for their impolitic commentary. Here, counsel committed something to writing which perhaps was flippant and ill-conceived, but he did so in a letter to a prospective defense witness. The fact of counsel’s letter suggests nothing concerning counsel’s preparation for or performance at trial. The Majority, thus, gets it backward: it is appellant’s actual claims that are the “backdrop” for his collateral attack; the question of counsel’s supposed “reasons” for trying the case as he did are a matter we need not reach unless one or more of those predicate claims prove to have arguable merit. No such finding has been made here. And so, I fear the Majority has been led astray by appellant’s exaggerations; the remand in this case is in my mind an overreaction to isolated commentary which may well prove to be entirely unrelated to, and unsupportive of, appellant’s actual claims.</p>
