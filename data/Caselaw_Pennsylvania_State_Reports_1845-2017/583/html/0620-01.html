Currently, the murder remains unsolved and a police investigation continues. Patricia Ross, the Blair County Coroner, preliminarily classified Buchanan’s death as a homicide at the crime scene. Subsequently, Dr. Harold Cottle, a forensic pathologist, conducted an autopsy of the body and authored the autopsy report at issue in this case. On November 20, 2001, appellant submitted a written request to Ross for the release of Buchanan’s autopsy report. However, on January 28, 2002, the Blair County District Attorney’s Office filed a petition for a preliminary injunction and protective order seeking to seal the autopsy report. In response to the Commonwealth’s petition appellant filed a motion to intervene and a motion to deny the Commonwealth’s petition. The trial court then issued a temporary injunction sealing the report pending a hearing on the issue of whether the report should remain sealed.</p>

Detective DeFrancisco testified that as part of a homicide investigation, the police use details contained in the autopsy report throughout the investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 62. He testified that the details could be used to identify the perpetrator and, during witness interviews, to determine the accuracy of the witness’s information and credibility. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, he explained that some witnesses are more credible than others during an investigation and those witnesses who provide details of the homicide not known to the general public, but documented in the autopsy report, can enhance their credibility and bolster the veracity of their statements. <em>Id. </em>Detective DeFrancisco then offered an opinion that releasing the autopsy report in this case would hinder or jeopardize the ongoing police investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 63.</p>

      <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>In determining that remand was appropriate, the Superior Court panel majority reasoned as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b829-4" data-blocks='[["BL_829.4",829,[210,471,1109,359]]]'>[I]t is not enough for the Commonwealth merely to assert that an investigation is ongoing. The Commonwealth must make a specific showing that the release of the report would have a substantial negative impact on its investigation—for example, by keeping witnesses from coming forth or preventing investigators from verifying information that they receive from informants.</blockquote>

      <em>Buchanan, </em><a href="/a2d/823/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="823 A.2d 147" data-case-ids="9122144" data-case-paths="/a2d/823/0147-01">823 A.2d at 153</a>. The panel majority noted that the trial court had failed to make specific findings of fact that would permit the Superior Court to determine whether release of Buchanan’s autopsy report would actually substantially hinder or jeopardize the ongoing investigation. We believe the panel’s approach is generally sound on this record. Upon remand, the trial court should determine whether the Commonwealth can establish that the release of the report in this case in fact poses a threat of substantially hindering or jeopardizing the ongoing investigation. In this consideration, the trial court may, pursuant to its broad discretionary authority, conduct an <em>in camera </em>review of the autopsy report, and consider additional evidence if proffered. Additionally, the trial court is free to determine whether a less restrictive means, such as redaction, is adequate to protect the Commonwealth’s interests. Finally, if appropriate, the trial court may require an additional showing by the Commonwealth that continued sealing of the report for a reasonable period is required to ensure the integrity of the ongoing investigation.</p>

Amicus posits that at the hearing, the Commonwealth submitted extensive testimony in support of its averments that the release of the autopsy report would hinder its investigation, most notably by alerting the perpetrator and/or suspects to information known by the investigative team; by depriving the investigators of the opportunity to test the veracity of statements offered by alleged witnesses or informants regarding the details surrounding the homicide known only to the perpetrator and investigative team; and by compromising the investigative team’s ability to obtain future search warrants based on the information contained in the report.
