Officer Hayes obtained treatment for her injury and Appellant the City of Philadelphia (the “City”) placed her on IOD status, which allowed her to receive disability benefits equal to 100 percent of her pre-injury base pay while she was out of work. <em>See </em>Civil Service Reg. 32.0414.

As a result of her continuing ankle problems, Officer Hayes returned to a limited duty position in April 2001. In late June 2001, Officer Hayes met with Dr. Chairman and following that meeting, Dr. Chairman concluded that Officer Hayes had chronic pain from the tear to her anterior talo fibular ligament. In July 2001, two doctors examined Officer Hayes at the City’s request and cleared her to return to her regular full duty patrol position. Thus, Officer Hayes reluctantly returned to full duty status in August 2001.</p>

She was taken to the emergency room, where she received treatment for injuries to her left knee, right arm and other areas of her upper body. Notably, Officer Hayes did not immediately notice any increased pain to her right ankle at the time of the fall. Moreover, following the fall, Officer Hayes continued to work in a full duty capacity, although she used several sick days because of pain in her right ankle. In mid-October, Officer Hayes informed her sergeant of her ankle pain and requested that the City conduct another medical examination of her ankle, but the City denied that request.</p>

Two days later, on November 1, 2001, Officer Hayes again saw Dr. Chairman and dúring that meeting, Dr. Chairman recorded Officer Hayes’ account of the September 11th fall, noted inflammation and sensitivity in her right ankle, and ultimately diagnosed her with “inflammation and swelling, right lateral ankle [and] possible [anterior talo fibular] ligamentous tear.” 11/01/01 Report of Dr. Chairman. Dr. Chairman recommended a soft cast to immobilize Officer Hayes’ right foot for two to three weeks as well as ankle injections.

Accordingly, Officer Hayes remained out of work, continuing to use her accumulated sick leave, until January 12, 2002, when she returned to her full duty patrol position.

The City, however, refused to grant that request, finding that Officer Hayes had not suffered a reoccurrence of her ankle injury during the September 11th fall because she did not miss work for ankle problems until six weeks later.

      <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>As this Court has stated previously, Civil Service Regulation 32, which governs the award of IOD benefits to City employees, is “similar in intent and form” to the WCA. <em>See City of Phila., </em>772 A.2d at 965 (citing <em>Sammons v.

Indeed, both Regulation 32 and the WCA are specifically designed to provide compensation to individuals who are injured in the course of their employment and who suffer lost wages as a result. <em>See Smith v. Civil Svc.

In fact, given that the two schemes are designed to compensate for the same type of loss, the Civil Service Regulations make clear that a claimant cannot simultaneously collect both workers’ compensation <em>and </em>IOD benefits for the same injury. <em>See </em>Civil Service Regs. 32.013, 32.023, 32.09. Ultimately, because of the underlying similarities of the two compensation systems, this Court has stated that “the principles enunciated in interpreting [the WCA] will apply to Regulation 32 where similar substantive issues are involved.” <em>City of Phila., </em>772 A.2d at 965 (citing <em>Sammons, </em><a href="/a2d/673/0998-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="673 A.2d 998" data-case-ids="7867209" data-case-paths="/a2d/673/0998-01">673 A.2d at 1002</a>). Indeed, on numerous occasions, Pennsylvania courts have looked to the WCA and the cases interpreting it for guidance in resolving issues that the Civil Service Regulations do not address. <em>See, e.g., City of Phila., </em>772 A.2d at 965-969 (applying workers’ compensation standards for “psychic injury” and “abnormal working conditions” to Regulation 32 claim); <em>Campbell v.

The City maintains that the WCA is not applicable because the governing precedent only permits reference to the WCA to resolve <em>substantive issues </em>and the admissibility of hearsay is not a substantive issue, but rather is a “threshold determination, procedural in character and nature.” City’s Brf. at 12. The City therefore argues that we are required to look to general agency law, which does not permit reliance on uncorroborated hearsay such as that at issue here. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=417%20A.2d%20810" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="417 A.2d 810">id.</a> </em>(citing <em>Walker v.

    <p id="b617-4" data-blocks='[["BL_617.4",617,[174,859,1152,1122]]]'>Ultimately, however, we conclude that we need not resolve this thorny issue regarding the prevailing nature of hearsay rules as the pervasive difficulties courts face in analyzing whether matters are substantive or procedural in nature renders it neither desirable nor practical to require the Commission to rely on such distinctions in ascertaining whether resort to workers’ compensation law is justified in any particular circumstance. Instead, we conclude that the Commission should simply apply workers’ compensation law to IOD proceedings in those limited circumstances in which (1) there is a discrete gap in the Civil Service Regulations that must be filled by reference to another body of law, and (2) there is directly applicable workers’ compensation law which is separable from its context and which can be applied in the IOD proceeding without otherwise disrupting Regulation 32’s existing structure. As explained above, application of workers’ compensation law in these specific circumstances is justified given Regulation 32’s “similarity in intent and form” to the WCA, which, in the end, makes the WCA a better reference tool than local agency law in IOD proceedings. <em>See City of Phila, </em>772 A.2d at 965.</p>

Indeed, it is undisputed that there is a gap in Regulation 32 as it does not address the discrete issue of when, if ever, hearsay may be admitted to prove a claimant’s entitlement to benefits, and both parties agree that it is therefore necessary to look to <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>another body of law to supplement Regulation 32’s provisions. While the City urges us to apply the general evidentiary rules of local agency law, the WCA contains a provision that is not only directly on point, <em>i.e., </em>section 422, but which can also be applied in the IOD context without disrupting Regulation 32’s existing scheme. Moreover, section 422 is not inextricably intertwined with other provisions of the WCA that are incompatible with Regulation 32 and thus, it can be divorced from the WCA and applied in the IOD context, without implicating other concerns.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Indeed, it seems plain that section 422’s allowance of hearsay evidence is complementary to both the workers’ compensation system and the IOD system, as it allows for greater efficiency in the administration of short-term benefits covering periods of one year or less.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

While we agree with Officer Hayes’ contention that in general, agencies should follow local agency laws where their own regulations are silent and therefore, the <em>Walker </em>rule would apply in most cases where an agency’s regulations are silent on hearsay rules, the unusual <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>relationship between workers’ compensation and IOD proceedings is such that it is only logical that the Civil Service Commission should borrow from the WCA instead of the more generic local agency law when it is possible and practical to do so.

The City acknowledged that Officer Hayes had framed her appeal as one under Regulation 32.11, and that the burden of proof for an appeal under Regulation 32.11 would lie with the City. However, it argued that Officer Hayes should have brought her appeal pursuant to Regulation 32.12, which governs appeals pursued by employees who have been “aggrieved by a finding as to the existence, nature, or service-connection of the employee's disability,” and pointed out that Regulation 32.12 requires a claimant to prove that she is out of work due to work-related injuries in order to obtain benefits.

As such, there are plainly provisions of the WCA that will not be transferable to Regulation 32, either because they do not neatly fill a gap in Regulation 32 or because they are so inextricably linked to procedures unique to the workers' compensation setting that they simply cannot be disentangled from that setting for application elsewhere. That said, in <em>Gunter, </em>this Court declined to decide whether the payment of IOD benefits was the equivalent of the issuance of an NCP under the WCA for purposes of precluding or estopping the City from subsequently contesting a claim for workers’ compensation benefits, instead deciding the case on other grounds.</p>
