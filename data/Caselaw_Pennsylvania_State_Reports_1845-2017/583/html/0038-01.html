Respondent could no longer practice law as a profession or as a business, and “attorney” was clearly not her current occupation. Knowing that she was technically a “formerly admitted attorney,” respondent also knew, or should have known, of the disciplinary rules she was bound by, not only under the Code of Professional Ethics, but also under the Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement.</p>

Words are a lawyer’s standard in trade, and lawyers should be held to their meaning. A former occupation is not a current occupation. A conditional or equivocal status is not an unequivocal one.

    <p id="b237-5" data-blocks='[["BL_237.4",237,[165,575,1153,1070]]]'>During the hearing, respondent testified as follows “I tell everybody that I practiced law until four years ago, and then I began publishing the newspaper.” R. 8. But, that is not what her nominating petitions demonstrate. Respondent did not have personal contact with every elector who signed her petitions to inform them, contrary to what the petition said, that she was actually a “formerly admitted attorney.” Instead, she created a false impression that she was a practicing attorney. How was the electorate to know that respondent was not admitted to practice in Pennsylvania, and furthermore, was in apparent violation of disciplinary and ethical rules for holding herself out as such? Respondent’s misrepresentation, moreover, was material. When a person is seeking to attain elected judicial office as a Magisterial District Judge, the fact that that candidate is an attorney obviously might sway an elector to sign her petition. The fact that one is an attorney no doubt is an advantage over candidates for this position who are not so qualified; a false claim to be an attorney, in the context of a nomination petition for a judicial position, is misleading in the extreme.</p>
