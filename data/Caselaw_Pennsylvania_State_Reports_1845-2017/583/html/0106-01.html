The amendment specifically addressed the question before the court in <em>Besch; </em>it did not alter the validity of the reasoning employed by this court in <em>Bobitski. </em>Thus, the purpose and intent of PaCOA as recognized and effectuated in <em>Bobitski, </em>is as viable today as it was when that decision was announced.</p>

A person can commit racketeering activity by violating the Drug Act. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 911(h)(1)(h).
