The Commonwealth Court panel in this case overturned the trial court’s determination that $6,425.00 in cash found on appellee Richard Esquilin<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> subsequent to his arrest for partic<a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>ipating as the “money man” in illegal drug transactions was subject to forfeiture. In ordering the entire sum forfeited, the trial court found: (1) that a sufficient nexus existed between the money and the illegal drug transactions to deem the cash subject to forfeiture, and (2) that appellee failed to show that the money was lawfully acquired. The Commonwealth Court affirmed the forfeiture only as to $60.00, while reversing as to the remaining $6,365.00, finding that there was an insufficient nexus between the remaining portion of the money and drug dealing. For the reasons set forth below, we find that the trial court correctly determined that the entire amount of money should be forfeited. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the trial court’s forfeiture order.</p>
    <p id="b742-4" data-blocks='[["BL_742.5",742,[268,1102,1163,955]]]'>The facts surrounding this appeal are as follows. On June 18, 2000, at approximately 8:00 p.m., officers from the Philadelphia Police Narcotics Strike Force began surveillance in the West Kensington section of Philadelphia. Officer Spicer observed appellee standing on the sidewalk with Miguel Bur-gos, in front of 2810 North Lee Street.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> At 8:10 p.m., Richard Negron approached the two men and, after a brief conversation, handed an unknown amount of money to Burgos. Bur-gos then reached into the front of his pants and pulled out small objects which he handed to Negron. At 8:25 p.m., an unknown Hispanic female approached the two men and also gave money to Burgos in exchange for small objects from the front of Burgos’ pants. Burgos immediately handed this money to appellee. At 8:35 p.m., Ishmael Cruz walked up to Burgos and engaged in a brief conversation before giving money to Burgos in exchange for small objects that Burgos removed from the front of his pants. Burgos again handed the money to appellee.</p>

An <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>officer stopped Negron while he was a passenger in a car, at which time Negron tossed from the car one clear zip-lock packet containing crack-cocaine. Officer Burgess stopped Cruz and recovered from him one clear zip-lock packet containing crack-cocaine. Officer Jones, acting on this information, then arrested appellee. In a search incident to the arrest, Officer Jones recovered $6,425.00<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> in cash, comprising: forty-eight one hundred-dollar bills, two fifty-dollar bills, sixty-nine twenty-dollar bills, eight ten-dollar bills, eleven five-dollar bills, and ten one-dollar bills. Officer Twist arrested and searched Burgos, recovering three zip-lock packets of cocaine and $7.00 in cash. Appellee was charged with criminal conspiracy and possessing a controlled substance with intent to deliver, but the charges were ultimately dismissed pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 600, for lack of a prompt trial.</p>
    <p id="b743-4" data-blocks='[["BL_743.4",743,[167,1163,1154,630]]]'>In the meantime, the Commonwealth filed a petition for forfeiture of the $6,425.00 in cash seized from appellee. The trial court, per the Honorable Denis P. Cohen, held a hearing on the matter on June 13, 2002. No testimony was taken because the parties agreed to have the matter decided based solely on documentary evidence. That evidence included: a three-page police investigation report, dated June 22, 2000; five police property receipts, dated June 18, 2000; five chemistry laboratory reports, dated August 3, 2000; appellee’s answers to interrogatories; bank account statements; and a copy of a cancelled check. After considering the evidence, the trial court ordered the entire $6,425.00 forfeited.</p>

In its Pa.R.A.P 1925(a) opinion, the trial court held that the police officers had probable cause to arrest and search appellee, whom they saw acting as the money man in three obvious drug transactions; therefore, the cash was properly seized incident to a lawful arrest. The trial court also found that the Commonwealth established <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>that the $6,425.00 was used to facilitate violations, or represented the proceeds of violations, of The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act (“Controlled Substance Act”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The trial court concluded that the Commonwealth established a nexus between the money seized and the illegal drug transactions police had observed, and concluded that the documents offered into evidence by appellee did not establish that the money was lawfully acquired. The trial court also noted that appellee had failed to offer any explanation for his activities on June 18, 2000, to counter the evidence that he was the money man in an illegal drug operation.</p>
    <p id="b744-4" data-blocks='[["BL_744.4",744,[273,979,1162,1299]]]'>On appeal, a panel of the Commonwealth Court affirmed in part and reversed in part in a memorandum opinion, authored by the Honorable Rochelle S. Friedman, filed on August 6, 2008. The panel affirmed the trial court’s finding that the officers had probable cause to arrest and search appellee, but reversed the finding that all of the $6,425.00 in cash was used to facilitate violations, or represented the proceeds of violations, of the Controlled Substance Act. The panel believed that it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that, as witnessed by the officers, Burgos had handed money to appellee from the drug sales to Negron, Cruz and the unknown Hispanic female, each transaction having an estimated value of $20.00. Thus, the panel found sufficient support for the trial court’s forfeiture order as to $60.00 of the money found on appellee. As for the rest of the money, however, the panel believed there was no evidence to support the conclusion that it was connected with illegal drug dealing. In light of its conclusion that no nexus was shown between the remainder of the money and a violation of the Controlled Substance Act, the panel did not pass upon whether appellee had offered an innocent explanation for his possession of the money. Accordingly, the panel affirmed the trial court’s grant of the forfeiture petition with respect to $60.00, but reversed with respect to the remaining $6,365.00. .</p>

      <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>On further appeal to this Court, the Commonwealth now argues that the Commonwealth Court improperly reweighed the evidence and refused to accord it the benefit of all reasonable inferences, notwithstanding that it was the prevailing party at trial. The Commonwealth submits that, when the evidence is properly viewed, it clearly proved by a preponderance of the evidence the nexus between the money and illegal drugs: appellee stood with Burgos, conducting street sales of illegal drugs; at least a portion of the money seized had directly facilitated the very drug transactions police had witnessed; and the fact-finder found appellee’s assertions of a legitimate source for the funds to be implausible. Given the totality of the circumstances, the Commonwealth submits that the trial court correctly inferred that all of the money possessed by appellee, who was observed participating in illegal drug sales, was forfeitable. The Commonwealth submits that, in overturning the trial court’s assessment of the evidence, the panel overstepped its limited authority as a reviewing court and substituted its own judgment.</p>
    <p id="b745-4" data-blocks='[["BL_745.4",745,[166,1371,1153,1015]],["BL_746.1",746,[277,346,1159,94]]]'>The Commonwealth further argues that appellee’s failure to provide an innocent explanation for his activities on the night of June 18, 2000, corroborated its evidence that the money was tied to illegal drug dealing. In the Commonwealth’s view, the absence of any innocent explanation logically suggests that the unusually large amount of cash that appellee had in his possession while selling cocaine on the street was related to that very enterprise, <em>i.e., </em>it was either “proceeds from illegal street transactions, or the recent sale of a substantial amount of drugs, or intended to be used to purchase a substantial amount of drugs.” Brief for Appellant, 15. The Commonwealth argues that appellee’s failure to provide a credible explanation of a non-drug source for the large sum of cash likewise supports the trial court’s forfeiture finding. The Commonwealth notes that appellee’s proffered explanation— that the cash had been withdrawn from a bank account owned by Madeline Soberal, the mother of his children, almost three weeks prior to his arrest, and that the money was to be used for repairs to a house he had recently purchased—was reject<a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>ed as implausible by the trial judge and it argues that that finding is not subject to reweighing on appeal.</p>
    <p id="b746-4" data-blocks='[["BL_746.4",746,[272,464,1164,821]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that the trial court’s forfeiture finding here was consistent with this Court’s decisions in <em>Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth distinguishes <em>Fontanez </em>and <em>Marshall </em>because there was no evidence of the claimant’s participation in illegal drug sales in those cases, a crucial evidentiary void which led to this Court’s conclusions that a claimant’s mere possession of a significant amount of cash did not prove, even indirectly, a violation of the Controlled Substance Act. In this case, the Commonwealth notes, it proved that appellee conspired with Burgos to conduct multiple sales of cocaine and retained the money from those sales, facts which provide the clear drug nexus which was deemed lacking in <em>Fontanez </em>and <em>Marshall.</em>

    <p id="b746-5" data-blocks='[["BL_746.5",746,[270,1318,1163,572]]]'>The Commonwealth also argues that the Commonwealth Court panel’s approach to forfeiture review will now require the Commonwealth to specifically trace the source of every dollar found on drug dealers observed in the act of selling drugs. The Commonwealth argues that the forfeiture statute should not be construed as requiring such heightened proof. The Commonwealth argues that once it shows a nexus between the money and violations of the Controlled Substance Act, the burden properly shifts to the forfeiture claimant to persuade the fact-finder that some or all of the money came from a legitimate source.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Appellee portrays himself as a man merely standing across from his house at around 8:00 p.m. with his neighbor, who then became an innocent recipient of $60.00 in drug proceeds from that neighbor, while unaware of the fact that the neighbor was dealing drugs. Appellee argues that this was “hardly enough” evidence to link him to the drug sales and proceeds.</p>
    <p id="b747-4" data-blocks='[["BL_747.4",747,[164,835,1155,998]]]'>Even assuming the $60.00 traceable to the observed drug deals was properly deemed forfeitable, appellee argues that there was insufficient evidence to link the balance of the cash found on him to drug activity. Appellee notes that the forfeiture statute is to be strictly construed. Appellee posits that the Commonwealth cannot rely upon the presumption that money found in close proximity to drugs constitutes proceeds from the sale of drugs because no drugs were found on or near him. In addition, appellee argues that the fact that $6,365.00 in cash was found along with the $60.00 in cash directly traceable to the illegal drug sales was not enough to make the larger sum forfeitable. Appellee argues that property is not forfeitable just because it is possessed by a drug offender, nor is property acquired prior to the time of an illegal action subject to forfeiture. Appellee states that, because the Commonwealth did not sustain its initial burden to prove a connection between his cash and the drug activity, the burden never shifted to him to establish a defense to avoid forfeiture.</p>

Appellee argues that he cooperated by answering other interrogatories posed by the Commonwealth and by producing documents which purportedly proved the innocent source of the money. In conclusion, appellee submits that the Commonwealth Court properly found that the Commonwealth failed to carry its burden to show a substantial nexus between the $6,365.00 and any other <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>drug dealing, leading to the conclusion that the money was not subject to forfeiture.</p>

It is not unusual for drug dealing confederates to engage in a division of labor, whereby one controls the drugs and the other the money.

Thus, the panel apparently deemed it irrelevant, as a matter of law, that appellee was found in possession of sixty-nine twenty-dollar bills, in a case where he and his cohort had conducted multiple sales of $20.00 worth of cocaine. In the panel’s view, for the denomination of the bills to suggest that the money represented drug proceeds, the Commonwealth had to present evidence that “at a particular time, [appellee] possessed no twenty-dollar bills and then, -with or without Burgos, he sold sixty-nine packets of crack cocaine, receiving a twenty-dollar bill for each sale.” Slip op. at 7 n. 8.

In the panel’s view, “[i]n order to prove that [appellee] acquired the entire [$6,425.00] from selling $20.00 packets of drugs, the Commonwealth needed to show, <em>inter alia, </em>that [appellee] spent some of the money or that he sold some packets of drugs for an amount other than $20.00. Absent such evidence, the Commonwealth did not prove that the entire $6,425.00 constitutes proceeds from the illegal sale of drugs.” Slip op. at 7 n. 11. But, again, neither the Forfeiture Act nor the law generally requires such absolute correspondence for evidence to warrant a mere inference. The fact that the ultimate amount found on appellee was not divisible by 20 does not mean that the money could not possibly represent the proceeds of this sort of drug-dealing operation. Drug dealers may use a portion of their proceeds for a variety of purposes along the way: to buy lunch, to pay confederates a share, to make change, to advance a buyer a portion of the price of the item. In addition, retail drug dealers may amass money so as to facilitate the purchase of more drugs; under the Act, money which helps to facilitate drug violations is no less subject to forfeit than drug proceeds. The panel’s notion that the amount of money and the denominations thereof excluded the possibility that it was drug proceeds, or money intended to facilitate drug violations, is simply erroneous.</p>

Moreover, the cash from the three sales police observed was in such intimate proximity with the rest of the cash found upon appellee that it was commingled. In addition, the panel’s absolutist approach to the rebuttable presumption simply ignores the fact that the evidence suggested that Burgos and appellee conspired together to sell these drugs.

In both of those cases, this Court reversed forfeitures of large sums of money because no drugs or drug paraphernalia had been found on or near the claimants and no illegal drug transactions had been observed. The case <em>sub judice </em>does not suffer from the same drug nexus deficiency that controlled the outcome in <em>Marshall </em>and <em>Fontanez. </em>The officers in this matter observed three sales of crack cocaine and saw Burgos hand money to appellee after two of those transactions. Furthermore, since there was not enough money found on Burgos to represent proceeds from the sale of even one packet of cocaine, the logical inference is that appellee was directly involved in the operation and held all of the money from the drug sales.</p>

In an attempt to <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>meet his burden, appellee offered non-testimonial evidence suggesting that he had earned the money working at a four-month, undocumented job which paid him $10.50 per hour. Appellee also claimed that the cash had been withdrawn from the bank account of Soberal, his children’s mother, and provided receipts from two withdrawals made over two weeks before his arrest, one on June 1, 2000 and another on June 2, 2000. In his answers to interrogatories, appellee also claimed that the money was to be used to make repairs on a house that he and Soberal had recently purchased, albeit he failed to provide any documentation to prove the existence of the house or their purchase of it.

The scant evidence provided by appellant undercuts and debunks his claim that he lawfully possessed such a large sum of money. Appellant claims that his only source of income is an undocumented four month [old] job at which he earned $10.50 per hour. [Appellee] fails to specify how many hours a week he worked. It is preposterous, therefore, to believe that this small amount of income was the source of the seized amount and that he saved every penny of his sole job for months, using the unknown amount of earned funds for nothing else. His bald contention that he was to use the funds for restructuring a house he just purchased without even providing documentation of the house purchase or any contract receipt or proposal for restructuring undermines any credibility that he would just happen to be carrying those funds for that purpose while engaged in drug dealing. How he could even purchase a house given his employment situation also strains credulity. Equally unbelievable is his vain effort to paint the possession of the funds as documented <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>inasmuch as $5300.00 was withdrawn from a bank account more than two weeks before.

Nor did the trial court err in viewing with skepticism appellee’s claim that he withdrew the cash only to carry it about on his person for over two weeks, when the money supposedly was dedicated to paying for renovations on a house he had bought—a house whose existence he never proved, and a house he was unlikely to have had the resources (over and above the money seized) to purchase, given his circumstances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> On such a record, the trial court did not err in finding that appellee’s explanation for the source of the money was incredible and could not with<a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>stand scrutiny. <em>See Holt, </em><a href="/pa-commw/160/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="635 A.2d 233" data-case-ids="1454664,7360961" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/160/0440-01,/a2d/635/0233-01">635 A.2d at 238-39</a> (trial court not obligated to credit claimant’s explanations for source of large amounts of cash).
