For the reasons expressed below, we hold that the trial court’s order is an appealable collateral order and that the court erred when it denied Appellant’s Motion to Quash and/or Withdraw Subpoena. Accordingly, we vacate the order of the Superior Court, reverse the order of the trial court, and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>

On March 27, 1977, the body of Debbie Capiola was found in the woods in Robinson Township, close to the border of Allegheny and Washington Counties. Upon discovery of the victim’s body, blue jeans were found wrapped around her neck. An autopsy revealed that the victim’s cause of death was strangu<a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>lation. It was later determined that the jeans had a spermatozoa stain on them.</p>

(“Cellmark”) for DNA analysis. The results of the test inculpated Appellant. Thereafter, the Pennsylvania State Police obtained an arrest warrant for Appellant, and Appellant surrendered himself to the State Police. The Commonwealth subsequently charged Appellant with one count of criminal homicide, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2501(a).</p>

Prior to trial and in response to Appellant’s informal request for discovery, the Commonwealth provided Appellant with the DNA test results from Cellmark. Appellant then filed an Omnibus Pre-trial Motion, which included, in pertinent part, a Motion for Pre-trial Discovery in which he sought permission to have the blue jeans sent to The Bode Technology Group, Inc. (“Bode”) for DNA analysis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In addition, Appellant filed a Motion for an Order Authorizing Release of Evidence for Independent Testing in which he requested that the Commonwealth be required to package the jeans and to send them to Bode for testing. The trial court granted these motions and permitted Appellant to have a blood sample drawn and sent to Bode as well. As a result, the jeans and blood sample were delivered to Bode. Bode completed its testing procedures and returned the jeans to the Commonwealth.</p>

According to the Petition, the Assistant District Attorney for Allegheny County contacted Ms. Ulery in August of 2001 and requested a copy of her report concerning the DNA analysis of the relevant evidence. Additionally, the Commonwealth asserted that Ms. Ulery informed the Assistant District Attorney that no report was ever written and that she was unable to provide the Commonwealth with the results of her analysis without the consent of Appellant’s counsel, which counsel had refused to provide.</p>

According to this Motion, Appellant’s counsel provided the Commonwealth with Appellant’s witness list and informed the Commonwealth that Appellant did not intend to call any expert witness at trial.

As such, Appellant opposed the issuance of the subpoena based on the attorney-client privilege, the work-product doctrine, and Appellant’s constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel and against compelled self-incrimination. The trial court denied Appellant’s Motion to Quash on the same day.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In response, Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal, informing the trial court that he was appealing the court’s order denying his Motion to Quash.</p>

The majority, however, found that the order fails to meet the Rule’s final requirement for a collateral order, <em>ie., </em>that if review of the question presented is postponed until final judgment in the case, then the claim will be irreparably lost.

The issue concerning the challenged trial court order in the matter <em>sub judice </em>is whether the work-product doctrine, as well as the other rights and privileges asserted by Appellant, bars the Commonwealth from calling as a witness an agent hired by a defense attorney in preparation for trial where the defendant does not intend to call the agent at trial or to utilize materials prepared by the agent as evidence at trial, thus precluding a trial court from requiring the agent’s attendance <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>and testimony at the defendant’s trial.- In our view, there is no question that resolution of this issue can be achieved independent from an analysis of whether Appellant is guilty of criminal homicide.

Notably, however, the proposed certificate, which was attached to the petition, did not direct production of any documents or reports. In any event, the trial court did not sign or adopt the proposed certificate, nor did it otherwise rule upon the Commonwealth’s requests. The Commonwealth’s second petition was substantially scaled-down and did not seek production of any reports, data, or results. The second proposed certificate directed only the attendance and testimony of Ms. Ullery at trial. On August 7, 2001, the trial court signed the second proposed certificate, pursuant to the Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Within or Without a State in Criminal Proceedings, 42 Pa.C.S. § 5961, <em>et seq. </em>However, as the Majority notes, the trial court did not direct defense counsel to disclose to the Commonwealth any information respecting Ullery or the DNA testing that Bode had conducted.

On appeal to this Court, appellant continues to miss the mark with his argument, urging, at various points in his brief, the privileged nature of: the results of Bode’s DNA testing, <em>see </em>Appellant’s Brief at 9, 15, 22; “the records [and] reports prepared by Bode,” <em>id </em>at 14; and Ms. Ullery’s expert opinions, <em>id </em>at 14-15. The Commonwealth also seems to misperceive the actual content of the mere witness-appearance certificate granted in its favor—which notably was drafted by the Commonwealth—repeatedly insisting upon the non-privileged nature of Bode’s “DNA test results.” Commonwealth Brief at 15, 20, 29.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

Although the trial court recognized that “the Commonwealth’s Certificate does not seek any written materials from Bode, but rather the testimony of Ms. Ul[l]ery,” it went further in its opinion, offering that: “[E]ven if Ul[l]ery appears at trial with any writings produced incidental to the DNA testing of the jeans, 1. e., ‘test results and materials in support thereof relative to [the] analysis conducted by Bode,’ ... there is presently nothing ... to suggest such writings would be protected.” Trial Ct. Op. at 6 (quoting Amended Petition). Moreover, the trial court found that Ms. Ullery’s work for the defense in the instant case, in conducting the DNA testing, was “without inherent legal meaning,” strongly implying that whatever results or opinions she possessed, memorialized or otherwise, would not be protected under the work-product doctrine if the Commonwealth sought to question her on her defense work. <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>

      <em> </em>It did not order the production of any tangible evidence relating to Ms. Ullery’s expert research or opinions.

It simply was a certificate to be presented to a judge in the Commonwealth of Virginia for proceedings to procure a subpoena for Ms. Ullery’s attendance at appellant’s trial. Accordingly, the sole and exceedingly narrow issue of appealability here is whether the defendant in a criminal case may appeal, as of right, from a pre-trial order refusing to quash a certificate which directs an out-of-state defense expert to “appear and testify,” where the defense has assured the court that it does not intend to call that expert at trial.</p>

While I agree with the Majority’s articulation of the collateral order rule and with its ultimate conclusion that the denial of the motion to quash the certificate is appealable under that rule, I would focus more closely upon the actual nature of the order, and thus, I would accept jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine for very different reasons.</p>

Contrary to the Majority, I would not so readily group the mere witness appearance order challenged in this case with those that were at issue in <em>Dennis </em>and <em>Ben. </em>Those cases involved trial court discovery orders which actually directed the production of documents. Neither case can be considered controlling here because the “right” implicated by appellant’s challenge is not the same as the rights involved in those <em>cases—ie., </em>an attorney’s right to keep confidential his thought processes in <em>Dennis, </em><a href="/pa/580/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="859 A.2d 1270" data-case-ids="1100722,9167137" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0095-01,/a2d/859/1270-01">859 A.2d at 1278</a>, and the statutory privilege asserted by the third-party witness in <em>Ben, </em><a href="/a2d/729/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="729 A.2d 547" data-case-ids="11620501,607217" data-case-paths="/a2d/729/0547-01,/pa/556/0475-01">729 A.2d at 549</a>. In light of the actual order at issue and the procedural posture of this case, the only right at issue—if, indeed, it is a “right” at all—is the right to protect a defense expert from being required to appear at a defendant’s criminal trial. It is a right that falls, at best, one very significant step short of the right to avoid the production of attorney work-product, <em>see </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 573(G), as extended to include the work-product of an attorney’s agents. <em>See United States v.

In my view, because an objection can always be raised at trial to any actual threat to privileged work-produet, and because the defense can always seek relief via a motion <em>in limine, </em>a mere order to appear ordinarily should not be deemed appealable.</p>
    <p id="b424-5" data-blocks='[["BL_424.4",424,[278,731,1162,841]]]'>I also am not comfortable with the suggestion by Mr. Justice Saylor, in his Concurring Opinion, that our collateral order jurisprudence requires a categorical approach to collateral order “importance.” Rather, the “importance” of a claim or right is always most appropriately analyzed in light of all of the circumstances of a given case. Of course, it may be that certain values, like the confidentiality advanced by the work-product doctrine, are such that they will usually satisfy the importance requirement. But in other instances, there should be room for flexibility. For example, if the order to appear in this case had not been accompanied by expressions of the trial court concerning the applicability of the work-product privilege, or if it were not so apparent that the only reason the Commonwealth sought the witness’s appearance was to breach the privilege, I would hold that the order fails the importance prong of the text.</p>
    <p id="b424-6" data-blocks='[["BL_424.5",424,[277,1597,1158,790]],["BL_425.1",425,[166,343,1153,842]]]'>However, the circumstances of this case are such that it is not a mere order-to-appear case. I would hold that appellant’s claim attains “importance” here not by indulging the fiction that the order was discovery-based, but solely because of the unique circumstances presented. From the outset, the Commonwealth’s intertwining of its desire to have Ms. Ullery present at trial with its desire to actually obtain Bode’s DNA test results caused confusion, as evidenced by the disparity between the Commonwealth’s initial petition and its proposed certificate. <em>Compare </em>Petition at ¶ 8 <em>with </em>Certificate at ¶ 7. The Commonwealth’s conflated position has apparently persisted throughout the litigation, notwithstanding that the order at issue—and appellate courts review orders, not theories, or failed requests—did not direct appellant to produce any documents, test results, or expert opinions. Appellant’s overly <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>broad motion to quash contributed to the conflation, and it now appears that both parties either misperceive the order, choose to ignore its contours, or consider it nearly inevitable that Bode’s DNA results will ultimately be “produced” as a result of Ms. Ullery’s appearance. Mere fear of a discovery violation ordinarily would be too attenuated to warrant pretrial review, but what decisively alters the calculus, in my view, is that the trial court has essentially announced in advance that it intends to permit inquiry despite appellant’s work-product claim. The Superior Court’s affirmance only added to the inevitably created by the universally lax approach taken to this litigation. Hence, I would find that the “right” implicated in appellant’s circumstance, if not in his poorly articulated claim, is sufficiently important under these unique circumstances to warrant this Court’s accepting jurisdiction, so as to ensure the administration of justice.</p>
    <p id="b425-5" data-blocks='[["BL_425.4",425,[168,1211,1152,524]]]'>Similarly, I believe that the “irreparably lost claim” element of the collateral order test has been satisfied, not because the attorney work-product doctrine was implicated by the trial court’s certificate, but because it almost certainly will be implicated, indeed, violated, in light of the trial court’s opinion and the litigants’ assumptions attending the case. I would hold that the inevitability of compelled disclosure, notwithstanding the actually benign nature of the trial court’s order, puts appellant’s challenge nearly enough to being irreparably lost that it would be unjust to deny review.</p>
