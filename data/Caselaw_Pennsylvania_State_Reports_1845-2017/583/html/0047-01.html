In her Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, L.S. admitted that her injuries did not rise to the level of “serious injur[ies]” as defined by the MVFRL. Nonetheless, L.S. contended that the limited tort option was inapplicable to her cause of action because, at the time of the accident, she was a pedestrian and not an operator or occupant of a motor vehicle.</p>

Initially, the trial court determined that, because L.S. resided with her mother, she was bound by her mother’s election of the limited tort option. After reviewing the extent of the injuries suffered by L.S., the court concluded that L.S. had failed to meet the “serious injury” threshold as required by the limited tort provision to recover noneconomic damages.

In determining that the limited tort option of the MVFRL applied to pedestrians, the Majority relied upon the express language of Section 1705(d), which specifies that the limited tort alternative applies to an insured who has sustained a loss “in a motor vehicle accident.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(d). According to the Majority, this statutory language makes it clear that an insured, who has elected limited tort coverage and has not suffered a “serious injury,” “cannot recover noneconomic damages when involved in a motor vehicle accident, whether as a driver, a passenger in someone else’s car, or as a pedestrian.” <em>Eschbach, </em><a href="/a2d/822/0796-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="822 A.2d 796" data-case-ids="9132516" data-case-paths="/a2d/822/0796-01">822 A.2d at 800</a>.

Judge Johnson emphasized that a pedestrian, who is injured due to the negligence of a motor vehicle operator, falls outside the purview of the MVFRL. In reaching his decision, Judge Johnson noted that nothing in the plain language of Section <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>1705 suggests that the General Assembly intended a pedestrian to be bound by his or her limited tort election in a motor vehicle insurance policy. Instead, he explained that Section 3705 directly speaks of only drivers and passengers of motor vehicles. Moreover, Judge Johnson noted that the overriding intent of the MVFRL was to reduce the cost of automobile insurance coverage and to deter individuals from failing to insure their vehicles. However, he explained that applying the limited tort alternative to innocent pedestrians “could deter individuals from electing the limited tort [option] and thereby undermine the MVFRL’s effort to reduce the costs of motor vehicle insurance, since limited tort insurance enables insurance companies to limit their potential costs and thereby reduce consumer’s insurance premiums.” <em><a href="/a2d/822/0796-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="822 A.2d 796" data-case-ids="9132516" data-case-paths="/a2d/822/0796-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/822/0796-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="822 A.2d 796" data-case-ids="9132516" data-case-paths="/a2d/822/0796-01">at 808</a> (Johnson, J., concurring and dissenting). Finally, Judge Johnson cited to the <em>en banc </em>decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County in <em>Andreyo v. Radle, </em>59 D. &amp; C.4th 8 (Pa. Dauphin Ct.2002), which, under similar factual circumstances, concluded that the legislature did not intend the MVFRL to apply to pedestrians, “or for that matter, [to an insured] sitting in his living room should an errant automobile come crashing through his door.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

If a consumer’s election of the limited tort alternative was meant to bind pedestrians, then the consumer must be properly notified so that he or she could make an informed decision. As presently worded, however, Section 1705 fails to inform insurance consumers that their election of the limited tort alternative could potentially limit their right of recovery if they are injured as a pedestrian. Nothing in the language of Section 1705 suggests that the legislature contemplated the inclusion of pedestrians within the statutory framework. Therefore, based upon the sound statutory construction principle <em>expressio unius est exelusio alterius </em>(the express mention of one meaning in a statute implies the exclusion of other meanings), we must refrain from judicially expanding Section 1705 to imply that the General Assembly intended to incorporate pedestrians within the purview of the MVFRL. <em>See Henrieh v. Harleysville Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/533/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="533 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1837554" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0181-01">533 Pa. 181</a>, <a href="/pa/533/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="533 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1837554" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0181-01">620 A.2d 1122</a>, 1123 (1993) (finding no fault with appellate court’s use of principle <em>expressio unius est exelusio altenus </em>in analyzing Section 1714 of the MVFRL, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1714).</p>

It is well established that the prevailing intent of the General Assembly in enacting the MVFRL was to reduce the escalating cost of automobile insurance premiums, while requiring financial responsibility. <em>Rump v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, </em><a href="/pa/551/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="551 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="507786" data-case-paths="/pa/551/0339-01">551 Pa. 339</a>, <a href="/a2d/710/1093-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="710 A.2d 1093" data-case-ids="11841960,507786" data-case-paths="/a2d/710/1093-01,/pa/551/0339-01">710 A.2d 1093</a>, 1096 (1998). Nevertheless, applying Section 1705 to innocent pedestrians would defeat the mischief that Section 1705 was designed to remedy, namely to deter individuals from faffing to insure their vehicles. Clearly, the act of punishing innocent pedestrians, who are completely unassociated with a motor vehicle, would do little to deter an individual from failing to procure motor vehicle insurance.</p>

This Court has recognized that “[i]n construing a statute, the court must ascertain and give effect to the legislative intention as expressed in the language of the statute, and cannot, under its powers of construction, supply omissions in a statute, especially where it appears that the matter may have been intentionally omitted[.]” <em>Kusza v.

As such, if the General Assembly intended to limit a pedestrian’s right of recovery based on a provision in his or her automobile insurance policy, it should have expressly stated such a motive in the language of Section 1705. Otherwise, absent express statutory authority, this Court would be judicially legislating and impermissibly expanding the scope of Section 1705 to include not only accidents involving operators and occupants of motor vehicles, but also accidents involving pedestrians. Accordingly, we decline such an invitation.</p>
    <p id="b251-4" data-blocks='[["BL_251.4",251,[165,1308,1156,788]]]'>In turning to the instant matter, L.S. was an innocent, minor pedestrian who was struck down in traffic and injured through the negligence of a motor vehicle operator. It is undisputed that A.S. voluntarily elected the limited tort alternative and that L.S., as a minor residing in the household of her mother, was an “insured” pursuant to the automobile insurance policy of A.S. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(f). However, the injuries that L.S. suffered did not result from her own personal use of a motor vehicle, as either an operator or an occupant. As explained above, the legislature has failed to specify, or for that matter, even contemplate, the inclusion of pedestrians within the parameters of Section 1705. Therefore, as an innocent pedestrian, L.S.’s right of recovery should not be restricted by her mother’s election of the limited tort alternative.</p>

    <p id="b252-5" data-blocks='[["BL_252.5",252,[278,1123,1160,905]]]'>Ultimately, we believe that neither the plain language of the statute nor the express legislative intent support a statutory interpretation of Section 1705 that restricts the right of recovery of a pedestrian based upon his or her limited tort election. Currently, the plain language of Section 1705 discusses only drivers and passengers of motor vehicles. It is completely silent as to pedestrians. As such, this Court must refrain from expanding the purview of Section 1705 to limit a pedestrian’s right of recovery. Moreover, any alleged application of Section 1705 to pedestrians would serve to impede the legislative objectives underlying the enactment of the MVFRL. In particular, restricting an innocent pedestrian’s right of recovery based upon a provision in his or her automobile insurance policy would do little to promote financial responsibility. Accordingly, as presently written, the restrictions on recovery as set forth in Section 1705 of the MVFRL are not applicable to pedestrians who have been injured in motor vehicle accidents.</p>
