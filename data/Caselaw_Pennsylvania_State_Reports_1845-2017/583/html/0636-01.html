Furthermore, Mr. Rader confirmed that, during the 1999-2001 period, the total number of law enforcement manpower-hours expended per DUI arrest at sobriety checkpoints was 22.84, and the total number of manpower-hours per arrest—including both law enforcement and administrative personnel—-was 28.77.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> By comparison, 18.82 manpower-hours were required for each DUI arrest stemming from a roving patrol, and 7.69 percent of all drivers stopped by such patrols were charged with DUI.</p>

Indeed, in both <em>Tarbert </em>and <em>Yastrop </em>it was apparent that the police could have apprehended some drunk drivers by patrolling the roadways in the traditional manner, and yet in each case a majority of Justices were of the view that the compelling governmental interest in protecting the safety of the motoring public ren<a id="p651" href="#p651" data-label="651" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*651</a>dered the Supreme Court’s balancing test appropriate. <em>Cf.

Thus, as in <em>Yastrop, </em>we re-affirm what has already been stated above—that the three-factor balancing articulated by the Supreme Court in cases such as <em>Sitz </em>and <em>Edmond, </em>and utilized by this Court in <em>Tarbert </em>and <em>Blouse, </em>constitutes the appropriate means of resolving constitutional challenges to systematic roadway checkpoints; the question then distills to whether Appellant’s proof is sufficient to demonstrate that sobriety checkpoints are largely ineffectual, and hence, unconstitutional.</p>
    <p id="b845-4" data-blocks='[["BL_845.4",845,[168,1102,1154,1061]]]'>On this record, we are unwilling to draw that conclusion. Although the comparative statistics that Appellant has forwarded show that sobriety checkpoints require more manpower-hours for each DUI arrest than roving patrols, and that a lower percentage of vehicle-stops lead to DUI arrests than with roving patrols, this alone does not mean that they are ineffectual. For one thing, the statistics may be somewhat misleading: because every vehicle that passes through a roadblock is stopped, at least briefly, and a roving patrol only stops an automobile exhibiting signs of impaired driving, it is to be expected that a higher percentage of stopped vehicles will lead to arrests in the roving patrol scenario. The more revealing statistic is that which compares the number of manpower-hours required to make an arrest. Here, we note that the data proffered by Appellant show that approximately 21 percent more law enforcement manpower-hours are needed to make one DUI arrest at a checkpoint than during a roving patrol. Additionally, when the administrative and other non-law-enforcement personnel are factored in, approximately 53 percent more total manpower-hours are required.</p>

Although Mr. Rader conceded that it is difficult to quantify this deterrence effect, sound reasoning dictates that deterrence is a function of the public perception that the DUI laws are being enforced. Checkpoints are highly visible, and thus, can reasonably be expected to alter an individual’s perception of the likelihood of being apprehended if he decides to drive after having consumed alcohol. <em>See generally Martinez-Fuerte, </em><a href="/us/428/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="428 U.S. 543" data-case-ids="6178901" data-case-paths="/us/428/0543-01">428 U.S. at 557</a>, <a href="/us/428/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="428 U.S. 543" data-case-ids="6178901" data-case-paths="/us/428/0543-01">96 S.Ct. at 3083</a> (suggesting that the ability for roadblocks to deter the smuggling of illegal aliens was an important factor in the Court’s analysis upholding such procedures); Blouse, <a href="/pa/531/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="531 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="1834402" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0167-01">531 Pa. at 171</a>, <a id="p653" href="#p653" data-label="653" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*653</a><a href="/pa/531/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="531 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="1834402" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0167-01">611 A.2d at 1179</a> (“Lastly, the risk of detection, both actual and perceived, will provide an effective deterrent to Motor Vehicle Code violations.”).</p>

To avoid unnecessary surprise to motorists, the existence of a roadblock can be so conducted as to be ascertainable from a reasonable distance or otherwise made knowable in advance. The possibility of arbitrary roadblocks can be significantly curtailed by the institution of certain safeguards. First, the very decision to hold a drunk-driver roadblock, as well as the decision as to its time and place, should be matters reserved for prior administrative approval, thus removing the determination of those matters from the discretion of police officers in the field. In this connection it is essential that the route selected for the roadblock be one which, based on local experience, is likely to be travelled by intoxicated drivers. The time of the roadblock should be governed by the same consideration. Additionally, the question of which vehicles to stop at the roadblock should not be left to the unfettered discretion of police officers at the scene, but instead should be in accordance with objective standards prefixed by administrative decision.</blockquote>

I believe DUI roadblocks are a waste of limited resources and promote inefficient law enforcement because police officers are forced to spend innumerable hours stopping hundreds of vehicles for a comparatively low number of DUI arrests. It defies common sense to argue that by consolidating police resources on one section of one street, the police can catch more drunk drivers. This logic somehow presumes that drunk drivers will voluntarily line up at pre-determined checkpoints. The more realistic presumption, however, is that an unknown number of drunk drivers who would have easily attracted the attention of trained law <a id="p655" href="#p655" data-label="655" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*655</a>officers on routine patrol evade detection simply by using roads other than those targeted for DUI roadblocks.</blockquote>

    <p id="b849-6" data-blocks='[["BL_849.5",849,[170,520,1152,1001]]]'>Of course, this matter provides the record evidence confirming this view. The empirical data before our Court establishes that during the years 1999-2001, only .71 percent of all drivers stopped at suspicionless checkpoints were charged with DUI whereas the same charge was lodged against <em>7.69 </em>percent of all drivers stopped by roving patrols (seven versus <em>seventy-seven </em>DUI arrests per 1000 stops). The majority attempts to explain this disparity away by calling the statistics “misleading” in that “it is expected that a higher percentage of stopped vehicles will lead to arrests in the roving patrol scenario” due to the fact that “every vehicle that passes through a roadblock is stopped, at least briefly, and a roving patrol only stops an automobile exhibiting signs of impaired driving.” Op. at 587. However, in my view, the black and white statistical evidence is in no way “misleading” as it unequivocally affirms that roving patrols are more effective than checkpoints and in fact, it is precisely <em>because </em>roving patrols target those who have exhibited some sign of impaired driving that they are the more effective tool for catching drunk drivers.</p>

Again, the majority tries to explain away this considerable imbalance, this time saying that the manpower-hours per arrest statistic does not “tell the whole story” because checkpoints are likely to reduce drunk driving through deterrence. Op. at 588. According to the majority, this deterrence stems from the fact that checkpoints are highly visible and are required to be advertised in advance, thereby giving drivers an opportunity to use alternative transportation. However, as noted above, the reality is that many people, rather than undergoing the inconvenience of finding alternative transportation, will drive after drinking and then simply avoid the advertised checkpoint location or, if they <a id="p656" href="#p656" data-label="656" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*656</a>somehow did not get word of the pre-determined location, will attempt to turn around once they realize that a checkpoint is stationed ahead. As I stated in my dissent in <em>Yastrop, </em>“to effectively deter drunk drivers, the obvious remedy is to catch more drunk drivers by utilizing routine police patrols and roving DUI patrols, rather than using one pre-determined and pre-announced location.” <em><a href="/a2d/768/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="156" data-cite="768 A.2d 318" data-case-ids="11115596,1276826" data-case-paths="/a2d/768/0318-01,/pa/564/0338-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/768/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="156" data-cite="768 A.2d 318" data-case-ids="11115596,1276826" data-case-paths="/a2d/768/0318-01,/pa/564/0338-01">at 329</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

However, this Court cannot and should not ignore the cold hard facts before us. Contrary to what the majority suggests, we do not need to make judgments here because the statistics do it for us. The statistics Appellant has presented to the Court <em>prove </em>that roving patrols are more efficient and effective than DUI checkpoints. They show that checkpoints require more manpower-hours for each DUI arrest than do roving patrols and they show that a lower percentage of stops at checkpoints lead to DUI arrests than do stops stemming from roving patrols. In the end, the statistics tell the simple tale that if more police manpower had been allocated to roving patrols instead of checkpoints, more drunk drivers would have been removed from the roads and our roads would have been safer places to travel.</p>

The bottom line here is that checkpoints are not the least <a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>intrusive or, as the statistics on this record leave no doubt about, the most effective means of catching and deterring drunk drivers.

I do, however, agree with the majority that the statistics presented by Appellant do not, in one sense, "tell the whole story.” Indeed, the statistics, while clearly proving the relative ineffectiveness of suspicion-less checkpoints, do not in any way account for the substantial intrusion that those checkpoints impose on the lives of law-abiding motorists, who must often wait in the backlog of traffic caused by the checkpoints even before enduring the actual stop by police once they reach the checkpoint.</p>
