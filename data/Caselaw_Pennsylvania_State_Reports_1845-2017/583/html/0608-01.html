    <p id="b804-5" data-blocks='[["BL_804.5",804,[280,486,1162,469]]]'>In this case, the Superior Court concluded that Appellee Cherne Industries (“Cherne”) was entitled to post-trial relief in the form of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (“judgment n.o.v.”). We presently consider whether the Superior Court correctly determined that Cherne did not waive the ground upon which its request for a judgment n.o.v. was based. For the following reasons, we conclude that the Superior Court erred. Accordingly, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b804-6" data-blocks='[["BL_804.6",804,[277,981,1160,575]]]'>The relevant facts and procedural history are as follows. Appellant Douglas Straub (“Straub”) was an employee of R.E. Pearson Construction Company (“R.E.Pearson”), and working on a new road construction project. The project required that old sewer pipes be replaced with new ones. For this aspect of the project, R.E.Pearson purchased a product known as a “Muni-Ball” from Dealers Service. The Muni-Ball, which was manufactured and sold to Dealers Service by Cherne, was an inflatable plug that served to temporarily seal the inside of a large diameter sewer pipe during its installation to prevent water or debris from entering or draining from it.</p>
    <p id="b804-7" data-blocks='[["BL_804.7",804,[276,1581,1160,577]]]'>On April 29, 1998, Straub was with a crew installing a new sewer pipe. The pipe was in a trench with a Muni-Ball in it. Straub positioned himself in the trench and outside the pipe’s opening. After attaching the air line to the Muni-Ball, Straub began to inflate the Muni-Ball using an air compressor. Because the pressure gauge connected to the Muni-Ball was not working, Straub watched for water to stop passing around the plug to determine when the Muni-Ball was sufficiently inflated. As Straub was about to close off the valve, the Muni-Ball exploded due to over-inflation. As a result of the explosion, Straub sustained serious injuries.</p>

Appellants’ complaint set forth a count in negligence, a count in strict liability, a count for <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>breach of warranties, and a count for loss of consortium against each defendant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In strict liability, Appellants asserted that the Muni-Ball was defective in design and warnings.

On September 18, 2002, after the parties rested, the trial court and the parties discussed the instructions and verdict sheet that the trial court would give to the jury. The trial court stated that its aim was to make certain that the jury understood that Appellants asserted two distinct and independent claims—a claim in strict liability and a claim in negligence—and to make clear in the verdict sheet that Appellants “may win on product liability and lose on the negligence claim or vice versa.” (Tr. 9/18/02 at 140). It was agreed that separate verdict sheets would be used—one for strict liability, one for negligence, and one for the calculation of damages, if any.</p>

In response to Cherne’s motion, Appellants argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that Cherne did not preserve and waived its challenge to the jury’s verdict by not raising this argument at trial and waiting until post-trial proceedings to put it forward.</p>

The first reason was the fact that “the relationship between strict products liability and traditional negligence doctrine is a matter of much confusion and disagreement.” (Superior Court Memorandum Opinion at 7). The second reason was the fact that since “neither party objected to instructions that allowed the jury to find Cherne liable on either or both causes of action[,]” both parties “made it possible for the jury to find Cherne negligent even if the product was not defective.” <em>(Id. </em>at 8).</p>

Appellants further assert that the verdict sheets and the trial court’s instructions permitted the jury to consider whether Cherne was negligent, even if it found that the Muni-Ball had no defect. Therefore, Appellants argue, Cherne was required to point this out to the trial court by objecting to the verdict sheets and the trial court’s related instructions or by objecting to the verdict itself when it was rendered, at the latest.

More specifically, Cherne argues that in light of the jury’s finding that the Muni-Ball was not defective, Appellants’ wholesale failure to introduce any evidence that Cherne was negligent in ways that did not relate to the condition of the Muni-Ball means that there was no evidence upon which the jury could have found for Appellants on their negligence claim. Cherne asserts that as such, the issue it raises is a ground upon which motions for a judgment n.o.v. have been traditionally based. <em>See Moure v. Raeuchle, </em><a href="/pa/529/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="529 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1831163" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0394-01">529 Pa. 394</a>, <a href="/pa/529/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="529 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1831163" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0394-01">604 A.2d 1003</a>, 1007 (1992) (explaining that a judgment n.Q.v. can be entered where the evidence was such that no two reasonable <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>minds could disagree that the outcome should have been rendered in favor of the movant).</p>
    <p id="b812-4" data-blocks='[["BL_812.4",812,[277,463,1160,413]]]'>We disagree. Cherne is not arguing that the verdict cannot stand because a reasonable jury could not have found Cherne negligent based on the evidence that Appellants introduced at trial. Rather, Cherne is arguing that once the jury found that the Muni-Ball was not defective, there was nothing left for the jury to do, inasmuch as all Appellants’ evidence in negligence related to the design of and warnings on the product, and the jury should have found in Cherne’s favor.</p>
    <p id="b812-5" data-blocks='[["BL_812.5",812,[274,901,1162,1487]],["BL_813.1",813,[166,342,1150,152]]]'>It is, therefore, clear to us that Cherne’s motion for post-trial relief was premised on the argument that the jury’s verdict was incompatible with a principle of law that Cherne considers to be part of Pennsylvania jurisprudence—that when a plaintiff brings parallel claims in strict liability and negligence against a manufacturer, the manufacturer cannot be negligent, if its product is not defective. The verdict sheets and the trial court’s instructions, however, did not reflect this purported principle and indeed, were contrary to it, directing the jury to proceed and consider Cherne’s negligence, even if it found that the Muni-Ball had no defect. Under Pa.R.C.P. 227.1(b)(l)’s mandate regarding issue preservation, an objection to the verdict sheets and the trial court’s accompanying instructions, thereby giving the trial court the opportunity to take corrective action, was required. Cherne however, failed to make this objection. Thus, we have no hesitation in concluding that the ground upon which Cherne’s request for a judgment n.o.v was based was not preserved, and accordingly, waived. We further conclude that the Superior Court’s reasoning that waiver did not apply because of the state of products liability law and the absence of an objection from Appellants was mistaken. <em>See supra, </em>pp. 6-7. Rule 227.1(b)(l)’s mandate applies evenly in all cases, regardless of whether the area of the law at issue is unsettled. Moreover, by its nature, the Rule’s contemporaneous objection requirement is imposed on the party who seeks to claim that post-trial relief is warranted due to an error that occurred at trial. In this case, that party was Cherne. We therefore hold that <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>under Pa.R.C.P. 227(b)(1), Cherne did not preserve, and thus waived, the ground upon which it requested a judgment n.o.v. in its post-trial motion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
