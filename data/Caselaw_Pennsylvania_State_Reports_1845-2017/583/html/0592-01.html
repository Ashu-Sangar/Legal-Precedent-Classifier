Appellee was accepted into an Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (“ARD”) diversionary program on April 9, 1991 for that first offense, and his operating privilege was suspended for three months. On June 25, 1993, appellee was arrested for a second DUI offense, and he was convicted on February 14, 1994.

As part of that sentence, the trial judge ordered appellee to comply with the provisions of the Interlock Law “if applicable.” The Department thereafter notified appellee that his operating privilege would be suspended for one year and that he must comply with the provisions of the Interlock Law to have his operating privilege restored at the end of that year. The notice also advised appellee that, if he failed to comply with the Interlock Law, his operating privilege would be suspended for an additional year.</p>

The interlock/ suspension appeal was listed and argued on April 11, 2002. On May 22, 2002, the court issued an order and opinion finding that appellee’s 1991 ARD was not a prior conviction for purposes of the Interlock Law, and further concluding that appellee was but a first-time DUI offender in February of 2001. In so concluding, the court did not consider appellee’s 1994 DUI conviction, a conviction appellee now concedes occurred. (It appears from the April 11 transcript that the existence of the 1994 conviction was not argued to the court.) The court also determined that it “had no authority” to impose an ignition interlock requirement upon appellee as a first-time offender, as a matter of discretion, because the first-time offender provision did not become effective until after appellee was convicted and sentenced for his 2001 offense. The court therefore sustained appellee’s appeal and ordered that “the requirement that [appellee] submit to the imposition of a guardian interlock device is STRICKEN.”</p>

In the panel’s view, the Department’s argument that Section 7002’s recidivist provision could be triggered on the basis of DUI convictions which occurred prior to the enactment of the Interlock Law would require a retroactive application of the statute, in violation of Section 1926 of the Statutory Construction Act. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1926 (“No statute shall be construed to be retroactive unless clearly and manifestly so intended by the General Assembly.”). The panel reasoned that application of the interlock requirement based upon appellees prior DUI convictions would have a legal effect different from that which those convictions had under the law in effect at the time of the earlier convictions. <em>Alexander, </em><a href="/a2d/822/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="822 A.2d 92" data-case-ids="9125701" data-case-paths="/a2d/822/0092-01">822 A.2d at </a>94 (citing <em>McMahon v.

Because the interlock requirement is a mere condition of license restoration, the Department argues that an order imposing the requirement cannot be the subject of a statutory appeal under 75 Pa.C.S. § 1550.

Lehman argued that the GCA changed the punishment for his 1962 larceny and inflicted a greater punishment than the law allowed at the time he stole the case of beer. In an opinion by Mr. Justice Eakin, this Court rejected Lehman’s challenge, first noting that, “[t]he <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause speaks only to retroactive punishment .... ” and thus, “the issue becomes whether the civil disability imposed on [Lehman]—the inability to purchase firearms— constitutes punishment.” <a href="/pa/576/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="839 A.2d 265" data-case-ids="16718,9057069" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0365-01,/a2d/839/0265-01">839 A.2d at </a>270 (citing <em>Smith v.

The GCA is simply not retrospective in the sense forbidden by the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause: it does not punish conduct that occurred before its adoption.

Thus, an ignition interlock requirement could not be imposed as a licensing restriction for a DUI conviction which occurred before the effective date of the Interlock Law—such as, for example, appellees second DUI conviction in 1994. But that is not the issue posed in this appeal. The Departments interlock notification in this case was occasioned by appellees third DUI conviction, which arose after enactment of the Interlock Law. If appellee had not been convicted in September of 2001 for an additional DUI, he would not be required to install an interlock device on his motor vehicle under pain of additional license suspension.

Rather, it takes the recidivist DUI defendant as it finds him after the post-Interlock Law DUI conviction. In this case, the relevant “fact or condition” which came into existence before the Interlock Law was adopted was that appellee had two prior DUI convictions. However, the fact that appellees punishment and license restriction for his prior crimes had expired did not give rise to some “right” not to be recognized as the recidivist he would be if and when he committed another DUI offense after the Interlock Law was adopted. Nor did the Interlock Law impose a new “disability” relating to the past convictions; the disability, to the extent the license restriction can be deemed one at all, came into being only as a consequence of appellees new offense, it was imposed in response to that offense, and it became a condition of returning to licensed status after a suspension that followed from the new offense. There is no doubt that the Interlock Law imposes a licensing consequence for recidivist DUI offenders that is greater than the licensing consequence such <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>recidivist offenders faced prior to the enactment of the statute. However, the statute does not look back and enhance the punishment recidivist DUI offenders received for their prior DUI convictions. Instead, the enhanced consequence applies solely with respect to those DUI convictions occurring after the effective date of the law.

When ordered by the Department as a condition of license restoration, it is merely a method of limiting access to a motor vehicle for a period of time subsequent to the license suspension required by statute. The interlock requirement is, in some respects, an accommodation to repeat DUI offenders, in that it permits them to operate their motor vehicles despite their history, at least so long as the offender has not been drinking alcoholic beverages prior to attempting to drive the vehicle. The alternative to installing the device is an additional year’s suspension.

Javit, </em><a href="/a2d/734/0922-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="734 A.2d 922" data-case-ids="11547302" data-case-paths="/a2d/734/0922-01">734 A.2d 922</a> (Pa.Super.1999). In <em>Javit, </em>the Superior Court held that a person who holds a probationary license pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. 1554 may be convicted of driving while operating privilege is suspended or revoked (DUI-related) in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. 1543(b) on the basis of a violation of the restricted hours applicable to the license. The court rejected the argument that the issuance of the probationary license negated a finding of suspension, holding that Javit’s license remained suspended during the period of time that he held the probationary license:</p>
      <blockquote id="b795-6" data-blocks='[["BL_795.6",795,[238,1807,1090,310]]]'>The possession of a probationary license is not the equivalent of restoration of appellant's full operating privileges. Just as the penalty of suspension of operating privileges cannot be circumvented by possession of a valid out-of-state license. <em>Commonwealth v. Claar, </em>152 Pa.Cmwlth. 153, <a href="/pa-commw/152/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="618 A.2d 1140" data-case-ids="1439915" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/152/0153-01">618 A.2d 1140</a> (1992), suspension is not terminated by the possession of the in-state probationary license.

        <em>Id. </em>at 925. The sound reasoning in <em>Javit </em>is persuasive in this circumstance as well. When an operator is issued a license subject to installation of an interlock device, this interlock-restricted license is the functional equivalent of a probationary license in that it restricts the operators use of a motor vehicle to the conditions stated in the statute. If the condition of installing the interlock device is not met, the drivers license is not restored; it remains suspended for an additional year.</p>
