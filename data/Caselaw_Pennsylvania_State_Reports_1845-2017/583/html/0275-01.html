Since the Complaint is based on challenges to the constitutionality of the statute, we must begin by considering the standard by which we resolve constitutional challenges to legislative actions. First, our case law makes clear that there is a strong presumption in the law that legislative enactments do not violate our Constitution. <em>See Pennsylvania School Boards Ass’n., Inc. et al. v. Commonwealth Ass’n. of School Administrators, </em><a href="/pa/569/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="569 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="312760" data-case-paths="/pa/569/0436-01">569 Pa. 436</a>, <a href="/a2d/805/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="805 A.2d 476" data-case-ids="11433559,312760" data-case-paths="/a2d/805/0476-01,/pa/569/0436-01">805 A.2d 476</a>, 479 (2002).

All doubts are to be resolved in favor of finding that the legislative enactment passes constitutional muster. <em>Commonwealth v.

Each of these provisions was born in a time in which Pennsylvanians were experiencing rapid growth economically and “ ‘wrenching’ social change.... ” K. Gormley, The Pennsylvania Constitution, § 3.6[a], p. 61 (2003). An enormous growth in the corporate form of business organization led to significant concentrations of wealth and the corruption of numerous legislators. <em>Id. </em>at 62. Corruption took the form of special laws legislation, logrolling,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> and arbitrary favoritism and was met with a demand for reform. <em>Id. </em>The Constitutional Convention of 1872-73 was convened to reform corrupt legislative behavior, and to this end, the result was the constitutional strictures contained in Article III. <em>See </em>R. Branning, Pennsylvania Constitutional Development 37 (1960). Thus, while these changes to the Constitution originated during a unique time of fear of tyrannical corporate power and legislative corruption, these mandates retain their value even today by placing certain constitutional limitations on the legislative process.</p>

The challenge was framed under the clear-title facet of Article III, Section 3, on the theory that the title of the enactment failed to afford adequate notice that the legislation would supplant prior legislation which dedicated the revenue stream from dog and livestock regulation to public education. This Court, however, rejected that challenge.

We need not enter this debate here, however. It is sufficient for our purposes that the General Assembly has not made a complete appropriation, such that, prior to disbursement of the special funds, it must proceed in accordance with the special appropriation provision of Article III, Section 11. <em>See generally Common Cause of Pa. v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/a2d/668/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="149" data-cite="668 A.2d 190" data-case-ids="7861127" data-case-paths="/a2d/668/0190-01">668 A.2d 190</a>, 199 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995) (reflecting prevailing law which, at least subject to this Court’s future consideration, rejects the inclusion within a general appropriations bill of a special fund appropriation that resides outside of <em>Powell’s </em>reach), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em><a href="/pa/544/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="150" data-cite="544 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="463572" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0512-01">544 Pa. 512</a>, <a href="/pa/544/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="151" data-cite="677 A.2d 1206" data-case-ids="463572,7876334" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0512-01,/a2d/677/1206-01">677 A.2d 1206</a> (1996).</p>

        <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>We also do not overlook that prior decisions have sometimes deemphasized the special apportionment provision of Article III, Section II, either overlooking its role entirely, <em>see, e.g., Powell, </em><a href="/citations/?q=94%20A.%20746" class="citation" data-index="152" data-cite="94 A. 746">94 A. at 749</a> (stating that Article III, Section 11 "was only intended to apply to the biennial appropriation made by the Legislature”), or relegating it to the status of surplusage in light of Article III, Section 3 single-subject requirement. <em>See, e.g., Constitution Defense League v. Waters, </em><a href="/pa/309/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="153" data-cite="309 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1141712" data-case-paths="/pa/309/0545-01">309 Pa. 545</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=164%20A.%20613" class="citation" data-index="154" data-cite="164 A. 613">164 A. 613</a> (1933) (equating the single-subject provisions of Article III, Section 3 and Article III, Section 11). Our decision today reinvigorates Article III, Section 11 as it pertains to source-only-related special funds, recognizing the provision’s substantial and independent role.</p>

As a separate matter, we acknowledge that there are significant policy justifica]ions militating against severance on a finding of a violation of the single-subject provision in circumstances where logrolling may have occurred. <em>See, e.g., </em>Martha J.

Many jurisdictions, however, enforce the legislative intent that severance should be accomplished even in such a context. <em>See, e.g., Hammerschmidt v.

Here, the provisions that we have found must be severed appear comparably modest in comparison to the overall character and effect of the legislation; indeed, the Legislature did not deem it necessary to include a specific referent to them in the title of the Gaming Act. Moreover, Petitioners have not asserted that our precedent should be overruled. Accordingly, we will enforce the clearly indicated legislative intent, <em>see </em>4 Pa.C.S. § 1902, in conformance with precedent.</p>
