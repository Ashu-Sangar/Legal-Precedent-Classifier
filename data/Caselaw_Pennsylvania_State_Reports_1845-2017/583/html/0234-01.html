Rather than subject the individual utility properties to the various local real estate taxes, Article VIII, Section 4<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> of the Constitution <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>authorized the legislature to provide such revenue by levying on the utilities gross receipts taxes or other special taxes payable to the Commonwealth. To implement the constitutional provision, the General Assembly enacted PURTA in 1970. PURTA permits the Commonwealth to collect the equivalent of a local real estate tax from utilities “at the rate of thirty mills upon each dollar of the State taxable value of its utility realty at the end of the preceding calendar year.” 72 P.S. 8102-A(a). Under PURTA, the Department collects the tax from the utilities and distributes those tax revenues to Local Taxing Authorities (“LTA”) throughout Pennsylvania, such as counties, municipalities, and school districts. The distribution back to the LTAs is the equivalent of the real estate tax the LTAs otherwise could have imposed on utility real estate (the “realty tax equivalent”) and is distributed to the LTAs based upon a formula intended to replace the amount of tax foregone by the LTAs by not levying a real estate tax on the public utilities.</p>

Each year, the Department provides the utility with a form upon which the utility inserts the state taxable value of its real estate subject to the PURTA tax and this figure is multiplied by the tax rate. Based on the <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>calculation of its liability, the utility remits payment to the Department, along with a sworn statement as to the method of computing the state taxable value. 72 P.S. § 8102-A(a-b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Utilities, like the Appellants, calculate their tax liability based on the net book value of their respective realty. <em><a href="/a2d/825/0733-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="825 A.2d 733" data-case-ids="9116832" data-case-paths="/a2d/825/0733-01">Id.</a> </em>An LTA, for its part, files a report of the assessed value of utility realty within its district, the rate of its real estate tax, and the realty tax equivalent obtained by multiplying the assessed value and tax rate. 72 P.S. § 8106-A(a). The Department then must distribute to each reporting LTA its share of the total realty tax equivalent, based on the ratio of each LTA’s total tax receipts to the total tax receipts of all LTAs. 72 P.S. § 8107-A. Because the PURTA statute requires the utilities to assess their PURTA tax liability on the net book value of their realty, and the Department distributes the PURTA tax revenue using local assessed value, the revenues collected by the Department and the amounts it disbursed generally are not equal. In fact, from 1970 to 1994, the total PURTA tax revenues collected exceeded the total PURTA distribution to the LTAs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The first year the distribution exceeded the reve<a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>nue collected was 1994.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The department shall notify each reporting public utility of such ratio, and it shall be the duty of such public utility, within forty-five days thereafter, to pay to the State Treasurer, through the Department of Revenue, an additional amount of tax equal to the product of (1) such ratio and (2) the State taxable value shown in its report required by section 1102-A(b).

As discussed, the taxpayers lack the information necessary to compute the PURTA assessment ratio, and must rely upon the Department to supply that figure as part of the notice of tax due and payable. <em>See </em>RR. 41a.</p>

PURTA was amended after the tax period in question to specify that the LTAs' Section 1106-A reports are public documents, notwithstanding Section 731 of the Fiscal Code. <em>See </em>72 P.S. § 8106-A(c) (as amended by the Act of May 12, 1999, P.L. 26, No. 4, § 20).

The Department maintains that the post-deprivation procedures provided by the Commonwealth comport with due process because Appellants have available administrative and judicial review, and during such review they are guaranteed the right to representation by counsel, oral and deposition testimony, affidavits and subpoenas, a written decision, and the like. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellees at 22-23. Absent access to the information necessary to test the accuracy of the amount of tax owed as stated by the Department, however, these facets of the post-deprivation process do not, by themselves, satisfy the <em>McKesson </em>standard as recited above.</p>
