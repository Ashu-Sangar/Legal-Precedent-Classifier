Furthermore, the prosecutor’s references to Appellant’s having been from the “big city” and admonition that “you don’t come up here into this county and shoot a boy and a hard working girl,” are similar (albeit more closely confined to the circumstances at hand in the present case) to the sort of “outsider-based” argumentation that was disapproved by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v.

On this claim, I am in alignment with the majority’s assessment only as to its points concerning the availability of an ineffectiveness challenge in connection with the absence of an objection to the district attorney’s opening statement (at which time Appellant was engaged in self-representation), and the reasonable basis and prejudice prongs of the ineffectiveness inquiry relative to the absence of an objection by counsel during the prosecutor’s closing. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 371-74, 877 A.2d at 441-42.</p>

Whereas in most cases there is considerable overlap in the practical application of these concepts, the two are not the same.

Given such differences, I believe that this Court should require that the essential distinction between specific intent to kill and malice be more carefully observed in jury charges. Nevertheless, as I do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that the jurors empaneled at Appellant’s trial applied the challenged instruction in a way that violates the Constitution, <em>see Middleton v.

In this regard, the majority relies on the analysis from Appellant’s direct appeal, to the effect that the trial court’s errors in admitting the evidence were harmless. <em>See id. </em>at 19.

Since overwhelming evidence of criminal liability is not dispositive with regard to a capital sentencing jury’s determination as between the imposition of a fife sentence and a death verdict, I believe that an independent assessment is due concerning the penalty-phase impact of the incorporated, erroneously admitted evidence.

Appellant notes, however, that two of the defined terms (“fireman” and “hijacking”) appearing in the same listing as the perpetration-of-a-felony term and definition are not substantively employed in Section 2502, and therefore, that those definitions would be rendered superfluous if Section 2502(d) were not understood as pertinent to the death penalty statute, where all of the terms are expressly used. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(1) (defining as an aggravating circumstance, <em>inter alia, </em>the killing of a firefighter in the performance of his duties or as a result of his official position);<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(4) (killing while engaged in hijacking of an aircraft). From a broader frame of reference, Appellant observes that only criminal defendants convicted of first-degree murder may be subjected to the capital sentencing process under Section 9711; however, Section 9711 not itself define first-degree murder. Instead, the <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>definition of first-degree murder is found in Section 2502(a) (“A criminal homicide constitutes murder of the first degree when it is committed by an intentional killing.”), which conjoins with another definitional provision of Section 2502(d) (defining “intentional killing” as “[kjilling by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing.”). Thus, Appellant observes that the most elemental questions concerning Section 9711 lead inexorably to Section 2502(d)’s definitions, where, just like the definitions for an essential element of first-degree murder, of fireman, and of hijacking, the definition of “perpetration of a felony” is also found, corresponding to Section 9711(d)(6)’s perpetration-of-a-felony aggravator.</p>

In this regard, Appellant posits that the drafting history reveals that Sections 2502 of the Crimes Code and 9711 of the Sentencing Code were originally components of a single statutory provision, but became uncoupled based on organizational concerns, a reason having nothing to do with the relevant definitions of first-degree murder and intentional killing, fireman, hijacking, and/or perpetration of a felony.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> In particular, Appellant <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>notes the relative juxtaposition (through the mid-1970’s) of the substantive offense provisions of Sections 2502 and the sentencing provisions of Section 1311 of the Crimes Code, predecessor to the present Section 9711 of the Sentencing Code.</p>

In response, the General Assembly amended Section 1311 of the Crimes Code by adding several mitigating circumstances, including the catch-all mitigator, as well as adding a clause requiring imposition of a death sentence if the jury finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances or if the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, and the return of a life sentence in all other cases. <em>See </em>Act of Sep. 13, 1978, P.L. 756, No. 141, § 1. The 1978 amendments thus brought the capital sentencing scheme into essentially its present-day form. In <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>1980, however, the provisions of Section 1311 of the Crimes Code were transferred to their current location at Section 9711. <em>See </em>Act of Oct. 5, 1980, P.L. 693, No. 142, § 401(a).

Stephens, </em><a href="/us/462/0862-01" class="citation" data-index="133" data-cite="462 U.S. 862" data-case-ids="6195530" data-case-paths="/us/462/0862-01">462 U.S. 862</a>, 877, <a href="/us/462/0862-01" class="citation" data-index="134" data-cite="462 U.S. 862" data-case-ids="6195530" data-case-paths="/us/462/0862-01">103 S.Ct. 2733</a>, 2742, <a href="/us/462/0862-01" class="citation" data-index="135" data-cite="462 U.S. 862" data-case-ids="6195530" data-case-paths="/us/462/0862-01">77 L.Ed.2d 235</a> (1983) (holding that, to satisfy the constitutional standard derived from <em>Furman, </em>an aggravating circumstance “must genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant as compared to others found guilty of murder.”). In this regard, Appellant highlights that all other states having a capital sentencing system in which the sentencer is permitted to consider commission of the killing during the perpetration of a felony in aggravation specifically limit the relevant to discrete, explicitly enumerated groups of felony offenses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a>

The Commonwealth also advocates a strict, plain meaning approach to Section 2502(d), but gives no account for the fact that an wholly internal treatment of the provision renders several of the defined terms superfluous. According to the Commonwealth, the legislative history is irrelevant. The Commonwealth also notes that several other terms used in Section 9711 contain express cross-references to definitional provisions, thus suggesting that if the Legislature had intended to incorporate Section 2502(d)’s definitions, it would have done so expressly.</p>
    <p id="b592-4" data-blocks='[["BL_592.5",592,[276,1066,1164,1127]],["BL_593.2",593,[165,335,1156,585]]]'>In my view, the absence of any substantive import of several of Section 2502(d)’s definitions within Section 2502(d) itself renders the statute ambiguous, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(2) (setting forth the presumption that the General Assembly intends the entire statute to be effective and certain), and thus implicates principles of statutory construction, such as reference to the legislative history. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(7). In review of that history, it is apparent that, in fashioning the Pennsylvania death penalty statute the General Assembly was responding to constitutional requirements as explained in decisions of the United States Supreme Court dictating the maintenance of carefully defined, narrowing criteria as the threshold to death eligibility. <em>See </em>Legis. J.—Senate at 721-23 (June 26, 1978) (setting forth a formal statement of the legislative history surrounding former Section 1311 of the Crimes Code); <em>see also Zant, </em><a href="/us/462/0862-01" class="citation" data-index="136" data-cite="462 U.S. 862" data-case-ids="6195530" data-case-paths="/us/462/0862-01">462 U.S. at 877</a>, <a href="/us/462/0862-01" class="citation" data-index="137" data-cite="462 U.S. 862" data-case-ids="6195530" data-case-paths="/us/462/0862-01">103 S.Ct. at 2742</a> (elaborating on <em>Furman’s </em>dictates). Section 2502(d)’s narrowing definition of perpetration of a felony aligns precisely with this approach, and I agree with Appellant that the provision gains full meaning only when read in conjunction <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>with the death penalty statute. The approach of reading Sections 2502 and 9711 in conjunction also comports with this Court’s obligation to construe the death penalty statute narrowly. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1); <em>Commonwealth v. Stallworth, </em><a href="/pa/566/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="138" data-cite="566 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="706233" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0349-01">566 Pa. 349</a>, 373-74 &amp; n. 7, <a href="/pa/566/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="139" data-cite="781 A.2d 110" data-case-ids="706233,9477016" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0349-01,/a2d/781/0110-01">781 A.2d 110</a>, 124 &amp; n. 7 (2001). Finally, reading Section 9711 independent of Section 2502(d) also creates the apparent anomaly that the limitation upon felonies eligible for perpetration-of-a-felony status applies to second-degree murder (the definition of which is found within Section 2502), but not to capital sentencing, in which setting the narrowing function is most critical.</p>
