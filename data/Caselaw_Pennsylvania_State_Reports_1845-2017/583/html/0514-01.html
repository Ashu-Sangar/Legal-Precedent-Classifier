In a written report submitted to appellee Asbell and dated January 17, 1995, Vincent Carita, one of the engineers who conducted the evaluation, noted that although the portion of the pier structure that had not collapsed was in generally fair condition, there were a “number of deficient front row piles along the upriver side and outshore end of the pier.” N.T., 11/14/01, at p.10. Accordingly, the report recommended a “comprehensive maintenance and repair plan” and a “thorough and comprehensive condition survey ... in order to fully detail the exact nature and extent of required repairs.” <em>Id. </em>While the inshore portion of the pier that had collapsed was eventually repaired with a “concrete high deck structure,” appellees ignored the recommendation that the remainder of the pier be further evaluated at that time. <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>

As a result, appellees once again employed Hudson Engineers to conduct emergency repairs and also to evaluate Pier 34 for the purpose of bringing the vessel containing the Moshulu Restaurant from Camden, New Jersey, across the river, and docking it at the pier. Mark Klein, an engineer employed by Hudson at the time, conducted the investigation and concluded, consistent with Carita’s opinion ten months earlier, that the pier’s <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>pilings were “leaning in an outshore direction” and that the pier was “no longer intact.” <em>Id. </em>at 25-26.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On November 1, 1995, Klein, along with Sam Hudson, President of Hudson Engineers, and Rob Hudson, President of J.E.

The group recommended to appellees that the pier be rebuilt in its entirety, but appellees rejected that recommendation because the estimated cost of such an extensive project was too high. Instead, appellees opted merely to have the pier “stabilized.” <em>Id. </em>at 34. However, notwithstanding the engineers’ urging that the pier be monitored and continuously reassessed during the stabilization process, appellees ceased the monitoring in December of 1995 because of the significant cost. <em>Id. </em>at 174. Indeed, the engineers undertook to do “the least amount to stop the pier or hold it in place.” <em>Id. </em>at 36. The stabilization work was completed in April of 1996. <em>Id. </em>at 176.</p>

While Hudson was there, Karetny requested that he view some cracks that had developed in the parking lot area. Hudson found that the parking lot area was stable, but was alarmed by one large crack that had appeared on the pier, just outside the doorway of the banquet building. Upon further inspection, Hudson noticed that the ceiling inside the building was beginning to separate. N.T., 11/14/01, at 180. Hudson cautioned appellees that an intact pier would move only “microscopically,” but that, in his estimation, Pier 34 had moved a distance of about one and one-half of an inch. <em>Id. </em>at 182.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Hudson once <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>again recommended that the pier be surveyed, or monitored, on a continual basis, and once again, appellees rejected that suggestion. Specifically, appellee Asbell replied that monitoring the pier would not result in uncovering anything he did not “already know.” <em>Id. </em>at 181. No repairs were undertaken at that time.</p>

Ascher filled and patched the crack. On January 20, 2000, Ascher was again called to the pier by Karetny in order to address a split in the carpeting that had been caused by that portion of the crack which was extending inside of the building. Ascher, while in the presence of Karetny, cut the carpeting and observed that the crack was approximately eight feet long and three inches deep in some places. N.T., 11/13/01, at 174; 177. At the direction of a third person to whom he was introduced by Karetny, Ascher cemented the crack and repaired the carpeting to conceal it.</p>

He was met by Karetny and found a gas pipe that ran along a railing on the side of the pier. The pipe had bent, and Jones repaired it the following day. Karetny explained to Jones that the reason the pipe had bent was “probably from the pier moving.” <em>Id. </em>at 142.</p>

Tyson employed a diver to examine the underwater structure of the pier. The diver arrived early the next day and, before diving, took appellees out on his boat and showed them that certain steel pilings, which had been installed as reinforcements, were “twisting.” <em>Id. </em>at 14. During the dive, the diver reported to Tyson and appellees that, in fact, fill had been leaking out from small openings in the underside of the horizontal pier structure and that the rows of pilings were “out of plumb on the top leaning toward New Jersey.” <em>Id. </em>at 16. On that same occasion, appellees also asked Tyson to investigate the crack in and outside of the banquet building. Tyson informed appellees that the separation was, in fact, not a “crack,” but a construction joint. Tyson observed that the joint had opened to approximately three inches both inside and outside the building, and he also witnessed two of appellees’ employees pouring sand and gravel into the joint.</p>

Tyson also noted for Asbell that “old piers do collapse” and pointed out that fifty feet of pier had recently collapsed on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River. Tyson also remarked that appellees had no safety equipment available on the pier, to which Asbell replied, “I had them out there but people stole them so the hell with them.” Mat21.</p>

Karetny told Cucciniello that the holes in the floor should be “of no concern” to her and that they were merely “raising the pier from underneath.” N.T., 11/13/01, at 87-88.</p>

Karetny also noticed that “the bottom of the building [was] pushing out.” <em>Id. </em>When Tyson arrived at the pier, appellees called his attention to a plate in the seawall that had been secured by bolts, and which was not meant to move at all. The plate had moved, along with the wall, over six inches, shearing off the heads of the bolts that had secured it. Tyson also noted that the construction joint extending through the banquet building, which had been open three inches a few days earlier, was now open to approximately seven inches. Finally, Tyson noted a new, three-inch-wide crack near the outshore end of the ballroom in the banquet building and that the door to that building was jammed shut because the doorjamb had shifted. <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>Tyson concluded that the pier had moved approximately eight inches from May 16 to May 18. <em>Id. </em>at 28, 29.</p>

Tyson concluded that “that would have been about the time that the river was going down below [from the tide] and it would be leaving the underside of that structural deck and therefore, the river wouldn’t be helping to hold up the pier....” <em>Id. </em>at 30. Tyson admonished appellees in no uncertain terms: “[Y]our pier is in a state of failure.... [It] will probably collapse tonight between 8 and 9 o’clock ...

The crack extended from the ballroom to the edge of the pier. Lawrence Price, a security guard on duty at the building that evening, was instructed by a night club manager to assist in covering the gaping crack with plates of sheet metal. N.T., 11/13/01, at 51. In fulfillment of Tyson’s prediction, later that evening when the tide receded, at approximately 8 p.m., the pier collapsed, and the entire nightclub and a portion of the ballroom building fell into the Delaware River. Three young women, DeAnn White, Jean Marie Ferraro, and Monica Rodriguez, were tragically killed in the collapse, and forty-three others, includ<a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>ing several rescue personnel, were injured. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 11.

The crux of the Commonwealth’s position is that the trial court erred in finding that the enumerated “means” for causing/risking catastrophe in Section 3302(a) are exclusive and also in finding that appellees did not “employ” any dangerous forces or substances. Indeed, quoting the actual language of Section 3302(a), the Commonwealth submits that a person is liable under the statute when he “causes” or “creates the risk of catastrophe” not only through the use of any of the enumerated “forces” or “substances” but also “by any other means of causing potentially widespread injury or damage.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 3302(a). Thus, the Commonwealth explains that “the statute is broadly drawn to include all possible destructive forces within the capacity of human ingenuity.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 18. Furthermore, the Commonwealth argues that appellees, in fact, “employed” a dangerous force: <em>ie., </em>they made a collapsing pier open to the public for their own <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>profit, knowing it was about to fail, while actively concealing the danger from their unsuspecting victims.

Appellees further argue that, because Section 3302 does not plainly and unambiguously cover their conduct, this Court must give the statute the most reasonable construction consistent with legislative intent—which, they say, is that the statute was meant to cover more egregious conduct than what occurred here. Appellees submit that their conduct—which they pose as an omission rather than an act—is covered exclusively by Section 3303 (failure to prevent catastrophe) and that to hold otherwise would make Section 3303 mere surplusage. Furthermore, appellees invoke the principle of <em>esjudem generis, </em>which provides that general expressions in a statute are restricted to things and persons similar to those specifically enumerated in the language preceding the general expression. Appellees imply that the catch-all phraseology in Section <em>3302(a)—i.e., </em>“other harmful or destructive force or substance, or by any other means of causing potentially widespread injury or damage”—should be construed, in light of the more specific preceding <em>language—i.e., </em>“explosion, fire, flood, avalanche, collapse of building, release of poison gas, radioactive material”—to criminalize only a very narrow scope of dangerous activities.

According to such evidence, not only did appellees ignore or discount their own observations of the severity of the pier’s decline, they also repeatedly and consistently disregarded assessments and warnings from their engineers that put appellees on notice of the increasing likelihood of the pier’s collapse. Indeed, this evidence, if believed, shows that, on the morning of the very day that the pier collapsed, their engineer predicted the approximate tide-related time at which and the manner in which the pier would collapse. Appellees disregarded that warning. It would be one thing if appellees, faced with the prospect of the pier collapsing, simply allowed it to happen under circumstances where it would affect nothing but the continued existence of the pier. But, under the Commonwealth’s evidence, appellees did not simply abandon the collapsing structure to the inexorable effect of “natural forces.” Nor did appellees abandon the structure while posting warning signs to keep persons away from the danger, or alert them to what appellees knew. Instead, the evidence adduced at the hearing would support a finding that appellees persisted in promoting the nightclub, booking in advance events at their several facilities on the pier. Moreover, this evidence plainly advances the Commonwealth’s position that, on the night of the collapse, appellees engaged in what <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>amounted to a literal “cover-up”: they ordered that the ever-growing crack in the floor of their banquet building—tell-tale evidence of the very real calamity awaiting any person who ventured onto the premises—be concealed.</p>

The evidence of appellees’ conduct in this case was sufficient to warrant a jury in finding the reckless creation of a risk of catastrophe. Furthermore, while appellees’ knowing disregard of the inevitable may not, in and of itself, amount to the “employment” of a means, substance, or force in risking the catastrophe, their action in continuing to advertise, promote, and hold open their facilities to the public, coupled with the act of concealing the fact of inevitable collapse from their patrons, is sufficient to warrant a jury in finding affirmative “employment” on appellees’ part. While appellees can offer contrary evidence at trial and/or argue to the jury that they were guilty only of “inaction,” the jury is not obliged to accept such position in the face of the above-referenced evidence. Instead, the totality of the aforementioned factors would support a jury in finding that appellees’ conduct and response amounted to “employment” of a means and created the risk.</p>

    <p id="b737-4" data-blocks='[["BL_737.4",737,[166,956,1153,906]]]'>In this case, the evidence of appellees’ advertising, promotion, and opening of their facilities to the public, while taking active measures to conceal the visible evidence of the pier’s severe deterioration and concomitant imminent danger, and while failing to provide any warning to their patrons of the danger awaiting them, were facts sufficient to make out a <em>prima facie </em>charge under Section 3302. Certainly, if and when the matter proceeds to trial, appellees are free to argue to the factfinder that that same conduct, at most, proves a failure to prevent a catastrophe. The existence of these provisions does not reveal an act of legislative duplication, but an intent to account for all potentially culpable conduct in this area. Accordingly, we conclude that the Commonwealth is not barred from prosecuting appellees for both risking a catastrophe and failure to prevent a catastrophe, nor is it barred from prosecuting appellees for criminal conspiracy to the extent the object of the conspiracy was to commit either of those crimes.</p>

The majority opined that the "any other means” language was taken “out of context” and quoted the entirety of the subsection, although it did not explain what it perceived as the import of the entire quoted text. The majority then commented that although the dissent cited no authority for appellees' “alleged duty to act,” the majority would "assume they had such a duty” but that, “[i]n any event ... because both [Section 3302(b) and 3303] might irreconcilably apply to this case, Pennsylvania law permits prosecution on failure to prevent a catastrophe only.” <em>Karetny, </em><a href="/a2d/837/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="837 A.2d 474" data-case-ids="9299327" data-case-paths="/a2d/837/0474-01">837 A.2d at </a>478 n. 4.

It appears that the Commonwealth did not, in fact, raise an argument regarding 42 Pa.C.S. § 9303 on appeal to the Superior Court. However, the Commonwealth was the appellant below, and it was not faced with a finding or holding by the trial court on the general-specific construction issue. The Commonwealth became aggrieved on this point only when the Superior Court majority seized upon the one-line argument in appellees’ brief on the point as an independent basis for affirming the trial court. In pressing appellate claims, no party is required to predict, identify, and rebut all new or alternative theories that might be invoked by the appellate court. There is no waiver.</p>
