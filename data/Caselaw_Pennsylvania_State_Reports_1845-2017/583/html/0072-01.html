A divided Commonwealth Court panel reversed, holding that the Board had the burden of establishing a lack of good repute, that an applicant’s criminal and citation history are irrelevant to a determination of good repute, and that the Board had failed to produce relevant evidence to prove lack of good repute. For the following reasons, we find that the liquor license applicant bears the burden of proof concerning good repute and that the Board and the trial court properly deteimined that citation history and prior misdemeanor con<a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>victions are relevant to the question of good repute.

The 21 citations resulted in over $8,000 in civil penalties, seven license suspensions, and the revocation of a Sunday Sales Permit.

In addition, in 1996, both William and Thomas were convicted of gambling and conspiracy arising from the use of video slot or poker machines at one of their licensed establishments, Skinny Dugan’s, Inc.

The Board later filed a 30-page opinion in support of its conclusion. The Board summarized in great detail its prior history and familiarity with the Goldens involving their other liquor licenses and prior citations. The Board also noted the Goldens’ prior convictions. In the Boards view, there was “no question” that, in the context of a liquor license transfer, an applicants prior operational history, including a history of Liquor Code violations and citations, is relevant to the question of good repute. The Board noted that:</p>

While William Golden, III correctly testified that no license has ever been revoked, the licenses had received over $8,000.00 in fines, seven license suspensions, and the revocation of a Sunday Sales Permit. Further, one license was warned not once, but twice, to improve its operation or risk loss of its license in a nuisance bar action. In all but two of the citations, the charges were not even contested, and William Golden’s attitude towards these citations at the administrative hearing held in this case appeared to be unapologetic; he was either “not present” when the violations occurred, or felt that some of the charges resulted from downturns in business or were not worth fighting. He offered no explanation at all about how or why the many sales to minors occurred, other than his opinion that those types of charges cannot ever be won if contested. The Board finds this lack of acknowledgment of his responsibility to abide by the liquor laws in the past to be indicative of future disregard of those same laws.</blockquote>

They have demonstrated a disregard of both the liquor laws and the criminal laws of the Commonwealth, as evidenced by repeated citations for sales to minors, permitting minors to frequent, bounced checks, falsification of an application, and other unlawful acts, and by their past criminal convictions, especially using three of their licensed establishments as gambling venues. Thus, the Boards inability to find the Goldens to be persons of good repute precludes the approval of this application.</blockquote>

Following a <em>de novo </em>hearing, the trial court affirmed, citing with approval to the Boards analysis. The court noted the Goldens’ extensive operational history with the Board and their “sizeable citation history.” In light of that citation history, the court reasoned that the Goldens had failed to demonstrate past compliance with the Liquor Code. The court also agreed with the Board that the Goldens’ previous convictions, though misdemeanors, were relevant to the question of good repute. Like the Board, the trial court was particularly concerned with the convictions for gambling and conspiracy. In the trial courts view, the <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>Board did not err in finding itself unsatisfied that the Goldens were persons of good repute, given their citation history and prior convictions.

Invoking dictionary definitions, the majority concluded that the Board had the burden of proving that the Goldens “do not have a good reputation among the community” in order to justify denying the license transfer under the statute’s good repute provision. Slip op. at 7, <em>citing </em>Black’s Law Dictionary 1303 (6th ed.1990) (defining “repute,” in part, as “reputation or the character and status commonly ascribed to one’s actions by the public”) and Webster’s Third International Dictionary 1929 (2002) (defining “repute” as “the character or status commonly ascribed to one: the popular opinion of one: reputation of a specific kind.”).</p>

Thomas Golden testified that he was a member of his church; and that he had coached two basketball teams for nine years in the Pennsbury Athletic Association. The majority opined that the Goldens’ testimony supported a finding of good reputation in the community because the organizations in which they were involved presumably would not have permitted them to accept leadership roles if they had had poor reputations. The majority noted that, while the Goldens’ testimony was not the strongest evidence of good repute, it was sufficient given the absence of Board regulations specifying what evidence was necessary and appropriate to show good repute.

In the majority’s view, the citations were irrelevant for reasons which, although it is not entirely clear, call to mind notions of double jeopardy. Without citing to any authority, the majority reasoned that, because the citations had been resolved by sanctions, to consider them in the transfer process would improperly allow the citations to be “used twice” and to “have force and effect even after they were closed by the imposition of sanctions.” The criminal histories were deemed irrelevant because, in the majority’s view, those records somehow related only to character and not to reputation in the community.

The Board notes that the plain language of Section 404 provides that the Board shall grant and issue a liquor license to an applicant only “upon ... being satisfied” that, among other things, the applicant is a person of good repute. The Board argues that the fact that the process is initiated by the applicant, and that it is the Board which must be “satisfied” that the applicant qualifies for a license, clearly suggests <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>that the burden is upon the applicant.

Under Section 404, the Board is initially involved not as a quasi-prosecutor or even as an adverse party, but in a capacity of evaluation and determination. Upon receipt of the application and fees, the Board is obliged to issue a license only if it is “satisfied” both that the statements in the application are truthful and that certain enumerated conditions are established, including that the applicant is a person of good repute. The statute does not state that applicants are presumed to be of good repute, such that the Board is in a position of rebuttal; rather, the determination of good repute is a matter vested in the discretion of the Board, a discretion which is triggered by review of the application. By holding that the Board has the burden of <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>disproving good repute, the Commonwealth Court essentially read into Section 404 a presumption of good repute which is not found in the statutory text.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

The Board first cites the general proposition that the test for relevancy is a liberal one: thus, under the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence, evidence is relevant if it has “any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Pa.R.E. 401. The Board ' further notes that, in the administrative context, the evidentiary standard is relaxed; thus, Section 505 of the Administrative Agency Law provides that “Commonwealth agencies shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence at agency hearings, and all relevant evidence of reasonably probative value may be received.” 2 Pa.C.S. § 505.</p>

The Board correctly notes that there is a wealth of case law to the contrary, holding that double jeopardy concerns do not apply in proceedings, such as this, which are of a civil nature. <em>See, e.g., Atiyeh v.

The Board submits that criminal convictions are, at a minimum, “reasonably probative” of the question of whether an individual is reputable. Citing to a broad range of cases, the Board argues that criminal convictions have at least some impact upon measuring a person’s reputation, the degree of the impact being a question of the relative seriousness of the offense and the character trait in question. The Board submits that the Commonwealth Court erred to the extent it deemed misdemeanor convictions to be irrelevant because they supposedly speak exclusively to “character,” and never to “reputation.” The Board also cites cases from both the Commonwealth Court and the Superior Court which have held that prior misdemeanor convictions are at least relevant to the question of whether a person is reputable. <em>See Appeal of Irene’s Café, </em>44 Pa.Cmwlth. 20, <a href="/citations/?q=404%20A.2d%20707" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="404 A.2d 707">404 A.2d 707</a>, 709 (1979) (misdemeanor convictions deemed relevant to repute for purposes of Board’s requested approval of manager of licensed premises); <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellee argues that, in cases where a corporation is the liquor license applicant, it is a latter part of Section 404 which governs; and that provision states only that the Board has discretion to refuse a license if “any officer or director of such corporation, or any member or partner of such partnership or association shall have been convicted or found guilty of a felony within a period of five (5) years immediately predating the date of application for the said license.” 47 P.S. § 4-404.

Thus, appellee submits that the violations were largely by employees of the corporate entity and emphasizes that, notwithstanding the citations, none of the Goldens’ previous liquor licenses had ever been revoked or rescinded. Appellee argues that in light of these circumstances, the citations do not prove that the Goldens are persons lacking “good repute” such that the license transfer was properly denied. Notably, for purposes of the legal question accepted for review by this Court, appellee does not dispute that citation history is a relevant consideration on the question of good repute; instead, its argument largely goes to the weight that should be accorded that evidence. Nor does appellee attempt to defend the Commonwealth Court’s reasoning that double jeopardy-<a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>related concerns somehow prohibit consideration of “settled” citations in assessing the entitlement to a liquor license transfer.</p>

Appellee also echoes the Commonwealth Court’s suggestion that the Liquor Code does not authorize denial of a license application premised upon misdemeanor convictions of corporate officers. With respect to the Board’s argument that criminal convictions can affect a person’s reputation, appellee concedes that point as a general matter, but then argues that the question here is whether in fact the Goldens’ reputations were so affected.

The requirement that the applicant for various forms of liquor licenses or permits be a “reputable person” or person of “good repute,” or that the establishment to be operated be a reputable one, is common throughout the Liquor Code. <em>See, e.g., </em>47 Pa.C.S. §§ 1-102, 2-207, 4-431, 4-432, 4-433, 4-437, 4-461, 7-703.

The method of proving character is by showing the general reputation of the person in the neighborhood in which he lives. What is proven, therefore, is not a person’s real character, but his character as reputed among his neighbors, or what the consensus of opinion of the neighbors is as to his character.</blockquote>

But we have no doubt that it had an obvious and important meaning when enacted in the wake of Prohibition, an era during which the distribution of alcohol was in the hands of decidedly “disreputable” persons, acting illegally. This may well explain why the General Assembly saw no need to define the term further.</p>
    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[269,671,1169,1286]]]'>For this Court’s present consideration, what matters more is that the question is one of mere relevance for purposes of the Board’s administrative determination. In this regard, we believe the Board rightly considered prior instances of conduct known (or knowable) to the Board, such as the applicant’s citation history and prior convictions, to be relevant to the applicant’s burden to show good repute. The “repute” of which the Code speaks can only be understood in terms of the purpose for which repute is to be considered, <em>i.e., </em>to determine if issuance of a liquor license is appropriate. The question for the Board cannot be whether the applicant has a localized reputation as a “good guy” generally. Logically, the General Assembly was concerned with repute as it may be relevant to the responsibility which is a necessary concomitant of the privilege represented by the license, <em>ie., </em>the “highest degree of responsibility [owed] to [one’s] fellow citizens” which is assumed along with the license. <em>Koczwara, </em><a href="/citations/?q=155%20A.2d%20825" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="155 A.2d 825">155 A.2d at 828</a>. The applicant’s citation history in connection with other liquor licenses is extremely probative in order to accurately measure whether a person (or establishment) is reputable. A history of citations, and a consideration of the appropriateness of the applicant’s response to those citations, may suggest a lack of regard for the liquor laws. A person lacking in such regard can hardly be deemed a person of good repute for purposes of securing a liquor license.</p>

In such instances, the applicant will usually have some history with the Board, whether good or bad. Arguably, the single most important factor in assessing fitness for the privilege of <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>licensure is the applicant’s Liquor Code performance and compliance in the past.

Thus, consider if, instead of their own testimony, the Goldens had proffered classic reputation <em>evidence—ie., </em>testimony from friends and neighbors concerning their reputation in the relevant community for traits of character which are implicated in running a licensed liquor establishment. Presumably, those traits would include law abidingness. Such character witnesses could certainly be impeached with specific instances of conduct, including previous Liquor Code citations, in order to call into question their qualifications to speak for the community on the issue, <em>i.e., </em>their basis of knowledge of the person or trait and the standard by which they measure reputation. <em>See </em>Pa.R.E. 405(a) (“On cross-examination of the reputation witness, inquiry is allowable into specific instances of conduct probative of the character trait in question, except that in criminal cases inquiry into allegations of other criminal misconduct of the accused is not permissible.”); <em><a href="/citations/?q=155%20A.2d%20825" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="155 A.2d 825">id.</a> </em>Rule 405(b)(1) (“In civil cases where character or a trait of character is admissible as an element of a claim or defense, character may be proved by specific instances of conduct”). As the U.S. Supreme Court has noted in the context of impeaching character witnesses with evidence of arrests, “If one never heard the speculations and rumors in which even one’s friends indulge upon his arrest, the jury may doubt whether he is capable of giving any very reliable conclusions as to his reputation.” <em>Michelson v.

Even accepting for purposes of this decision that the Board would lack authority to deny a liquor license on the basis of misdemeanor convictions alone (given that the statute lists felony convictions as a disqualifier which is separate and distinct from the repute disqualifier), misdemeanor convictions surely are reasonably probative of repute. Certainly, there is nothing in Section 404 that prohibits the Board from considering misdemeanor convictions when deciding good repute. Like prior Liquor Code violations, misdemeanor convictions speak to the applicant’s law-abiding character. There is a particular relevance in the Goldens’ gambling convictions, since they arose in connection with a licensed establishment.</p>
