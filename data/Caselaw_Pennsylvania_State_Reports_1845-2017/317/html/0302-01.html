Henes. There is some evidence that he began to live with Mrs. Henes in 1917, and some that the relationship began at a later date. Mrs. Henes is a widow, whose husband died in 1910. She then had five children of her own. In later years she became the mother of four or five children by <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>McGovern.

To this end be gave two weeks’ notice and at tbe expiration thereof tbe entire balance in the account, to wit, $13,700, was withdrawn by Dr. Kraus and delivered to tbe decedent.

You take it. You have been good to me.

Tbe next day, the decedent, according to tbe physician’s testimony, told bim that be bad given the money to tbe plaintiff.

On that date Mrs. Henes had in her possession $6,000 of this original sum of $13,700, the rest of it having been, as she said, “used up.” The Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia ordered her to pay that remaining sum of $6,000 into court. A precept was then directed to the court of common pleas to try the issue whether this sum came into the possession of Mrs. Henes as a gift from McGovern during his lifetime. The court directed that in that issue “Alice E. Henes shall be plaintiff and have the affirmative in the burden of proof and the administrator shall be defendant.” On the issue submitted to the jury by this precept in the orphans’ court the ease was first tried on November 14,1933, and the jury found in favor of the defendant. On December 18th, a new trial was granted. This was had on February 19, 1934, and a verdict was again rendered for the defendant. Plaintiff’s motions for a new trial and for judgment n. o. v. were both refused. This appeal followed.</p>

This court would be justified in not considering this assignment for the reason that it does not appear in the record that any objection was made to the manner in which the issue was framed nor any exception taken. We have repeatedly held that questions not raised in the lower court will not be considered on appeal.

However, we deem it proper to say that if there was any error in the framing of the issue in this case, the error was one of <em>form </em>and not of <em>substance </em>because no principle is better settled in the law than that the burden of proof is on one claiming to be the donee of property to establish all facts essential to the validity of such gift. This court said in Maxler v. Hawk, <a href="/pa/233/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="233 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="981029" data-case-paths="/pa/233/0316-01">233 Pa. 316</a>, 323, <a href="/citations/?q=82%20A.%20251" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="82 A. 251">82 A. 251</a>: “The complaint ... is that the court erred in instructing the jury that the burden was on the defendant to satisfy the jury that the bonds were actually given to him by the decedent with the intention that he should have title to them. The essential elements of a gift inter vivos are an intention to give and such actual or constructive delivery of the thing given as places the absolute control of dominion over the gift in the donee. . . . The learned judge might have gone farther than he did and told the jury that the proof of the gift should be clear and convincing.” In Gongaware’s Est., <a href="/pa/265/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="265 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="1051843" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0512-01">265 Pa. 512</a>, 515, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.%20276" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="109 A. 276">109 A. 276</a>, this court said in an opinion by Mr. Justice Simpson : “The burden of proving a gift . . . is upon those who allege it.” In the Heading Trust Co. v.

The only title which defendant sets up is an alleged parol gift at that time, and, under the circumstances of this case, the burden was upon him to make proof thereof.” In McConville v. Ingham, <a href="/pa/268/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="268 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="1061505" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0507-01">268 Pa. 507</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.%2085" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="112 A. 85">112 A. 85</a>, this court said in an opinion by Mr. Justice Simpson : “In the present instance, however, the question as to whether or not there was a gift, was the initial inquiry and the storm center of the controversy. Upon this point the burden of proof was on defendant [i. e., the alleged donee] and not upon the plaintiff (nemo praesumitur donare), not only because the original own-<a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>ersliip of plaintiff is presumed to continue . . . but also because the defense is an affirmative one, which necessarily carries with it tbe burden of proof.” To the same effect are Sullivan v.

Hess, <a href="/pa/241/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="241 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="976036" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0407-01">241 Pa. 407</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.%20544" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="88 A. 544">88 A. 544</a>, this court said: “The burden of proof is upon the one who claims the benefit of a gift inter vivos, and the proof must be clear and satisfactory : Smith’s Est., <a href="/pa/237/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="237 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="988980" data-case-paths="/pa/237/0115-01">237 Pa. 115</a> [<a href="/citations/?q=85%20A.%2076" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="85 A. 76">85 A. 76</a>].”</p>

Henes the defendant. However, that Owen McGovern so owned this sum of money was admitted, and, this fact being admitted or at least easily proved, the burden would then have immediately shifted to Mrs. Henes to prove that this money was given to her as she alleged. Therefore, no substantial harm was done by placing the burden upon her in the first instance, as McGovern’s alleged gift and not his ownership of the subject of the “gift,” was the very essence of the controversy. It is not at all unusual in the trial of cases for the so-called “burden of proof” (or, more properly, the burden of coming forward with opposing evidence) to shift to defendant. The case of Zeck v. Hertz, <a href="/pa-super/11/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="11 Pa. Super. 512" data-case-ids="820926" data-case-paths="/pa-super/11/0512-01">11 Pa.

Super. 512" data-case-ids="820926" data-case-paths="/pa-super/11/0512-01">rior Ct. 512</a>, furnishes an example of tbe shifting of the so-called “burden of proof” in civil cases. Here plaintiff sued for money allegedly loaned defendants, and the affidavit of defense acknowledged receipt of the money but claimed it was “in consideration and payment for services rendered.” The Superior Court said: “The issue was thus resolved into the question, whether the money was furnished as a loan or a gift. With this shifting of the defense the burden of proof also shifted and cast upon the defendants the duty of showing to the satisfaction of the jury that the transaction was in fact a gift, unaided by any legal presumption in its favor.”</p>
    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[288,988,1149,693]]]'>There is considerable confusion of thought arising from the fact that the phrase “burden of proof” is used indiscriminately as meaning either <em>burden of proof </em>or <em>burden of producing evidence. </em>It was aptly said in Central Bridge Co. v. Butler, <a href="/mass/68/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="2 Gray 130" data-case-ids="1998265" data-case-paths="/mass/68/0130-01">2 Gray 130</a>: “The burden of proof and the weight of evidence are two very different things. The former remains on the party affirming a fact in support of his case, and does not change in any aspect of the cause; the latter shifts from side to side in the progress of a trial, according to the nature and strength of the proofs offered in support or denial of the main fact to be established.” See also Caldwell v. New Jersey Co., <a href="/ny/47/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="47 N.Y. 282" data-case-ids="509509" data-case-paths="/ny/47/0282-01">47 N. Y. 282</a>, 290.</p>

Co., <a href="/citations/?q=32%20Wis.%2050" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="32 Wis. 50">32 W. R. 50</a>, 53, Lord Justice Bowen said: “In order to make my opinion clear, I should like to say shortly how I understand the term ‘burden of proof.’ In every lawsuit somebody must go on with it; the plaintiff is the first to begin, and if he does nothing he fails. If he makes a prima facie case, and nothing is done by the other side to answer it, the defendant fails. The test, therefore, as to burden of proof is simply to consider which party would be successful if no evidence at all was given, or if no more evidence was given than is given at this particular point of the case; because it is obvious that during the controversy in the litigation there are points at which the onus of <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>proof shifts, and at which the tribunal must say, if the case stopped there, that it must be decided in a particular way. Such being the test, it is not a burden which rests forever on the person on whom it is first cast, but as soon as he, in his turn, finds evidence which, prima facie, rebuts the evidence against which he is contending, the burden shifts until again there is evidence which satisfies the demand. Now, that being so, the question as to onus of proof is only a rule for deciding on whom the obligation rests of going further, if he wishes to win.”</p>
    <p id="b341-3" data-blocks='[["BL_341.4",341,[141,867,1150,1169]]]'>Having shown that McGovern owned the money in dis-X&gt;ute a short time before his death, the presumption is that the ownership remained in him until the contrary was proved, and there also being a presumption that human beings do not give away property, this presumption cast upon her who claimed that McGovern gave his money to her the burden of proving it. We said in Watkins v. Prudential Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/315/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="315 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1156742" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0497-01">315 Pa. 497</a>, 504, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20644" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="173 A. 644">173 A. 644</a>: “Presumptions are not fact suppliers; they are guideposts indicating whence proof must come. . . . Sometimes the party who has the [initial] burden of persuading the jury does not have all through the case the burden of coming forward with affirmative evidence.” If in the instant case the issue had been framed, “McGovern, administrator, v. Henes,” the <em>real burden of the </em>case, which was that of producing the evidence vital to the pivotal issue, would still have been upon the latter. If she failed to meet this burden, the presumption that McGovern having once owned this money continued to own it until his death would have called for a verdict in favor of the administrator. The sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>

    <p id="b342-4" data-blocks='[["BL_342.5",342,[275,539,1151,1769]]]'>The third assignment of error is the refusal of the court below to grant plaintiff a new trial. This is overruled. Plaintiff was given opportunity to prove her contention that decedent McGovern gave her the sum of money in question. The jury apparently did not give credence to the testimony of her witnesses. The credibility of these witnesses was for the jury. In Trainer v. Port, <a href="/pa/310/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="310 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="1144264" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0570-01">310 Pa. 570</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=165%20A.%20232" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="165 A. 232">165 A. 232</a>, we cited with approval the following from Lindemann v.

American Surety Co., <a href="/pa/309/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="309 Pa. 236" data-case-ids="1141603" data-case-paths="/pa/309/0236-01">309 Pa. 236</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=163%20A.%20523" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="163 A. 523">163 A. 523</a>, this court quoted approvingly from the opinion of Mr. Justice Shakswood in Reel v.

As claimant of this gift Mrs. Henes had to present proof that was clear and satisfactory. The jurors were by law the weighers of her proof and they evidently found it wanting. The record yields us no warrant to disturb the verdict.</p>
