The trust company accepted his note for |25,000 with the understanding that the proceeds should be credited to his deposit account. The effect of this credit would be to raise the deposit balance in favor of the depositor to $110,000. It appears, however, that the proceeds of the note were not credited to the claimant’s account, although the note was delivered to the bank and <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>was found by the secretary of banking in its possession when the bank failed. In other words, the bank mingled the note with its general assets and gave no credit to the depositor for the proceeds. In our opinion this was a conversion by the bank of the proceeds of the note which gave rise to a trusteeship ex maleficio of the proceeds.</p>
    <p id="b346-4" data-blocks='[["BL_346.5",346,[256,650,1150,749]]]'>“It is true that this left the maker of the note liable in assumpsit upon the note and the claim upon the note by the bank must be set off against the claim of the depositor upon his account. It cannot, however, be set off against the fund held in trust for the depositor under the trusteeship ex maleficio which we have found to exist. The depositor is therefore entitled to a preference with regard to the proceeds of the note, that is, $25,000, if that amount can be traced to assets in possession of the bank a,nd properly identified. The auditing judge found that $20,941.47 had been sufficiently identified and traced to the possession of the bank, and we were, therefore, of the opinion that the depositor, or his assignee, the payee of the check was entitled to a preference in that amount.</p>

He was guided by and followed the rulings of the court in other cases having to do with similar claims and our prior decisions in which the applicable legal principles were involved. To cite and discuss these at length does not appear to be necessary.”</p>
