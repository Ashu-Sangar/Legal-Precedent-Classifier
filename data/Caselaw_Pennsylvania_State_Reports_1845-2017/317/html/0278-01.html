The contract provided for a board, to be known as the Traction Conference Board, to be “composed of four members, two members appointed by the mayor of the city by and with the consent of the majority vote of council, one of whom shall be designated as and shall be chairman of the <em>board; </em>one by the joint action of those municipalities other than the <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>City of Pittsburgh signing agreements identical with this one; and one shall be selected by the new company; [for which provision was made in the agreement] and in case of failure of those municipalities so signing to select their representative by March 1,1922, then the city shall select three members.

Article VI, section 4, contains the words “All officers,” “appointed officers” and “all officers elected by the people”; “public officer” is used in section 13, article III. These terms include officers of the State, a county or a municipality: Houseman v.

Discussion has been clarified by contrasting the words “office,” “position” and “employment” (Fredericks v. Board of Health, <a href="/njl/82/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="82 N.J.L. 200" data-case-ids="214493" data-case-paths="/njl/82/0200-01">82 N. J.

Our cases have distinguished such “officer” from “subordinate ministerial agents or employees,” such as “policemen, firemen, watchmen and superintendents of public property under the orders of the municipal department” : Richie v. Phila., supra; Glessner’s Case, <a href="/pa/289/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="289 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="1103325" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0086-01">289 Pa. 86</a>, 89, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.%20166" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="137 A. 166">137 A. 166</a>. In determining whether a position is an office or an employment, it is generally said that the “question must be determined by a consideration of the nature of the service to be performed by the incumbent, and of the duties imposed upon him, and whenever it appears that those duties are of a grave and important character, involving in the proper performance of them some of the functions of government, the officer charged with them is clearly to be regarded as a public one”: Richie v. Phila., supra, at 515. Other elements in the problem are whether the duties are designated by statute, whether the incumbent serves for a fixed period, acts under oath, gives a bond, and the source or character of the compensation received.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

      <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>Undoubtedly, Finley occupied a <em>position; </em>be was employed. But tbe position was not created by tbe Constitution, by statute, or by tbe authorized delegation to a subordinate by any public officer of part of bis governmental powers; it was created by tbe Philadelphia Company and tbe Pittsburgh Railways, as much as by tbe city. Tbe duties of the members of the board cannot be said to be performed under tbe legislative, tbe judicial or tbe executive department of government. By tbe tests referred to, and by tbe terms of tbe contract, Finley was not an officer within tbe meaning of tbe constitutional provision (or of article I, section 2, of tbe Charter Act, supra) on which appellant must rely as authority to set aside tbe agreement of tbe city that tbe members of tbe board shall be removed only with tbe consent of tbe majority of the council. Tbe constitutional provision (and tbe Charter Act) afford a quick method of removing an officer — i. e., one exercising governmental functions — in order that further misgovernment may cease: 7 Debates, Constitution of Pa. 559, 562; 8 Ibid. 122, 126. Finley’s position is not within the reason for tbe existence of either provision. Tbe constitutional provision and tbe Charter Act were in actual or constructive contemplation of tbe parties when tbe contract was executed; by requiring tbe consent of tbe council to remove any city member, tbe parties agreed by implication that tbe members of tbe board were not to have tbe status of officers within tbe constitutional sense. Now to contend that they did not mean what they said would require an imputation to the parties of a fraudulent intent which cannot be made. They were competent to define tbe status of members of the board.</p>

It would seem that the general purpose of the arrangement was to conserve the street railway properties, improve the service, attract new capital, provide a plan by which the city, inter alia, might receive some, or all, of its indebtedness, by affording representation for all the municipal parties in the supervisory management of the railway company’s affairs. It is unnecessary to recite the details of the contract; it included the formation of a “New Company,” and the supervision and control of its capital, budget, rates of fare and payment of debts. It provided that the salaries of the members of the board should be paid by the railway company and charged to operating expenses. Any m ember of the board could be dismissed at any time by the party appointing him, the city, in such case, acting as the parties had agreed. There was no defined period of employment.</p>
    <p id="b313-4" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[123,1203,1148,366]]]'>The city contends that Finley was entrusted with the receipt of public moneys, and must, therefore, be considered a public officer. The agreement, however, provides that the surplus, if any, shall be paid to the board each year for distribution to the city and other contracting municipalities. The funds at this stage were moneys due the public, but not yet public money.</p>

It may be said that it joined with other municipalities and with a company, apparently unable much longer to go on, in an arrangement relieving the immediate burden, in the hope that improvement in the railway system and car service could be worked out. In Helvering, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, v. Powers, <a href="/us/293/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="293 U.S. 214" data-case-ids="3927126" data-case-paths="/us/293/0214-01">293 U. S. 214</a>, (December 3, 1934), trustees, appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Council, operating the Boston Elevated Railway on behalf of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, claimed exemption from federal income taxes, on the ground that they were “officers of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and instrumen-talities of government.” Their claim was rejected. The <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>conduct of the street railway system was not the performance of a governmental function, and their operation of the system on behalf of the State did not make it governmental ; they were not entitled to the immunity claimed; that the statute providing for them declared that they should be public officers, except in two respects, was immaterial to their claim. Finley’s position was not created by statute and was not declared a public office.</p>

In no accepted view of the word officer, within the constitutional sense, can it be said that Finley was an officer removable by the mayor alone.</p>
