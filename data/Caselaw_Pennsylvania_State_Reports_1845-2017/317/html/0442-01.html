    <p id="b473-9" data-blocks='[["BL_473.11",473,[138,1111,1149,198]]]'>Plaintiff appeals from tbe action of tbe court below making absolute a rule to show cause wby tbe entry of a discontinuance of tbis case should not be stricken from tbe record.</p>
    <p id="ASU" data-blocks='[["BL_473.12",473,[134,1329,1154,912]]]'>Plaintiff’s bill seeks to enjoin tbe defendant’s using trade names similar to those in use by bim. A motion for a preliminary injunction was beard by tbe court; defendant being called as on cross-examination testified at considerable length and was required by subpoena to produce records and documentary evidence. At tbe conclusion of tbe bearing, plaintiff withdrew its motion for a preliminary injunction and tbe case was continued to proceed to final bearing, defendant giving notice in open court that be would oppose a discontinuance. Tbe following day, however, without leave of court and without notice to defendant, plaintiff caused a discontinuance to be entered as a matter of course by tbe protbonotary of tbe common pleas. On learning of tbis action, defendant obtained a rule from tbe court to strike off tbe discontinuance, which rule was subsequently made absolute in an opinion which states tbe reason for so doing.</p>

Phila. et al., <a href="/pa/306/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="306 Pa. 216" data-case-ids="1136930" data-case-paths="/pa/306/0216-01">306 Pa. 216</a>, 220-21; Cross’s Est., <a href="/pa/309/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="309 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="1141545" data-case-paths="/pa/309/0418-01">309 Pa. 418</a>, 421-2. An examination of the record in the present case shows no abuse of discretion.</p>
