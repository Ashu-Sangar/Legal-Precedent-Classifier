The notice from the Hilltop Association to the building society, of the former’s judgment lien, was dated July 20,1932.

The exceptions were dismissed by the court below upon the ground that the exceptant’s loss was not “definitely ascertained” and that it “had only a contingent claim against Manayunk Trust Company, and at the time when the secretary of banking took possession of that institution on October 13, 1931, there was no measure or standard by which the damages of exceptant could be liquidated . . . there had been no loss. That loss was not ascertained until the sale by the sheriff in November, 1932. Up until that time, it was entirely possible that there would be no loss at all.

In Trenton Potteries Co. v. Title Guarantee &amp; Trust Co., <a href="/ny/176/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="176 N.Y. 65" data-case-ids="2313523" data-case-paths="/ny/176/0065-01">176 N.

E. 132</a>, the Court of Appeals, by Werner, J., said: “The contract is one of insurance against defects in title, unmarketability, liens, and incumbrances. The risks of title insurance end where the risks of other kinds begin. Title insurance, instead of protecting the insured against matters that may arise during a stated period after the issuance of the policy, is designed to save him harmless <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>from any loss through defects, liens, or incumbrances that may affect or burden his title when he takes it. It must follow, as a general rule, therefore, that when the insured gets a good title the covenant of the insurer has been fulfilled, and there is no liability.” The converse of this is that when the insured gets a bad title, or the policy has been otherwise breached, the covenant of the insurer has not been fulfilled, and there is a <em>liability. </em>A liability having attached, the only thing that remains is to ascertain <em>its extent </em>in terms of dollars.</p>

If the insured had tried to sell his $8,000 mortgage, he would have found its marketability impaired by the fact that it was subject to two liens totalling $10,000 instead of to one lien of only $4,000. Even though it was backed by an insurance policy, a prospective purchaser would give substantially less for it with these two liens against it instead of the one lien specified. The would-be purchaser would naturally consider the possibility that, should foreclosure proceedings be instituted and the company be called upon to make good its contract of insurance, it might be in no financial condition to do so (as actually happened here). When it was disclosed that, contrary to the insurance contract, there was no encumbrance on this property except one of $4,000, there was a total encumbrance of $10,000, the insurer then and there became legally liable for its breach of contract to the insured. The <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>latter coaid <em>then </em>have sued the insurer for the loss sustained, and the measure of damage would have been the difference in the market value of the $8,000 mortgage which in fact was subject to both the disclosed lien of $4,000 <em>and </em>the undisclosed lien of $6,000, and <em>what </em>its market <em>value would have been had it been subject only to the former.</em>

It is <em>possible </em>that A will never have to make that payment, for B may cancel the debt, or some generous relative or friend may pay it for A. . . .

(No. 1), supra, "An indemnitor’s obligation is not immediate and absolute. It is born only on the happening of a contingency, that contingency being the default of the person whose favorable action the indemnitor guarantees. A surety’s obligation is a living thing subject to possible extinction; an indemnitor by his engagement has merely put himself in a position where he may in the future be shouldered with an obligation that can legally come into being only through another’s default.” Applying these principles here, the indemnitor’s obligation came into being when the appellant invested the sum of $8,000 <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>in the insured mortgage upon the assurance of the trust company that there were no liens prior to that mortgage except the one of $4,000 specified. That <em>was </em>the trust company’s default. The default was practically contemporaneous with the execution of the contract of indemnity, whereas in most cases arising on contracts of indemnity the default is <em>subsequent </em>to the contract. The error in appellee’s reasoning is his assumption that the contingency which gave rise to the indemnitor’s obligation was the <em>demonstration </em>of loss by the sale of this property by the foreclosure in 1932, and that until then there was no default by the indemnitor, whereas in fact the trust company’s obligation came into being on April 15,1930, when $8,000 was invested by appellant in a third lien in reliance upon the trust company’s insurance policy. The foreclosure proceedings two years later merely <em>concretely demonstrated </em>the extent of ex-ceptant’s loss and of the company’s reciprocal obliga1 tion. The loss sustained could have been measured by appropriate proceedings any time after the investment had been made. In a suit for damages for breach of the insurance policy the insured could have offered testimony showing (1) the value of the security if the record as to liens had been as the company had insured it to be, (2) its value with the record as it actually was, and (3) how much its own $8,000 mortgage had been reduced in value by reason of the diminution in the value of the pledged security. In Whiteman v. Merion Title &amp; Trust Co., <a href="/pa-super/25/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="25 Pa. Super. 320" data-case-ids="851889" data-case-paths="/pa-super/25/0320-01">25 Pa. Superior Ct. 320</a>, which was a suit upon a policy of title insurance where the company agreed to indemnify, keep harmless, and insure the insured from all loss or damage, not exceeding $1,500 which the said insured shall sustain by reason of defects or unmarketability of the title of the insured to the estate, mortgage or interest described in a schedule annexed, or because of any liens on it, or encumbrances, “charging the same at the date of the policy,” and there was a total loss to the insured by reason of <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>the sale of the property mortgaged under a prior mortgage in existence at the date of the policy, it was held that the insurance company was liable only for the actual value of the land, and not for the amount of the mortgage insured. The Superior Court there said: “What he [i. e., the insured] has lost, if the averments of the affidavit of defense are true, is the right to a lien upon land which is worth only $500, and that is the limit of his right to recover.” In other words, the measure of the company’s liability was the value of the pledge that had been wiped out. By parity of reasoning, if in the instant case it had been determined that the pledge “securing” the mortgage of $8,000 had been reduced in value to an amount less than $8,000, the measure of damages would have been the amount by which the undisclosed judgment of $6,000 <em>had, </em>in impairing the value of the security, <em>reduced the value of the mortgage. </em>That this damage was not measured until two years later does not prove its earlier <em>non-ewistence. </em>Measuring is not a creative act. If, for example, the appellant had purchased a lot of land underlaid with anthracite coal and the trust company had given the appellant an insurance policy that its deed included not only the surface but also the right to surface support (i. e., the “third estate”: see Penman v. Jones, <a href="/pa/256/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="256 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="1030725" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0416-01">256 Pa. 416</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.%201043" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="100 A. 1043">100 A. 1043</a>), and it did not in fact include such support, the insurer’s liability would have attached the moment the insured parted with his money in reliance on the policy. Under the theory contended for here, it would not be obligated to indemnify the insured <em>until the surface had subsided, thus visibly demonstrating </em>the damage. That is, of course, erroneous (Noonan v. Pardee, <a href="/pa/200/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="200 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="924320" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0474-01">200 Pa. 474</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.%20255" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="50 A. 255">50 A. 255</a>); it was equally erroneous to hold here that the insurer was not answerable to the insured for the impairment of the latter’s security until damage caused by that impairment had been visibly demonstrated by a sale. When in this class of cases such a sale does take place, courts accept the result as <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>furnishing the best data for measuring damage, but the sale , does not <em>give rise </em>to the loss nor is it ever the only-available method of determining its extent. In bankruptcy, it is not uncommon to list liabilities whose monetary measurement is a matter for the future. In Maynard v. Elliott, <a href="/us/283/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="283 U.S. 273" data-case-ids="434460" data-case-paths="/us/283/0273-01">283 U. S. 273</a>, it was held that “the liability of a bankrupt as endorser of a promissory note which was not matured at the time of the adjudication is provable, as a claim ‘founded . . . upon a contract express or implied.’ ” In that case, Mr. Justice Stone said: “That some contingent claims are deemed not provable does not militate against this conclusion. The contingency of the bankrupt’s obligation may be such as to render any claim upon it incapable of proof. It may be one beyond the control of the creditor, and dependent upon an event so fortuitous as to make it uncertain whether liability will ever attach. . . . Or, the contingency may be such as to make any valuation of the claim impossible, even though liability has attached.” In determining any person’s liabilities, debts other than those that are absolute and matured are properly included. For example, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act of May 21, 1921, P. L. 1045, provides, inter alia, in its first section that “ ‘debt’ includes any legal liability, whether matured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, absolute, fixed or contingent.”</p>

Title insurance is designed to protect tbe insured, and save him harmless from any loss arising through defects, liens, or encumbrances that may be in existence, affecting tbe title when tbe policy is issued. . . . Can there be any doubt that tbe reduction of bis [plaintiff’s] interest in tbe property from an ownership of the whole, to that of one-half, was a defect, coming directly within tbe terms of the policy? ... It requires no argument to show that tbe abso<a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>lute failure of title to one-half the interest was a serious defect, as compared in extént and quality with the title to the entire interest, which he had asserted and submitted to the defendant company, as the basis upon which the insurance was to be effected, and which was accepted and approved by it, as set forth in the policy. The estate or interest of the insured which was covered by the policy was that of owner in fee of the entire property. Any defect in title <em>which reduced his interest </em>[italics supplied] below that point was, it seems to us, just that much loss, or damage, for which he was entitled to be indemnified.” Applying the reasoning of that case to this, we hold that any defect insured against which reduced the insured’s interest below the point agreed to, to wit, a reduction by a lien of $6,000 was a loss or damage for which he was entitled to be indemnified. It is true the case cited says: “Actual loss, of course, must precede the right of compensation ; but that is measured by the standard accepted as between the parties.” This is a recognition of the fact that “actual loss” and the measurement of that loss are two distinct things. The “actual loss” was that the insured got only a half interest in a property though he had been <em>insured </em>a whole interest. The “actual loss” was then and there sustained though it was not measured until later. The words “actual loss” have been judicially defined. In My Laundry Co. v. Schmeling, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20N.W.%20540" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="109 N.W. 540">109 N.

Plaintiffs had purchased a mortgage of $21,000 on a number of houses embracing a building operation in Philadelphia. The buildings were at the time unfinished and defendant issued a policy in the sum of $21,000, insuring plaintiffs against, inter alia, “ ‘actual loss or damage not exceeding $21,000, which the said insured shall sustain by reason of noncompletion of premises.’ ” An appeal was then allowed to this court. In <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>that case the only question before the court was the proper construction of a certain subrogation clause in the policy. Nevertheless the report of the case indicates that testimony was taken as to whether or not there was an actual loss or depreciation in the value of the mortgage, because of the failure to complete the houses. This court said, in an opinion by Mr. Chief Justice Frazer: “Defendant contends sufficient equity remained in the properties released from the mortgage to cover the actual loss sustained and witnesses for plaintiffs valued the properties at twenty-two hundred dollars and four thousand dollars, the first mortgages thereon being respectively fourteen hundred dollars and two thousand five hundred dollars. The properties, however, were duly taken into consideration by the experts who testified to the amount of depreciation in value of the mortgage, so that defendant really obtained whatever benefit was to be derived from them,”</p>

In Banes v. New Jersey Title Guarantee &amp; Trust Co., <a href="/f/142/0957-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="142 F. 957" data-case-ids="3901910" data-case-paths="/f/142/0957-01">142 Fed. 957</a>, Circuit Judge Acheson said: “Defendant’s guaranty is against loss or damage which the plaintiff shall sustain by reason of defects of title or because of liens or incumbrances as specified therein. Therefore, by the very terms of the contract, it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to show some loss or damage. This is the general doctrine in actions on contracts of indemnity [citing cases]. In this case there was no proof whatever of any loss or damage to the plaintiff. No defect of title to the land covered by the mortgage appeared, nor was it shown that any lien or incumbrance charging the same existed.” We interpret this as meaning that if there had existed an unspecified lien or incumbrance charging the land, this would have amounted to a proof of loss, whose measurement would be a matter of evidence. This is the position we take in the case at bar. If the appellant .had <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>purchased an oil painting in reliance on an insurance policy that it was a genuine Corot and it proved to be only an imitation, the insured’s liability for the loss would have attached immediately. It would not have required a sale to call that liability into being or even to have measured the extent of the loss. For example, in sales of goods the-buyer may sue for breach of warranty without either selling or returning the goods. In an early case this court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Tilghman, drew a distinction between “utterly lost” and “technically lost” as applied to a ship. He said: “But she is not utterly lost merely because it may cost more than she is worth to repair her”: Ins. Co. v. Duval et al., 8 S. &amp; R. 138, 148. It would seem from this that when a ship or other object is damaged, a “loss” has been sustained.</p>
    <p id="A3T" data-blocks='[["BL_205.2",205,[108,1202,1149,746]]]'>When it became manifest that the lien which the Trust Company had insured against was actually in existence, thereby reducing the value of plaintiff’s third mortgage, a loss was established and the next step was to measure its extent. This was done when a sale of the property took place, though it could have been done before. In Hymes v. Esty et al., <a href="/citations/?q=133%20N.Y.%20343" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="133 N.Y. 343">133 N.

Thus, in suits brought by executors or administrators, where the creditor’s claim was due when decedent died, set-off has always been allowed even though his estate was insolvent: Murray v. Williamson, Administrator of Gray, 3 Binney <em>135; </em>Com. v. Clarkson, Administrator of Skiles, v.

The reason for this conclusion is tersely expressed in the second of these cases as follows (page 293) : ‘The sum really due at the death of the party is the true debt.

The Franklin Fire Ins. Co., <a href="/watts-serg/6/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 439" data-case-ids="480108" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0439-01">6 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 439</a>, which was an action on a covenant of guaranty of a bond, defendant pleaded a set off from a loss <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>under a policy of insurance on the mortgaged premises executed by the plaintiffs <em>guaranteeing the premises free from mechanics3 liens. </em>The court below sustained the demurrer to the plea of set-off. This court reversed the court below saying, in an opinion by Chief Justice Gibson: “If an unliquidated cross demand may be set-up when it has sprung from the same transaction — and we have constantly ruled that it may — why may it not be set up when it has sprung from a distinct and independent contract? The confusion incident to the trial of distinct issues in the same action is no greater where the demands, are independent of each other than where they are connected ; nor more embarrassing where they are indefinite than where they are liquidated; nor more complicated where they are set against each other than where they are joined in the same declaration or in consolidated actions. <em>The practical difference between a debt properly so called and an indefinite demand of money resting in contract, is more seeming than real. </em>[Italics supplied.] A bond for the payment of a sum certain is strictly a debt and a subject of set-off; yet to ascertain the amount due on it when reduced, as it sometimes is, by failure of consideration or a variety of causes, is often one of the most difficult duties that can be committed to a jury. When its definite character is so often deceptive, what better claim has it to be made matter of set-off than a policy of insurance?”</p>
