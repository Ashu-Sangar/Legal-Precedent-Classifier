    <p id="b521-9" data-blocks='[["BL_521.17",521,[107,1642,1150,741]]]'>On the audit of the account of the secretary of banking as receiver of The Royersford Trust Company, these four appellants each claimed a preferential payment out of the fund for distribution. There was no dispute as to the amounts of the claims, but only as to the right of the several parties to have such preferences. The court below refused to allow the preferences, whereupon each of the parties took one of these appeals. The basis of each decision below was that “Before priority in payment may be decreed, there must be [and in these cases there was not] a tracing of the trust res to, and a showing that it is contained in some particular property, security, fund or account” which forms part of the assets for distribution. This conclusion is correct.</p>

Carnegie Trust Co., <a href="/pa/292/0114-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="292 Pa. 114" data-case-ids="1109667" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0114-01">292 Pa. 114</a>, 121, it was still recognized as tbe law.</p>

This is recognized also in Pittsburgh’s App., <a href="/pa/316/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="316 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1158976" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0125-01">316 Pa. 125</a>, where we held that trust relationship alone does not give priority since it depends on identification of tbe property; and in Lifter v.

The trust company collected the note, but instead of remitting the proceeds sent its draft therefor to the Ottumwa Bank, which was not paid on presentation because the secretary of banking had closed the trust company and taken possession of its assets. The amount of the note was meanwhile deposited in a particular account, and there remained, separate from the trust company’s general assets, until the time of distribution of the estate of the trust company. We held that the Ot-tumwa Bank was entitled to a preference because the fund could be and was traced into the particular account, where it at all times was.</p>

As such, it held a mortgage of $6,000 on the property of Ralph Jones, on which a balance of $4,800 was due. On May 1, 1932, it transferred that mortgage to itself, allotting to the estate a $1,700 participating interest therein, and a $3,100 participating interest in a mortgage of one H. E. Anderson. The next day Jones paid to the <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>Royersford Trust Company tbe amount of bis mortgage by a check on bis bank account in tbe company itself. These two matters were evidently but parts of a single transaction. As the court below well said “Tbe whole transaction was irregular and improper, a bold and brazen violation by tbe trust company of its duty as a fiduciary.” It also accurately said, however: “We have repeatedly held . . . that the establishment of a trust relationship will not alone support a preference. Before priority in payment may be decreed, there must be a tracing of the trust res to, and a showing that it is contained in, some particular property, security, fund or account, separate and distinct from the general assets of the bank . . . [whereas here] this was but a bookkeeping transaction, and no currency was involved.”</p>

This it did in a mortgage of that amount given by J. Hilbert. Later he paid off the mortgage by a check on a Pottstown Bank, and the trust company invested the proceeds in a participating interest in the mortgage of H. E. Anderson, already referred to. No further tracing of the fund was attempted, and so far as appears, neither the Anderson mortgage nor its proceeds appears in the account. Hence there is nothing out of which this claimant can properly claim a preference.</p>
