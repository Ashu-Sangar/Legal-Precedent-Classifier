Mercer, deceased, was probated), appellant filed a petition under the Declaratory Judgments Act of June 18, 1923, P. L. 840, against the trustees of a fund of $100,000, provided for in testator’s will and known as the Chinese Expedition Fund, and against the Bucks County Historical Society, which was <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>also interested in tbe fund, praying for a declaratory decree determining tbe rights of petitioner as respects tbe fund. Answers were filed by respondents, testimony taken, followed, after argument, by a carefully tbougbt out <em>opinion; </em>from tbe decree based tbereon this appeal was taken. In tbe main we are in accord with tbe opinion and decree, but we cannot agree that petitioner occupies so subordinate a position in regard to tbe fund as is stated in that decree.</p>
    <p id="b269-3" data-blocks='[["BL_269.4",269,[133,842,1149,1456]]]'>In speaking of testator, tbe court below well said: “He was intensely interested in tbe arts and crafts of tbe early races of mankind. He studied and preserved for future generations the tools and implements of labor and manufacture of primitive peoples. Research, recovery and preservation became with him not a fad, but a life work. To preserve for tbe enlightenment and benefit of mankind became tbe moving passion of bis life.” We agree also with tbe trial judge’s statement, that testator “engaged [appellant] because of bis fitness for tbe work and bis willingness to bear tbe hardships of tbe work in tbe field. He [testator] desired [appellant’s] cooperation in tbe arrangement and compilation of tbe fruits of bis research.” Only in tbe light of these facts, and of an agreement between testator and appellant, now to be stated, can we reach a true understanding of tbe meaning of tbe language of testator’s will in relation to tbe Chinese Expedition Fund. This is in accord with tbe unbending rule in relation to tbe interpretation of all agreements. “An agreement is tbe assent of two minds to tbe same thing. It should be construed in tbe light of tbe facts and circumstances under which tbe parties contracted. These form a sort of context that may be properly resorted to as an aid in interpreting tbe contract, to tbe end that tbe objects and purposes of the parties may be carried into effect”: Nimlet’s Est., <a href="/pa/299/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="299 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1122313" data-case-paths="/pa/299/0359-01">299 Pa. 359</a>; Hild v.

This is, indeed, a fact which the writings clearly state over and over again. The contract stipulates that the “expedition [is] . . . to be conducted under [testator’s] direction by [petitioner]” and stipulates in detail of what the work is to consist. It further provides that before “petitioner’s return to the United States from Germany [where petitioner was when the contract was drawn] a preliminary payment of $225 per month to be paid to [petitioner] for general maintenance of [peti<a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>tioner] and Ms family in the meantime.

Hence, this definition must be accepted and applied wherever necessary in construing either instrument. This being so, it completely overthrows the contention of the trustees, as set forth in their answer to the petition, viz.: “In short, trustee respondents aver that, if, in trustees’ judgment, [petitioner] fails to do the work of the expedition . . . in a manner satisfactory to the trustees, petitioner, in the proper discretion of the trustees, is subject to discharge and dismissal, and the respondents are charged with the duty of selecting his successor to carry out the <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>purpose of the trust.” And it is also a complete answer to so much of the seventh paragraph of the decree of the court below, already referred to, as says that petitioner is subject to discharge by the trustees “for cause or at will.”</p>
