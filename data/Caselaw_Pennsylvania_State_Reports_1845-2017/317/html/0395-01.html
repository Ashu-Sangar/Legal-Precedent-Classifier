In 1911, the federal government, to improve navigation, constructed Dam No. 8 in the Ohio River, at a point in the State of West Virginia 5 miles below the Little Beaver. The dam raised the water in the Ohio and its contributing streams.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> With the exception of a strip about 540 feet wide owned by plaintiffs,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> intersecting the defendant’s land at a point about 600 feet from the Ohio River shore, defendant owns all the land on the east shore of the Little Beaver, from the north shore of the Ohio River to the Ohio state line.

Since 1932, its coal has been floated from its mines in this Commonwealth, down the Monongahela and the Ohio Rivers, and into the Little Beaver to this coal dock in barges which, defendant says in its brief, are 175 feet by 26 feet and capable of carrying 900 tons, although, in the present condition of the stream, defendant may only half load its barges. A stream carrying such traffic is navigable. “Those rivers must be regarded as public navigable rivers in law which are navigable in fact.

The same divestiture must also result from the permanent additional flooding of land formerly submerged (and now navigable), even though the owners’ title to the submerged land theretofore was absolute. The determination of plaintiffs’ right to interfere by the desired injunction, therefore, does not turn on the navigability of the stream before the improvement, though that point was elaborately dealt with at the <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>trial and in the adjudication. The government raised the water level and created increased existing slack water in the Little Beaver to Mile 0.4; that is, the established pool full at low-water mark in the Ohio now extends that far up the smaller stream. For that distance, it is navigable. There is no evidence that would support a finding that the river is not navigable for that distance and the record is not concerned with navigability from that point toward the source of the stream. The improvement transformed the Ohio and its tributaries into “artificial canals instead of natural waterways”: U. S. v. Cress, <a href="/us/243/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="243 U.S. 316" data-case-ids="3692579" data-case-paths="/us/243/0316-01">supra,</a> page 326. Whether the change produced in the stream constituted a taking of plaintiffs’ property requiring payment of compensation pursuant to the 5th Amendment is not a question for us on this record. On the completion of the improvement, the public became entitled to use it for the purpose intended. Such users are not trespassers. Navigation is the exercise of a right of way over water. If it becomes desirable to remove obstructions on what, it appears, is the natural river bottom, the plaintiffs cannot complain, if one entitled to use the right of way and adversely affected by the obstruction removes it pursuant to the regulations of the war department, to which Congress has entrusted the subject.

Here, of course, even the scope of defendant’s possible activity is controlled by the federal legislation referred to and the conditions stated in the permit. When defendant, pursuant to federal permit, improves navigation by dredging the channel, it exercises a federal power; that power is not exhausted by the original improvement resulting from the construction of the dam which created the back <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>water, but continues for the improvement of navigation as and when required.
