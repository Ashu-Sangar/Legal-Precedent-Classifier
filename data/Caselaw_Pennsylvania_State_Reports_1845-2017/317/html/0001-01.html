The cases were heard on hill and answer. No facts are disputed. In each hill the power to tax was challenged for various reasons, some common to all plaintiffs and others peculiar to the business of the complaining party. The learned court below was of opinion that the legislature expressly withheld from the city the power to tax the property in question. As we all agree that the particular property sought to be taxed is already taxed by the State, and, therefore, within the statutory exception denying to the city the power to tax it, we shall confine our discussion to that objection, made by all the plaintiffs.</p>

L. 45, empowering cities of the first and second classes to collect “certain additional taxes for general revenue purposes.” It provides: “ . . . the council of any city of the first or second class shall have the authority . . . for general revenue purposes, to levy, assess and collect . . . such taxes on persons, transactions, occupations, privileges, subjects and personal property, within the limits of such city ... as it shall detex-mine, except that such council shall not have authority to levy, assess and collect . . . any tax on a privilege, transaction, subject or occupation, or on personal property, which is now or may hereafter become subject to a State tax or license fee.”</p>

The phraseology of the ordinance makes it impossible to accept the city’s contention that the purpose was to tax a privilege; both the title and the enacting parts of the ordinance deny it. The title (a part of the ordinance: Duquesne Light Co. v. Pgh., <a href="/pa/251/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="251 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1019903" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0557-01">251 Pa. 557</a>, 563, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.%2085" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="97 A. 85">97 A. 85</a>) clearly declares municipal intention to enact an ordinance “levying and assessing a tax on meters or other measuring devices used to record the quantity of service. ...” Section 1 imposed the tax “in respect to the ownership or use by said companies or individuals of meters or other devices used. . . .” As the tax on the meters in respect to their ownership or use, is, in effect, a tax on the meters, there is no support for the argument that (in the words of appellant’s brief) “the tax is limited to the ‘use’ of said meters by said companies ; and there is therefore no tax either against the meters or against their owners ‘in respect to the ownership’ thereof.” It is not an occupation tax (compare Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries, etc., Co., <a href="/us/255/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="255 U.S. 288" data-case-ids="341490" data-case-paths="/us/255/0288-01">255 U.

Pursuant to the Act of March 7, 1901, P. L. 20, authorizing tbe City of Pittsburgh to impose a license tax, tbe city passed an ordinance imposing on street railway corporations doing business in tbe city a tax per lineal foot of track. Tbe city contended that tbe tax was levied for tbe privilege or franchise of doing business in tbe city. It was held that tbe ordinance imposed a tax on property, not authorized by tbe statute: Pittsburgh Rys. Co. v. Pgh., <a href="/pa/211/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="211 Pa. 479" data-case-ids="940050" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0479-01">211 Pa. 479</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20A.%201077" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="60 A. 1077">60 A. 1077</a>.

L. 1037, entitled “An act imposing a state tax on liquid fuels. . . .” The Commonwealth contended that tbe tax was not a tax on property, but one “assessed upon tbe vendor for tbe privilege of carrying on bis business,” or one “imposed on tbe privilege of transferring property.” It was held that it was a tax on property. Tbe ordinance now before us provides for a tax on meters “in respect to [their] ownership or use”; use is implied in ownership. “To levy a tax by reason of ownership of property is to tax tbe property”: Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., <a href="/us/255/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="255 U.S. 288" data-case-ids="341490" data-case-paths="/us/255/0288-01">255 U. S. 288</a>, 294.</p>
