The bill also prayed for the reconveyance of property acquired by defendants by virtue of sheriff\u2019s sales therein referred to. After hearing the parties and their witnesses, the chancellor held that plaintiff was not entitled to a recon-veyance of the property in question, that the cessation of payments of royalty by plaintiff constituted a breach of the agreement between the parties, and that defendants had made a correct accounting in their answer. He accordingly dismissed the bill. Exceptions to the findings of fact and conclusions of law were later overruled by the court in banc and the decree affirmed. Upon a thorough examination of the voluminous record, we are clearly of opinion the conclusion reached by the learned chancellor, and concurred in by the court in banc, is free from error and fully warranted by the evidence.\nThe decree of the lower court is affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs.",
