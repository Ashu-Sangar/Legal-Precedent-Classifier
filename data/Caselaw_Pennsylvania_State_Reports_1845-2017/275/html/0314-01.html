It is alleged also that in accordance therewith sheriff’s sales were had, the titles vested in defendants, and plaintiff did all he agreed to do. It is also said that, by a supplemental agreement, entered into after the sheriff’s sale (no additional consideration being stated), the time limit, within which-the contract was to continue in force for plaintiff’s benefit, was fixed at two years from September 30, 1915.</p>
    <p id="b338-4" data-blocks='[["BL_338.5",338,[285,1162,1152,748]]]'>The statement further avers that, in accordance with these agreements, defendants received $15,000 from the sale of coal mined from the properties; $2,200 from gas leases thereof; $9,000 from paving blocks sold; and $3,000 from bills receivable of the brick company. This apparently exhausted everything alleged to be covered by the agreements, except two tracts of land, one of which, containing 114 acres, is averred to have been sold to the Knoxdale Coal &amp; Coke Company for $4,000, from which it has since mined coal of the value of $18,375, leaving still thereunder coal of the value of $250,000; the balance of the land being later sold for $34,783.05.

It is only when a trustee refuses to perform or recognize a trust, that courts are asked to declare its existence as against him, and if a trust, which had no legal existence under the statute, can be brought into being as within the exception, simply because a trustee breaks his promise to perform, no case will be without the exception. ‘The statute of frauds would be worse than waste paper, if a breach of the promise created a trust in the promisor, which the contract itself was insufficient to raise’: Kellum et al. v.
