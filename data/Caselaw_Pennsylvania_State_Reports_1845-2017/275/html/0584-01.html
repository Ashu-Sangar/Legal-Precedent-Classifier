The court below held liability could not be imposed until the presumption of innocence was overcome by evidence so preponderating as to fairly lead to the conclusion the act complained of was committed by defendant or under his positive orders, relying on Catasauqua Mfg. Co. v. Hopkins, <a href="/pa/141/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="141 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="974934" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0030-01">141 Pa. 30</a>, 46. That case was an action for conspiracy to cheat and defraud plaintiff in the quantity of iron delivered to its mill. The court held if the evidence led fairly and satisfactorily to the belief defendants had obtained money from the company by means of false weights, then plaintiff’s ease was made out. We said there was a presumption of innocence in favor of persons charged with conspiracy to defraud, but we did not set up a burden of proof in civil cases for persons charged with conspiracy to defraud different from that applied to individuals charged with defrauding or attempting to defraud. It was distinctly stated (p. 46), in prosecution for a crime, “a still higher measure of proof is required, and the guilt of the defendant must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.” We did not hold, as appellee argues, where an action is predicated on facts constituting a crime, liability could follow only when the proof was sufficient to convict of a crime.</p>

The Act of 1881 merely substitutes, for the proof necessary to show lack of capacity, the hard and fast rule of sixteen years of age. Children under that age have been legislatively declared utterly unfit to handle firearms. The negligent act is solely referable to the unlawful sale to a minor under sixteen. Where the sale is made in the ordinary course of business, it is immaterial whether the clerk or the owner sells the weapon.

Any ordinary discharge of a firearm is a natural and probable result of its use, and as affecting the minor purchaser’s right of recovery or that of any one injured by him through an unlawful sale and use of a firearm, the minor’s negligence in handling the gun is not material.

Only one explanation of the gun’s discharge appears in the testimony: “Q. What happened when you got down to that gate? A. We were down at the gate and down a little ways. I shot Lee McMillen. I had the gun over my arm and it just went off some way and shot him.” Unless defendant’s evidence brought the boy’s carelessness to the gate, and showed the' playing there caused the gun’s discharge, the court was bound to submit the case to the jury on the evidence above quoted, <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>under proper instructions. The standard of responsibility for a child is his capacity to understand and avoid danger. They are required to exercise that degree of care and caution which persons of like age, capacity and experience might use under similar conditions, and if it had appeared the boys were knocking the gun about, the trial court would have been justified in branding it as the grossest kind of negligence.</p>

The boy wore short trousers and a blouse waist. Personal appearance should be received as some indication of a child’s age; it may be slight evidence, but its weight is for the jury. It might be, under given circumstances, extremely difficult to tell age by observation, but this relates more generally to older persons. Where age is one of the necessary ingredients of a crime, appearance, standing alone, would hardly be considered sufficient to establish the fact. Here we have the testimony as'to age, the boy’s general appearance and the manner of dress; under these circumstances, the evidence should have been admitted.</p>
