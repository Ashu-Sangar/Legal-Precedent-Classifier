Subsequently, by leave of court1, plaintiff amended his statement of claim, which was filed in its revised form on August 29,1921, and served the same day, on defendants, with notice to file an affidavit of defense, as required by the Practice Act. Although defendants’ counsel accepted service of the amended statement, as of September 22, 1921, the affidavit of defense to it, and the accompanying counterclaim, were not filed until October 14, 1921, and were never properly served on plaintiff.

The court allowed the service and suggested to defendants that they might move for a continuance if they felt they could not proceed with the trial; but they preferred to try the case at once.</p>
