It owned the <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>furniture contained therein, and kept1 a small local bank account for current expenses. Contracts secured were handled through the employees, and, when approved, were delivered by this agency to the purchasers of coal, in which commodity it dealt. The summons in assumpsit in the present case was duly issued, and the return of the sheriff showed service upon the defendant “by handing personally, January 14, 1918, a true and attested copy of the within writ, at Juniper and Chestnut streets, in the County of Philadelphia, State of Pennsylvania, the place of business of said defendant company, to M. T. Dean, the person for the time-being in charge thereof.” Upon motion, supported by depositions, the trial court set aside the service, finding that the corporate property of defendant was not situated in whole or in part' in the county where the process issued, and that it transacted no substantial part of its business therein. Prom the order making absolute the rule to set aside the service, which was a final decree (Park Bros. &amp; Co. v. Oil City Boiler Works, <a href="/pa/204/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="204 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="927533" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0453-01">204 Pa. 453</a>), in that the door was thus closed to further proceeding by the plaintiff, an appeal was taken. A reversal was had (Miller Paper Co. v.

L. 483), by affidavit' of defense; and such pleading was subsequently filed denying the right to maintain the suit in Philadelphia County, and also answering the contention of the plaintiff on the merits. At the same time, upon petition, an order was made directing a preliminary trial on the question of jurisdiction, — a proper practice: Daley v. Iselin, <a href="/pa/212/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="212 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="941854" data-case-paths="/pa/212/0279-01">212 Pa. 279</a>.

If the judgment is not a final one, then the position of the appellee must he sustained, for, no review can be had until the termination of the particular litigation, unless by force of some statutory provision. “Interlocutory judgments are such as are given in the middle of a cause, upon some plea, or proceeding, or default, which in only intermediate, and does not finally determine or complete the suit1,......and most usually [refer to] those incomplete judgments whereby the right of the party is, indeed, established, but the quantum of damages sustained by him is not ascertained”: 3 Blackstone 396; Holden’s Adm. v. M’Makin, 1 Pars. 270, 288. “A final judgment is such as at once puts an end to the action, by determining that the plaintiff is, or is not, entitled to recover, and [if the former] the amount in debt or damages to be recovered”: Mahoning County Bank’s App., <a href="/pa/32/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="32 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="986675" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0158-01">32 Pa. 158</a>, 160.</p>

Temporary hardships may be worked by such requirement, as a correct determination of some intermediate question raised might relieve from further action, necessary for the protection of the litigant’s rights. This has been recognized in certain cases, as by permitting an appeal where an order to account is contested, — review being now allowed before the actual stating of it (Act March 30, 1921, P. L. 60, amending Act June 24, 1895, P. L. 243, — for the previous rule, see Miller v. Belmont P. &amp; R.

L. 64); and where the court has permitted a judgment t'o be opened. Act May 20,1891, P. L. 101. But these, and like cases, are statutory exceptions, and do not modify the general principle, denying appeals from interlocutory orders.</p>

L. 286, which, permits appeals when such action appears. This legislation refers only to decrees based “upon the whole record,” which necessarily cannot be entered until the proceeding has terminated, and is to be taken, “as in other cases,” after a final judgment. Such a situation is not found in the casé at bar. Nor is appellant aided by the Act of May 20,1891, P. L. 101, allowing review from a refusal to strike off a judgment “whether entered by confession, upon warrant of attorney, or otherwise.” No such order here appears, but merely a direction to proceed with the trial on the merits, as would be required where a statutory demurrer to a statement of claim is overruled: Shifferstine v.

J. 44); but if he excepts to the preliminary decree and files his affidavit of defense only as compelled and directed by the court, the contrary is true. This is what was said in effect by our court in Coleman’s App., <a href="/pa/75/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="75 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="1036659" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0441-01">75 Pa. 441</a>, 460: “The other questions in the cause may be very briefly disposed of. Walton Dwight having been served with process according to the order of the court, moved the court to vacate and strike off the order of service, and to set aside the service made upon him in pursuance thereof. This motion was refused by the court in Lycoming County. He then appeared de bene esse, reserving all exceptions to the order and service. When compelled by rule to answer, he did so, under the same special exception. It is clear that he could not appeal from the interlocutory order of the court, refusing his first1 motion, and it is equally clear that any and every step which he might afterwards take for his own benefit or security in the course of the proceedings cannot estop or preclude him from setting up the want of jurisdiction at any stage. It was an objection which lay at the foundation of the whole case, and if it had gone on to a final decree either in Lycoming or Tioga County, the same question would have been open upon an appeal to this court.” This power to preserve the right to review by refusing to take any additional step except under order of court is recognized in Lycoming Fire Ins. Co. v. Storrs, <a href="/pa/97/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="97 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="444792" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0354-01">97 Pa. 354</a>, — a case cited as authority in McCullough v.

The first was dismissed as premature, but the complaint made was considered on the hearing of the second, though unavailing, since certain voluntary steps had been taken by the defendant after the refusal to dismiss. Of course, the objection must be consistently pressed, or an acceptance of jurisdiction will follow: Stamey v.
