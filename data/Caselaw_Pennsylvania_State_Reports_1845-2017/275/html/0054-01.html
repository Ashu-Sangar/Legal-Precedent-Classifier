It was claimed that the operations were conducted occasionally, but without financial success, and by reason thereof a forfeiture was worked, of which notice was duly given, and possession of the land, encumbered with pipe lines and tanks, was demanded. The refusal of the lessee to remove led to this action of ejectment, and the issue framed raised the question as to whether the production was profitable; and, even if not, whether the plaintiff could reenter in view of the fact that the only party interested in the rentals was the defendant, who had acquired the ownership of the same. A trial resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff, and the subsequent entry of judgment, upon which this appeal is based. Thirteen errors have been assigned, which complain of the admission of testimony, the charge of the court, the answers to points and the refusal of defendant’s motion for judgment non obstante veredicto; but an examination shows none which brings properly before us a matter for review.</p>

Though a general exception was taken thereto, no request was made to have the charge filed as part of the record, and, under the many decisions of this court a consideration of the errors complained of cannot be had: Allegro v. Rural Valley Mut. Fire Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/268/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="268 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="1061538" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0333-01">268 Pa. 333</a>; Sikorski v. P. &amp; R. Ry.

Even if this duty had been complied with, the alleged mistakes were not pointed out before the jury retired, and no opportunity was given the court below to correct any statement which might have been improperly made. Under such circumstances, only basic or fundamental errors can be now considered, — and none appear. To state, as here, that the complaints will be subse<a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>quently averred, is not sufficient, as it makes impossible a correction before a decision by the jury.</p>

L. 286, which provides that it shall be presented “within the time prescribed for moving for a new trial.” The record shows this was not done in the present case, which was tried in January of 1921, the motion for a new trial filed on January 29th, and that for judgment n. o. v. not until December 3d following, — two days before the opinion finally disposing of the case was recorded, though dated November 29th. By paper presented since argument, it would seem this motion was a substitute for an earlier one, but whether the former was in compliance with the requirements of the act is not disclosed.
