Defendant, having secured rooms in New Castle, Pa., equipped them with furniture and a stock of goods suitable for conducting such business. He then solicited Coens, the plaintiff, to manage it under an agreement that, after the receipts from the business should repay the cost of the original investment, maintenance, and the board and room of plaintiff and defendant, plaintiff, who was to receive no compensation for his services meanwhile other than board and room, was to be given a half interest in the business. Coens conducted the place under this arrangement for a period of twenty months, when defendant requested him to take charge of another business for a brief time. Thereafter defendant was repeatedly requested to make settlement. This he failed to do; no adjustment of plaintiff’s claim was ever reached, and he was refused the interest that had been agreed upon. Later, defendant sold this business to plaintiff for the <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>sum of $1,800, and the bill of sale described the property as being owned in its entirety by defendant. When the sale was negotiated, plaintiff demanded a settlement of his claim, and from this record it appears that at no time thereafter did he waive it in his dealings with defendant. He now sues on the breach of agreement, and claims compensation in quantum meruit for the services performed. The court below, after hearing plaintiff’s case, directed a nonsuit for the reason that the cause of action concerned the relations of partners: Crow v. Green et al., <a href="/pa/111/0637-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="111 Pa. 637" data-case-ids="545341" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0637-01">111 Pa. 637</a>, 642.</p>

Persons who have entered into a contract to become partners at some future time, or upon the happening of some future contingency, do not become partners until the agreed time has arrived, or the contingency has happened: Martin v.

If the venture was unsuccessful, then the profits would never pay the original investment, and, if successful and the interest be not given, the partnership does not exist. Plaintiff was not ipso facto to be: come a partner, — it required an affirmative act; defendant was to give him a half interest in the business. It is for the breach of this covenant the action is predicated. Defendant repudiated the agreement by refusing, after the accumulated profits had reimbursed him for his investment, to give plaintiff the interest therein stipulated.</p>

At no times does it appear he inferentially surrendered his right, but, on the contrary, gave notice to the effect that he would demand it, and he has here diligently set out to get it. A sale and payment of notes under such circumstances precludes the idea of any estoppel; had defendant' wished to close the matter finally he could have demanded an acquittance before closing the sale. The court below was in error in holding the facts evidenced a partnership relation.</p>
