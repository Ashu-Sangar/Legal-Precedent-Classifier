Her estate was subject to the transfer inheritance tax at the two per cent rate under section 2 of the Act of June 20, 1919, P. L. 521. Her real and personal estate was appraised at $1,125,948.58. A deduction of $29,711,47 was allowed for debts and administration expenses. The tax demanded by the Commonwealth amounted to $21,924.74. Appellees agreed to a direct1 tax of $20,800.49, but disputed the balance, $1,124.25. This latter figure represents the amount that would be chargeable at 2% against $56,212.41 paid to the federal government as an estate tax. The auditing judge deducted this sum from the gross estate and disallowed the Commonwealth’s claim as presented. The exceptions filed to the decree were dismissed by the court in banc.</p>

Therefore it makes little difference what technical arguments may be presented, based on the <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>various sections, or the supposed combined effect of the definitions embodied in the act; for, when the title and first section are read, the legislative intent clearly appears.</p>
    <p id="b297-5" data-blocks='[["BL_297.4",297,[142,546,1151,1127]]]'>The act reads (section 2): “All taxes imposed by this act shall be at the rate of two per centum upon the clear value of the property subject to such tax passing to or for the use of [lineals],......and at the rate of five per centum upon the clear value of the property...... passing to or for the use of [collaterals]......In ascertaining the clear value of such estates, the only deductions to be allowed from the gross values of such estates shall be the debts of the decedent and the expenses of the administration of such estates, and no deduction whatsoever shall be allowed for or on account of any taxes paid on such estate to the government of the United States or to any other state or territory”: Act of June 20, 1919, P. L. 521. This is plain and unambiguous language, holding that the federal tax should not be deducted in determining the amount of the inheritance tax, and, since there is no constitutional provision forbidding this, we must enforce it as written. This record does not call upon us to decide who, as between the distributees, must bear this additional burden on his or her inheritance.</p>
    <p id="b297-10" data-blocks='[["BL_297.5",297,[142,1693,1152,579]]]'>While value is made the measure on which the amount to be paid is fixed, decisions of other jurisdictions on this question are only helpful in aiding us to interpret our statute when those of other states are similar. A uniform standard of valuation does not exist in all states. Some fix the value of the property received by the legatee or distributee as the base, while others permit certain deductions. In places where the only deductions permitted are debts and administration costs, the courts are in agreement the federal estate tax should not be deducted.</p>
    <p id="b297-11" data-blocks='[["BL_297.6",297,[146,2293,1147,101]],["BL_298.1",298,[293,334,1149,1025]]]'>It is urged, however, there can be no clear value for a money legacy upon which section 2 may operate, as <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>there is no federal tax, administration expenses or debts deducted from a cash legacy, assuming the testator left the question of payment of tax to- the ordinary course of the law. Distributees have only such claims on an estate as the law gives them, and the testator has only such right to give as the law confers; both are subject to the law of the land. The state has the right to declare that, on the death of any of its citizens, an excise of 2 per cent of the estate, valued as of the time of death, belongs to her as a price for succession of the remainder, regardless of the effect on legatees. If it is claimed the same enactement does not provide how this charge may be worked out among the several legatees, distributees, including residuary claimants, the act, in its main feature, is not to be declared unworkable for this reason. But, when the question is properly before us, due consideration will be given these features, when clear value of a money legacy may be important.</p>
    <p id="b298-5" data-blocks='[["BL_298.4",298,[294,1363,1149,485]]]'>inasmuch as the only right to inherit grows out of statutory provisions, and there is no limitation upon the legislative power except uniformity, required by article IX of the Constitution, it is clear the legislature may use any uniform tax it chooses. It therefore had the right to refuse to allow the federal income tax to be deducted from the gross value of the estate in determining the total inheritance excise charge, and this is of course uniformity, for it classed all estates exactly alike.</p>

It cannot be legislated out of existence or interfered with simply because the United States sees fit to levy a graduated tax on the same subject of taxation, — a state-created right. The <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>State has an undoubted right to refuse to acknowledge this claim as a proper deduction when settling and dividing the inheritance with its citizens. Our law does not offend our Constitution, and the subsequent exercise by the federal government of its right to impose by legislation a similar tax, does not cause it to so offend. The subject of the tax is not a matter of concurrent legislation, and may be taken away by the State, leaving the United States without this subject to tax. The federal tax is executed through its own taxing power, and the Pennsylvania transfer inheritance'tax is a condition imposed on the state-granted privilege,— the transfer of property: Knowlton v.
