Before leaving the point under discussion, attention may be directed to Clearfield Co. v. Cameron Twp. Poor Dist., <a href="/pa/135/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="135 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="817426" data-case-paths="/pa/135/0086-01">135 Pa. 86</a>, 89, 95, and Smith W. M. Co. v. Browne, <a href="/pa/206/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="206 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="931710" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0543-01">206 Pa. 543</a>, 548, where we held that a new act of assembly may refer to established law, as applicable, without full recital; and this, — considering the binding force of the prior federal interpretation of the 18th Amendment, — is really the course pursued by the act before us, so far as this case is concerned.</p>
    <p id="b511-3" data-blocks='[["BL_511.4",511,[161,1248,1150,585]]]'>The foregoing considerations bring us to the conclusions already indicated, for the ultimate reasons we are about t'o state: (1) Since the portion of the Woner Act now under attack might have been omitted without changing the law of Pennsylvania there announced, it cannot be accounted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, such as to annul that statute; and (2) since the part of our Constitution previously quoted, governing methods of legislative expression, manifestly was never intended to apply to a situation like the present, it cannot be invoked to avoid the act.</p>
    <p id="b511-4" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[165,1845,1152,538]],["BL_512.1",512,[254,325,1147,151]]]'>In addition to the matters already discussed, appellant contends that the legislation before us offends article III, section 7, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, as section 21 of the statute provides a rule of evidence, for cases falling within the act, which differs from the ordinary rule. Since, by a joint stipulation filed of record, both sides agree that the testimony shall not be brought up on appeal, and that the facts set forth in the charge of the court shall “stand as the proved facts in the case,” it does not appear defendant has been prejudiced by the <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>statutory rule of evidence attacked as unconstitutional; hence he is not in a position to complain, and this is all that need be said on the point.</p>
    <p id="b512-4" data-blocks='[["BL_512.5",512,[246,487,1152,1453]]]'>The fact, called to our attention by appellant, that more severe punishment is visited on offenders against the present statute than is provided for in the federal law, is of no moment; while the states, when legislating for the enforcement of the 18th Amendment, have no power to depart from the construction of its meaning adopted by Congress and affirmed by the Supreme Court of the nation, yet we see no reason why each commonwealth cannot provide such penalties as it may deem proper for breaches of its own acts of assembly (Com. v. Nickerson, <a href="/mass/236/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="236 Mass. 281" data-case-ids="75216" data-case-paths="/mass/236/0281-01">236 Mass. 281</a>, 295-300, <a href="/citations/?q=128%20N.E.%20273" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="128 N.E. 273">128 N. E. 273</a>, 279, 280; U. S. v. Lanza, 43 Sup. Ct. Rep. No. 5, p. 141); and, in this connection, we may say it makes no difference whether the legislation before us was passed pursuant to the grant of concurrent power, vested by the prohibition amendment in the State, or by virtue of the state’s inherent police power, as the latter may be affected by the amendment. In either event, Pennsylvania has authority to enact laws to enforce the amendment, and the fixing of punishment for violations thereof is a necessary incident of that power. If, by comparison with the federal law, the ordained penalties were so manifestly inadequate as to be open to the charge that they really could not have been intended as deterrents, perhaps an argument would lie against their validity; but not where, as here, the state’s punishments are even harsher than those fixed by Congress.</p>
    <p id="b512-5" data-blocks='[["BL_512.6",512,[245,1951,1147,252]]]'>We have examined Com. v. Dougherty, <a href="/pa-super/39/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="39 Pa.
