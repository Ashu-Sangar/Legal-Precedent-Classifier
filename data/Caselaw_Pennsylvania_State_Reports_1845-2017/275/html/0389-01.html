William Armstrong, the common source of title, was the owner of a large tract of land lying along the Monongahela River in Cumberland Township, Greene County, and, in 1847, conveyed seventy-six acres thereof to John L. Dawson; the deed therefor contains the following clause: “together with the privilege of mining under the adjoining land of the said party of the first part [now occupied by Alfred Armstrong] and taking therefrom the vein of or bed of stone coal therein situate within <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>the following described boundaries.” This is followed by a description of a thirty-acre piece of land, and the habendum of the deed states, inter alia, “together with the privilege of mining and taking the stone coal within the boundaries described.” There was then and still is in the thirty-acre tract a vein of coal five feet in thickness located near the surface and called the Waynesburg or Hill vein, while several hundred feet below this there was and is another vein of coal nine feet in thickness, called the Pittsburgh or River vein; and the main question here is, whether both veins, and, if not, which one passed by the conveyance. Through sundry transfers the title remaining in Armstrong became vested in John C. Howling, who died in 1910 and whose heirs in 1920 conveyed the Pittsburgh vein of coal in the thirty acres to L. T. Laidley, the plaintiff. Through divers transfers the Dawson title to the coal in the thirty acres became vested in Josiah V. Thompson in 1900, and in 1.913 he conveyed the same to the defendant, Sallie Huston Rowe. There has been no coal mined in either vein of the thirty acres since the Armstrong conveyance of 1847.</p>

L. 415, to determine the ownership of the Pittsburgh vein of coal in the thirty acres. The act provides, inter alia, that a party in possession of any lands or tenements, under claim of title, may petition the court of common pleas for a rule upon an adverse claimant to show cause why an issue should not be awarded to determine the title or right of possession; and, if the issue is awarded, that the verdict shall have the same effect as in an action of ejectment. Defendant denied plaintiff’s claim of possession and on that ground challenged the right to award an issue. The trial court disposed of this question on petition, answer and testimony; as appellant has failed to print the latter, we cannot say the court erred in finding plaintiff had such possession as entitled him to the <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>issue. In the absence of an adverse occupancy, a prima facie legal title in petitioner draws to it such possession as will warrant the awarding of an issue: McCormick et al. v.

    <p id="b415-4" data-blocks='[["BL_415.5",415,[168,719,1151,1239]]]'>The real question is, What coal did the parties intend to convey by the Armstrong deed? There is no patent ambiguity in the expression, “the vein or bed of st'one coal therein situate,” but a latent ambiguity arises from the fact that there are two veins of coal, either of which, standing alone, answers the call in the deed. In such case, evidence aliunde is competent and necessary to explain what was in the minds of the parties; for this purpose plaintiff submitted testimony tending to show that in 1847 the Waynesburg vein was well known with open mines therein near the thirty acres, while the Pittsburgh vein was unknown in that neighborhood and had never been opened there for mining purposes; also that the former vein could be conveniently mined from the adjoining premises, embraced in the deed, while the latter could be mined only by sinking a deep and costly shaft. The defendant offered evidence tending to show the Pittsburgh vein outcropped at various places along the river and was well known in 1847, and prior thereto, and that coal had been mined therefrom, although not in this tract; it also appeared that such coal was of better quality and, the vein being thicker, of much greater commercial value than the upper vein.</p>

There was no error in refusing defendant’s offer to prove by the witness, Andrew Brown, inter alia, that his father bought real estate at Gray’s Landing in 1846. That was apparently <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>an immaterial matter, bnt, if otherwise, there was nothing to show a lack of better evidence of the purchase than the hearsay knowledge of a witness born two years thereafter. This part of the offer being incompetent, justified a rejection of the whole; as to the other matters embraced therein we express no opinion. The improperly rejected evidence, while not conclusive of the statements therein made, nor of knowledge thereof by the parties to the Armstrong deed, tends to show general knowledge of the Pittsburgh vein in 1847 and strengthens the contention that the parties contracted with reference thereto.

Thompson et al. and one of the courses in that deed says, “thence by coal claimed by Dawson’s heirs north sixty-six degrees six minutes West sixty perches”;. while that is this coal it is not an admission of adverse ownership. .Then there is the testimony of Charles Kerr to the effect that about the same year he asked Dowlin if he was going to try to hold the coal and the latter said he did not have money to go to law, but sometimes talked that he would try t'o do something about it. As the deed of the surface from Dowlin to Randolph, made in 1899, does not mention either vein of coal, it cannot be construed as an election by Dowlin to take the Waynesburg vein. There is nothing in the record to show any admission by Dowlin that he was not the owner of the Pittsburgh vein, or any conduct on his part to justify the defendant’s claim of an estoppel, and the trial judge properly refused to submit that question to the jury; for whether an estoppel re-<a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>suits from established facts is a question of law: Keating v.
