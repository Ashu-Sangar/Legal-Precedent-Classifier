The Mountain Water Company was incorporated in 1893, and the Bethlehem Consolidated Water Company in 1902. These three concerns were, on April 18,1902, merged into the Bethlehem Consolidated Water Company, which, in 1903, conveyed all its franchises, powers, rights, privileges, property, real and personal to the Bethlehem City Water Company; and the latter on September 28,1920, after approval by the Public Service Commission, conveyed all the merged rights, powers, privileges and franchises to the City of Bethlehem (plaintiff). On February 2,1920, a portion of Hanover Township was annexed to the City of Allentown (defendant). Previous to that date, the Bethlehem City Water Company, or its predecessor, had laid mains and pipes in certain parts of the annexed territory, supplying the inhabitants with water; in the fall of 1921, Allentown, began to extend its municipal water mains into this district and continued to do so until the preliminary injunction issued.</p>

Of course, the chancellor can take judicial knowledge of local geography (Pearce v. Langfit, <a href="/pa/101/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="101 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="500897" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0507-01">101 Pa. 507</a>, 512), including the class into which -the several cities and other communities, with which we have to deal, fall; but, for the benefit of the reviewing tribunal, he should be careful to state all information in that regard which may be necessary to a proper understanding of the record.</p>
    <p id="b138-5" data-blocks='[["BL_138.5",138,[257,1422,1149,973]],["BL_139.1",139,[163,336,1145,97]]]'>Since the litigation involves public interests, and as counsel say, in their briefs, that defendant is willing to pay a reasonable price for plaintiff’s property, but not a franchise value, we venture to suggest that, for the sake of the public, which the parties represent, they should make every effort to arrive at a fair understanding and adjustment1, so this controversy may be brought to a speedy close. We also take occasion to note that the matter before us strongly suggests the necessity for further legislation, authorizing municipalities, situated as are the present ones, to move the Public Service Commission to condemn and value the property involved (including, in a proper case, franchise value) wherever a municipality acquires the assets and franchises of a water company, which incidentally operates within t'he territorial limits of an adjoining municipality; but, pending this legislation, where such a situation arises, those representing the several communities should make every <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>reasonable endeavor to reach a fair adjustment in their own way.</p>
    <p id="b139-3" data-blocks='[["BL_139.4",139,[161,446,1151,809]]]'>The bill, as drawn, prays for general relief, and, specifically, that the status quo be maintained till final hearing; and, then, that defendant be restrained from invading the territory of plaintiff. If, when the facts are properly developed, the Public Service Company Law should be held to apply to the present case, then, perhaps, according to our recent decisions (see Fogelsville, etc., Co. v. Pa. P. &amp; L. Co., <a href="/pa/271/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="271 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="295694" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0237-01">271 Pa. 237</a>, 244-5, and authorities there cited), working out' a system for administering that law, the prayer for general relief would warrant the chancellor in issuing an injunction, pending application to the. Public Service Commission; but, when the record is returned t'o the court below, if the case is proceeded with, and plaintiff still desires that form of relief, it had better move to amend the bill accordingly.</p>
    <p id="b139-4" data-blocks='[["BL_139.5",139,[163,1265,1148,208]]]'>The order áppealed from is reversed, the status quo, as at time of order, is reinstated, and the record remitted for further proceedings consonant with the views here expressed; costs to await final order.</p>
