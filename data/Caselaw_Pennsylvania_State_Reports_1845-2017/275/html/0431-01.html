Titus, in 1901, being the owner of a tract of land in Monongahela Township, Greene County, conveyed the Pittsburgh vein of coal in one hundred and fifty acres thereof to J. Y. Thompson et al., but retained the same vein of coal in the remaining fifteen acres of the tract. Thereafter the title to the one hundred and fifty acres of coal became vested in the Poland Coal Company, defendant, a Pennsylvania corporation, as did the title to the same vein of coal in some nine hundred and fifty <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>acres of adjoining land. An expert examination led defendant to the conclusion that the most feasible location for a mine or colliery from which to reach the one hundred and fifty acres of coal, and also that in adjoining land, was the fifteen acres, which it neither had nor could purchase. The defendant, therefore, in October, 1912, took possession of the fifteen acres and, by proceeding in the court of quarter sessions under sections 1 and 4 of article XII, of the Act of June 9, 1911, P. L. 756 (see pp. 801, 804), sought1 to acquire it under the right of eminent domain. This proceeding was successful in the lower court, but failed in the Superior Court, on the ground that those sections of the act were unconstitutional; see Poland Coal Company’s Case, <a href="/pa-super/58/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="58 Pa. Super. 312" data-case-ids="446182" data-case-paths="/pa-super/58/0312-01">58 Pa. Superior Ct. 312</a>. Meantime, defendant continued to occupy the fifteen acres, or so much thereof as it desired, made five openings therein, constructed an electric tram railway twelve hundred feet in length thereon, also a fan house equipped with a large electric fan and motor, together with a foreman’s house, small powder house, etc., and proceeded with its mining operation. Plaintiff protested against this occupation and use of his land and in 1915 brought an action of ejectment against defendant to recover the fifteen acres, which he did by verdict and judgment in the lower court, affirmed by this court January 4, 1919; see Titus v. Poland Coal Co., <a href="/pa/263/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="263 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="1047491" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0024-01">263 Pa. 24</a>.

Enc. of Law (2d ed.) p. 611; 11 R. C. L. p. 1087, section 29. A well-considered opinion of the late Justice Hand, when in the court of common pleas, in Hillard Live Stock Co. v. Amity Coal Co., 11 Lane. L. R. 241, cites many of our earlier cases and holds that mine cars, and tools in a blacksmith shop connected with the mine, are fixtures and pass with the real estate, as they are necessary to a complete mine. Whatever is a necessary part of the machinery for carrying on the business is a fixture irrespective of the manner of its attachment: Christian v. Dripps, <a href="/pa/28/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="28 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="981640" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0271-01">28 Pa. 271</a>. There was ample evidence here to support a finding that the pit cars and motors were fixtures; however, there was some conflict in the evidence as to the manner and extent of their use and more as to their number and value and we are not prepared to say the trial judge erred in submitting the question to the jury, under proper instructions. Frequently, as here, the question as to whether an article has become a fixture, is a mixed one of law and fact: 11 R. C. L. p. 1092, section 33. As the question could not be ruled in appellant’s favor as one of law, it was the gainer by its submission to the jury as one of fact, for it might have been and possibly was resolved in favor of defendant. We say possibly was so resolved, for the evidence as to other items of damage was sufficient to support the verdict.</p>

J. p. 691, section 67. For the benefit of trade a tenant may, during his possession of the demised premises, remove a fixture he has placed thereon (Overton v. Williston, <a href="/pa/31/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="31 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="985067" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0155-01">31 Pa. 155</a>; Seeger v.

It was not until the trespass ended in 1919 that the cost of restoration could be ascertained and the question necessarily was whether it exceeded the value of the land at that time. Defendant being a trespasser was, of course, not entitled to compensation for the buildings it placed upon the land: Davidson v. Barclay, <a href="/pa/63/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="63 Pa. 406" data-case-ids="1019050" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0406-01">63 Pa. 406</a>.</p>
