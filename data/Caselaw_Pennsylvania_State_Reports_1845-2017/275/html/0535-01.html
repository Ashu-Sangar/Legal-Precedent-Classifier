Each month’s delivery to be treated and considered as a separate and independent contract and to be settled and paid for in cash on or before the fifteenth day of the next succeeding month. Pursuant to which plaintiff delivered to defendant carloads of the coal during each of the nine months, but in less numbers <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>than the contract called for. This suit was brought to recover $1,795.32, for the coal so delivered during the last month of the contract (June, 1917); to this defendant set up a counterclaim for damages by reason of the shortages of the monthly deliveries. The pleadings consisted of plaintiff’s statement, to which was attached a copy of the contract, defendant’s affidavit of defense, as amended, and plaintiff’s reply thereto. At the trial, plaintiff, after having made out a prima facie case, by offering in evidence the contract, the undenied averments in the statement and certain admissions in the affidavit of defense, rested. Defendant then offered in evidence the paragraphs of its affidavit of defense not denied, or not sufficiently denied, in plaintiff’s reply, and then rested. No part of plaintiff’s reply, or other proof, than as above stated, was offered by either side, while each asked for binding instructions. The trial judge directed a verdict for defendant for $15,680.83, being the amount of its counterclaim, less plaintiff’s claim, and from judgment entered thereon plaintiff brought this appeal.</p>

This must be answered in the affirmative. Plaintiff contracted to deliver two hundred and twenty-five cars of slack coal at $1.25 per ton, and the affidavit sets out the number of cars delivered each month, making in all 136 cars and leaves a shortage of 89 cars, which, computed at the average tonnage of the cars delivered, makes a total shortage of <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>4,147 tons. The affidavit also sets out the market value of such coal at the end of each month and defendant’s loss, computed on t'he basis of the difference between the market value and the contract price; and further that plaintiff neglected and refused to deliver the balance of the coal, although demand therefor was duly made, or to pay defendant the damages it sustained by reason of such failure. The affidavit gives the amounts, etc., for each month in detail and states a substantial cause of action.</p>

True, plaintiff’s reply set up monthly settlements, car shortage, etc., but these matters were in the nature of an affirmative defense wherein the burden of proof was upon the plaintiff, and none was submitted. The contract stipulates that “Each month’s delivery is to be •treated and considered as a separate and independent contract,” and further, that', “Seller will make every effort for the prompt and faithful fulfillment of contract, but will not be responsible for delivery hereunder if prevented by strikes or combinations of miners or laborers, accidents in mines or otherwise, fire or flooding, interruptions of transportation, failure of car supply, or from any other causes beyond seller’s control. .It is understood also that in case there should be a shortage of cars at the mines from which seller proposes to ship under this contract, shipment will be apportioned equitably and uniformly on all contracts or orders so far as the same can be accomplished.” It is not necessary for a buyer to aver or prove the absence of circumstances which would excuse the seller’s failure to perform; and this is especially so where, as here, these circumstances were peculiarly within the knowledge of the latter. In Smokeless Fuel Co. v. W. E. Seaton and Sons, 52 S. E.

Under like conditions it has often been so held: see Davis et al. v. Alpha Portland Cement Co., <a href="/f/134/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="134 F. 274" data-case-ids="3862589" data-case-paths="/f/134/0274-01">134 Fed. 274</a>, s. c. <a href="/f/142/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="142 F. 74" data-case-ids="3905676" data-case-paths="/f/142/0074-01">142 Fed. 74</a>; American Trust &amp; Savings Bank v. Ziegler Coal Co., <a href="/f/165/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="165 F. 34" data-case-ids="1887027" data-case-paths="/f/165/0034-01">165 Fed. 34</a>; Producers’ Coke Co. v. McKeefrey Iron Co., <a href="/f/267/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="267 F. 22" data-case-ids="3546622" data-case-paths="/f/267/0022-01">267 Fed. 22</a>.</p>
    <p id="b563-3" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[85,1052,1154,1017]]]'>As above stated, plaintiff’s reply was not offered in evidence nor was it brought upon the record in t'he manner pointed out in the opinion by the present Chief Justice in Buehler v. U. S. Fashion Plate Co., <a href="/pa/269/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="269 Pa. 428" data-case-ids="1063486" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0428-01">269 Pa. 428</a>, and therefore cannot be considered. The suggestion that plaintiff was obliged to furnish only so much coal as defendant’s business required, finds no support in the contract or proofs. The case must be decided on the record as made, and the court cannot go back to the pleadings for the purpose of modifying in any way facts which have been offered and admitted in evidence: Buehler v. U. S. Fashion Plate Co., supra. The pleadings, when competent as evidence and properly brought upon the record, must be treated as at least prima facie correct (Mellon National Bank v. Peoples National Bank, <a href="/pa/226/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="226 Pa. 261" data-case-ids="967865" data-case-paths="/pa/226/0261-01">226 Pa. 261</a>; McCord v. Durant, <a href="/pa/134/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="134 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="814954" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0184-01">134 Pa. 184</a>; and see Kull v. Mastbaum &amp; Fleisher, <a href="/pa/269/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="269 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="1063548" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0202-01">269 Pa. 202</a>), hence, the trial judge rightly directed the jury to allow the defendant’s counterclaim.</p>
