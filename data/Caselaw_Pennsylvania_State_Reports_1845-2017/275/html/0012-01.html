L. 507, and its amendments. It was not stated whether there were any bonds or other evidences of indebtedness for which the mortgages were security; or, if there were, whether all of defendant’s assets were liable for them, or only the real estate described, in the mortgages. The Commonwealth contended defendant was required to make return of the mortgage indebtedness and pay the tax to the State, because of the provisions <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>of section 17 of the Act of 1913, as amended by the Act of July 15, 1919, P. L. 955. Defendant claimed these provisions had no applicability; that it had properly paid the full amount of interest to the owners of the mortgages, who were required, by section 1 of the Act of 1913, to make return and pay the tax to the proper county. The court below sustained the Commonwealth’s contention, and defendant appeals from the judgment entered in accordance therewith.</p>

Under such circum<a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>stances, another clause in the Act of 1919 applies, for it holds the State is entitled to this tax whenever “interest shall be paid” by a domestic corporation on any “evidence of indebtedness”; and this such a mortgage of course is. The words “or interest shall be paid,” do not appear in either sections 1 or 17 of the Act of 1913; hence we. must assume they were inserted in the amendment of 1919 to cover some additional subject of taxation, especially as the disjunctive “or,” and not the conjunctive “and,” is used to express the legislative intent. Thus viewed, they cannot properly be limited to instances where the corporation has “issued” the obligations or “assumed” a general liability for them; but must apply, exactly! as the language states, Whenever there are “scrip, bonds, certificates and. evidences of indebtedness ......on which interest shall be paid.” This is a necessary deduction, for otherwise the words “interest shall be paid,” might just as well have been omitted from the statute, a conclusion not permissible, if reasonably avoidable, as it is here: Phila. to use v. Spring Garden Farmer’s Market Co., <a href="/pa/161/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="161 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="854151" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0522-01">161 Pa. 522</a>, 527; Ludwick’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=269%20Pa.%20366" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="269 Pa. 366">269 Pa. 366</a>, 371. It follows that, though we assume there were no bonds for which the mortgages were given as security, still, as the mortgages themselves were “evidences of indebtedness [of plaintiff’s property]......, on which interest shall be paid,” the tax goes to the State, exactly as it would if the general assets of the corporation were also liable for the debt.</p>

Roxford Knitting Co., <a href="/pa/268/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="268 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1061562" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0266-01">268 Pa. 266</a>, and Com. v.

In those cases, we decided that corporate promissory notes and car trust certificates were taxable under section 1 and not under section 17, because they were specifically mentioned in the former and not in the latter. It was so held, however, not because they could not be taxed under section <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>17, for it is expressly stated that the terms used therein “may be broad enough to cover them, and might well be held to do so, were it not for section 1 of the same, act which imposes a tax for county purposes,” but because, as the law then stood, the two sections appeared to be conflicting, so far as the particular securities under consideration were concerned, and therefore “the special provision must be taken......as an exception to the general provision,” and the former alone held applicable. Each of those cases related to taxes prior to 1919, and hence when it was provided, by the amendment of that date, that only the securities “which cannot be made taxable under......section [17], are to be taxed under section 1,” the principle relied on was thereafter inapplicable, and during later years those securities became taxable under section 17: cessante ratione cessat et ipsa lex.</p>
    <p id="b39-7" data-blocks='[["BL_39.4",39,[172,1217,1153,1188]]]'>Defendant also contends that the amendment of 1919 was passed to overcome the effect of Com. v.

If we suppose this claim to be correct, still defendant’s contention fails, for the Commonwealth also claimed, in that case, that section 17 applied though the corporation did not issue but only “paid interest on the mortgage indebtedness [that fact alone making it] liable for the collection of the tax.” Both of these contentions were overruled; and hence, if we suppose the legislature desired to make that decision innocuous, we must presume that, by the use of the words “or on which interest shall be paid,” it intended to make effective, for future taxes, the second of the Commonwealth’s contentions also. It is probable, however, that the legislative purpose was thereafter to render inapplicable the rulings in all three of the above cases; and this it does, for, as already pointed out, section 1 is not to be applied when the corporation has issued or assumed the indebtedness, or paid interest on it.</p>

If it does, it knows, from this fact alone, it must pay the tax to the State, and the owner of the security knows he need not make return thereof or pay the tax to the county.</p>
