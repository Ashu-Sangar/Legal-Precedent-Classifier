The conduct of the agent under this agreement was not impeached, and the learned court below, as well as the master, found the plaintiff was not entitled to any account from the defendant by reason thereof. On October 6, 1916, contract “D” was executed, having for its purpose the disposition of the furnace output for the first six months of 1917. A third agreement, “E,” made provision for the output for the balance of that year, and a fourth covered the first six months of 1918. Thereafter the sales were made through the agency of the defendant, but by contract “G,” executed directly by seller and purchaser. After deliveries had ceased on the first contract, “0,” and <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>prior to the commencement of shipments under contract “D,” the defendant, as agent, sold a part of the product of plaintiff to the LaBelle Iron Works, and ordered deliveries to it. This transaction is not evidenced by any written agreement with the plaintiff, but shipments were directed to be made at a price considerably less than that which the buyer had agreed to pay to the defendant. A small portion of the tonnage during this period was sold to others by the agent at a much larger sum than that accounted for to the principal.</p>

The operations of the defendant became apparent only when the testimony was taken. The court had directed an accounting for the sums received for the domestic and foundry coke, for that sold for cash, not included in the first four agreements, and for all disposed of under contract “G,” as well as for sums received by reason'of wage advances. It had likewise in its 11th conclusion left open, for subsequent determination, the measure of defendant’s liability. Complaint is now made that under the circumstances there was no power to include a charge for cars of coke alleged to have been converted, nor sums received for freight differentials or commissions. It has been frequently held by this court that the accounting must be limited to the matters set forth in the pleadings (Luther v.

In the present case, however, the master would seem to have been justified, under the conclusions of the court below upon which the decree was based, in considering the matters brought to- his attention. Further, the hearings continued for a considerable period of time without objection on this score by the defendant, and complaint does not seem to have been made until argument on exceptions to the report.

It was found that various devices were used by the defendant company to secure for itself larger earnings than the 5% commission provided for in its contracts and orders for shipments, and in some instances it has been held that the coke received was diverted from the ordinary course of trade, and used by the defendant to carry out its agreements to sell at a low price. In such cases, it has been charged with the-highest market value of the output at the time of its delivery. As a result1 of this, and other misconduct pointed out, commissions on all contracts were disallowed.</p>

The agreement of Hillman &amp; Sons Company with the Buffalo Furnace Company called for Connellsville coke, and part of this and like subsequent orders were assigned to the By-Products Company, and deliveries made under contracts D, E and F. A difference in freight rates of fifteen cents, — after June 25, 1918, thirty cents, — in favor of the shipper accrued when the point of loading was Glassport. The defendant in its settlements with the furnace company secured the benefit of this sum, and failed to permit its principal to participate in this advantage to which the latter was entitled. Instead, the former claimed the right to withhold it, in addition to the commission of <em>5% </em>provided for in the contract. Though it may have retained these amounts in good faith, yet without disclosure to the principal, and approval by it, the agent was bound to account for the rebates so received as part of the purchase price, and the finding of the master and court below that1 these differentials on contracts D, E and F must be returned, is a correct1 conclusion: 1 Mechem on Agency 1227.</p>

In these cases not only did the agent obtain more than it paid to the principal, —this difference being retained on the theory that it had made a purchase, — but by undisclosed arrangements with the buyers it secured from time to time larger prices, based on the increased cost of production. These sums properly belonged to the plaintiff, and the direction to account for the amount thereof was proper. In addition to the collections made on the three contracts referred to, it made use of the principal’s coke to carry out what was known as the Rainey contract, under which the defendant was required to deliver in 1917 at a fixed, price. Instead of so doing, it applied the plaintiff’s product to its own purposes, and satisfied its obligation. Here again it received the benefit of wage advances properly payable to the plaintiff, and for these <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>sums it is likewise accountable.

After the expiration of the first arrangement with the Buffalo Furnace Company there was an interval of time when the shipments of plaintiff are not evidenced by written contract. During this period the defendant had an agreement with the LaBelle Furnace Company to furnish coke at $3 per ton. This fact it did not disclose to the principal, but directed it to make shipments to the buyer at the rate of $2.50, thus being relieved of responsibility. Here, the master properly held there was a conversion, and directed an accounting at the market price at the time, of delivery, irrespective of the sum named in defendant’s contract.</p>

In. all, orders were given from 1915 to 1919 for 3,804 cars, representing 929 purchases. As far as the testimony discloses, 3,521 of these cars were properly accounted for. Appellant admits that 234 cars, including 49 bought by it, were not.. The appellee claims this number should be at least 293. No evidence was produced to show any wrongful conduct in the great majority of the shipments, unless it is to be inferred from the general course of business. That the purpose of the defendant in all cases was fraudulent" was deduced by the” master from the transactions concerning which investigation was made. This was limited <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>to about 10% of the total number, and largely to the accounts where a discrepancy appeared upon their face. Many examined seem to have been unobjectionable, but some showed wrongdoing. From this testimony the master found that the agent concealed in certain cases the terms of the contract, of which it took advantage, that it reported fictitious sales, or at false prices, or did not report them at all, or made shipments to its own customers, in order to relieve itself of liability on low-price contracts. The various transactions have been set forth with great care, and as to those the conclusion reached is justified. On the theory that the evidence received shifted the burden to the defendant to demonstrate the fairness of each sale, all were held improper, though in many instances where testimony was taken no error was found. The duty is upon the agent to account, but if he does so, then the burden of showing dishonesty in any particular case is upon him who asserts the wrong. It is undoubtedly the duty of the agent to act fairly and to report fully to his principal, and as has been said (1 Mechem on Agency 1844), proof of incorrect returns justifies unfavorable inferences. Where a decree directing an accounting is entered, then the agent is required to file his statement, and as to such items complained of, which are not properly explained, the burden is on defendant to satisfy the master as to their correctness: Mintz v. Brock, <a href="/pa/193/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="193 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="910343" data-case-paths="/pa/193/0294-01">193 Pa. 294</a>.

C. 302</a>, the burden of proving the necessary facts to show wrongdoing on the part of the agent is Upon the one asserting it, and this is not to be left to mere conjecture. See, also, 2 C. J. 930. As to the cars which the defendant purchased for itself, and as to those in which the master has found improper conduct in his 25th finding, and the amplification thereof, the defendant should be compelled to account for the market price <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>at the time of delivery.

Blood, <a href="/f/47/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="47 F. 361" data-case-ids="3721477" data-case-paths="/f/47/0361-01">47 Fed. 361</a>; Merriman v. McCormick Harvester Machine Co., <a href="/wis/96/0600-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="96 Wis. 600" data-case-ids="8706724" data-case-paths="/wis/96/0600-01">96 Wis. 600</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=71%20N.W.%201050" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="71 N.W. 1050">71 N. W. 1050</a>; Hippisley v. Knee Bros., 1 K. B. 1 (1905). To sustain the contrary position, the plaintiff relies upon Little v. Phipps, <a href="/mass/208/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="208 Mass. 331" data-case-ids="3470835" data-case-paths="/mass/208/0331-01">208 Mass. 331</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=91%20N.E.%20260" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="91 N.E. 260">91 N. E. 260</a>, where an agent was denied compensation on two transactions, but the court there found that it was- impossible to say what part of the compensation agreed upon was due in respect to the services faithfully performed by defendant, and therefore held no allowance could be made. Hansen v. Barnard, <a href="/f/270/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="270 F. 163" data-case-ids="6735524" data-case-paths="/f/270/0163-01">270 Fed. 163</a>, cited by appellee, was a case where an officer claimed the balance of salary due upon a specified voyage, and the balance of compensation was denied because of his fraudulent handling of accounts on the particular journey. It is not controlling of the present situation. Here, the various sales are represented by distinct contracts with purchasers or by shipping orders, and we see no reason why the transactions should not be treated as divisible and compensation allowed for'those not shown to be unfair, and denied where misconduct ap<a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>pears, including those sales where freight differentials and wage advances were improperly retained by the agent.</p>
    <p id="b228-4" data-blocks='[["BL_228.4",228,[256,483,1148,425]]]'>It follows from what has been said that the decree entered must be modified as to the charges for foundry and domestic coke, — item one of the account stated, — and as to commissions, — item fifteen, — and the record is remitted to the court below to make the necessary modifications as indicated in this opinion. The assignments of error raising other questions are overruled; the costs of this appeal to be paid by appellant.</p>

    <p id="b228-7" data-blocks='[["BL_228.8",228,[257,1135,1145,149]]]'>The appellant has asked for a reargument in this case. Upon due consideration, we are of opinion that the application should be refused.</p>
    <p id="b228-8" data-blocks='[["BL_228.9",228,[254,1296,1150,696]]]'>The order already filed sufficiently indicates the liability to be imposed upon the defendant in the case of sales referred to in finding 25, and the amplification thereof. Where it appears there was a direct conversion to the use of defendant, or the coke of plaintiff was diverted to the carrying out of the lower-priced contracts of the agent, the latter is properly chargeable with the market value at the time of delivery, without allowance of any commissions for its services. In the other cases, the sums actually received, and not accounted for, including freight differentials and wage advances, if any, are to be paid, with the loss of commissions in all cases where any misconduct was shown.</p>
    <p id="b228-9" data-blocks='[["BL_228.10",228,[253,2003,1149,380]],["BL_229.1",229,[142,329,1155,854]]]'>One matter has been called to our attention, which can be corrected by a modification of the order heretofore filed. In item nine of the account, approved by the court below, defendant1 was charged with wage advances received under contract F, entered into after the governmental order, fixing the price of coke at $6 per ton. We have found in the appeal between the same parties, to <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>No. 105, October Term, 1922, thát this contract, between plaintiff and defendant, was fair, and should be sustained. The sum agreed to be paid to the plaintiff, including the freight differential, was $6.15, to be reduced, by the subtraction of the commission, to $5,85, the only amount with which the plaintiff is chargeable. It therefore follows that the profits made by defendant, which would include any wage advances received, cannot now be demanded by the principal, and the decree which has been entered should be altered accordingly. A like correction should be made as to the wage advances on shipments made under contract F during the first six months of 1918 and applied to carry out the Eainey contract. Here, the coke was paid for at the maximum price permitted by the government, and the liability of the agent was thus fixed.</p>
    <p id="b229-4" data-blocks='[["BL_229.5",229,[150,1205,1151,313]]]'>The petition for reargument is dismissed* and the decree heretofore entered is modified so as to exclude therefrom such sums as have been charged for wage advances received under contract F, or on tonnage applied to the Eainey contract where delivered under the same agreement.</p>
