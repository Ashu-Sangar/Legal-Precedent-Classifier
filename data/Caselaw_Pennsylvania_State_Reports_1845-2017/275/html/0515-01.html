    <p id="b541-3" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[119,431,1153,1899]]]'>(a) The defendant and Kate Nadab, hereinafter called the deceased, conducted, at 2931 Wylie Avenue, Pittsburgh, a small store, which was connected by a swinging door with a sleeping chamber in the rear, and behind this was a kitchen. Lat'e in the afternoon of August 13, 1921, Santos entered the building; shortly afterwards several shots were heard. No one witnessed the shooting, but those who first reached the premises found defendant on the floor of the store near t'he door leading to the bedroom, with two wounds in his head, one of which was caused by a bullet that had “penetrated the outer table of the skull, shattered the inner table, and was lying on the [covering] of the brain.” The dead body of Mrs. Nadab was in the bedroom, with three wounds upon it: a haematoma on the top of her head, about three inches in diameter, under which was a fracture of the skull three inches long; a bullet had entered her head near the left temple, passed into the brain and lodged in the cerebellum; and she had a compound fracture of the middle third of the right tibia. Her five-year old boy, with his heart pierced by a bullet, was near by. After Mrs. Nadab’s body had been rolled over by the opening of the door, a revolver was discovered not far from her right! hand; this was the property of defendant, who testified he kept it in one of the store drawers. On indictments for the murder of the two deceased persons, Santos pleaded not guilty, and his counsel set up as defenses that, either Kate Nadab had shot him and the child, and then committed suicide, or a shot fired by her had entered his head, rendering him irresponsible, and, not knowing what he was about, he had shot her and, possibly the child; the Commonwealth does not deny that deceased may have shot defendant; its theory is that Santos struck Mrs. Nadab, who, to defend herself, shot him, and he then killed her and the child.</p>

      <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>(b) The only assignments of error are to the sentences, and the refusal of the trial judge to permit certain witnesses for defendant to testify that, shortly before the day of the fatal encounter, Mrs. Nadab declared her intention of shooting the accused, and then hilling herself.</p>
    <p id="b542-4" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[275,654,1148,479]]]'>(c) The proffer of evidence contained in the second assignment is somewhat vague (cf. paragraph r, infra), and, considered alone, it may be objectionable in part from that standpoint, but the meaning of the words sought to be introduced, as used by deceased, are made plain by the offer contained in the first assignment, which is sufficiently clear; this may be seen by the text of the several tenders of proof printed in the notes of the reporter, preceding this opinion.</p>
    <p id="b542-5" data-blocks='[["BL_542.6",542,[270,1144,1153,1235]],["BL_543.1",543,[123,333,1152,482]]]'>(d) The law -seems established that, where one accused of homicide pleads self-defense, he may introduce evidence of communicated threats made against him by the deceased (Com. v. Principatti, <a href="/pa/260/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="260 Pa. 587" data-case-ids="1040311" data-case-paths="/pa/260/0587-01">260 Pa. 587</a>, 594), or even of uncommunicated threats, where it is sought to show an intention of the deceased from which it may be inferred he was the aggressor: Com. v. Keller, <a href="/pa/191/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="191 Pa. 122" data-case-ids="907036" data-case-paths="/pa/191/0122-01">191 Pa. 122</a>, 132. In the instant ease, although there is no contention or evidence that Santos acted in self-defense, or that deceased’s alleged threat to hill defendant had been communicated to him, nevertheless, since one of the defenses was-that Mrs. Nadab attached the accused, committing injuries which rendered him mentally irresponsible, and that, while in this condition of mind, he hilled her and the child, it was just as important, in order to prove this state of affairs by circumstantial evidence, to show facts from which it could be inferred that the deceased was the aggressor as though self-defense were set up; and a lihe rule, as to the admission of evidence, should apply. The prosecution cannot heep out such evidence as here offered by failing to dispute, or even by conceding, the bare fact that deceased attempted to hill defendant; in the first place, that fact does not show who <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>was the aggressor, and, next1, the accused is entitled to prove his defense in his own way. While the matter in hand will be taken up again, later on, when dealing specifically with the second assignment of error (paragraphs r, t, u, infra), it is unnecessary, under the view we entertain of the proffered testimony, to decide the case on the theory of uncommunicated threats, for evidence such as that here in question is certainly admissible on the issue of deceased’s alleged suicide.</p>
    <p id="b543-3" data-blocks='[["BL_543.4",543,[124,825,1153,973]]]'>(e) The great weight of authority and reason demand that, in a trial for homicide where self-destruction of deceased is set up as a defense, the accused should be permitted to introduce declarations, made by the alleged victim, reasonably close to the time of her death, evincing an intention to take her own life; and particularly is this true where, as in the present case, the circumstantial evidence is consistent with the defense: Com. v.

For instance, in this case the evidence in question is admissible because suicidal intent, like any other purpose, is a mental condition, which can manifest itself, primarily, only through some act or word of the person in question; hence relevant acts or words may be proved as the basis of an inference that the state of mind, or intention, in question did in fact exist', from which fact, and others in the case (Wigmore, section 1726), the conclusion may be drawn that the design contended for had been carried into execution.

If it be contended that the offers should be rejected because certain portions of them are irrelevant, it may be answered, we expressed our opinion on a similar contention in Com. v. Colandro, <a href="/pa/231/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="231 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="973928" data-case-paths="/pa/231/0343-01">231 Pa. 343</a>, 348, saying: “While the ordinary rule [in civil cases] is that, where an offer blends irrelevant and inadmissible matters with a matter relevant and admissible, its rejection as a whole is not error, yet......this principle......ought not to be summoned to sustain a ruling prejudicial to the interests of a defendant on trial <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>for murder; [in such case], so much of an offer as is relevant should be admitted, [and] the fact that some inseparable, incidental collateral facts, irrelevant in themselves and prejudicial to the prosecution, might thus be caused t'o appear, would not make the competent part any the less admissible......The possibility of prejudice can be sufficiently cured by restricting the use [of the testimony].” Here the only parts of the offers which properly could be accounted prejudicial to the prosecution are the uncommunicated threats of deceased to kill defendant, and, as said earlier in this opinion (paragraph d, supra), they may be introduced as relevant to the defense that deceased was the aggressor; although we are now considering the admissibility of the rejected evidence solely as tending to support the defense of suicide.</p>

The general rule is, On an appeal from a judgment entered on the finding of a jury, the whole body of the evidence must be viewed in the light which best supports the verdict, all inferences being drawn and doubt's resolved in such way as will sustain that conclusion; but this rule does not apply where, as here, we are seeking to see whether error was committed by the rejection, on the principle suggested by the appellee (indicated in the immediately preceding paragraph), of what was otherwise competent evidence, duly <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>offered. Under such circumstances, we must put ourselves in the position of the trial judge at the time the offer under consideration was made, and, in order to decide the admissibility of the testimony tendered, we must look at all evidential matters then on the record in such light, favorable to the defendant, as it is reasonably conceivable the jury might have viewed them, in connection with the proffered testimony, had it been received. With this rule in mind, we shall now examine the uncontested proofs to see whether they, — particularly considering the physical facts attending the shooting of deceased, — can justifiably be classed as irreconcilable with the defenses sought to be supported by the rejected evidence.</p>
    <p id="b547-3" data-blocks='[["BL_547.4",547,[98,1116,1156,1299]],["BL_548.1",548,[312,349,1147,143]]]'>(m) As previously said (paragraph a, supra), defendant' is the only living witness to the shooting; aside from his assertion that, owing to the dazed state of his mind at the time of the killing, he did not know how it occurred, and certain expert testimony put in by both sides, the evidence is purely circumstantial. While the circumstantial proofs may be accepted as in a measure corroborative of the state’s theory, they are, also, not wholly inconsistent with the defenses interposed by the accused; so far as these defenses are concerned, there is no way of telling just when or how the various wounds on the body of deceased were received or the manner of her killing, to a degree of certainty which warrants the decision of those points as matters of law, and the experts produced at the trial differ in reference thereto. Hence we say the circumstantial proofs, even with the explanatory opinion testimony, are not irreconcilable with the theories of the defense, and cannot exclude other evidence offered to sustain such theories, unless the opinions of the physician who performed the autopsy are to be taken as conclusively removing all possibility of self-destruction of deceased and as warranting the court in ruling that the suicidal theory, set up by the defense, was untenable, — for what this witness said is the only <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>thing on which the court below could base its view as to there being on the record “very clear evidence that Mrs. Nadab could not have fired the shot which killed her.”</p>
    <p id="b548-4" data-blocks='[["BL_548.5",548,[305,513,1155,1496]]]'>(n) The physician in question testified that the bullet penetrated deceased’s head “at the outer angle of the left eye, right in the temple region..... .and went directly backward, inward and downward, lacerating the brain, the cerebral sinus., and the cerebellum”; that powder marks appeared around the wound, although their extent was rendered uncertain by the fact that she was a colored person. He stated, first, that powder burns could be recognized; then, that there were none. From his examination of the entrance wound and path of the bullet in the head of deceased, this doctor was asked to give his opinion as to the direction from which the bullet had been fired; he indicated a view, but said, also, that the bullet had been badly scored by a bone and deflected from its course, so that it would be “pretty hard to tell from what direction it was coming.” This witness, when asked his opinion as to the distance from the muzzle of the pistol, at the moment of discharge, to the place of entry of the bullet into Mrs. Nadab’s head, gave conflicting answers at different stages of his testimony, first saying “at least two feet,” then replying in the affirmative to the question “Not less than six inches and about two feet away?” and, finally, on cross-examination, he said “not less than sixteen [inches].” He further testified that, in his opinion, it would be impossible to determine, from an examination of the wounds, whether deceased was lying or standing when she was shot.</p>

After discussing the element's of murder at common law and under our statute, and reviewing the evidence in the case, the court ended its charge as follows: “If, however, you should be satisfied that [defendant] killed her, but that there was no malice present, then you should find him guilty of voluntary manslaughter; if you find he did not kill her at all, then you should find him not guilty, and the same verdicts you will render for the same reasons in the other indictment, wherein he is charged with killing Frederick Nadab.” While it is true the element of malice., essential to murder, is lacking in voluntary manslaughter, yet in this case it was wrong to charge that the fact of killing, together with an absence of malice, required a verdict against defendant. The above-quoted instruction, indeed the entire charge, overlooked the defense that, if accused killed deceased, it was at a time when his reason was dethroned by the bul<a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>let wound in Ms head; it, in effect, deprived the jury of the right to acquit, if satisfied that defendant killed without malice and without mental capacity to appreciate what he was doing. If the killing was done by defendant, without malice, while in a state of passion, from either anger or fear, caused by sufficient provocation, it would be manslaughter (Pennsylvania v. Bell, <a href="/add/1/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="1 Add. 156" data-case-ids="12128462" data-case-paths="/add/1/0156-01">1 Add. 156</a>; Com. v.

Then, that part of the instruction which tells the jury to “render the same verdict for the same reason in the other indictment, charging defendant with killing Frederick Nadab,” will not do. There is very little evidence, and that of a purely circumstantial nature, tending to prove defendant shot the boy, and the jury should be given the opportunity to separately consider this indictment, and to return a different verdict thereon from that rendered on the first charge, if it sees fit so to do. Finally, the Commonwealth pressed for a conviction of murder, and, in charging on the degree of this crime, the trial judge rather accentuated the elements of deliberation and premeditation, necessary to the capital offense (section 74, Act of March 31,1860, P. L. 382, 402)., at the expense of the “true criterion of the first degree,” which is the “intent to take life” (Keenan v. Com., <a href="/pa/44/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="44 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="484325" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0055-01">44 Pa. 55</a>, 56; Com. v. McManus, <a href="/pa/143/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="143 Pa. 64" data-case-ids="978545" data-case-paths="/pa/143/0064-01">143 Pa. 64</a>, 77, 84); he failed to make clear the sort of deliberation and premeditation required (Keenan v. Com., supra, 56-7; Wharton on Homicide, 3d ed., section 113, p. 161; and see charge of Judge Woodward in Com. v. Klose, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Kulp%20111" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="4 Kulp 111">4 Kulp, 111</a>, 114), and that they must be connected with the carrying into execution of a fully conscious, no matter how hastily formed (Com. v. Buccieri, <a href="/pa/153/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="153 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="840271" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0535-01">153 Pa. 535</a>, 541), purpose to kill (Johnson v. Com., <a href="/pa/24/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="24 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="9504748" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0386-01">24 Pa. 386</a>, 389), not merely a design to do great' bodily harm, which is a mark of the second degree: <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>Com. v. Drum, <a href="/pa/58/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="58 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1013212" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0009-01">58 Pa. 9</a>, 23; Green v.

Klose, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Kulp%20111" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="4 Kulp 111">supra, 115, 117</a>. If it be said, the use of the pistol shows the intent in this case must have been to kill, the answer is that, even in murder “committed by the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the body of the deceased,” the degree of the crime is for the jury (Com. v. Greene, <a href="/pa/227/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="227 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="1008604" data-case-paths="/pa/227/0086-01">227 Pa. 86</a>, 89); and while the law regards such circumstances as “evidence that a specific intent to kill existed,” yet this evidence is “never so far conclusive as to such fact that the trial court may pronounce it conclusive as a matter of law”: Com. v. Chapler, <a href="/pa/228/0630-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="228 Pa. 630" data-case-ids="969897" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0630-01">228 Pa. 630</a>, 633. Since defendant was not convicted of murder in either degree, it is apparent no harm was done him by the instructions under discussion; they should not, however, be carried, in their present form, into another trial; hence the mention of them at this time.</p>

Here, as already pointed out, defendant was measurably deprived of both these rights, particularly so far as his defense of suicide by the deceased is concerned, for this is mentioned in the charge only in an incidental and inadequate way, and important evidence relating thereto was excluded.</p>
