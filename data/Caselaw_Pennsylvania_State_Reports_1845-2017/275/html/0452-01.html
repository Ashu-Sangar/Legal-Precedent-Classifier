    <p id="b475-11" data-blocks='[["BL_475.22",475,[133,1809,1149,426]]]'>In this case plaintiff sued to recover commissions, alleged to be due him as agent for defendant in the sale of certain real estate; the jury rendered a verdict for the former; the latter moved for a new trial and for judgment n. o. v.; the court below granted the first motion and denied the second; both sides have appealed; plaintiff complains of the order entered, and defendant because of the refusal of his motion for judgment n. o. v.</p>
    <p id="b475-12" data-blocks='[["BL_475.23",475,[135,2254,1149,152]],["BL_476.1",476,[274,337,1154,1009]]]'>The court below states, — in its opinion granting the new trial and refusing judgment n. o. v., — that, though the testimony given by plaintiff contains “no distinct <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>and unequivocal admission” of fraudulent conduct on Ms part toward defendant, yet “an inference might be drawn from [such] testimony, as a whole, that [important] facts were not disclosed by him” to his principal (the defendant), and, from the failure to make such disclosures, the conclusion might be warranted that plaintiff had been guilty of fraudulent conduct of a character which would deprive him of a right to recover at law. The court below further states, the issue of the particular fraudulent conduct now in question was not submitted to the jury, because, although other frauds were alleged, it was neither raised in the affidavit of defense nor specially called to the trial judge’s attention; but that, in the trial court’s view, “this question ought to have been so submitted, instead of being in effect excluded from consideration by the instructions given,” adding, “we [the trial court] feel that the way in which to avoid the danger of injustice to either party is to grant a new trial.” ■</p>
