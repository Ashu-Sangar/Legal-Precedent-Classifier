He personally conducted one of them; the other was under the management of Marino Giunta, an employee. John Faiola, a minor ten years of age, worked at the latter place cleaning, sweeping and performing other services about it, and at times assisting the truck driver in delivering groceries and fruit. He had been thus engaged for two years when he received a bump on the knee while moving some heavy barrels at the direction of Giunta, the injury developing into a disease of the marrow of the bone. In an action to recover damages, the court below directed a nonsuit because no express contract of employment had been shown, and a contract implied from the acts of others should not bind defendant and cause him to be subject to the penalty of <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>a criminal statute.

Private instructions to an agent may not empower him to act within the ordinary scope of duties entrusted to him, but the public or an interested person is not always bound by private instructions. The principal may be held responsible, though the particular acts are done in excess of such instructions (Adams Express Co. v. Schlessinger, <a href="/pa/75/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="75 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="1036731" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0246-01">75 Pa. 246</a>; Tanner v. Oil Creek R. R.

Defendant admits the store where the boy worked was in charge of Giunta as manager. While the latter’s duties were indefinitely described (defendant denies Giunta had any authority to employ), he was a manager in control. His duties involved a general direction of its business, the exercise of judgment or discretion in sales and purchases, and responsibility for its general upkeep and welfare. These duties would ordinarily raise an implied authority in such person to employ the assistance necessary to successfully conduct the business, plaintiff’s son being in that class: 31 Cyc. 1192 (see note 17). The <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>public had a right to believe the boy was in defendant’s employ when, for a period of two years, he continuously delivered goods to it. Defendant could scarcely evade liability for the reasons here given if one of these customers had sued because of some wrongful act committed by the boy in the course of delivering fruit or produce to his residence. The acts of Giunta were those of a vice-principal within an apparent scope of authority, and bind the defendant, to say nothing of ratification shown by the testimony. The question of delegation of authority, express or implied, was for the jury <em>• </em>it was not for the court as a matter of law. The boy was employed in violation of a statute forbidding the employment of persons under the age of fourteen years. The employment of the child in violation of the act constitutes negligence per se. The employer is liable in damages for any injuries naturally or probably occurring during the course of employment regardless of negligence (Krutlies v. Bulls Head Goal Co., <a href="/pa/249/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="249 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="1013516" data-case-paths="/pa/249/0162-01">249 Pa. 162</a>, 166); this liability exists where the employment is by an agent acting within the scope of his authority, express or implied, though the employer might not be criminally liable where the hiring is under an implied authority (Miller v.
