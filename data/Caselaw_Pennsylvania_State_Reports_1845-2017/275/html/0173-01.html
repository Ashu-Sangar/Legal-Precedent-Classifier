In an action against a railroad company for injuries suffered at a grade-crossing in a collision between an automobile truck and a train, the ease is for the jury where plaintiff’s evidence showed that he had stopped at a point 12% feet from the nearest main track, which was the usual place of stopping, that, hearing and seeing nothing, he approached at the rate of two miles an hour towards the track, that the weather was foggy, that, as he approached the track, the view was temporarily obstructed by a pile of ties and a box car on a siding, and that the rear end of the truck Was struck by the train.</p>

    <p id="b196-12" data-blocks='[["BL_196.13",196,[275,1705,1150,476]]]'>The scene of the collision was a grade crossing, familiar to both plaintiff and the driver; they, knowing the train was about due, slowly approached the crossing and stopped 12% feet from the nearest rail of the main track, the railroad at this point consisting of a siding and one track. The highway crossed the railroad at an angle, about two hundred feet from a bend in the latter, this curve somewhat limiting the view of approaching trains.</p>

Neither seeing nor hearing anything, they started forward at about two miles an hour, — all that low gear and a heavily loaded truck, weighing ten ’tons, would permit, — and, when they were crossing the main track, the rear end of the truck was struck by the train. Plaintiff testified that the truck was stopped at the place where it was customary for travelers to stop, look and listen before crossing.</p>
