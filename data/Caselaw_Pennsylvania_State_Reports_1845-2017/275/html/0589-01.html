Van Blunk died on April 18, 1918, leaving a will, by the third paragraph of which he provided: ‘I give and devise unto my niece, Catharine Welbank, wife of Charles Welbank, her heirs and assigns forever, for her sole and separate use, free and discharged from any and all control of her said husband, and of any curtesy or other interest therein on the <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>part of her said husband, my house and lot of ground No. 1623 South Broad Street, Philadelphia......In event of my selling or disposing of my said house in my lifetime, then, in lieu thereof, I give and bequeath unto my said niece, absolutely, a sum equal to the price or sum for which I shall have sold or disposed of it.’</p>

The devise contained in the will of the testator is to 'Catharine Welbank, wife of Charles Welbank, her heirs and assigns forever, for her sole and separate use, free and discharged from any and all control of her said husband and of any curtesy or other interest therein on the part of her said husband,’ which are apt words for the creation of a married woman’s sole and separate use [trust1]. Mr. Patterson called attention to the further provision of the third paragraph, in which the testator, in case he should sell this real estate in his lifetime, bequeathed to Mrs. Welbank, absolutely, a sum equal to the price received, [also to] certain other provisions in the will for devisee’s benefit, which are absolute in their nature......[and] argued that, from the whole tenor of the will, the testator did not intend to subject this devise to a trust by the mere employment of the technical words ‘sole and separate use.’ [The court below thought otherwise, saying, particularly as to the matter in the third paragraph, above referred to:] It need only be added that the bequest to Mrs. Welbank of <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>the proceeds of sale,, if such sale were made by the testator himself, has manifestly no effect upon the specific devise of the property where no such sale has been made, and the absence of an appointment of a trustee for Mrs. Welbank is immaterial, for it is the duty of the court to protect her separate use by appointing a trustee as was done in this case.------Clearly the trust continues during the coverture of Mrs. Welbank, and the fund must be retained by the accountant as her trustee.”</p>
