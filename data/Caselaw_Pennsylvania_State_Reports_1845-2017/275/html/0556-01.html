Ryan, Daniel Wade, Thomas Reilly, Daniel G. Murphy and John J. Green as an unincorporated association operating under the name of “Ryan Campaign Committee” to recover the amount alleged to be <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>due for printing and stationery furnished the committee. When the case came on for trial, plaintiff, with leave of court, entered a discontinuance as to the defendant Green, and the case was continued. When reached for trial a second time, the jury was sworn against the four remaining defendants, and thereupon, before plaintiff opened its case, defendants’ counsel moved the court to dismiss the suit and to render judgment for defendants on the ground that the discontinuance entered as to Green operated as a release and discharge of the four other defendants. Without giving plaintiff opportunity to present its proofs, the trial judge granted the motion to dismiss and entered judgment for defendants, from which judgment plaintiff has appealed, urging that there was no legal warrant for the court’s action.</p>

The methods available to a defendant to get rid of a suit brought against him without full trial are by an affidavit of defense by way of demurrer, by motion for nonsuit at the close of plaintiff’s evidence, or by a point for binding instructions when the proofs on both sides are closed, and possibly by a demand for an offer from plaintiff covering his entire case at the beginning of the trial and a ruling thereon, but even in this day, when there is a somewhat insistent demand for greater celerity in court proceedings, no such short cut to disposition of a case without giving plaintiff opportunity to offer his proofs, can be sanctioned. Even under defendants’ own theory that the action was joint and that a discontinuance as to one defendant worked a discharge as to the others, a proper determination could not be reached until the reason for the discontinuance was known. It might well be that the name of the defendant as to whom the discontinuance was granted was brought into the action by mistake. Where a suit is brought against a number of defendants jointly there is nothing to prevent the plaintiff from discon<a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>tinning as to one, amending Ms pleadings and proceeding against the remaining parties jointly.

In the case at bar, appellant was not even permitted to make an offer. Neither a nonsuit nor a direction of a verdict for t'he defendant nor a demurrer to evidence is proper before the plaintiff has closed his case: Abbott’s Civil Jury Trials (3d ed.) 598. Bastian v.

Speaking of this procedure, we said: “This action of the court was wholly unwarranted......Meager as the testimony is, on account of the unwarranted action of the learned judge in summarily terminating the trial before the plaintiff had either time or opportunity of developing his case, there is quite enough in it to carry the case to the jury.” In reversing the judgment and remitting the record, we did so “for the purpose of a full and fair trial.” Abbotts Alderney Dairies v. Phila. Rapid Transit Co., <a href="/pa-super/62/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="62 Pa. Super. 343" data-case-ids="455253" data-case-paths="/pa-super/62/0343-01">62 Pa. Superior Ct. 343</a>, bears on the question we are considering. In that case, the driver of the wagon which had been in collision with defendant’s car was called as the first witness for plaintiff. At the conclusion of his evidence, which was given in a somewhat obscure manner, a second witness was called, whereupon the court ruled that it would not hear any further testimony because, on the evidence of the driver, the case showed contributory negligence and a nonsuit was en<a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>tered. In reversing the judgment, the Superior Court said: “The nonsuit could only be entered after tbe plaintiff had bad an opportunity to introduce its evidence and it bad then appeared that this was not sucb evidence as in law is sufficient to maintain tbe action. Tbe first section of tbe Act of March 11,1875, P. L. 6, clearly implies that the plaintiff shall be first beard through bis witnesses before a nonsuit for lack of evidence is granted. Under any other application of tbe statute, plaintiff might be thrown out of court when be bad testimony available with which to make out a prima facie case.” If a nonsuit cannot be entered against a plaintiff until after be has bad an opportunity to introduce all bis evidence, for much stronger reason a judgment cannot be.</p>
