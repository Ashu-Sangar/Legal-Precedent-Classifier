In the absence of the items of information to which we have called attention, and particularly in default of any specific averment as to the value of the stock plaintiff received for his $2,000, there is no way to estimate the alleged loss to plaintiff. This is a defect, but, — since the Practice Act of May 14, 1915, P. L. 483, — not of a character to warrant the entry of judgment against the pleader, as the statement of claim indicates that plaintiff seeks to recover a loss incurred by him, through defendant’s false representations, in paying $2,000, for something of less value. Under these circumstances, the latter should have taken a rule for a more specific statement, and, upon the rule being made absolute, if plaintiff failed to comply with the court’s order in that regard, defendant should have made a motion for non pros.
