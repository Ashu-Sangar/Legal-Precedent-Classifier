That did not constitute the government, nor represent it, so as to make its contract with defendant a contract with the United States; and, generally, the former was not immune from liability before, state <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>courts because it was an arm of tbe government, but was subject to process tbe same as any foreign corporation doing business in Pennsylvania, and not immune from civil action here, though the federal courts may have concurrent jurisdiction.

United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation and the United States of America, No. 328 October Term, 1921, 42 U. S. Sup. Ct. 386, where, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Holmes, it is held the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation was not an arm of the government, but a business corporation, organized under the laws of the District of Columbia, with a capacity to sue and be sued. Such status was not affected by the fact that the United States owned all the stock of such corporation, nor was immunity thrown around it because enormous powers were ultimately conferred on the fleet corporation. See Haines et al. v. Lone Star Shipbuilding Co., etc., <a href="/pa/268/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="268 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="1061607" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0092-01">268 Pa. 92</a>.

    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[280,554,1154,749]]]'>Appellant’s answers to the interrogatories are chiefly legal conclusions, based on what was decided in <a href="/pa/268/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="268 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="1061607" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0092-01">268 Pa. 92</a>, rather than a statement of facts in reply to questions. At no place is there an unequivocal answer to questions put. Plaintiff was entitled to as full and specific answers as if affiant had been on the witness stand. Interrogatories are issued to elicit facts. These answers are evasive, giving but a touch of facts here and there, intentionally skipping the material parts necessary to the inquiry. In many instances a direct answer could have been given, but it is clear the framer of the answer did not intend to make it direct, seeing fit rather to swing responsibility around the alleged immunity feature of the garnishee.</p>
    <p id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.6",286,[278,1314,1155,641]]]'>The answers to the fifth and sixth interrogatories require more specific attention, as the last of the questions involved is predicated on these answers. The replies are to the effect that it did not have in its possession any money due defendant within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and, if it did have, it was due under a contract for work to be performed in the State of Texas; that, subsequently, a proceeding in equity, wherein defendant and garnishee had been parties, terminated on the 22d of April, 1919, through an arrangement whereby the garnishee was to pay the creditors of defendant who were parties to that equity proceeding.</p>

The executive offices of garnishee company were located in Philadelphia, and it is not questioned this company was legally doing business in this State. So we have an attachment of money due to a defendant from a garnishee, having its principal place of business within this State, payable within this State, though both garnishee and defendant are foreign corporations. Both are brought within the jurisdiction of our courts as to person and subject-matt'er of attachment. The visible locus of a debt is the residence of the debtor, and the tribunal of that residence may exercise jurisdiction over it in rem: Story’s Conflict of Law, sections 549 and 550; Andrews v.

There is nothing in the answer to justify the court in holding plaintiff was precluded from instituting suit because of this action in the State of Texas, though it appears defendant and garnishee had been parties thereto. It terminated April 22, 1919, through some arrangement whereby garnishee was to pay certain creditors named in that case. We do not know whether the payment included the total sum due from garnishee to defendant or if that sum has been paid. There is no denial here that garnishee has a sum of money in its hands sufficient to pay plaintiff, nor assertion that it does not have other money due defendant in addition to that to be paid under the Texas suit.</p>
