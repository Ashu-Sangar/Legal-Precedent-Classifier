To plaintiff’s statement1 of claim defendant filed a demurring affidavit of defense, upon which the trial court entered judgment in his favor; plaintiff appeals.</p>

Two questions arise out of the contract as pleaded; first, is it within the statute of frauds of the State of New York; second, was a definite, completed, enforceable contract entered into, or was what transpired between the parties only negotiations looking toward a contract? The answer to both <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>these propositions by the common pleas was adverse to plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b115-4" data-blocks='[["BL_115.5",115,[139,442,1153,1955]],["BL_116.1",116,[281,344,1153,1946]]]'>The statement of claim sets forth that plaintiff was a lumberman of experience and defendant the owner of a large tract of forest lands, comprising about twenty-five thousand acres; that the parties plaintiff and defendant had prior negotiations concerning the sale of the lands, resulting in a written agreement to effect that purpose, terminated, however, by the expiration of the time limit fixed in it, which defendant refused to extend. The statement goes on to recite that after the termination of the written agreement, defendant urged plaintiff to undertake the development of the lands, pursuant to which request they met’ in the City of Buffalo on April 19, 1919. At this meeting, defendant submitted to plaintiff a written prospectus, made part of the statement of claim, containing a description of the lands and a proposition for the organization of a corporation to develop them. This prospectus recited the intention to organize the corporation “to acquire some 25,000 acres of hardwood forests” belonging to defendant, with an estimate of the timber thereon and of its value. It set forth that it was proposed to develop to the heart of the property a railroad twenty-two miles long, and to construct sawmills and other plants for the manufacture of the timber; to finance the enterprise the prospectus outlined a plan for an issue of $1,000,000 7 <em>% </em>cumulative preferred stock and $2,000,000 in common stock in payment for the property. After stating that this prospectus was submitted by defendant to plaintiff, the statement proceeds with the averment that at that time, on April 19, 1919, it was “orally agreed by and between plaintiff and defendant that defendant <em>would join </em>in a joint adventure with the plaintiff, to effectuate the sale of the forest products situate upon the hereinbefore described lands and set forth in the said written prospectus submitted by the defendant, either in the open market or to third parties and <em>would join </em>in whatever development of the <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>property should become necessary to carry out this purpose; the lands hereinbefore described the defendant orally promised and agreed should be used and developed for the best interests and purposes of the said joint adventure.” This oral understanding manifestly contemplated a development as outlined in the prospectus, through a corporation to be organized to acquire the lands which were to be conveyed to it and to be paid for as the prospectus provided, by the issue of common and preferred stock. After the matter above quoted, the statement proceeds with the allegation, that “plaintiff, relying upon the said agreement of the defendant,” orally agreed to use his skill and experience for the purpose of accomplishing the development of the property and the sale of the forest products thereon, and sets forth that the sums realized from the joint adventure should be distributed, $1,600,000 to defendant, and all further sums, accruing after deducting necessary expenses, to be divided equally between plaintiff and defendant. The statement further recites that it was orally agreed that', to “carry out the <em>development of the lands” </em>and effectuate the sale of the forest products, a corporation should be organized “upon such a basis of division of the common and preferred stock” as that the defendant should receive $800,000 of preferred stock, and $800,000 to be derived from a proposed bond issue to be made by the corporation, and that plaintiff and defendant were each to receive one-half of the common stock of the corporation (without stating what was to be the amount of the common stock unless it is to be inferred that it was to be the amount fixed in the prospectus, $2,000,000) and that after the formation of the corporation the parties were to cooperate in the placing of bonds of the corporation to the amount of $1,000,000. It is alleged that the division of the common stock fixes the right of the parties to share equally in the profits of the joint adventure.</p>

This is further evidenced by a letter, made part of the statement of claim, written on April 21, 1919, two days after the meeting in Buffalo, by defendant to plaintiff’s attorney, in which copies of the prospectus were enclosed, with the request for any further suggestion relative to it, wherein it was stated that a telegram had been received from third parties, asking for an interview in regard to the timber tract, to which defendant replied that he was <em>“negotiating </em>with other parties.” The statement of claim follows the recounting of what took place at the interview in Buffalo, with the averment1 that defendant had caused articles of incorporation for a new company to be prepared, which were forwarded to plaintiff and his attorney for execution. These articles of incorporation are attached to the statement of claim, made part of it and show the main purposes for which the corporation was to be formed, to be to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire lands and timber lands. It is set forth in the statement that it was agreed plaintiff should employ an engineer and go upon the property in company with defendant to work out1 the best means of transportation of the products of the proposed corporation to market, either by the construction of a railroad or a flume, and that plaintiff employed an engineer and with defendant proceeded to an examination of the property to ascertain the best means of transportation. It is stated that plaintiff, relying upon the agreement entered into on April 19th “and the purposes expressed in the articles of incorporation of the proposed corporation duly executed and accepted by the plaintiff as aforesaid” and to carry out the purposes of the joint adventure, expended money and time in placing the forest products situate upon the property of defendant before prospective purchasers for "the purpose of “securing a market for the said products when said property should be developed,” and as a result that ar<a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>rangements were made for the sale of the pulp wood on the property and of the hardwood at certain prices mentioned, “said sales to be contingent! upon the development of the said property and means of transportation by the new corporation” in accordance with the terms and conditions of the covenants and agreements between the parties; that, at a subsequent meeting, plaintiff was ready and willing to carry out his agreement, to complete the organization of the company, and to cooperate with defendant in placing the bonds, to begin the work of development of the property and to put the products thereon upon the market but that, upon request of defendant to proceed with the organization of the corporation, the placing of its bonds, the development of the property and “the sale and delivery of the soft1 and hard woods thereon,” defendant refused to carry out the terms of the agreement.</p>

In their printed brief, appellant’s counsel do not limit consideration to the cases cited, but urge that all decisions of the courts of the State of New York bearing on the question shall be considered.</p>

Our study of the New York cases construing its statute of frauds, leads us to the conclusion that appellee’s position is the correct one on this feature of the case. Speaking of the New York statute in Hagedorn v. Lang, <a href="/ad/34/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="34 A.D. 117" data-case-ids="4625075" data-case-paths="/ad/34/0117-01">34 N. Y. App. Div. 117</a>, 118, it was said: “The purpose of the statute of frauds is sufficiently indicated by its title. It is a statute against frauds. It was designed to prevent litigation over oral agreements, where the terms are always dependent upon the uncertain and varying memory of witnesses. This evil was to be remedied by the reduction of the terms of the contract to writing, so that the parties might not misunderstand the particulars of the contract which they were making; that no man might be induced to enter a court of justice to vex the peace of his opponent without clear and definite evidence of the terms of the contract which form the ground of action, equally accessible to both parties and to the court; and, that <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>perjury might not be invited to sustain a claim which never had any real existence.”</p>
    <p id="b121-5" data-blocks='[["BL_121.4",121,[157,427,1160,1301]]]'>The court below correctly distinguished between oral agreements to form partnerships to deal in lands, not within the statute, and oral agreements affecting lands, when it said: “However, a partnership agreement not within the statute of frauds, because by it no estate or. interest in lands is created, granted or assigned, must not be confused with such an agreement which does involve the creation, granting or assigning of such an estate or interest,” and pointed out the difference in the two classes of contracts as expressed in the language of Pounds v. Egbert, <a href="/nys/102/1079-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="117 A.D. 756" data-case-ids="3447698,5265588" data-case-paths="/nys/102/1079-01,/ad/117/0756-01">117 N. Y. App. Div. 756</a>, where it was said: “An agreement to form a copartnership to deal in lands does not, therefore, involve any element violative of the statute of frauds; but if such agreement also provides for a conveyance of real property from one partner to another or to the copartnership, it then provides for the creation of an estate or interest in lands and comes directly within the statute of frauds. The ground upon which partnership agreements to deal in land have been sustained, as well as the plain words of the statute, requires the conclusion that the mere fact that an agreement happens to provide for a copartnership will not save it from the statute of frauds if it also attempts to create, grant or assign an estate or interest in lands.”</p>

It would be nugatory if it could be subverted by oral testimony that an agreement had been entered into to convey land to a corporation which the court would enforce, whereas it would not enforce such a contract between individuals. We agree with the observation of the court below, “The defendant was to part with his land or an interest therein for the benefit of plaintiff to the extent he was to share in the profits and by the agreement an interest in the land passed to plaintiff from the defendant, or else nothing passed or was acquired by the plaintiff on which he could found a demand.” “An agreement to place the title to property <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>which one party owns, in a partnership which was to be formed in order to develop the land and sell it at a profit, is for the sale of the land and within the statute”: Rowley, Modern Law of Partnership, section 218, p. 227.</p>

The court of last resort in New York held in Green v. Armstrong, <a href="/denio/1/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="1 Denio 550" data-case-ids="483933" data-case-paths="/denio/1/0550-01">1 Denio 550</a> (16 New York Common Law Reports 890) : “An agreement for the sale of growing trees, with a right to enter on the land at a future time and remove them, is a contract for the sale of an interest in lands, and to be valid must be in writing.” In that case, the court said: “By the statute, a contract for the sale of ‘any interest in lands’ is void unless in writing. The word ‘land’ is comprehensive in its import and includes many things besides the earth we tread on, as waters, grass, stones, buildings, fences, trees and the like; for all these may be conveyed by the general designation of land......Standing trees are therefore part and parcel of the land in which they are rooted, and as such are real property......It is not material and does not affect the principle that the subject' of the sale will be personal property when transferred to the purchaser. If, when sold, it is, in the hands of a seller, a part of the land itself, the contract is within the statute. These trees were part of the defendant’s land and not his personal chattels. The contract for their sale and transfer, being by parol, was therefore void.” A contract for standing timber on a tract of land to be taken off at discretion as to time is an interest in land and within the statute of frauds and perjuries, the transmission of which must be by writing: Pattison’s App., <a href="/pa/61/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="61 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="428574" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0294-01">61 Pa. 294</a>; McClintock’s App., <a href="/pa/71/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="71 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1031280" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0365-01">71 Pa. 365</a>; Mahan v.

To our minds, they convey the clear impression that defendant’s lands were to be conveyed to the corporation; that being so, the oral agreement to so convey them is indisputably within the statute. The articles of incorporation not only show that the defendant1 thought the corporation to be created was to acquire his lands but that the plaintiff signed them, which is persuasive at least to the conclusion that he thought the lands were to be conveyed to the corporation.</p>

The statement does not aver that plaintiff and defendant had entered into a joint adventure, but that they “would join” therein, thus giving the idea not of an agreement consummated but of one subsequently to be reached. There is no allegation in the statement that1 they intended the agreement to be operative before the execution of the articles of incorporation. The prospectus shows that1 what was contemplated was the acquiring by the corporation of defendant’s lands. This prospectus was in the minds of the parties at the time of their meeting on April 19th, when the contract is alleged to have been entered into, and subsequent thereto, as appears by the letter of April 21st, asking for suggestions relative to it. As before stated, this letter shows <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>that what was transpiring between the parties was negotiations on the basis of the prospectus, not a completed contract; when defendant came to take the first step toward reducing the negotiations to certainty, he did it by preparing the articles of incorporation for the company, whose purpose was “to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire” his lands.</p>

To produce this effect, it must be shown by the acts or declarations of the parties that they intended the agreement1 to be operative before execution and without regard to the writing.” “In order that a contract may be enforceable the promise or the agreement of the parties to it must be certain and explicit, so that their full intention may be ascertained to a reasonable degree of certainty. Their agreement must be neither vague nor indefinite, and, if thus defective, parol proof cannot be resorted to. The contract must be certain and unequivocal in its essential terms either within itself or by reference to some other agreement or matter. In addition to a definite promise, the subject-matter of the agreement must be expressed in such terms that it can be asserted with reasonable certainty. A contract which is so uncertain in respect of it's subject-matter that it neither identifies the thing by describing it, nor furnishes any data by which certainty of identification can be obtained, is unenforceable...... Courts can neither specifically enforce contracts nor award substantial damages for their breach when they are wanting in certainty”: 6 Ruling Case Law 644.
