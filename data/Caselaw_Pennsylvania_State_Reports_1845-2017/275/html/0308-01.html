    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.8",332,[271,546,1146,475]]]'>Plaintiffs, as devisees of John S. Morrison, and defendant, as executor and trustee of the estate of Adié A. Stevens, deceased, were tenants in common of certain real estate; the former filed this bill in equity for partition thereof, but not, as apparently the court below mistakingly thought at the time it filed its adjudication, for an accounting of the income therefrom also. The decree awards partition, but says nothing on the subject of an accounting; defendant alone appeals.</p>
    <p id="b332-5" data-blocks='[["BL_332.9",332,[268,1032,1152,1349]],["BL_333.1",333,[183,311,1149,481]]]'>The statement of questions involved, which limits the matters to be. considered by this court, (Garvey v. Thompson, <a href="/pa/268/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="268 Pa. 353" data-case-ids="1061537" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0353-01">268 Pa. 353</a>), as appellant recognizes in his argument, proposes only four questions: (1) “Where accounting is denied, should not such finding be included in decree of court?” Possibly this was not done because on reflection it was clear the bill did not pray for such an accounting as the court below first thought, and appellant seems still to think, was desired. After reciting certain agreements between plaintiffs and defendant’s testator, dated May 18, 1893, and July 9, 1895,— more specifically referred to in considering the last claim made by appellant, — the bill avers that the sum of $25,-072.89 is shown thereby to be “a charge [on the lands] in favor of [appellees as] said John S. Morrison’s heirs, for moneys advanced by him and them on said lands,” and then prays only that “a just and equitable settlement and adjustment be had of the moneys due the plaintiff herein ; and that the same may be decreed to be secured in and paid out of the said lands on a just and equitable basis.” No accounting is sought; in this court plaintiffs expressly disclaim all right thereto (a disavowal binding on them in the present and all future proceedings: Garber v. Doersom, <a href="/pa/117/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="117 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="555781" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0162-01">117 Pa. 162</a>; Donnelly v.

Under such circumstances there was no occasion for inserting in the decree a provision denying the right to an account.</p>
    <p id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[182,802,1154,1130]]]'>(2 and 3) Appellant claims that the bill should be dismissed for want of proper parties, because the Sugar Run Coal Mining Company was not joined in the proceedings, it being a lessee of the lands, under a lease made by Mr. Stevens only, after the death of Mr. Morrison, but which it is alleged plaintiffs are estopped from repudiating. This contention we cannot sustain. While under some circumstances a tenant for a long term of years may be a proper party to partition proceedings, he is not a necessary party in the sense that a failure to join him will defeat the action: Duke v. Hague, <a href="/pa/107/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="107 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="8856267" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0057-01">107 Pa. 57</a>. If, as appellant avers, the lease is binding on all the owners, the partition is in effect of the estate in remainder; the tenant, being in possession of the entire property under a claim of exclusive right thereto, is not a tenant in common with anybody, and hence its interest cannot be parted or divided: Sieders v. Giles, <a href="/pa/141/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="141 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="974881" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0093-01">141 Pa. 93</a>, 95; 30 Cyc. 179. So far as it is concerned, everybody must take notice of its rights, which, if assailed, can be asserted or defended in a proceeding to which it is a party.</p>

This of course cannot be so. Where a tenant’s claim affects only some of the owners, as in Duke v. Hague, <a href="/pa/107/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="107 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="8856267" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0057-01">supra,</a> he may, if he has a long term, have a real interest in the proceedings; for his tenancy would <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>be determined if the property was allotted to some one else than his lessors, or was sold by decree of conrt: Caveny v.

Morrison in his lifetime on account of the purchase and improvement of the lands [the sum of $25,072.89, stipulate]......that the royalties from the coal mines [on the properties] and any income derived from said lands” shall be applied to the payment of the outside indebtedness and, after this is satisfied, “one-third [shall be paid] to the Morrison heirs in liquidation of the sum of $25,072.89; one-third t'o A. A. Stevens as profit, and one-third to the Morrison heirs as profit, [and after the sum of $25,072.89 is liquidated] one-half [shall be paid] to the Morrison heirs, and one-half to A. A. Stevens.” The agreements do not specify the length of time they <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>are to continue in force, and relate, not to the properties themselves, but only tc “the royalties from the coal mines” and the “income derived from said lands.” If the parties had meant the properties should be held undivided until all the debts, including the $25,072.89, had been paid, it would have been easy to have said so; that they did not say so, is potent evidence this was not their intention.</p>
    <p id="b335-3" data-blocks='[["BL_335.4",335,[143,750,1155,968]]]'>It is true that owners may agree to postpone the time for a division of any land held in common, if their agreement does not violate any law or public policy; but as this would pro tanto prevent free alienation, which is a favorite policy of this Commonwealth, the intention so to do must be clearly made to appear. Here it is not. On the contrary, all that is specified in the agreements will be fully met by simply treating them as stipulating for the distribution of the royalties and income so long as the properties are held in common. Indeed, if appellant’s contention is given its logical effect, the agreements provide for an illegal perpetuity; for they specify, that, after the $25,072.89 is paid, an equal division of the income shall be made between plaintiffs and defendant, without limitation of time, exactly as they do for the payment of the outside indebtedness and thereafter for a division into thirds, one thereof to be applied on account of the $25,072.89.</p>
