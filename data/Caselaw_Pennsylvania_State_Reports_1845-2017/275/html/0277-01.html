An appearance was entered six days later, and nothing further done until October 26,1914, when, on motion, the record was amended to read “Sadie Mumma, administratrix of Enos B. Mumma, deceased,” instead of “Sadie Mumma.” On the same day plaintiff’s statement was filed. June 12, 1916, plaintiff ruled defendant to plead, which was done three years later, October 31, 1919. Plaintiff’s statement clearly brought the action under the Federal Employer’s Liability Act of April 22,1908, and its amendments.</p>

When the case was instituted, without statement filed, it did not disclose what defendant would be called upon to answer. That could only appear when the statement was filed. The mere name of the plaintiff did not give any intimation as to the cause of suit, and, unless defendant took steps to force a statement to be filed, it would remain in ignorance of what the charge might be, except that it was one in trespass. Had this suit been instituted in the <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>name to .which it was amended, defendant would have been none the wiser as to the cause of action. It might have been a common law action for matters in Pennsylvania, or a suit under the New Jersey statutes. But the sufficient fact is, defendant was duly brought into court, there to hold itself in readiness to reply to a cause of action that would be disclosed in a statement to be filed. It took no steps to clear the record or inform itself of the difficulty.

There was no request or motion to transcribe the testimony and file the charge of record; consequently all the assignments of error based thereon, and the points covering the statute of limitations, cannot be considered. Likewise the answers to the points dealing with the second question need not be considered.</p>

He was killed while traveling through a cut, by a rock that projected from the side to within six inches of the cab window. There is no question but this was the cause of the death, as portions of his hair were found on the edge of the rock immediately after the accident. It was negligence for the company to have its roadbed thus constructed. These men should have a reasonably safe place in which to work, inasmuch as it is their duty to lean out of cab windows to observe the track ahead of them. “It is only in a clear case the question of assumption of risk is one of law for the court; where there is doubt as to the facts, or as to inferences to be drawn from them, it is for the jury. The burden of proof as to the assumption of risk is on the defendant”: Dutrey, Administratrix, v. Phila. &amp; R. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/265/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="265 Pa. 215" data-case-ids="1051891" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0215-01">265 Pa. 215</a>, 220. This employee assumed all the risks ordinarily incident to his employment, including risks which are obvious and fully known to the employee, and appreciated by him, or so plainly observable he must <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>be presumed to know them, but he is not obliged to use even ordinary care to discover dangerous defects, as knowledge will not be imputed to him unless they are plainly observable: McIntire v. St. Louis &amp; S. T. Ry. Co., 227 S.W. (Mo.) 1047, 1054.</p>
    <p id="b306-4" data-blocks='[["BL_306.4",306,[261,622,1153,1505]]]'>On the question of assumption of-risk, cases will be of little value except as they may lay down general principles. We must turn to the facts, and from them learn whether they are brought within the rule stated by the Supreme Court of the United States. This man, in a number of years, had passed through the cut about thirteen times in daylight, his train traveling rapidly. A projection of this character, which undeniably could be seen, is not likely to have impressed his mind with any specific danger, for it is not clear his attention was directed to the point during any of these trips; he may not have noticed it, or, at night, may not have known its exact location; many other duties within the engine may have required his attention when passing this point. He could not well determine its distance from the cab, running at a speed of thirty miles an hour; so, whether it was such an obvious defect as should have been known by ordinary observation must be for the jury. On this point a witness testified that you could not tell at night, sitting on the right side of the engine, going at a speed of twenty-five to thirty miles an hour, how close the rocks projected. He might be able to see that they were close, but “it is like a panorama, passing through that fast. It is just a blur. You could not tell whether you were eight or ten inches or eight or ten feet” from the rocks. Further, he would not, in the ordinary discharge of his duties, necessarily know that this projection was so close to his cab.</p>
