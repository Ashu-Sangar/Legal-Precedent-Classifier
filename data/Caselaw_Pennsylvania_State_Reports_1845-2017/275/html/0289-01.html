This duty is somewhat similar to the obligations resting on township authorities of the second class, and it is likewise the rule governing boroughs and cities when the highways go through thinly settled parts thereof.

This applies to highways existing at the time the township is created one of the first class. Such township is not compelled to repair all walks built under ordinance or adopted. The legislature did not intend, in speaking of sidewalks, that all paths along the miles and miles of highways were to be kept in repair by the supervisors or commissioners. Every path along a highway in these rural districts cannot be considered a sidewalk. To impose the duty of repair and maintenance there must be a change from an ordinary dirt road to an improved way, not necessarily coming within what we have frequently defined as improved highway, but it should show a higher standard of construction than that of an ordinary dirt, gravel or cinder path. Many sidewalks exist along roads immediately adjoining cities and towns, in front <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>of farms or country homes, with large grounds surrounding, which were constructed simply to make the ground even or level in front of the properties. These can hardly be termed sidewalks in the sense in which that term is used in the act, even if a wooden or stone curb is employed to keep the path from falling away.</p>
    <p id="b315-3" data-blocks='[["BL_315.4",315,[157,663,1155,1242]]]'>At the time defendant was thus created, this highway, known as Courtright Street, was in use; there was a dirt walk along the side; it was not such a sidewalk as the legislature had in view when imposing duties in relation thereto on townships as to the care and maintenance of sidewalks, nor was it substantially within the terms of the act; the township was not compelled to keep the way in a fairly smooth and safe condition. Township supervisors or commissioners are under no obligation to construct footpaths; nor can they be charged with negligence in permitting other parties to construct such side-paths : Siegler v. Mellinger, <a href="/pa/203/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="203 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="994732" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0256-01">203 Pa. 256</a>,259. To further impose liability on the township for failure to keep such walks clear of ice and snow would be out of all reason, even though the walks were built of wood, brick or other solid material; the rules of law governing cities as to snow and ice on the streets do not apply to townships. Liability can be fixed only by pointing to some act of assembly, or some duty at common law resting on them, which has been violated. This has not been done here; a dirt sidewalk is not such as the legislature intended should be repaired under penalty of damages for injuries from neglect.</p>
    <p id="b315-4" data-blocks='[["BL_315.5",315,[162,1915,1153,263]]]'>We must not confuse the duty here outlined with accidents occurring on a slippery highway from the absence of guard rails or similar conditions (Winegardner v.

In this respect it was not unlike almost every other road in the-rural districts after a frost and constant rains. It would be laying too heavy a burden upon townships to hold them responsible for the swampy and miry conditions of the roads at such times, owing principally t! the character of the soil. If its condition is the result of the weather, and the nature of the soil, and not to the neglect of the township in keeping it in repair, we see no reason why the township should be held responsible for an accident, such as we have in this case”: Brendlinger v. New Hanover Twp., <a href="/pa/148/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="148 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="981803" data-case-paths="/pa/148/0093-01">148 Pa. 93</a>, 95, 96. This rule applies to the entire width of the highway, except where there is an act recognizing a different sort of way along the side. As to this latter, to create an additional burden on the township (care of sidewalks), the duty must be pointed out and the sidewalk must be one within contemplation of the law.</p>
