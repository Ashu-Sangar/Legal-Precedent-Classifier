        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nPlaintiff sued defendant to recover damages for injury to his real and personal property, caused, as he alleges, by the defendant municipality unlawfully flooding his store with rain water. The verdict was for plaintiff, who appeals from a judgment entered for defendant non obstante veredicto. Under such circumstances \u201call the evidence and inferences therefrom favorable to plaintiff must be taken as true, and all unfavorable to him, if depending solely upon testimony, must be rejected\u201d: Fuller v. Stewart Coal Co., 268 Pa. 328; Keck v. Pittsburgh, etc., Ry. Co., 271 Pa. 479. In this light we shall state the evidence.\nPlaintiff was the owner of a property situated at the northwest corner of Borough Line and Bluff Streets in the defendant city. The division line between the city and Union Township was in Borough Line Street, the whole of which, because of a working agreement between them, the township agreed to keep in repair from Bluff Street to Smithfield Street, which included the part in front of plaintiff\u2019s property. Opposite Smithfield Street is an unnamed public road of the township, the natural drainage of which was across Borough Line Street into and along Smithfield Street, within the city limits. Evidently for the purpose of enabling it to escape the duty of properly caring for this water, the street commissioner of the city placed an obstruction on the township side of Borough Line Street at its intersection with the public road. It is admitted the effect of this was to divert the water, which formerly ran down Smithfield Street, to Borough Line Street, on which, if the rainfall was not too heavy, it flowed past the front of plaintiff\u2019s property into a sewer leading to a ravine, still further to the east. The pathmaster for the road supervisors of the township removed the obstruction, causing the water to again follow its natural course down Smithfield Street; whereupon the street commissioner of the city replaced it, and threatened to have the pathmaster arrested if he tore it out again.\nPlaintiff thereupon called the attention of the mayor and council of the city to the fact that the obstruction caused an excessive amount of water to run down Borough Line Street, and part of it into his property. They visited the locality on several occasions, saw the obstruction and its effect, and entered into negotiations with the supervisors of the township, in order, if possible, to reach an amicable settlement of the difficulty. The city authorities suggested that a sewer be built at joint expense, but \u201cthe supervisors refused to have anything to do with it, claiming that the water never came that way [naturally] and that it was the city\u2019s place to take care of it.\u201d From this position they never receded; and, before anything was agreed upon, a large quantity of rain water, which normally would have passed down Smithfield Street, traveled along Borough Line Street into and upon plaintiff\u2019s property, causing the damage for which this suit was brought.\nThe court below, in its opinion on the motion for judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto, properly decided that there was ample evidence from which the jury could find, as it did, that the city authorities in legal effect ratified the act of the street commissioner; but it also held that, as the township supervisors likewise knew of the obstruction and did not cause its removal, it must be concluded, as a matter of law, they consented to the diversion of the water into Borough Line Street and hence, because of the rule laid down in Huddleston v. Borough of West Bellevue, 111 Pa. 110; Borough of West Bellevue v. Huddleston, 23 W. N. C. 240, and Robino v. North Sewickley Township, 48 Pa. Superior Ct. 68, the liability, if any, was that of the township and not of the city.\nIn this we think there was error; the cases cited distinctly state that the liability of the second municipality arises only when it \u201creceives [the water] without objection.\u201d Admittedly, every public body is liable for the resulting injury, if any, whenever it diverts rain water from its natural channel and casts it upon private property: Torrey v. City of Scranton, 133 Pa. 173. It is not denied that, but for the act of the street commissioner, plaintiff\u2019s property would have escaped being flooded; and hence, the city being responsible for the continuance, of the obstruction, she must be held liable unless it is shown the diversion was with the consent, express or implied, of the township authorities. This, however, under the facts stated, was a question for the jury. It is certain the supervisors never expressly consented to the diversion, on the contrary they steadily objected to it; and this excludes also the finding, as a matter of law, that they impliedly consented, for it is a contradiction in terms to say that by implication one necessarily agrees to that which he expressly refuses to agree to. The maxim expressum facit cessare taciturn, though usually applied in the construction of written instruments, is appropriate also to such a situation.\nAppellee urges, in addition, that the proximate cause of the injury was the breaking or stopping up of the sewer, which was built to carry off the water naturally running down Borough Line Street in front of and past plaintiff\u2019s property. The court below, at appellee\u2019s request, left to the jury, for its determination, the question as to whether or not \u201cthe injury sustained by plaintiff was caused by the breaking down or stopping up of the sewer,\u201d and this they found against the city; which cannot, since this course was taken at her request, be heard to complain here of its submission to that tribunal. Moreover;, even if the breaking or stopping up of the sewer, would ordinarily be held to be the proximate cause of such an injury, the city\u2019s liability would not necessarily be determined by solving only the question as to whether or not it did break down or stop up, for if this was due to its being improperly overloaded with rain water, then the proximate cause of the injury was the unlawful surcharge, and the city, if it caused this, would be liable for any resulting damages.\nThe judgment of the court below is reversed, and the record is remitted with directions to enter judgment for plaintiff on the verdict.",

A municipality may he held liable for an injury resulting from the acts of one of its officers, within the general line of his duty, even though performed outside of the municipal limits, if what was done was for its benefit, and if, after the city authorities knew of it, they did not object to it.\n3. Every public body is liable for a resulting injury, caused by diverting rain water from its natural channel and casting it upon private property.\n4. If, however, it only casts the rain water upon the highway of a second municipality, which receives it without objection, the first will not be held liable for such resulting injury.\n5. This rule, however, has no applicability where the second municipality does not receive the water without objection, but on the contrary steadily objects to its diversion from its natural channel.\n6.
