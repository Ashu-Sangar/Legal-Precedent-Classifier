The court below found, however, that \u201cthere was no partnership between decedent and claimant,\u201d and that \u201cdecedent was not indebted to his son.\u201d The majority of this court feels there is evidence on the record to sustain these controlling findings, and, hence, that the decree appealed from must stand.\nThe decree is affirmed; costs to be paid out of the fund for distribution.",
