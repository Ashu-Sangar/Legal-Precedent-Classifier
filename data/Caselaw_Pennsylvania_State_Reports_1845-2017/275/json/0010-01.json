        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe question on this appeal involves the fact of an alleged common law marriage. The court below, on a thorough consideration of all the proofs presented, refused to believe the testimony of appellant\u2019s mother, that she had contracted a marriage with his father; and, as a result, concluded that appellant was \u201cnot born in lawful wedlock.\u201d\nThe relevant rules of law have been so recently considered and fully discussed by us (Stevenson\u2019s Est., 272 Pa. 291; Craig\u2019s Est., 273 Pa. 530), that it would serve no useful purpose to go over them again at this time; nor do we think it necessary to review the particular facts in the present case. It is sufficient to state that, after reading the testimony, we are not convinced of error.\nThe decree is affirmed.",
