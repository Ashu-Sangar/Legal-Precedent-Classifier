We noted that such a review “encompasses both an independent review of the record, see <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Sprangle v.

At that point, the Assistant District Attorney suggested that the witness’ additional testimony could be avoided if defense counsel <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>would agree to the contents of the proffered evidence. By similar agreement the Assistant District Attorney summarized the testimony to be offered by yet another detective witness. Notes of Testimony, August 25,1981, p. 25. Thus the record does not contradict the Commonwealth’s diligence in securing appellee’s return to Pennsylvania after he was discovered in New Jersey and defense counsel was thereby prompted to make the concession noted in the record above. That record further discloses that appellee’s counsel was given access to the entire file in the District Attorney's Office before the August 25, 1981 hearing.

Common Pleas Slip Op., filed December 27, 1983, at 2-4. Appellee was ultimately sentenced on his New Jersey charges on March 1, 1981. The Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office sent a Request for Custody under the Interstate Agreement on Detainer’s Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9101-9108, to the Warden of the Cape May County Jail on March 4, 1981. On March 30th the Cape May authorities advised Philadelphia that appellee’s sentence would expire the following day. On April 1, 1981, the Philadelphia authorities took him into custody. Thus the findings of the Common Pleas judge who presided at the Rule 1100 hearing are consistent with trial counsel’s strategy in contesting the District Attorney’s motion for extension of time and they explain why counsel agreed that the detective who had knowledge of the facts did not need to testify. Trial counsel’s decision not to challenge the efforts to return appellee was a judgment reasonably calculated to aid his client and was also in accord with the demands of profes<a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>sional conduct.
