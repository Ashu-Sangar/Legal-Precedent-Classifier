A limited access highway to the bridge was proposed and named in honor of Casimir Pulaski, a great general of the Revolution, who came from Poland, that free men might build such like bridges.

That ultimate question of responsibility is not before us. What is before us is this: In what form and before what forum should that question be resolved? The question was raised by an action in mandamus brought by DRPA, contending that, by statute and contract, the Commonwealth and the Department of Transportation (PennDOT) are obligated to build the highway, and can be compelled to do so in mandamus. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, contends that, if it is ultimately obliged to build the highway, it <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>is by contract, for which only damages would follow if it failed to perform. Further, the argument goes, since the claims sound in contract and state no statutory cause of action, the Commonwealth Court lacks jurisdiction and the matter properly lies before the Board of Claims.

The Delaware River Port Authority Compact (Compact) was agreed upon in 1931 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of New Jersey to effectuate the development of the Delaware River and Port District. The Compact was first approved by the Commonwealth by the Act of June 12, 1931, P.L. 575, <em>as amended, </em>36 P.S. § 3503, and by the State of New Jersey by 1929 N.J. Laws C. 271, N.J.Stat.Ann. 32:3-1 through 32:3-18. The United States Congress gave its consent to the Compact on June 14, 1932, <a href="/citations/?q=47%20Stat.%20308" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="47 Stat. 308">47 Stat. 308</a>.
