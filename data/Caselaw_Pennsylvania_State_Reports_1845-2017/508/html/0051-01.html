Appellant and his brother, co-defendant Carlos Tirado (known as “Cobo”), sold heroin in North Philadelphia. Georgie Figueroa, the victim, owed them some money for drug purchases. Although the victim’s mother had already given appellant some $600 on behalf of her son, appellant was unsatisfied. Accordingly, he summoned the victim, through a fourteen year old drug dealer in appellant’s employ, to a house on North Orianna Street where Cobo lived with Lisa and Eddie Colon. The victim was led to the house at approximately 11:45 p.m. on August 29, 1982, entered, and went into the basement with <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>appellant, followed a few minutes later by Eddie.

After Cobo and Dice beat the victim, accusing him of “snitching” and of owing them money, appellant told Dency to kill the victim. When Dency refused, appellant slapped Dency in the face, and stabbed the victim numerous times with the kitchen knife until appellant announced he was dead. The group then returned upstairs. A short while later, the victim emerged from the basement, covered with blood. When he tried to escape by jumping out the window in the living room, Cobo grabbed him by his hair and stabbed him repeatedly with the same knife, killing him.</p>

In the instant case, not only does appellant fail to indicate the manner in which his defense “conflicted”. with co-defendants’, the record does not support an inference that he was hindered in any way from presenting whatever defense he wished to present. Neither defendant took the stand to testify. Both defense attorneys vigorously attacked the credibility of the Commonwealth witnesses. Co-defendant Cobo’s defense was that Lisa Colon named Cobo as the murderer because he had jilted her and in order to protect her brother. Appellant’s defense was that Lisa named him because she was protecting her former lover Cobo as well as her brother. While these defenses might be seen as mildly antagonistic, in important respects they complement each other. That their defenses may have been mildly antagonistic did not, in and of itself, pose such a significant possibility of prejudice to appellant in this case so as to require the court to grant the motion to sever.

Nor would we hesitate to stay an execution of sentence pending appellate disposition of the collateral conviction in appropriate circumstances. We need not decide, at this time, the circumstances that would compel this Court to vacate a sentence of death or stay its execution where the collateral conviction is overturned or appealed. We note, however, that such remedy might not be required, for instance, where the jury has found (and the record supports) the existence of several aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances. Since the jury is required to return a sentence of death where it finds “at least one aggravating circumstance ... and no mitigating circumstance”, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(c)(iv), the sentence of death would, it seems, retain its integrity even though one of the several aggravating circumstances is later declared to be invalid for some reason. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

As required by the Sentencing Code, the court instructed the jury, correctly, as to the respective burdens of proving aggravating and mitigating circumstances. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(c)(iii). The jury was next instructed that the verdict must be a sentence of death if it unanimously found at least one aggravating and no mitigating circumstance, or one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances, and that the verdict must be a sentence of life imprisonment in all other cases. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(c)(iv). Rather than orally instruct the jury as to the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances, or delineate specific circumstances that the court found to have been presented by the circumstances, the court instead provided the jurors with a written verdict form setting forth, verbatim, all of the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">9</a> The jury was then instructed to indicate on the written verdict form the circumstances it found to have been proven by the Commonwealth beyond a reasonable doubt, and those it found to have been proven by the defendants by a preponderance of the evidence, which it did. Finally, although neither defendant had presented additional evidence at the sentencing proceeding, the jury was instructed that “All the evidence from both sides, including the evidence you heard earlier during the case in chief as to aggravating or mitigating circumstances is important and proper for you to consider.” Notes of Testimony, Sentencing Hearing May 19, 1983 at 14.51.</p>

We will address these arguments seriatim. (1) The court erred in failing to specify the circumstances it deemed presented by the evidence. We find no possibility of prejudice in the court’s lack of specificity. <em>See Commonwealth v.

(2) The court erred in failing to orally instruct the jury as to aggravating and mitigating circumstances, rather than providing the jury with the written list. While we have expressed, and continue to express, a preferance for oral instructions to the jury, we find neither abuse of discretion nor possibility of prejudice to appellant from the court’s use of the neutral, unambiguous and complete written list of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <em>See Commonwealth v.

(3) The court “erred in charging the jury that they must find for the death penalty if they find at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances without advising the jury what could be considered mitigating”. Contrary to appellant’s assertion, the court did fully instruct the jury “what [circumstances] could be considered mitigating.”. (4) The court erred “in holding that the jury could not find mitigating circumstances because the defendant did not present independent evidence at the trial or at the sentencing procedure.” The record indicates that the court made no such instruction or “holding”. The court’s instructions to the jury were fair, adequate and substantially of the form and substance required by the Sentencing Code. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(c).</p>

The United States Supreme Court has recently held that where a defendant in a capital case makes a preliminary showing that his sanity is likely to be a significant factor at his sentencing, the state must provide the defendant with access to a psychiatrist whether or not he can afford to pay for the services. <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>— U.S. —, <a href="/us/470/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="105 S.

Neither attorney attempted to secure the psychiatrist’s attendance at the sentencing hearing by subpoena, nor did they obtain any reports or evaluations from him. Appellant’s counsel specifically advised the court he "[sat] here without knowing ... whether the doctor has any testimony which would benefit the defendant in this matter____” N.T. May 19, 1983 at 14.3. Under these circumstances, it does not appear that the court abused its discretion in denying appellant's request for a continuance. <em>See Commonwealth v.

I cannot condone the trial court’s failure to orally explain to the jury the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances they might find on the basis of the evidence received. Merely providing the language of the statute without the benefit of the trial court’s explanation of the meaning of the language contained therein or its relationship to the evidence properly before the jury is totally inadequate. Just as it is essential at the guilt determining phase that the jury be fully instructed as to the elements of the crimes charged, it is crucial to a valid sentencing determination that there be no misconception on the part of the jurors in interpreting the statutory definitions or in determining what ^evidence may legitimately support the finding of an aggravating or mitigating circumstance.</p>
