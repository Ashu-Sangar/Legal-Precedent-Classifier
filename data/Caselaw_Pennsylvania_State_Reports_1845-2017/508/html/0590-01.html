The salary awarded to police officers holding the rank of “detective” was $760.00 more than the salary awarded to police officers holding the rank of “regular patrolman.” The Borough honored all of the provisions of the arbitration award except that it refused to pay the $760.00 increment awarded the police officers, designated detectives and instead paid those officers the salary established for “regu<a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>lar” patrolmen. Consequently, the detective police officers, appellants herein, filed an action in mandamus in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County against the Borough, its mayor and its council members, appellees, seeking to compel compliance with the arbitration award relating to their salaries. Appellees defended the refusal to comply with the award of the arbitrators on the grounds that such award was tantamount to the “creation” of the rank of detective and that, since the rank of detective was not officially adopted by ordinance of borough council pursuant to the Borough Code of 1966, Act of February 1, 1966, P.L. 581, as amended, 53 P.S. §§ 46001-46199, the award was illegal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a>

In no way did the award “create” a rank of detective, nor could it require the “creation” of such rank or promote any police officers to some newly “created” rank. The arbitrators could just as well have phrased their award of compensation to “those patrolmen who are assigned to the Detective Division” or to “those police officers who perform investigative duties”. Instead, the arbitrators simply and logically applied the designation used within the department in its award to police officers who were already assigned to the Detective Division and were performing investigative, detective duties.

Thus, council is not permitted to determine that the increase in salary of police of fleer/detectives in this instance constitutes a promotion, for to do so would voluntarily trigger the civil service provisions of the Borough Code in order to avoid the compensation award of the arbitrators. Such a tactic would violate the letter and the spirit of Act 111 for it would allow “a public employer [to] hide behind self-imposed legal restrictions,” a practice this Court has condemned. <em>City of Washington v.

The salaries established for these levels of patrolmen (who were employed by the borough for 24 months or less) ranged from $250.00 to $1500.00 less than the salary established for "regular" patrolmen.
