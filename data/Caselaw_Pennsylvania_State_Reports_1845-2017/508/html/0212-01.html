A twenty-five foot tree branch lay across the throat which was wrapped in shirt material. After viewing the corpse, the County Coroner estimated that the victim had been dead for twelve to fifteen hours, placing the time of death between midnight and three o’clock, a.m., on July 24, 1981. An autopsy revealed that prior to death, the victim had sustained fifteen blows to the head with a jagged, blunt object, and had suffered various bruises, a broken nose, internal hemorrhaging in the neck, swollen eyes, and a crushed windpipe. The crushed windpipe was determined to be the cause of death. After the victim’s death, his body was subjected to burns on parts of the torso, and trauma to the chest and scrotum, part of which was crushed.</p>

The blood was similar to the victim’s; the lacerations and punctures on the victim’s head were caused by this rock. The nearest rocks were two hundred feet from the body and were similar to the rock used to strike the victim. A pair of glasses found near the body was identified as those made and sold to Appellant by his optometrist, Dr. Perry. On July 25, 1981, the day following the death, Appellant returned to Dr. Perry and ordered another, identical pair of glasses.</p>

Mrs. Pursell also testified that she was extremely upset when she heard about the murder on the evening news (July 24, 1981) — so much so that she required medication to calm down — and that Appellant was aware of her reaction upon hearing of the victim’s death.</p>

No mention had been made in any report that glasses had been found at the scene.</p>
    <p id="b282-5" data-blocks='[["BL_282.4",282,[247,632,1167,747]]]'>Taking all of these circumstances together, a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that young Christopher Brine’s death was a homicide. From the nature of the injuries, a jury could further infer that the homicide was intentional and malicious. Since the victim was assaulted with a rock carried two hundred feet from its natural resting place, the jury could conclude that the killing was premeditated. Finally, the jury could conclude that Appellant committed the crime since his glasses were found at the scene and since the blood found on his shoes matched that of the victim’s. Accordingly, we are satisfied that sufficient evidence exists in this record to support the jury’s verdict of murder of the first degree, and dismiss Appellant’s sufficiency challenge.</p>

You should consider this evidence along with all the other evidence in the case in determining whether the Commonwealth has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime was committed and that the defendant himself committed or took part in committing the crime. The defendant’s evidence that he was not present either by itself or together with other evidence may be sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt of his guilt in your minds.

On the one hand there is direct evidence; that is, evidence which is testimony by a witness from his own personal knowledge such as something that he saw or heard himself ... The other type is circumstantial evidence which is testimony about facts which point to the existence of other facts which are in question. An example of this: The glasses, the blood on the shoe, any other blood. Whether or not circumstantial evidence is proof of the other facts in question depends in part on the application of common sense and <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>human experience. You should recognize that it is sometimes necessary to rely upon circumstantial evidence in criminal cases; particularly as in this case where the crime was committed in secret. In deciding whether or not to accept circumstantial evidence as proof of the facts in question, you must be satisfied first that the testimony of the witness involved is truthful and accurate; and second, that the existence of the facts that the witness testified to leads to the conclusion that the facts in question also happened. Circumstantial evidence alone may be sufficient to prove the defendant’s guilt. If there are several pieces of circumstantial evidence, it is not necessary that each piece standing separately convince you of the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, before you find — you may find — the defendant guilty, all the pieces of circumstantial evidence when considered together must reasonably and naturally lead to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty and must convince you of the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In other words, you may find the defendant guilty based on circumstantial evidence alone but only if the total amount and quality of that evidence convinces you of the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Along with that, as I have told you, one of the elements of this crime is that the defendant intended to kill Christopher Brine. Ordinarily it is not possible to prove intent by direct evidence unless, for example, there is evidence that the defendant made a statement concerning his state of mind, which we do not have in this case. However, intent like any other matter may be proved by circumstantial evidence; that is, in inferences that reasonably may be drawn from all the facts and circumstances including the defendant’s acts and conduct which have been shown by the evidence in this case.

One glaring example was the July 28, 1981 front-page newspaper publication of appellant’s prior criminal record. Not to be outdone, local radio and television stations also gave detailed reports of appellant’s past offenses. One television broadcast portrayed appellant as a “weird,” “wild” man who had brandished a gun in the neighborhood and who had served one and a half years in prison for a stabbing.</p>

At that conference the officer made public that glasses found at the scene of the crime had been identified as appellant’s and that blood was seen on appellant’s shirt on the night of the murder. By broadcasting critical evidence against appellant prior to the courtroom trial the police, in effect, tried appellant through the media to induce a climate conducive to establishing a finding of guilt. <em>See Rideau v.

Instead, the clear implication of this argument amounted to a direction to the jury that their function was limited to the consequence of a finding that the aggravating circumstance outweighed any mitigating circumstance. This argument obscured the jury’s critical function of determining whether an aggravating circumstance had in fact been established by the Commonwealth beyond a reasonable doubt. 42 Pa.C.S. § 971 1(c)(1)(iii). And, in the event the Commonwealth met this first burden, the jury’s obligation was at that point to weigh that aggravating circumstance against any possible mitigating circumstances. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(1)(iv).

Unfortunately under the laws of cases of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we do not have the definition of torture. There is no legal precedent for me to follow and state, “This is what our Courts” — or—“this is what our laws say torture is.” So, what happens in a case like this is that we must look elsewhere for some sort of a definition of the word “torture.” So, I’ve looked at several, and these are the two definitions I’ve come up with. One of them is the <em>Model Penal Code </em>in which they say that the offense or murder committed by means of torture is designed for the defendant who causes a considerable amount of pain and that the language used for this particularly aggravating circumstance is the murder was especially “heinous, atrocious, or cruel manifesting exceptional depravity.” Also, another place that I felt may be appropriate in trying to define for you “torture” was in the <em>American Law Reports. </em>They stated — these reports stated that since murder is an intentional act, that many Courts have determined, regarding murder by torture, a specific intention that the torture/murder has in committing the homicide. It has been held that this is an intention to inflict pain, suffering, or both pain and suffering.</blockquote>

It is imperative, however, that the definition of torture be circumscribed more than that of the trial court’s and that <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>adopted by the majority today. The infliction of pain which is unnecessarily heinous, atrocious, or cruel manifesting exceptional depravity may be interpreted to include acts resulting in the death of a victim which are not committed by means of torture. The former category is more inclusive than the latter. For example, the infliction of pain on an innocent and defenseless child resulting in death may well be understood by a jury, and this author, to satisfy the majority’s definition of torture. It would not be sufficient in itself, however, to establish an act committed by torture. The problem that I perceive with the majority’s definition is that it would impermissibly suggest to a jury that it may focus on the character of the defendant, rather than on the means by which the murder was committed. While it may be an unintended result, it is an inevitable one.</p>
    <p id="b311-5" data-blocks='[["BL_311.4",311,[251,1101,1159,454]]]'>The Legislature clearly intended to differentiate between murders which are especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel and murders by means of torture. Proposed amendments were suggested which would delete the language which is codified at 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(8) and substitute as an aggravating circumstance that the murder was especially heinous. The Legislature considered and rejected the proposed amendments. 1978 Legislative Journal — Senate at 103.</p>

With respect to the <em>Model Penal </em>Code, they state that the language used for this particularly aggravating circumstance is the murder was “especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manifesting exceptional” — you know what the word “exceptional” means — “depravity.” You’ve often heard the words “a depraved mind.” Well, that’s what “depravity” means, a type of mind that’s depraved. I hope that answers your question. I will send you out again, and you can still continue your deliberations.</blockquote>
