They saw Appellee flee the scene immediately afterward. One of them said that Appellee had a gun in his belt and that an attempt was made to restrain him.

The detective showed the photograph which Alexander had signed and dated. The photograph was admitted into evidence. No reference to the photographic identification was made during Alexander’s testimony.</p>
    <p id="b459-3" data-blocks='[["BL_459.3",459,[231,309,1162,1660]]]'>
      <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>The issue before us is whether the testimony of the detective as to the photographic identification was proper. The Commonwealth argues that it was properly admitted to rebut Alexander’s testimony that he did not make an identification, given that Alexander was present in court and available for cross-examination. The Superior Court held to the contrary and ordered a new trial. It based its decision on two grounds. The first was that the Commonwealth did not comply with Rule of Criminal Procedure 305(B)(1)(d), which requires disclosure of “the circumstances and results of any identification of the defendant by voice, photograph, or in-person identification.” The defense was unaware of the photographic identification. The Commonwealth did not disclose it, although the record indicates that there was a discovery request and the prosecution had the police report of the identification. If defense counsel were aware of such identification, he might have refrained from eliciting on cross-examination the testimony of Alexander that he never made an identification. The possibility of rebuttal by means of the evidence of photographic identification could thereby have been averted. Failure to make required disclosure requires a new trial unless it can be shown to have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>Commonwealth v. Contakos, </em><a href="/pa/492/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="492 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1767199" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0465-01">492 Pa. 465</a>, <a href="/pa/492/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="492 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1767199" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0465-01">424 A.2d 1284</a> (1981). The nondisclosure cannot be deemed to have been harmless in the instant case. The photographic identification was quite damaging to Appellee as it provided the only direct identification of him as the shooter. Because of that and the possible effect on defense counsel’s examination of Alexander, the non-disclosure was prejudicial and was a proper basis for the award of a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b459-4" data-blocks='[["BL_459.4",459,[230,1997,1159,361]]]'>In addition, the Superior Court found that the evidence of the photographic identification was erroneously admitted as substantive evidence, which it distinguished from admission merely for impeachment. Such admission was found to be violative of the rule against hearsay. The ruling was contrary to the Commonwealth’s claim that the testimony was admissible as substantive evidence.</p>

One of the individuals appeared as a witness. The other did not. In ruling on the admissibility of the officer’s testimony, we did not distinguish between the two declarants. We held that the testimony was inadmissible as hearsay. We also found it to be harmless in view of other evidence of identification. We cannot find the testimony in question tc be harmless in the instant case, as there was no other evidence of Alexander having identified Appellee. If a witness is unable to identify the defendant in court but made a previous identification, such previous identification may be established by questioning the witness him or herself. This was permitted in <em>Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth was permitted to contradict the witness by introducing the prior inconsistent statement. Such statement was admissible only to impeach the witness and not as substantive evidence. . In <em>Commonwealth v. Ballard, </em><a href="/pa/501/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="501 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="1782484" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0230-01">501 Pa. 230</a>, <a href="/pa/501/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="501 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="1782484" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0230-01">460 A.2d 1091</a> (1983), two police officers testified that a Commonwealth witness identified the defendant in a pre-trial photographic array. We held that the testimony was admissible because the witness was in court and subject to cross-examination. The Commonwealth places great reliance on <em>Ballard </em>and argues that it requires the admission of the testimony in question in the instant case. The <em>Ballard </em>opinion did not mention <em>Slaughter, </em>nor did it address either the question of harmlessness, the question of whether the witness must have been questioned about the previous identification and denied making it, or the question <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>as to whether the testimony was admissible as substantive evidence or merely for impeachment purposes. Justice Flaherty, concurring in <em>Ballard, </em>believed that the testimony was inadmissible but harmless in view of other competent identification evidence. We do not read <em>Ballard </em>as overruling the holding in <em>Slaughter. </em>The testimony as to the identifications in that case, which we found to be improper though harmless, was admitted as substantive evidence and was not used for impeachment. The case can be harmonized with <em>Waller </em>and <em>Ballard. Waller </em>addressed the distinction between substantive and impeachment evidence. Reading the cases together, we hold that a witness may testify as to an identification made by another person if and only if such other person is present in court, is available for cross-examination, has testified, has been questioned about the previous identification, and has denied making it. The testimony as to the identification is to be admitted in such circumstances as a prior inconsistent statement. Applying <em>Waller, </em>we hold that the evidence is admissible only for impeachment and not as substantive evidence. The court must so instruct the jury. That was not done in the instant case. The jury was permitted to view the evidence in question as substantive, which was improper and requires that the conviction be set aside.</p>

That case did not squarely address the issue of third party identification testimony. In <em>Slaughter </em>two police officers testified generally as to the fact of prior identifications of the accused. The first officer stated during cross-examination that he <em>had not been present </em>during the identifications but that the information had been relayed to him by others. On redirect examination that officer named the two identifying witnesses. The latter testimony was clearly double hearsay: the officer merely related that he had been told that two individuals had identified the defendant.

However, the trial court’s opinion in <em>Ballard </em>reveals that not only was the witness present in court and subject to cross-examination, but that “during her direct examination she unequivocally stated she was certain of her identification at the time she made it.” Slip opinion at 5. In view of this fact, it would be unnecessary and inaccurate to now read <em>Ballard </em>as holding that testimony concerning a witness’s out-of-court identification is admissible in every case where the witness is present and available for cross-examination.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">*</a>
