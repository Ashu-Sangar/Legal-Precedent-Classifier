Prior to their marriage, the Appellee purchased a tract of <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>land for $3,750 although title was listed in both parties as tenants in common. For seven months prior to the marriage, the parties lived together, Appellant supporting the Appellee while the Appellee constructed the dwelling on the aforesaid tract of land. The record indicates that a bank loan, the Appellee’s mother, and the parties themselves contributed the funds to construct the house. Subsequent to their marriage, the parties deeded the property to themselves as tenants by the entireties. Although construction of the marital residence began prior to the marriage, it was not completed until after July, 1978. Domestic tranquility ended by August of 1980, when the parties separated. The Appellee thereafter filed a complaint in divorce on August 20, 1980.</p>

The Appellee did note, however, that he paid for the unimproved lot himself. On February 19, 1981, a hearing was held before a master to equitably distribute the marital property. In that hearing, the Appellee testified that the real estate was jointly owned and that the Appellant had contributed $8,000 towards the construction of the house. He also indicated that the house was 80 percent completed prior to the marriage. There also was testimony that the Appellant contributed towards the parties’ living expenses during the time that they lived together but prior to their marriage.</p>

    <p id="b688-4" data-blocks='[["BL_688.4",688,[229,790,1168,424]]]'>Reviewing all the evidence, the master determined that the Merrill Lynch stock account was a marital asset, and the balance was to be equally divided after payment of a joint obligation. With regard to the real estate, the master reasoned that since the property was originally held as tenants in common, each would be entitled to an undivided one-half interest whether classified as property held as tenants by the entireties or tenants in common.</p>

In reversing the lower court, the Superior Court sua sponte held that both the real estate and Merrill Lynch stock account were “non-marital” assets and therefore not subject to equitable distribution. Because the Superior Court exceeded its scope of appellate review, we now reverse and remand to the Superi- or Court for further review of the remaining issues properly preserved for appeal.</p>
