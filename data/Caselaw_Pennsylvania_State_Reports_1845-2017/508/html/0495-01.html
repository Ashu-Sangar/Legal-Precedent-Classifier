At issue is whether an interest arbitration panel may include a provision for binding grievance arbitration in an award. The Township challenges the authority of the interest arbitration panel under the Act of June 24, 1968, P.L. 237, <em>as amended, </em>43 P.S. § 217.1 et seq. (“Act 111”) to include in its award a procedure for binding grievance arbitration. Subsumed in this issue is the question as to whether Act 111 requires that a grievance arbitration procedure conform with the arbitration procedure set forth in section 4 of that Act. Finally, we are called upon to determine whether a residency requirement can be provided for under the Act 111 interest arbitration.</p>

The Common Pleas Court found that the panel was empowered to establish a binding arbitration grievance procedure and a residency requirement.

    <p id="b563-4" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[225,673,1160,1218]]]'>Appellant contends that Act 111 is limited to “interest” arbitration and does not permit the use of “grievance” or contract arbitration between the public employer and police and fire personnel in the resolution of disputes that may arise under the terms of an existing collective bargaining agreement. This contention is premised upon the fact that Act 111 expressly provides for interest arbitration. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 217.4. Act 111 does not contain an express provision authorizing the arbitration procedure set forth in section 4, 43 P.S. § 217.4, to be used to resolve grievances that might arise under a collective bargaining agreement. Thus appellant states that this absence of an express authorization represents a legislative intent not to provide binding arbitration as a means for resolution of disputes as to the interpretations of the terms of the contract. In support of this position appellant notes the fact the Public Employe Relation Act, Act of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, § 101, 43 P.S. § 1101.101 <em>et seq. </em>(hereinafter “Act 195”), specifically provides for grievance arbitration as indicative of a legislative awareness of the distinction between the two types of arbitration procedures and as further evidence of a deliberate legislative judgment to deny grievance arbitration between public employers and police and fire personnel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Since the services of these employees were not as critical to the public safety and welfare they were afforded a voluntary arbitration procedure where an impasse in negotiation was reached, 43 P.S. § 1101.804, and the right to strike was recognized after the exhaustion of negotiation and mediation procedures provided for under the Act, 43 P.S. § 1101.1003.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

We have been shown no controlling precedent nor have we been offered any impressive arguments why we should establish an exception which would prevent an arbitration panel from establishing a grievance arbitration procedure as part of the contract it develops for the parties. This was a legitimate subject for bargaining and the employer could have voluntarily agreed to a provision for grievance arbitration to be included in the bargaining agreement the parties were attempting to negotiate. Moreover, in view of the prohibition against strikes under Act 111, grievance procedures of this nature which fosters harmony in the employment relationship should be favored. We therefore rely upon the above cited precedent in holding that the arbitration panel could properly include in its award a mechanism for binding arbitration of grievances and disputes arising under the terms of the collective bargaining provisions set forth under its award.</p>

The failure to provide for collective bargaining resulted in illegal strikes and a breakdown of communication between the public employer and their employees. On May 14, 1968, Governor Raymond P. Shafer created, by Executive Order, the Governor's Commission for Revision of Pennsylvania Public Employe Law of Pennsylvania [the "Hickman Commission’’]. The Hickman Commission was created to review the whole area of the relations of public employers and public employees and to make recommendations to the Governor (by June 20, 1968) for the establishment of orderly, fair and workable procedures governing those relations, including legislation. In its report the Commission noted that the “inability to bargain collectively has created more ill will and led to more friction and strikes than any other single cause" and recommended that the 1947 Act “be replaced by an entirely new law governing relationships between public employers and employees.” Four days after the Hickman Commission Report was published the General Assembly passed Act 111 of 1968 to cure-the defects of the 1947 Act as it relates to police and fire personnel. <em>See also Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v.
