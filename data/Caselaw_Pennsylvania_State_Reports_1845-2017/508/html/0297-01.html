Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>as it has been asserted, that the Motor Vehicle Code does <em>require </em>Courts of Common Pleas to establish ARD programs in which all first offenders charged under Section 3731 (drunk driving) must be placed on ARD, such statutory provision, since it is in contravention of the rules of this Court, would be invalid.

For one thing, such a view is at odds with the clear legislative mandate. For another, the es<a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>sence of the seriousness of the crime of drunk driving is that it is a life-threatening act. The fact that the drunk’s state of mind may technically be described as grossly negligent or grossly reckless, not “driving with the intent to kill,” does not negate the fact that as a result of his recklessness, innocent people and the drunk himself may be and often are injured or killed. In the face of the rather simple realities associated with drunk driving — that terrible costs in human life, injury and potential are exacted for no reason except the transitory pleasure of the drunk — it would be folly to encourage those who consume alcohol to believe that if they are caught driving while intoxicated, society will take a light view of it.</p>

While I agree with the majority’s conclusion that an attorney for the Commonwealth has sole discretion in determining which cases should be submitted for Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD), I am troubled by the conclusion that we must rely on the openness of the exercise of that discretion and an extremely narrow scope of review to restrain abuse.</p>

In so doing Mr. Justice Flaherty points out that the prosecutors in each of these consolidated cases gave specific reasons for refusing to submit the case for ARD. There is no indication, however, of whether there is a requirement that prosecutors in all ARD cases specifically articulate their reasons for withholding a case from ARD consideration. To insure the openness necessary for a useful restraint against abuse of discretion, such an articulation is clearly required.</p>
