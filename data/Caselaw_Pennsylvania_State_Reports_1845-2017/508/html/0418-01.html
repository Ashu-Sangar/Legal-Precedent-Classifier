Perhaps such has not come to notice because the practice that jurors must withhold discussion and consultation as well as judgment until all the evidence is received by them under a charge of the court is so aeonic and pervasive in this Commonwealth that only by “experiment” would the issue take wing. Some jurisdictions have faced the issue, and the consensus among them is that it is improper for jurors to discuss the details of the case among themselves before they have received all of the evidence, have listened to the closing arguments of counsel, and have been given their final instructions by the trial judge. <em>See Winebrenner v.

First, since the prosecution’s evidence is presented first, any initial opinions formed by the jurors are likely to be unfavorable to the defendant, and there is a tendency for a juror to pay greater attention to evidence that confirms his initial opinion. <em>See People v. Feldman, </em><a href="/mich-app/87/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="87 Mich. App. 157" data-case-ids="2182255" data-case-paths="/mich-app/87/0157-01">87 Mich.App. 157</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=274%20N.W.2d%201" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="274 N.W.2d 1">274 N.W.2d 1</a> (1978). Second, once a juror declares himself before his fellow jurors he is likely to stand by his opinion even if contradicted by subsequent evidence. <em>See State v. Gill, </em><a href="/sc/273/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="273 S.C. 190" data-case-ids="2158941" data-case-paths="/sc/273/0190-01">273 S.C. 190</a>, <a href="/sc/273/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="273 S.C. 190" data-case-ids="2158941" data-case-paths="/sc/273/0190-01">255 S.E.2d 455</a> (1979). Third, the defendant is entitled to have his case considered by the jury as a whole, not by separate groups or cliques that might be formed within the jury prior to the conclusion of the case. <em>See Winebrenner v. United States, <a href="/f2d/147/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="147 F.2d 322" data-case-ids="1261355" data-case-paths="/f2d/147/0322-01">supra.</a> </em>Fourth, jurors might form premature conclusions without having had the benefit of the court’s instructions concerning what law they are to apply to the facts of the case. <em>See State v.

    <p id="b485-5" data-blocks='[["BL_485.5",485,[225,785,1161,859]]]'>It should be noted that in the present case the trial judge did in fact caution the jury at several points during the trial that they should not discuss the case among themselves or with others. The court also instructed the jurors that they should avoid forming premature conclusions. The Superior Court panel, correctly recognizing that the “experiment” constituted error, found that these subsequent instructions were sufficient to clear up any misconceptions. They therefore concluded that the error was harmless. We disagree. At best the jury was left with conflicting and confusing instructions about what, if anything, they were permitted to discuss. Had the judge told the jury to disregard his previous instructions concerning the experiment, the error might have been cured. But that did not occur. As a result, we are compelled to conclude that appellant’s right to an impartial jury was violated.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

We can think of none, at least none that would constitute an acceptable reason for jeopardizing appellant’s constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury. Agreements that precede conviction can often prove watery reeds, and departures from the beaten paths into areas of “experiment” are fraught with dangers. Here the learned trial judge doubtless believed that since the defendant was an attorney such agreement could be forged in iron, and, had the outcome been different, perhaps at least one convert would have been won. We believe, however, that the issue is too profound in its implications to set precedent on a case-by-case experiment; nor can we permit less than a universal practice in a matter of such importance. We therefore agree with appellant’s first claim of ineffectiveness.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
