Near the existing structures he added one bungalow in 1953 and another in 1954. He made improvements to the bungalows in the form of access roads, sewers, water lines, and electricity.

It is important to emphasize that the actions of a governing body proceeding under powers of eminent domain or condemnation distinguish the present situation from other "taking” cases which are familiar to zoning law. <em>See e.g., Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., </em><a href="/us/272/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="272 U.S. 365" data-case-ids="1501273" data-case-paths="/us/272/0365-01">272 U.S. 365</a>, <a href="/us/272/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="47 S.

In the latter situation the argument proceeds along due process lines; asserting that an owner’s property was effectively taken by a change in zoning laws, without regard to compensation. However, in the present and like cases, there is no question that the landowner has been compensated for his loss.</p>

Our research has disclosed only one instance where a property owner was permitted to transfer a nonconforming use after that use had been extinguished by eminent domain. <em>See, Connor v. Township of Chanhassen, </em><a href="/minn/249/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="249 Minn. 205" data-case-ids="1771955" data-case-paths="/minn/249/0205-01">249 Minn. 205</a>, <a href="/minn/249/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="249 Minn. 205" data-case-ids="1771955" data-case-paths="/minn/249/0205-01">81 N.W.2d 789</a> (1957). We can find no other jurisdiction which has been willing to adopt this position. In fact, in a subsequent case, the Minnesota Supreme Court severely limited the impact of the <em>Connor </em>decision. <em>See State v.

Prior to making a conveyance in lieu of condemnation, appellant maintained as a pre-existing non-conforming use the bungalows in question, upon the same forty acre tract of land as he now seeks to maintain them. Appellant has not sought to move the bungalows to another tract of land, and, indeed, the structures themselves are the very same ones that have at all relevant times been upon the forty acre tract. Appellant does not even seek to expand the non-conforming use, by enlarging the number or size of the bungalows. Rather, appellant seeks only to continue the very same use that has always been allowed as a non-conforming use upon the tract in question, by simply relocating the situs of the use upon the same tract. To deny the continued use of the land in this manner is to too narrowly construe the landowner’s constitutional right to maintain land uses that existed prior to enactment of the zoning ordinance. I would, therefore, reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court, and order that the zoning permit in question be issued.</p>

Appellant now uses his land in the same way he has always used it. The only change of circumstances in this case is that the portion of appellant’s land now devoted to single-family bungalows is different from that portion of his land which was originally devoted to the bungalows; however, the use itself — the maintenance of one-family residences on appellant’s property — has remained the same.</p>
    <p id="b251-8" data-blocks='[["BL_251.10",251,[227,1574,1160,584]]]'>I would also add that I think the majority speaks too broadly when it concludes that “the use must not enlarge beyond its natural expectations, nor can it be moved from its original setting.” At 1106. The Bern Township Zoning Ordinance itself provides for an enlargement or increase of a nonconforming use by up to 50% upon land which was not even owned at the time the use became nonconforming.
