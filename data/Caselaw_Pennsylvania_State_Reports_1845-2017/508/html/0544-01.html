We find no error in this standard, but add the duration of the disability flowing from the injury as an equal factor. The evidence must raise a reasonable inference that the disability is permanent. This can be established by expert medical testimony that there is a scientific probability that the disability will not improve to a point where the injured employee may return to work. By producing credible evidence of such a scientific probability, a reasonable inference of permanence may be established. This standard is consistent with the provisions of the Heart and Lung Act which provide that benefits shall be paid until the disability ends and the injured employee is able to resume performing the duties of his employment. The employment duties in this case may be limited to those involved with the kind of supervisory work Palmeri was performing at the time of his injury or to those associated with a desk or administrative position. We reject the argument of the State Police that it was error for the Commonwealth Court to consider Palmeri’s capacity to perform particular sedentary jobs. It is not necessary that an injured trooper recover so that he is able to perform every conceivable function that could possibly arise in connection with a policeman’s duties generally. It is enough <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>that his recovery enable him to perform the duties of a position that is regularly assigned to state policemen even though the job be entirely sedentary.

As you can see from my letter, I stated that there was one valid way to determine whether or not a person can perform his work. That way is to put them through a performance test. Mr. Palmeri may be able to perform the work at the Communications Desk, but he should have a trial of work at the Communications Desk to make a valid determination.”</blockquote>

The prognosis is uncertain. I am unable to state at this time whether further surgery may be required. I am always optimistic that the patient will completely recover.

I would hope that Mr. Palmeri will recover enough function so that he may be able to walk.”</blockquote>
