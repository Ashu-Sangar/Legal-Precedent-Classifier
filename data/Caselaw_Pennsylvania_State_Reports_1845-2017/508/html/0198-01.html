According to the victim, during the rape episode appellee placed her in <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>fear and intimidated her by telling her that he had previously served time in jail for rape, by threatening her with a gun, and by grabbing her and throwing her onto a bed prior to engaging in various sexual acts with her. Prior to trial, appellee filed a motion seeking to bar 1) the introduction at trial of his prior criminal record and 2) the introduction of testimony containing references to the statement he made to the victim during the commission of this crime, to the effect that he had a prior conviction for rape. After an extensive hearing on the motion, the court held that the Commonwealth could not introduce appellee’s criminal record during its case in chief or during cross-examination of appellee, but that the victim would be permitted to testify with reference to the statement appellee made to her about his prior conviction.</p>

Nevertheless, we may create new exceptions in appropriate cases.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In a case such as this, in which the defendant himself has made his prior criminal activity or conviction— whether or not the defendant actually did engage in such criminal activity or actually did have such a conviction — an element of the crime with which he is now charged, our failure to allow this evidence to be admitted would grant to a whole class of criminals immunity from their crimes. If such evidence were not admissible, a criminal would only need to make sure that the fear needed for the commission of his crime emanated from a threat which only embodied a claim of prior criminal activity in order to be “excused” for his activity. If there were other threats of fear accompanying a defendant’s claim that he had engaged in prior criminal activity, the exclusion of evidence of the defendant’s statement would present a much weaker case.

Consequently, his view is that no new exception is needed. I am unpersuaded by this reasoning because evidence under the present exceptions is always offered a substantive evidence tending to prove the crime charged; otherwise, it is not relevant, <em>i.e., </em>it has no probative value.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_5" id="ref_footnote_4_5">4</a> Therefore, I <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>believe the appellee’s statements to his victim are admissible only if they fall within one of the traditional exceptions or if a new exception to the rule is recognized.
