Appellee, Isadore Beilis, was tried in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas and found guilty by a jury of the common law crimes of misfeasance, malfeasance and nonfeasance while serving in the capacity of a city councilman for the City of Philadelphia. Appellee took an appeal to the Superior Court alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that his conviction of the common law crimes was precluded by the existence of a specific statutory crime which dealt with the <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>conduct for which he was charged, i.e. extortion under former 18 P.S. § 4318, citing as authority former 18 P.S. § 5104 which provided that:</p>

    <p id="b187-6" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[233,892,1163,1464]]]'>The Superior Court agreed with this argument, stating that the <em>mere existence </em>of the statutory offense precluded a conviction of the common law crimes; i.e. even if the statutory offense was also charged and the defendant was acquitted of same, the common law offenses were still precluded. The Commonwealth was granted allowance to appeal to this Court, and we held in <em>Commonwealth v. Bellis, </em><a href="/pa/497/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="497 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="1775313" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0323-01">497 Pa. 323</a>, <a href="/pa/497/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="497 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="1775313" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0323-01">440 A.2d 1179</a> (1981) <em>(Bellis II) </em>that a common law prosecution is not barred simply because the facts would also support conviction of a statutory crime which includes elements not found in the common law offense. Thus, since the statutory crime of extortion contained elements not found in the common law crimes, Appellee could be convicted of either or both crimes. On this basis, we reversed the Superior Court and sent the case back for resolution of the remaining issues raised by Appellee but not dealt with by that court. On remand, the Superior Court, in <em>Commonwealth v. Bellis, </em><a href="/pa-super/324/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="324 Pa.

(Emphasis added) The Superior Court correctly interpreted our holding in <em>Beilis II </em>to say that prosecution for the common law offenses would be allowed where the elements of the offense differed from those of the statutory offense. However, it does not follow that a common law offense can include a statutory offense which provides a separate penalty for its violation as an element where culpability can be based <em>solely </em>on violation of the statutory proscription. From this it follows that it was error for the trial judge to instruct the jury that defendant could be found guilty of the common law offense if it were found that he breached the positive duty set forth in § 10-100 of the Home Rule Charter. As was stated in <em>Peoples, </em>conviction of the common law crime requires proof of either a breach of a positive statutory duty <em>or </em>the performance by a public official of a discretionary act with an improper or corrupt motive. Since the statutory duty outlined in the charge provided a penal sanction for its violation, consistent with <em>Beilis II, </em>Appellee could only have been convicted of the common law crimes if the jury were to find that he had performed a discretionary act with an improper or corrupt motive, the second alternative leg of the offense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Because the charge to the jury contained the statutory duty defined in § 10-100 of the Home Rule Char<a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>ter, however, it is unclear whether the jury improperly applied that duty to find Appellee guilty of the common law offenses or whether they found that he had performed a discretionary act with an improper or corrupt motive. “Where the trial court charges both correctly and incorrectly on the same proposition it is impossible to determine which instruction was followed by the jury, there must be a reversal, [sic]” <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Beilis II, </em>we rejected Beilis’ contention that Section 1104 of the Penal Code precluded prosecution for both the statutory crime of extortion and the common law crimes of misfeasance, malfeasance and non-feasance in office. There, we noted that “when the evidence establishes nothing more than the breach of a penal statute, the accused may not also be convicted of a common law offense which proscribes the same conduct. If, on the other hand, the elements of <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>the statutory offense are different, the accused may, upon sufficient evidence, be convicted of either or both offenses.” <em>Id., </em><a href="/pa/497/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="497 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="1775313" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0323-01">497 Pa. at 329</a>, <a href="/pa/497/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="497 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="1775313" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0323-01">440 A.2d at 1182</a> (footnote and citations omitted). Referring specifically to the conflicts-of-interest provision set forth in Section 10-100 of the Philadelphia Charter, we held that ”[l]ike the extortion statute, this provision addresses misconduct separate and distinct from the common law crime, and therefore does not bar prosecution for those crimes.” <em><a href="/pa/497/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="497 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="1775313" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0323-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/497/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="497 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="1775313" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0323-01">497 Pa. at </a>331 n. 11, <a href="/pa/497/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="497 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="1775313" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0323-01">440 A.2d at </a>1183 n. 11. The majority’s opinion in the case before us is inconsistent with that decision and relies on an expansive interpretation of one sentence in <em>Commonwealth v.
