The victim’s blood alcohol content was determined to be .18 and vomit was on the sidewalk near the victim as well as on the cuff of the victim’s trouser. The Commonwealth’s case was based on the theory that the appellant, who had walked a lengthy distance in trying to reach the Philadelphia International Airport, was looking for a car to steal and at approximately 8:00 in the evening, after walking for approximately 3 hours, he reached Delaware Avenue where he came upon Uffelman.</p>

Frederick Hammer was 18 years old at the time of the incident and lived approximately one and one-half hours driving time from Philadelphia, but was in Philadelphia that day to do a carpentry-type job with his brother and a co-worker on a building roof. During the job, scaffolding upon which they stood collapsed and appellant fell, whereupon he was transported to a local hospital by a rescue squad but released after examination determined that he was merely bruised. Appellant testified that he had less than a dollar and that after waiting for approximately three hours at the hospital in the expectation that his brother would retrieve him, he called his Stepfather and was advised to get public transportation to “center city” and call his stepfather again once he <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>had an address. Appellant testified that he believed that he did not have enough money to take a bus and that he began walking beneath the elevated train after receiving direction from a police officer regarding the general direction of the airport. He testified that he decided to go to the airport because he thought that it was “center city” and also knew his stepfather would be able to easily find the airport. He himself was familiar with the airport location both because the route from his home to Philadelphia passes the airport complex and because during a period he served in the Navy he was briefly located at the Philadelphia shipyard which is close to the airport.</p>
    <p id="b156-5" data-blocks='[["BL_156.4",156,[234,955,1169,960]]]'>He testified that he had underestimated the distance to the airport and that after walking for over three hours he had reached Delaware Avenue where the driver of a passing car stopped to ask him if he needed a ride. He explained that his destination was the airport and accepted the offered ride. He testified that the driver, decedent Uffelman, made a homosexual proposition and advance, offering the appellant money and that when appellant refused, the driver became angry, violent and held a gun on appellant. He then allegedly pulled the car to the curb, began to quickly walk around the front of the car, saying “We’ll see what you’re made of,” and then grabbed at appellant’s chest through the car window. After appellant was forced to get out of the car, he picked up the post used as a weapon, and while approximately facing decedent, swung and struck the decedent who then fell to the ground. Appellant then went to the driver’s side of the car, got in and drove away.</p>

When he repeatedly presented false identification, which he held in order to be served liquor, he was ordered out of the car and frisked. He was wearing an old Navy issue shirt, on which his last name, “Hammer,” was stenciled over a pocket. Appellant ran from the state troopers, hopped a guardrail, went down an embankment and escaped. Upon a <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>search of the glove compartment of the vehicle, the state troopers found Uffelman’s identification whereupon they contacted Philadelphia and learned for the first time that the body of Uffelman had been found on Delaware Avenue. A description of the appellant was issued and a neighbor of appellant who was a Pennsylvania State Trooper and who knew Freddie Hammer arrested Hammer the following night.</p>
    <p id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.4",157,[247,741,1161,579]]]'>The defense presented expert forensic testimony to the effect that the documented fractures to the skull of the victim were consistent with a single blow and that the location of the blow was not inconsistent with a stance of the actors approximately facing one another. The expert witness further testified that the type of head wound suffered by the victim affected an area of the brain controlling involuntary responses and thus could induce an involuntary vomiting response <em>after </em>the blow to the head, contrary to the Commonwealth theory that Uffelman was vomiting at the time he was struck.</p>

When the witness responded, “I would say that those are not necessary characteristics of the place they would choose,” the assistant district attorney questioned whether “it would surprise you to learn that about an hour ago, someone who has said he has interviewed 7,000 of people ... in describing where the 7,000 people he has interviewed chose their locations [used] the catchwords of anonymity and secrecy; is your opinion different?”, whereupon defense counsel objected to the prosecution’s extreme mischaracterization of the extensiveness of the preceding witness’ testimony. The court added: “All right. And the person who expressed the opinion holds a medical degree and a degree in psychiatry, I might add, to that statement,” N.T. pp. 2030-2031, and did not rule on the objection.</p>

Only two instances of judicial questioning were objected to by counsel during the trial and were not so objectionable as to require a new trial. The remaining allegations were presented for the first time in post-trial motions, no objection having been raised by trial counsel at trial. Accordingly, the trial judge, in addressing these untimely raised allegations in post-trial motions, held the issue to be waived due to the failure of counsel to object. Upon direct appeal to this Court, appellate counsel also failed to properly present the issue so as to render it reviewable. To obtain review of an allegation of substantive trial error not raised by trial counsel, it is necessary that first counsel whose representation succeeds that of trial counsel advance the allegation in terms of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to preserve the issue for review by timely objection. <em>Commonwealth v.

The man’s rear pocket was ripped and his head battered. A piece of lumber lying nearby fit the possibilities of a robbery and murder. The man was identified as an off-duty police officer and his car was missing. Alarm and hunt swiftly followed. The appellant was in possession of the victim’s car and fleeing for fear or guilt was racing to his home in Oxford, Pennsylvania. Stopped for speeding by state troopers on his way, he jumped from the car, fled over ditch and field to a nearby home, sought the use of a phone, and summoned his girlfriend to drive him home. The officers recalled the name “Hammer” stenciled on his shirt. The next day the state police net ineluctably closed around him. He was apprehended and a search warrant found the victim’s wallet hidden under his bedroom rug. Faced with the coming inculpation of the car and the victim’s wallet, the appellant told police that all was in fact innocent. Unfamiliar with Philadelphia, he said he was in that city for a day’s work as a carpenter, he fell from a scaffold, and while briefly hospitalized, lost contact with his brother. He called home and asked his stepfather to come for him. Believing the airport to be a central location he set that as the place for meeting. Short of money, he started walking to the airport. It was further away and a longer walk than he thought. On Delaware Avenue he met the victim who offered him a ride. During the ride he said the victim made menacing homosexual advances, stopped the car, and at gun point forced appellant out to accomplish his purpose. On the pavement as the victim approached, he saw a piece of wood, scuffled and successfully struck the deceased with the length of wood. The deceased fell to the ground and appellant in fear escaped.</p>

All contradictions, and there were many in his version, were assigned to fear and excitement. The Commonwealth pursued him upon the theory that he came upon a man who was ill and vomitting, struck him down, robbed him, and fled with his car. In a long and thorough trial, the appellant took the stand to explain and the dooming evidence was put to test. The jury found him guilty of third degree murder; that is he intended to do serious bodily harm but did not intend to kill. They might have done more. The majority have done more.

I, on the other hand, looking at the questions in the context of the whole, believe the judge was doing no more than exercising his right and his duty to clarify issues by interrogating the witness. <em>Commonwealth v. Manning, </em>
      <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a><a href="/pa/495/0652-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="495 Pa. 652" data-case-ids="1770750" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0652-01">495 Pa. 652</a>, <a href="/pa/495/0652-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="495 Pa. 652" data-case-ids="1770750" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0652-01">435 A.2d 1207</a> (1981). I can only assume that trial counsel felt the same because, as the exerpt shows, he did not protest. A similar review of the other so-called examples of “improprieties by the judge” leads to the inescapable conclusion that counsel had good reason for not objecting; there was nothing to which to object.</p>
    <p id="b175-4" data-blocks='[["BL_175.4",175,[261,659,1159,850]]]'>To find in the trial judge’s question some other motive, against the inherent and necessary logic of the question, is the reflection in the jaundiced eye. The majority seems more anxious to find fault with the trial judge than to consider the intrinsic question whether appellant received a fair trial. It is true that during surrebuttal the trial judge seemed somewhat disturbed with the proof offered that there are latent propensities in persons that are not known either to themselves or others until they surface. He did not, however, denigrate that common fact. What he did do was question the “scientific proof”. Perhaps it would have been better had he let the witness proceed unquestioned. Notwithstanding his questions however, the witnesses did in fact give their “scientific proofs” that there are closet homosexuals; proof equivalent to the fact it sometimes rains in Indianapolis.</p>
    <p id="b175-5" data-blocks='[["BL_175.5",175,[256,1530,1161,633]]]'>The decision of the majority is disturbing for yet another reason, in that they have this day decidedly weakened the perfectly sound legal principle that objections to perceived trial errors will be waived unless they are made at the time the alleged error occurs. <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, </em><a href="/pa/487/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="487 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="1759131" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0183-01">487 Pa. 183</a>, <a href="/pa/487/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="487 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="1759131" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0183-01">409 A.2d 25</a> (1979); <em>Commonwealth v. Clair, </em><a href="/pa/458/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="458 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="479736" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0418-01">458 Pa. 418</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=326%20A.2d%20272" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="326 A.2d 272">326 A.2d 272</a> (1974). When the perceived error is a claim of judicial partiality, a strict application of that waiver doctrine is inadvisable, says the majority, because a judge is not likely to become impartial simply because he is asked to do so by counsel. And besides, so their rationale goes, the judge might become annoyed.</p>
