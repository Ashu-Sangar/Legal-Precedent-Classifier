The bodies were covered with blood, and there was blood on the walls and ceiling of the room.

    <p id="b390-7" data-blocks='[["BL_390.6",390,[246,1372,1166,631]]]'>The record presents the following tragic tale. Appellant and John Lucic, Sr. were employees of the F.D. Strano Company. Appellant was employed as a roofer and Lucic was a foreman. In the fall of 1980, the two had a work-related confrontation. On August 4, 1981, Appellant approached another employee, Raymond Ours, and told him he was going to kill Lucie’s wife and children and asked Ours if he would help him do it. Ours refused, and told other members of the work crew what Appellant had said. At the end of the work day at 5:00 p.m., Appellant left work and went to the Lucic residence, which was about a ten minute walk from the F.D. Strano Company premises.</p>
    <p id="b390-8" data-blocks='[["BL_390.7",390,[245,2022,1164,311]],["BL_391.1",391,[231,297,1160,905]]]'>Two fellow employees observed Appellant at 6:00 p.m. coming from the direction of the Lucic residence, and running through a park in Ambridge, toward the F.D. Strano Company property. Appellant was very excited and he was not wearing his glasses. His hand was wrapped in a white rag and there were red stains on the back of his shirt which <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>appeared to be blood. When asked by the two co-workers what had happened, he replied that he had fallen off a ladder and hurt his nose. He then went into the F.D. Strano premises and into a bathroom at the back of the building. When he came out of the bathroom shortly thereafter, he was in an agitated condition and told one of the employees who had previously observed him that he had been to the Lucic house and had found the family with their throats slashed from ear to ear. He then said to the employee, “Please don’t tell anybody.” The employee with whom he was speaking advised him to go to the police. Appellant then walked one block to the Ambridge Police Station, arriving with what police observed as blood stains on his clothing, and took the police to the Lucic residence. After the police viewed the bodies and the premises, Appellant was placed under arrest, and advised of his constitutional rights.</p>
    <p id="b391-5" data-blocks='[["BL_391.4",391,[216,1222,1171,800]]]'>The next day, a search warrant was obtained for the F.D. Strano building, and a utility knife was found in the rafters of the bathroom that Appellant had used the previous evening after coming from the Lucic house. The utility knife was one commonly used by workers at F.D. Strano to cut shingles, and was marked with the name “Cross” on it. It was identified as belonging to Appellant. Blood residue on the knife was identified by expert testimony as being a mixture of the blood of John, Jr., and Denise Lucic. Further expert testimony established that there was blood from all three victims on Appellant’s shirt and pants. The pillow found on Danielle was sent to the F.B.I. Crime Laboratory in Washington D.C., and a fingerprint expert from that ■ laboratory testified at trial that Appellant’s palm print was on the pillow.</p>

He stated that he had received a phone call a week or two earlier from a caller he assumed was Denise Lucic because the caller had asked for John Lucic. The <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>caller suggested that Appellant could give her a bid on repair work for her bathroom. Although he had never mentioned the phone call or the repair work to John Lucic, Sr., Appellant decided on August 4 to walk up to the Lucic house and make a bid. When he arrived at the Lucic house, he knocked and received no answer. The door was open and he went in and called out for Mrs. Lucic. Receiving no answer, he went upstairs and into a bedroom. There, he said, he found the bodies of Mrs. Lucic and the little boy covered with blood. He started to step over the boy to get to Mrs. Lucic when his knee gave way and he fell on top of the little boy. Next, he knelt beside Mrs. Lucic, picked her up and cradled her in his arms, checking for a pulse on her wrist and neck. Finding no pulse, he laid her back down.</p>
    <p id="b392-5" data-blocks='[["BL_392.4",392,[237,1060,1165,532]]]'>He testified that, at this point, he broke down and cried. He reached for a handkerchief in his back pocket and when he pulled it out, his utility knife and a screwdriver that he had in his pocket came out and fell into a pool of blood on the floor. He picked up the knife and screwdriver and walked into the little girl’s bedroom where he found her lying on the floor with a pillow stuffed in her mouth. Appellant testified that he removed the pillow and checked to see if she was breathing. There was no movement so he replaced the pillow “the way (he) found it.”</p>

Only where one of these specific factors is established beyond a reasonable doubt may a sentence of death even be considered.</p>

In <em>Commonwealth v. Goins, <a href="/pa/508/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="508 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="1793994" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0270-01">supra,</a> </em>this Court concluded that the legislature intended the significance of the defendant’s <em>history </em>of such convictions, rather than the serious nature <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>of a prior offense, to be the basis for a finding of that aggravating factor. Accordingly we interpreted the legislature’s use of the plural “convictions” as deliberate and held that more than one conviction must be proven to establish a “significant history.”</p>
    <p id="b405-5" data-blocks='[["BL_405.4",405,[257,597,1158,469]]]'>It is implicit in our holding in <em>Goins </em>that the sentencing jury or judge must determine whether the number of the defendant’s prior convictions of crimes of violence is “significant.” The plain meaning of the term “significant” is “having or expressing a meaning.” Webster’s New World Dictionary of the American Language (2d Coll. ed. 1982). Clearly the number of prior convictions must be sufficient for the sentencer to draw a conclusion as to the defendant’s character.</p>
    <p id="b405-6" data-blocks='[["BL_405.5",405,[253,1107,1160,694]]]'>Since only felonies involving the use or threat of physical violence may be considered, the prior convictions proven by the Commonwealth will share two characteristics in common. First, they are serious offenses; second, they are violent in nature. In my view the legislature has determined that a prior criminal record which reveals a pattern of repeated violent crimes of a serious nature should be an aggravating factor in the sentencing determination. Multiple convictions of such crimes would establish not only the defendant’s contempt for society’s laws, but also his propensity for violent behavior and callous disregard for the sanctity of human life. Such individuals present a clear danger to society and are beyond remorse or rehabilitation.</p>
    <p id="b405-7" data-blocks='[["BL_405.6",405,[250,1832,1159,533]]]'>The Commonwealth’s evidence in support of a “significant history” in this matter was patently inadequate. The only evidence offered was that appellant had been convicted of a rape-sodomy in Virginia in 1974. Appellant countered with evidence that he had successfully fulfilled the conditions of his parole following a period of imprisonment. I reject the notion that proof of one prior remote and isolated incident involving a single victim could support the finding of a “significant history” of violent felony convictions as that term is contemplated by the General Assembly.</p>

Moreover, its erroneous inclusion was in my judgment under these circumstances harmless. I, therefore, concur in the result reached by the majority.</p>
