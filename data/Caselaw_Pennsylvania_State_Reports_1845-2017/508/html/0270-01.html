Viewing the evidence in light most favorable to the Commonwealth, it was established that on the night of June 22, 1981, the Appellant’s wife, Susan Goins, visited with some friends at the house of Cheryl Landers. Around midnight she telephoned her husband to tell him she would be on her way home soon, although she did not mention to him where she was. At around 1:45 a.m., June 23, Susan Goins left Landers’s house. Before she left, Landers wrote down for her the new telephone number Landers had recently been given. Between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m., Landers received a telephone call from the Appellant, inquiring whether his wife was with her. Also at about 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. on June 23, 1981, Gertrude Watson, who lived in the row house neighboring the Appellant and his wife, heard arguing, screaming, and the sound of something falling, coming from the Goins residence.</p>

It was later discovered that a medicine cabinet at the home had been broken into that morning. The Appellant was discovered semi-conscious by his mother in her home late in the afternoon, having ingested various drugs. He was taken to the hospital by the police, who had been called by the Appellant’s mother.</p>

Medical examination determined that Susan Goins had been struck in the head with the hammer about twenty-five times; in addition numerous other bruises and scratches to the shoulders and arms were found.</p>

He explained the blood on his clothing as resulting from his actions in hugging his wife’s body and trying to remove the hammer.</p>

The first of these instances occurred during defense counsel’s closing argument to the jury. The prosecutor interrupted counsel’s argument that the Commonwealth had failed to produce witnesses to rebut certain <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>of the defendant’s testimony, stating to the court and the jury that defense counsel was “making misstatements.” In addition to being patently frivolous, this argument is waived. Defense counsel objected to the interruption by the prosecutor and the court admonished the Commonwealth’s attorney against further interruptions. No motion for mistrial was made. Defense counsel received the only relief he requested and the only relief to which he was entitled.</p>
    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[254,844,1169,691]]]'>The second instance of misconduct complained of occurred during the prosecutor’s closing argument to the jury. The Appellant cites two statements which he argues were direct or indirect statements of the prosecutor’s opinion that the Appellant had killed his wife. In the first instance the prosecutor stated, “If you believe Gertrude Watson, this man [the Appellant] is not telling the truth. You decide that. That’s your job. I can’t give you my opinion. I can’t say it.” N.T. 5.234. It is difficult to discern in what regard this statement is objectionable, Watson and the Appellant having given contradictory testimony on the facts being addressed. In any event, the issue is waived for failure of trial counsel to object.</p>

Accepting the Appellant’s argument that this was an improper statement conveying the prosecutor’s opinion regarding the accused’s guilt, it is not every intemperate remark which will result in the grant of a new trial. Only those remarks whose “unavoidable effect would be to prejudice the jury, forming in their minds fixed bias <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>and hostility toward the defendant, so that they could not weigh the evidence and render a true verdict” will necessitate the ordering of a new trial. <em>Commonwealth v. Simon, </em><a href="/pa/432/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="432 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1919714" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0386-01">432 Pa. 386</a>, 394, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%20289" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="248 A.2d 289">248 A.2d 289</a>, 292 (1968). The trial court’s determination that the conduct complained of did not reach the level requiring a new trial is more than amply supported and cannot be characterized as an abuse of discretion.</p>
    <p id="b339-4" data-blocks='[["BL_339.4",339,[254,700,1162,1387]]]'>The Appellant also argues that he is entitled to a new trial for the reason that his trial counsel failed to provide him with effective assistance. Two claims of inadequate representation are based on trial counsel’s failure to call witnesses. The first of these witnesses, Appellant argues, would have testified that he had been awakened in the early morning of June 23, 1981 by screams coming from the back bedroom of the Goins residence, that at the time he heard the screams the bedroom window was closed, and that later he noticed that the window was open. According to the Appellant’s argument, this testimony would have supported the defense theory that an unknown burglar had entered the house, killed Susan Goins, and exited by way of the window. In view of the defendant’s testimony that he had left the front door of the house open when he went to meet his wife at the subway station, and the testimony that there were no signs of theft or forcible entry, the implausibility of the argument that an unknown burglar had entered and exited by way of a second floor window is so great that trial counsel’s failure to present a witness to support it cannot be deemed ineffective. Moreover the witness’s testimony as to the screams and other noises he heard would have corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to these facts. Counsel could well have decided not to present a witness whose testimony would have done more harm than good.</p>
    <p id="b339-5" data-blocks='[["BL_339.5",339,[252,2113,1158,260]],["BL_340.1",340,[241,330,1166,742]]]'>The other witnesses who should have been presented according to the Appellant would have testified that several months prior to the killing the Appellant had fractured his right thumb. This evidence, it is argued, would have gone toward establishing that the Appellant was unable to use <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>his right hand on the day of the crime. In addition to the fact that at least two points of the Appellant’s own testimony indicated that he was able to use his right hand (the Appellant testified that he tried to remove the hammer from his wife’s head with his right hand, yanking with sufficient force to splatter blood on his clothing), trial counsel testified at the evidentiary hearing that he had tried to grip a hammer and found that he did not need his thumb, even for landing blows such as those suffered by Susan Goins. We must agree with counsel’s assessment that the argument which might have been developed from these two witnesses’ testimony was “incredible and fantastic” and that “we would be laughed out of court with that.” Failure to pursue such a line of defense was clearly not ineffective.</p>
    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[237,1095,1176,956]]]'>The Appellant also challenges the adequacy of trial counsel’s representation for failure to introduce evidence argued to be exculpatory. The evidence in question is an' eight page F.B.I. report indicating that the latent fingerprints and palm prints lifted from the scene of the crime were not those of the Appellant. This claim must fail because the Commonwealth presented two fingerprint experts, one a Philadelphia police officer, the other an employee of the F.B.I., who testified that some of the fingerprints at the scene were from Mrs. Goins, while others did not match either the victim or the Appellant. The entry of the report on which this testimony was based would merely have been cumulative. Although the absence of the Appellant’s prints might have supported the defense theory that the Appellant was not the murderer, that theory would not have been furthered or strengthened by such duplicative evidence. Accordingly, counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for having failed to introduce it.</p>
    <p id="b340-6" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[236,2074,1163,311]],["BL_341.1",341,[255,304,1164,1612]]]'>Counsel is also argued to have provided ineffective assistance for failing to request a continuance in order to obtain an expert witness to rebut the testimony of the forensic scientist presented by the Commonwealth. Professor Herbert MacDonnell testified for the Commonwealth that the pattern of blood stains splattered about the house <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>and on the decedent’s clothing were consistent with her having been slain with great force. He also testified that the pattern of the stains on the Appellant’s clothes was inconsistent with the Appellant’s statement that the stains were caused by his hugging his wife’s dead body. Defense counsel first became aware that MacDonnell would testify for the Commonwealth during the course of the trial, although he did have the opportunity to interview MacDonnell prior to his direct testimony to discover what the substance of that testimony would be. At the evidentiary hearing counsel explained that he attempted to counter MacDonnell’s testimony solely by cross-examination, questioning his credentials, raising the issue of his fee, and bringing out that MacDonnell’s testimony was based on photographs, not direct observation of the scene. Counsel attempted to discount the opinion of the Commonwealth’s witness by suggesting that the jurors were as capable of drawing their own opinions from the photographs, and that it was somewhat ridiculous for an expert to claim that he could form such a detailed, definitive opinion on such a flimsy basis. That this method of impeachment was unsuccessful does not indicate that counsel was ineffective for pursuing it. The Appellant offers no indication that there even exists another forensic scientist capable of examining the pattern of blood stains, let alone that such an expert would have contradicted MacDonnell’s testimony. Without a showing that a continuance would have materially aided counsel in rebutting the testimony of the Commonwealth’s witness, we are unable to find counsel’s representation inadequate for failing to request a continuance.</p>
    <p id="b341-5" data-blocks='[["BL_341.4",341,[253,1941,1158,418]],["BL_342.1",342,[243,316,1171,1029]]]'>The final claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is based on the stipulation to the admissibility of photographs of the scene of the crime. These black-and-white photographs included one showing the hammer in the victim’s head. While we have consistently recognized the inflammatory potential of unduly gruesome photographs, <em>see e.g. Commonwealth v. Edwards, </em><a href="/pa/493/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="493 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="8732544" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0281-01">493 Pa. 281</a>, <a href="/pa/493/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="493 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="8732544" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0281-01">426 A.2d 550</a> (1981), and under other circumstances some or all of the <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>photographs now found objectionable might have been deemed inadmissible, in the context of this trial defense counsel cannot be considered ineffective for allowing them to be admitted. The entire defense theory of the case was that the Appellant returned to his house, found the battered body of his wife lying in the bedroom, blood on the floors and walls all around, and was in such a state of shock that he decided to take his own life by an overdose of pills. It was part of the strategy to impress upon the jury how .grisly the scene was so that they might better understand the Appellant’s reaction, as well as how the Appellant could have gotten blood on his clothing. Thus, within the context of the defense presented, counsel had a rational reason for stipulating to the admission of the photographs. He cannot be faulted simply because this strategy proved unsuccessful. <em>See Commonwealth v. Biebighauser, </em><a href="/pa/450/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="450 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1947078" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0336-01">450 Pa. 336</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=300%20A.2d%2070" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="300 A.2d 70">300 A.2d 70</a> (1973) (no harm from brief showing of nude photographs of victim, especially as they meshed with the defense presented).</p>

The court, however, overlooked the applicability of another rule of construction from which can be derived some understanding of legislative intent. “Words and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage____” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903. Following this precept, it is important to note that the statute reads “a significant history of felony convictions” rather than “a history of significant felony convictions.” The pertinent rule of grammar to be followed is that that modifier should be placed, if possible, next to the word to be modified. If the legislature had intended that the seriousness of the prior felonies be the measure of the aggravating circumstance, the latter construction would have been correctly used. The use of the former construction instead clearly demonstrates the intention that it be the defendant’s “history” of felony convictions which is “significant.” In this context it appears that the plural form “convictions” is intentionally used to the exclusion of the singular form “conviction.”</p>

It correctly holds that aggravating circumstance (d)(9), a “significant history of felony convictions involving use or threat of violence” (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711[d][9]), will not be triggered by a single such conviction. Any other interpretation would render 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(10) superfluous. I write separately, however, to point out that the single prior conviction involved in this case (the present equivalent of third-degree murder) satisfies the qualitative aspect of the statutory phrase “significant history” because of its close similarity to the conduct which resulted in the victim’s death in the present case.

Together they establish the definite, objective criteria which federal constitutional law requires of statutes authorizing capital punishment. <em>See Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, </em><a href="/pa/500/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="500 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="1781169" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0016-01">500 Pa. 16</a>, <a href="/pa/500/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="500 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="1781169" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0016-01">454 A.2d 937</a> (1982) . The term “murder” as used in the dissent by Mr. Justice Larsen is not a term used by the Legislature. It includes not only first and second degree murder, which could trigger capital punishment after a single conviction under § 9711(d)(10), but also third degree murder, which can be part of the significant history of convictions that authorizes the imposition of capital punishment under § 9711(d)(9). Thus, under the various subsections of § 9711(d), one concurrent conviction for either first or second degree murder will establish an aggravating circumstance, § 9711(d)(10), and two or more prior violent felonies may constitute a history which satisfies § 9711(d)(9). In addition, aggravating felonies which are concurrent with the capital crime or part of the transaction or occurrence which leads up to it are dealt with in § 9711(d)(6). That subsection places no limit on the number or kind of felonies which qualify and thus can be satisfied by a single concurrent felony. All other subsections of § 9711(d) describe circumstances coincident to a first degree murder which so aggravate it that the death penalty is warranted solely on the nature of the killing at bar. To speak in terms of murder generally casts us loose from the statute’s constitutional mooring in these precise and interlocking sets of aggravating circumstances.

Such a reading does injustice to the legislative intent which led to the concurrent enactment of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(10). Under this view, any single conviction for a violent felony would support a jury’s finding of the § 9711(d)(9) aggravating circumstance and there would be no need for § 9711(d)(10) and little for § 9711(d)(6). <em>Travaglia </em>should not be extended in such a manner.</p>

None of these definitions include a single third degree murder as such, and, I believe, the distinctions among them must be precisely observed and applied to avoid the vagueness and confusion which the Legislature went to such great pains to prevent.

In his post-verdict opinion, Judge Maimed made short work of this argument. Judge Maimed pointed to the governing rule of statutory construction, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1902, which provides that “the singular shall include the plural, and the plural the singular.” The reason for this rule is obvious; in common English usage, it is often awkward to use one form or the other. To assure that the most understandable phrasing would not result in wooden, semantical arguments over the intended meaning of such passages, the Legislature enacted Section 1902. Defendant’s attempt to read the death penalty statute as though § 1902 did not exist represents the very sort of stilted statutory interpretation the Legislature sought to avoid.</blockquote>

As of June 4, 1985, there have been twenty-seven convictions of murder of the first degree wherein the aggravating circumstance of significant history of felony convictions involving violence had been presented to the jury. Twenty-one of those cases resulted in the imposition' of the death penalty. My review of the data compiled in those cases indicates neither excessiveness nor disproportionality but, rather, individualized determinations tailored to the circumstances of the offenses and the character of the defendant.

His history now. includes the criminal taking of the lives of two innocent human beings. This history is now undeniable fact. The jury considered this historical fact and determined that it constituted a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence and, finding no mitigating circumstances to outweigh this aggravating circumstance, determined that Appellant be sentenced to death.

    <p id="b355-7" data-blocks='[["BL_355.6",355,[257,996,1160,421]]]'>The legislature has used the present tense “the defendant <em>has </em>(not <em>had) </em>a significant history” thus belieing any temporal restriction to a period before the latest conviction. The legislature uses the plural “convictions” for ease of expression. How stilted it would be to say, “the defendant has a significant history of a felony conviction.” Yet, the legislature has said exactly that, in better language, in aggravating circumstance (10).</p>
    <p id="b355-8" data-blocks='[["BL_355.7",355,[254,1442,1158,367]]]'>I can see nothing in the sentence used by the legislature which expressly or inferentially excludes from a jury’s consideration any of defendant’s felonious endeavors which involve the use or threat of violence to the person.

We must never lose sight of the fact that the jury could exercise its discretion in this hypothetical case and refuse to determine that a sentence of death be imposed. This discretionary aspect in aggravating circumstance (9) is what differentiates it from aggravating circumstance (10) which permits no exercise of discretion. Once it is established that the defendant has committed a felony for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death is imposable, “the verdict must be a sentence of death” in the absence of mitigating circumstances. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(iv).</p>

I would call upon the legislature to re-examine the issue and make the necessary amendments if it is found that the majority has misinterpreted the legislative intent.</p>
