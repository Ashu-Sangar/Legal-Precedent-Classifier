(See Model Penal Code Comment T.D. No. 8, pp. 5-10.) The defense of necessity, however, does not arise from a “choice” of several courses <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>of actions; instead it is based on a real emergency. It can be asserted only by an actor who is confronted with such a crisis as a personal danger (to oneself or others), a crisis which does not permit a selection from among several solutions, some of which do not involve criminal acts. <em>U.S. v.
