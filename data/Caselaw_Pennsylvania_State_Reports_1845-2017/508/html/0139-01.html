The Appellee was the only party present at this hearing. After advising the Appellee of her rights to be represented by an attorney, to cross-examine witnesses, and to present witnesses of her own, the referee entered the documents in the Appellee’s file into the record. He then stated that his was a willful misconduct case and that the “burglar-proof [sic] will fall upon your employer to show your ‘willful misconduct’.” The referee proceeded to question the Appellee and told her she would “have a chance to explain the circumstances which brought about your unemployment.” In response to the referee’s questioning the Appellee testified as to the events leading up to her dismissal. Her testimony was substantially similar to the explanation on the Summary of Interview Form. The primary difference was the Appellee’s explanation by way of her testimony that she was hired by Edward Goodman, Joseph Goodman’s father, and that she understood that Edward, not Joseph, was her immediate supervisor and boss. She further explained that she and Joseph were essentially co-workers, the Appellee carrying out the duties of a short order cook in the kitchen, running “the grill, the steam table, the deep frier, [and] the dressing table,” while Joseph Goodman took care of the cold sandwiches in the front of the restaurant.</p>

On appeal, the Board of Review affirmed the referee’s decision.

The Board also found that the Appellee’s contention that she was not aware of the supervisory capacity of the person issuing the order was not credible. Even though the employer did not attend the referee’s hearing, the Board determined that the Appellee’s voluntary testimony carried the employer’s burden of establishing her willful misconduct, citing <em>Rodgers v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>40 Pa. Cmwlth. 552, <a href="/citations/?q=397%20A.2d%201286" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="397 A.2d 1286">397 A.2d 1286</a> (1979).</p>

    <p id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.5",207,[260,1173,1171,1193]]]'>In <em>Harring v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>70 Pa.Cmwlth. 173, <a href="/citations/?q=452%20A.2d%20914" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="452 A.2d 914">452 A.2d 914</a> (1982), the court held that a negative inference from a party’s refusal to testify, although permissible for other purposes, could not be considered as “evidence” established by the party with the burden of proof. The only evidence offered on behalf of the employer was a hearsay letter. Absent the inference from the claimant’s silence, there was no corroboration of the hearsay evidence as required under <em>Walker v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>27 Pa.Cmwlth. 522, <a href="/citations/?q=367%20A.2d%20366" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="367 A.2d 366">367 A.2d 366</a> (1976), and thus no basis for a finding that the burden of proof had been met. The court accordingly reversed and remanded for the computation of benefits. In the present case, the court reasoned that the substantive rule of <em>Harring </em>would have applied if the uncounseled claimant had been aware of her “right” to remain silent in the face of uncorroborated hearsay which by itself could not have supported a finding in favor of the employer. Therefore, “in the interest of justice and fairness” the court fashioned the rule requiring the referee to explain that the claimant is not required to testify and that his testimony could be used to support a determination of ineligibility.</p>

At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that a sufficient record is made to ascertain that a proper determination has been made. In the present context, we find it highly significant that “the tribunal shall determine the order in which the evidence shall be presented.” In the strictly adversarial court proceeding, the party assigned the burden of proof proceeds first and must produce sufficient evidence to make a prima facie case. The failure to meet that burden relieves the opposing party of any obligation to <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>respond in order to win judgment. The same result cannot hold, however, where the tribunal may alter the order of presentation. In such a situation, the assignment of the burden of proof to one or the other party can only be understood as an indication of the quantum of evidence required to sustain a result in that party’s favor. The question of the sufficiency of the evidence to meet the burden must be examined against the complete record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The effect of the claimant’s testimony remains the same whether presented before or after the employer’s evidence.</p>

We observe that the Unemployment Compensation Law even limits the invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination as a basis for refusing to testify before a tribunal by extending a grant of immunity from prosecution based on such testimony. 43 P.S. § 828. It follows as a matter of course that the Commonwealth Court erred in requiring referees to explain that where the employer has the burden of proof the claimant is not required to testify. The regulations adopted by the Board and the statute enacted by the General Assembly make it clear that the claimant <em>can </em>be <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>required to testify in such circumstances, that there is no “right to remain silent.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

To require the referee to advise the claimant as to the strength of his case at any point in the hearing because he is not represented by counsel “casts the referee in the role of surrogate counsel and advocate for the claimant.” 81 Pa.Cmwlth. 189, 194, <a href="/citations/?q=473%20A.2d%20237" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="473 A.2d 237">473 A.2d 237</a>, 239 (Doyle, J. dissenting). As observed by Judge Doyle in his Dissenting Opinion the employer here was uncounseled as well by virtue of his absence. Consistent reasoning “in the interest of justice and fairness” would require the referee to advise the employer, in the face of the claimant’s silence, that his burden had not been met and that further evidence would be required if his position were to be sustained. This entire scenario is contrary to reason and goes far beyond the requirement that the referee be impartial in giving assistance to unrepresented parties. It is, we believe, preferable to simply recognize, as the Commonwealth Court has previously done, that “any layperson choosing to represent himself in a legal proceeding must, to some reasonable extent, assume the risk that his lack of expertise and legal training will prove his undoing.” <em>Groch v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>81 Pa.Cmwlth. 26, 30, <a href="/citations/?q=472%20A.2d%20286" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="472 A.2d 286">472 A.2d 286</a>, 288 (1984).</p>

Al<a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>though it is not always clear which of multiple questions should be addressed and which left unconsidered because of the disposition of those questions addressed, under the present circumstances it would have been preferable for the court to have first determined whether the evidence in the hearing which occurred was sufficient to support the legal conclusion of willful misconduct. Only in the event that such evidence was considered sufficient would it have been necessary to decide whether the evidence was all properly entered or obtained. The rule adopted by the court calls into question numerous previous rulings in related cases, e.g. <em>Rohrbach v. U.C.B.R., </em>69 Pa.Cmwlth. 172, <a href="/citations/?q=450%20A.2d%20323" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="450 A.2d 323">450 A.2d 323</a> (1982) (referee need not advise claimant of hearsay nature of certain evidence introduced into record); <em>DeMeno v.

It also impinges upon the rules of procedure adopted by the Board, e.g. 34 Pa.Code §§ 101.21, 101.51, 101.52, and in essence creates a new rule of procedure which the Board has otherwise not seen fit to adopt. This latter result is effectuated “in the interest of justice and fairness” despite the absence of any finding, or reasoning supporting a conclusion, that the procedures in operation violate fundamental due process guarantees. Such a drastic consequence should not have been reached if, on the record already developed, it might have been determined that the legal conclusion reached was unsupported.</p>

In further support of this holding we rejected the Board’s argument that waiver was inappropriate because of the informal, "nonadversarial” nature of the proceedings. We observed that previous cases had allocated burdens of proof with respect to the issues arising in unemployment cases and stated that this "created” an adversary system. Whatever the full import of this broadly stated dictum, it cannot be read to require that the “strictly adversarial” judicial system must be replicated in the administrative process of the unemployment compensation system. The General Assembly has explicitly provided otherwise, subject only to the limitations of fundamental due process. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 825.</p>

Whether the referee in that case should have required the claimant to testify is a question peculiar to the facts of that case and one which we may not presently review. To the extent that the decision in <em>Harring </em>may be read to mean that a claimant has a “right to remain silent” in the face of questioning, however, it is disapproved.</p>

It is clear that an unemployment compensation referee has an obligation to advise uncounseled claimants of their rights. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20101.21" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="34 Pa.

In order to fulfill this obligation, a referee must advise a claimant of his right to be represented by counsel, to offer witnesses, and to cross-examine adverse witnesses. <em>Unemployment Compensation Board v.

Nevertheless, the advice at issue in this case — a simple statement concerning the employer’s burden of proof and how that burden may be met — is more similar to the advice which a referee is already required to give an uncounseled claimant — a statement concerning the <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>claimant’s right to be represented by counsel and to present and cross-examine witnesses — than it is to such matters as evidentiary questions or points of law, on which a referee is not required to advise a claimant. While advice concerning evidentiary matters would require the referee to evaluate the evidence sought to be admitted and to give the claimant legal counsel as to the admissibility of that evidence, a cautionary statement concerning the employer’s burden of proof and how that burden may be met, like a statement concerning the right to be represented by counsel or to present and cross-examine witnesses, requires no evaluation of a particular case by the referee, but is the same in every case as a matter of law. Thus, an obligation to advise an uncounseled claimant as to the employer’s burden of proof and how that burden may be met would not interfere with the referee’s obligation to remain impartial.</p>
