The Board’s action was taken pursuant to Section 14(3) of the Professional Nursing Law, Act of May 22, 1951, P.L. 317, <em>as amended, </em>63 P.S. § 224(3), which provides that the Board may suspend or revoke any license where the Board shall find that “the licensee has wilfully or repeatedly violated any of the provisions of th[e] act or of the regulations of the Board.”</p>

She was responsible for the care of patient Richard Bartus during the shift from 11 p.m. on November 1, 1978 to 7 a.m. on November 2, 1978. Following surgery, the patient had developed serious complications which left him comatose and in respiratory distress. His pupils were fixed and dilated and he was unresponsive to deep pain stimuli. His respiration was maintained on a Bennett MA-I Respirator, while his blood pressure was maintained by the infusion of dopamine. The patient was presumed to be brain dead, but this status had not been conclusively established at the time of Appellee’s shift. The results of two electroencephalograms had not been attached yet to his chart. The patient did not have a “no code” order in his chart. It was the Hospital’s policy that in case of respiratory or cardiac failure that all efforts for resuscitation were to be attempted, unless a “no code” order was documented.</p>

The Appellee was aware of the patient’s condition from this review. She was also aware that the patient had “coded” recently and that the cause of the code was that he had suffered primary respiratory failure. The Board further found that at approximately 3:30 a.m., the Appellee remarked to Jeffrey Cameron, another registered nurse, that she was going to bathe the patient and proceeded to his room. Prior to the bath, Appellee checked and recorded the patient’s vital signs, disconnected the ventilator from his endotracheal tube, suctioned the secretions which were present, and reconnected the ventilator. During the suctioning procedure, there were no signs that indicated the patient was assisting ventilation.</p>

She determined they were not life-threatening after viewing the monitor and proceeded with the bath.

    <p id="b631-5" data-blocks='[["BL_631.5",631,[220,1569,1160,529]]]'>Appellee performed the test by adjusting the ventilation so that the patient was given two to three deep breaths of 100 percent oxygen, then removing the ventilator tubing from his endotracheal tube and laying it across his chest, and observing him for any signs of movement. During the test, the patient was off the ventilator for a period in excess of thirty seconds during which time he was deprived of pure oxygen and placed on room air. The Appellee did not touch the patient or administer any type of care during the test. The patient displayed no signs of spontaneous respiration.</p>

Noting that the cardiac monitor registered asystole (i.e. lack of heartbeat), Cameron told the Appellee to call the code and began to ventilate the patient. Instead, the Appellee called a third registered nurse, Mary Johnston, who immediately administered CPR. The Appellee was told once again to call the code. She then left the room, called the neurosurgical resident on duty, and then called the code. The code team arrived while Johnston and Cameron were attempting to resuscitate the patient. The code was terminated after the code leader received a call from a physician. The resuscitation attempt was unsuccessful, and the patient was pronounced dead at 4:20 a.m.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b634-5" data-blocks='[["BL_634.6",634,[254,816,1167,1288]]]'>We approve of the Commonwealth Court’s statement in <em>Leukhardt, </em><a href="/citations/?q=403%20A.2d%20645" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="403 A.2d 645">supra,</a> of the definition of “wilful” under § 14(3) as “an intentional, designed act and one without justifiable excuse.” The Commonwealth Court erred here, however, in holding that the Board must prove a specific intent to violate the act or its rules and regulations in order to establish a wilful violation. Such a holding disregards the very purpose of the Board of insuring “safe nursing services for the <em>citizens </em>of the Commonwealth.” <a href="/citations/?q=49%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2021.3" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="49 Pa.

Code § 21.3">49 Pa. Code § 21.3</a>(2). An interpretation of the term “wilful” which incorporates an element of the nurse’s motivation would subordinate the interest in patient care to that of policing a nurse’s conduct. It would then become irrelevant whether the nurse’s action exposed a patient to unsafe nursing services as long as the unacceptable action was not intended to violate the act or regulations. Not only would this be an unintended result of the statutory language, it is contrary to the unambiguous statement of the Board’s purpose.</p>

    <p id="b635-4" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[212,669,1160,793]]]'>The Commonwealth introduced the testimony of Isabelle Stanshine, a registered nurse employed at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital from June, 1977 to April, 1980. Qualified as an expert in the field of critical care, Stanshine testified that there were limited instances in which a nurse could properly remove a patient from a respirator — e.g. to transport a patient or during a suctioning procedure. She stated, however, that the Appellee’s actions in taking a patient in a comatose condition off the respirator was not one of those limited instances and was a deviation from acceptable nursing standards. [R. 155a-161a; 321a]. Stanshine further testified that spontaneous respiration should not be evaluated by a nurse and that it was not a nursing function at the Hospital. [R. 165a-166a; 314a-316a],</p>
    <p id="b635-6" data-blocks='[["BL_635.5",635,[209,1482,1160,527]]]'>Stanshine’s expert opinion that removing a comatose patient from a respirator was inappropriate was reiterated by the Appellee’s own expert witness, Kenneth Lawler, a supervisor of nursing at the Hospital. Lawler also testified that it would be appropriate for a nurse to check for spontaneous respiration under certain circumstances — e.g., a patient showed signs of becoming conscious. [R. 202a-203a]. Lawler stated that such a test would be improper, however, when a comatose patient did not display signs of activity. [R. 207a-208a].</p>

This method assures that a patient is not deprived of oxygen. The method used by Appellee is to <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>be used only when a previously unconscious patient shows signs of regaining consciousness. It is contraindicated and an unacceptable procedure for the patient under Appellee’s care. [Findings of Fact Nos. 49-51]. The Board’s conclusion that the Appellee’s conduct was a wilful violation of § 21.11(a)(4) was amply supported by the record.</p>
    <p id="b636-4" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[249,643,1166,587]]]'>The Board concluded that the Appellee’s failure to perform external cardiac resuscitation and artificial respiration was a wilful violation of <a href="/citations/?q=49%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2021.13" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="49 Pa. Code § 21.13">49 Pa. Code § 21.13</a>, as well as § 21.11(a)(4). Section 21.13 was intended, however, as a limitation of the individuals who may perform resuscitation and respiration and the circumstances under which they may be performed. Appellee’s failure to undertake such efforts although qualified to do so was a wilful violation of § 21.11(a)(4), but was not a wilful violation of § 21.13. Therefore, the Board’s finding that Appellee’s actions wilfully violated § 21.13 is not supported by the record.</p>

It was undisputed that the cardiac monitor strip documenting the rare PVCs was not attached to the patient’s chart. Although Appellee recognized the importance of charting the abnormal pattern, she testified that the strip had been thrown out. She stated this had been done at the order of Isabelle Stanshine [R. 296a-297a]. Stanshine refuted this testimony. She testified it was the Hospital’s policy to save the strip whenever a change occurred. [R. 313a]. It is apparent that the Board resolved the issue of credibility against the Appellee. Her expert testimony indicated that upon noting that the patient exhibited rare PVCs, it is the nurse’s responsibility (1) to refer to the patient’s chart to determine if similar PVCs had been documented; (2) to immediately document the PVCs; and (3) to observe for increasing frequency to determine if a trend is present. [R. 161a-162a]. Appellee failed to do so.</p>

Both testified that the Appellee failed to respond to instructions to call a code until commanded to do so for a second time.

Nevertheless, she abandoned the patient when the PVCs were shown on the monitor. Her response was improper as she should not have left the patient. [R. 163a].
