The majority holds that this argument “is of no aid since this implies a subjective standard and, in any event, this misadvice, if that it be, cannot be imputed in any way to appellee, Mezrow.” Slip op. at 6. I believe this holding fundamentally and erroneously misperceives the thrust of appellant’s argument. Her argument implies the opposite of a subjective standard; she is claiming that when she sought the help of an objective specialist, Dr. Casullo, for her dental problems, he failed to inform her that her disease might have stemmed from Dr. Mezrow’s conduct, and instead told her the disease was the result of a natural disease process. At that point, after a second doctor had told her, in effect, that her problems had not been caused or worsened by a first doctor’s treatment, what further steps could she reasonably be expected to <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>take to ascertain the true cause of her injury? <em>See and compare DeMartino v.

There Taylor had undergone a laminectomy in April 1972; soon thereafter 1) Taylor noticed increased pain in his back; 2) Taylor noticed pain radiating through his right leg, an area which had not been subject to pain before; 3) immediately after the operation a doctor told Taylor he should be able to return to work in a few months, yet Taylor was unable to return to work and in late 1972 was declared totally disabled by the Social Security Administration; 4) beginning in November 1972 Taylor sought treatment from doctors other than those who had performed the surgery; 5) in late 1973 or early 1974 other surgeons performed a second laminectomy on Taylor’s back. Despite these occurrences Taylor testified that he did not become aware nor was he advised that he had received improper medical care until January 1976, when he was so advised by his lawyer. Taylor commenced suit on September 14,1976, 4V2 years after the original operation. The trial court granted summary judgment, holding that <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>the two-year statute of limitations barred recovery.
