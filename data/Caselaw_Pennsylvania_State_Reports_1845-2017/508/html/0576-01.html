The context for the use of the term “public employer” in Act 111 could not be clearer.

There is an implicit suggestion that PHA security officers substitute for the Philadelphia police in these public housing units. We note <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>that the responsibility for police protection within the city limits, including the housing projects, is vested in the City’s police force. <em>See </em>Philadelphia Home Rule Charter § 5.5-200, 201, 351 Pa.Code § 5.5-200, 201. The PHA is designed to augment and not to replace the Philadelphia Police Force in these areas. This augmentation is justified by the greater incidence of criminal activity within these areas. To allow the PHA security force to replace the Philadelphia Police Force in these areas defeats the purpose of the creation of this security force.</p>

Mandatory binding interest arbitration in the event of a collective bargaining impasse ensures the prompt implementation of terms and conditions governing the employment relationship, thereby compensating for the loss of the right to strike. A constitutional amendment was passed in 1967 to permit this binding procedure. Pa. Const. Art. III, § 31.</p>
