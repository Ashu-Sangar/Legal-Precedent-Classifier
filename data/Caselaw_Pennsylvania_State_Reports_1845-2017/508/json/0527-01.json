        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nHUTCHINSON, Justice.\nAppellant was arrested on August 18, 1982 and charged with criminal homicide, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2501, in the death of his girlfriend, Karen Meeker. Appellant was tried before a jury and convicted of first-degree murder, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a). After the separate sentencing hearing required by our death penalty statute, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711, appellant was sentenced to death. This direct appeal followed. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 722(4) and 9711(h). Based on the arguments raised by appellant and our independent review of the case as required by Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, 500 Pa. 16, 454 A.2d 937 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 970, 103 S.Ct. 2444, 77 L.Ed.2d 1327 (1983), we affirm the conviction for first-degree murder but vacate the death sentence.\nAppellant and Mrs. Meeker, his victim, had lived together approximately two years. Mrs. Meeker\u2019s previous marriage ended in divorce, finalized shortly after she moved in with appellant. Her relationship with appellant was not always a happy one, and she occasionally broke it off, only to return at a later time. Disagreements between appellant and the victim\u2019s family led appellant to file criminal charges against members of Mrs. Meeker\u2019s family. The victim herself had charged appellant with destroying some of her property. These charges were still pending at her death, although she had attempted to withdraw her complaint.\nThe day she was killed, the victim was seen in several places with appellant. They were seen arguing, although nobody could give any specifics about the arguments. At about 3:30 p.m. the victim was discovered lying by the side of a country road. She had been shot and mortally wounded. Her intestines were protruding from her abdomen, and she had lost quite a bit of blood. She was helped by Claudia Rice, who happened to be driving in the area. Mrs. Rice left to call for help. She returned with Ed Crafton who also was in the area. The two of them were talking with the victim in an attempt to calm her until help arrived. During these conversations, the victim identified appellant as the one who shot her. She said appellant asked her to come into the woods so he could show her something and then shot her at close range. The victim also made similar statements to the paramedics and ambulance attendants, the doctor at the hospital and several of her relatives. The victim died during surgery shortly after the police had arrested appellant.\nAppellant first claims that the trial court improperly admitted the statements made by the victim just before her death. In all those statements she identified appellant as her killer. The standard rule for the admissibility of such statements are that the declarant believes that she is going to die, that death is imminent, and that death actually results. Commonwealth v. Miller, 490 Pa. 457, 417 A.2d 128 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1113, 101 S.Ct. 924, 66 L.Ed.2d 842 (1981); Commonwealth v. Little, 469 Pa. 83, 364 A.2d 915 (1976). The declarant need not say specifically that she will die, Commonwealth v. Hawkins, 448 Pa. 206, 292 A.2d 302 (1972), nor must she say it to every witness who testifies. The belief in impending death can be inferred from the surrounding circumstances without a direct statement of that belief by the witnesses. Commonwealth v. Gause, 459 Pa. 595, 330 A.2d 856 (1975). The admissibility of those statements is a matter of trial court discretion. Commonwealth v. Bastone, 466 Pa. 548, 353 A.2d 827 (1976). However, once admitted, the jury determines what weight they should be given. Id.\nThe court below held an evidentiary hearing out of the jury\u2019s presence to determine whether the statements incriminating appellant were admissible. Four witnesses testified at that hearing. Claudia Rice stated that Mrs. Meeker told her she was not going to make it. Ed Crafton, who also helped at the scene of the crime, corroborated that testimony. The ambulance attendant testified that the victim also told him she was dying. The doctor testified that when the victim reached the hospital she knew that she had a protruding wound in her abdomen. From all of this testimony, it is apparent that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the victim believed her own death was imminent. Therefore, the testimony was competent and properly admitted.\nAppellant also argues that because there were some inconsistencies among the various statements made by the victim the testimony should have been excluded. However, inconsistency is not a proper basis for excluding dying declarations. Commonwealth v. Douglas, 461 Pa. 749, 337 A.2d 860 (1975). Once the court has ruled on the inadmissibility, the jury is free to determine whether or not to believe them, in whole or in part. Bastone, supra. Here, the victim was consistent in identifying appellant as the person who shot her. The inconsistencies on other matters went to weight, not admissibility, and apparently did not destroy the jurors\u2019 belief that the victim correctly identified the appellant as her assailant. There was no error in admitting the victim\u2019s statements.\nAppellant also contends that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury that the prosecution had the burden of proving an absence of passion as an element of first-degree murder. The requested instruction is said to be required by Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975). Mullaney held, based on In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970), that the prosecution must prove absence of passion beyond a reasonable doubt in order to avoid reducing a homicide from murder to voluntary manslaughter, which is defined as a killing committed during the heat of passion, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2503(a).\nMullaney states, however, that the issue of passion must be properly presented before the instruction is required:\n[T]he Due Process Clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of the heat of passion on sudden provocation when the issue is properly presented in a homicide case.\nMullaney, supra, at 704, 95 S.Ct. at 1892. See Commonwealth v. Upsher, 497 Pa. 621, 444 A.2d 90 (1982) (defendant must present \u201csome evidence\u201d of self-defense before prosecution is required to prove absence of self-defense); but see Commonwealth v. Stoyko, 504 Pa. 455, 475 A.2d 714, cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 361, 83 L.Ed.2d 297 (1984) (evidence of intoxication places no new burden on prosecution). In the instant case, appellant has not presented any credible evidence to support his \u201cheat of passion\u201d contention. Thus, his requested jury instruction was properly denied.\nWe have defined the heat of passion as including \u201cany emotions of the mind known as anger, rage, sudden resentment or terror, rendering the mind incapable of cool reflection.\u201d Commonwealth v. Harris, 472 Pa. 406, 408, 372 A.2d 757, 758-59 (1977) (per curiam). The only evidence presented to support the finding of passion was that the victim and appellant had a stormy love affair and that they had been seen arguing the morning the victim was killed. This is insufficient to show the passion required to reduce a murder to manslaughter. Appellant also cites testimony indicating that he was sick and tired of their fighting. N.T. 201, 208, 214. When viewed in context, however, that testimony also fails to present the issue of legally sufficient passion. Indeed, it seems to cut the other way:\nShe said he has told her he wanted to show her something up in the woods and when she got up there, he went down in the woods, picked up a gun and told her he was tired of fighting with her, is what she indicated and then he shot her.\nN.T. at 201 (testimony of William Flexman).\n[S]he said my boyfriend shot me, well, a friend and she said he wanted to go for a walk in the woods. She said if I\u2019d known he had a gun then I wouldn\u2019t have gone. He stepped into the woods and produced a gun and turned around and said I\u2019m tired of your f \u2014 ing around on me and shot her.\nN.T. at 208 (testimony of Max Crandall).\nShe said they were driving up Moody Hollow Road, talking about some previous charges against us and he just pulled off the road. He got out and he called her out to the edge of the road and she said that he said that I\u2019m sick and tired of you and your shit and then he shot her and she said she heard the truck drive away.\nN.T. at 214 (testimony of Jonathan Watson). This testimony does not show the sudden provocation required by our cases. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Horne, 479 Pa. 496, 388 A.2d 1040 (1978); Commonwealth v. Whitfield, 475 Pa. 297, 380 A.2d 362 (1977); Commonwealth v. Mason, 474 Pa. 308, 378 A.2d 807 (1977); Harris, supra. Instead, it is relevant to show appellant acted willfully in killing the victim.\nThe court\u2019s instruction on voluntary manslaughter did state that the jury could only find malice if:\nyou are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the [appellant] was not acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by the victim or under an unreasonable belief that the circumstances were such that if they had existed or if they existed [sic] would have justified the killing.\nN.T. at 281. This instruction adequately states the proper burden of proof in this case. Therefore, the requested instruction was unnecessary. Since we have found no error in the finding of guilt, his conviction of first-degree murder must be affirmed.\nHaving decided the jury properly found appellant guilty of first degree murder, we now turn to the question of whether the death penalty the jurors imposed in this case can be upheld. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h) states that the sentence shall be affirmed unless we find that it was the product of passion, prejudice or other arbitrary factor, that the evidence does not support the statutory aggravating circumstances, or that the sentence is disproportionate to sentences in other similar cases.\nAt the separate sentencing hearing conducted in this case, the prosecution presented evidence as to only one aggravating circumstance, viz., a significant history of felony convictions involving the use of threat or violence to the person. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9). The only evidence produced was one prior conviction for voluntary manslaughter.\nIn Commonwealth v. Goins, 508 Pa. 270, 495 A.2d 527 (1985), we held that a single prior conviction for the equivalent of third-degree murder, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(c), was legally insufficient to constitute a \u201csignificant history of felony convictions\u201d under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9). This case is identical to Goins except the prior conviction is voluntary-manslaughter, a lesser degree of homicide than that at issue in Goins. Therefore, we must, as we did in Goins, vacate the death sentence.\nJudgment of conviction affirmed; judgment of sentence vacated. Case remanded to Court of Common Pleas of McKean County for imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment.\nLARSEN, J., files a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nMcDERMOTT, J., files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which LARSEN and PAPADAKOS, JJ., join.\nPAPADAKOS, J., files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which LARSEN, J., joins.\n. The admission of the statements also satisfies us on our independent review of sufficiency required by Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, supra. In Zettlemoyer, we stated that in each death penalty case we would determine whether there was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction for first degree murder. In Commonwealth v. Riggins, 478 Pa. 222, 386 A.2d 520 (1978), we stated dying declarations are sufficient by themselves to sustain a conviction. Therefore, the evidence in this case is sufficient.\n. See Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977), and Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982). Patterson does not elaborate on what the defense must do to meet its burden of \u201cnegation.\u201d\n. The dissents correctly point out that the proper application of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9) is difficult. Commonwealth v. Goins, 508 Pa. 270, 495 A.2d 527 (1985); see also Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 502 Pa. 474, 467 A.2d 288 (1983), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 3547, 82 L.Ed.2d 850 (1984). However, their solution seems to us to dispense with the ordinary implication of the word \"history,\" the use of the word \"conviction\u201d in its plural number and the presence of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(10) in our death penalty statute. One of the dissents points out, in hypotheticals, some of the anomalies presented by the legislature\u2019s attempt to capture in precise words the heinous crimes which warrant the final penalty of death. Reasonable precision appears required by decisions of the federal judiciary. The solution to the problems the dissents point out, therefore, lies with the legislature.",

        "text": "LARSEN, Justice,\nconcurring and dissenting.\nIf the death penalty is a deterrent, and I believe that it is; and if the death penalty serves the societal need for retribution, and I believe that it does; and if the death penalty serves the cathartic needs of the survivors of a murder victim, and I believe that it does; and since the death penalty prevents the murderer from murdering again; then the majority today has ignored and frustrated these important objectives and purposes of the Pennsylvania death penalty statute by establishing that a murderer such as appellant must be convicted of murder or manslaughter three times before he will be eligible to receive the death penalty. Surely the Legislature did not intend this result.\nAs I believe the majority\u2019s interpretation of subsection (d)(9), 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d)(9), thwarts the legislative intent and that the jury in this case properly determined that appellant\u2019s two convictions for murder and manslaughter (i.e., the current conviction for murder of the first degree and the prior conviction for voluntary manslaughter) constitutes a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence, I dissent to the majority\u2019s decision to vacate the sentence of death and remand for imposition of a life sentence. I concur in the affirmance of appellant\u2019s convictions.\nWe have held that the jury may consider, as evidence of the aggravating circumstances specified in subsections (d)(9) and (d)(10), a conviction not yet \u201cfinal\u201d because the defendant has not been sentenced for that conviction or because his conviction was on appeal. Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 502 Pa. 474, 467 A.2d 288 (1983); Commonwealth v. Beasley, 505 Pa. 279, 479 A.2d 460 (1984); Commonwealth v. Morales, 508 Pa. 51, 494 A.2d 367 (1985). This same principle would permit a jury to consider the murder of the first degree conviction which it has just returned as part of a defendant\u2019s significant history of violent felony convictions. It requires only a straightforward application of the language of subsection (d)(9) to affirm the jury\u2019s finding in this case \u2014 two homicide convictions (for murder and manslaughter) surely may constitute a \u201csignificant history of felony convictions involving ... violence to the person.\u201d\nThe majority relies upon Commonwealth v. Goins, 508 Pa. 270, 495 A.2d 527 (1985) (Hutchinson, J., concurring; Larsen, J., concurring and dissenting; Papadakos, J., concurring and dissenting), which in effect rewrites the statute by insertion of the concept \u201cmore than one prior\u201d violent felony conviction into the aggravating circumstance set forth in subsection (d)(9); that is, the majority in Goins and in the instant case has interpreted that subsection to read \u201csignificant history of more than one prior felony conviction\u201d involving violence to the person. This modification is improper. The legislative history cited by the majority in Goins to support its interpretation of subsection (d)(9) actually supports the interpretation that \u201csignificant history of felony convictions involving ... violence\u201d includes the conviction for which the defendant has just been tried. The majority in Goins notes \u201cthat the Senate had previously rejected an amendment ... which included as an aggravating circumstance that \u2018[t]he defendant was previously convicted of another murder or a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person.\u2019 1978 Legislative Journal \u2014 Senate at 103 (Emphasis added).\u201d 508 Pa. at 284, 495 A.2d at 534. The legislature refined the concepts expressed in the rejected amendment and, instead, split this proposed aggravating circumstance into two subsections, namely (d)(9) and (d)(10).\nThe concept of \u201canother murder\u201d was embodied in subsection (d)(10) which states that it is an aggravating circumstance where the \u201cdefendant has been convicted of another Federal or State offense, committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue, for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable____\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d)(10). In contrast, the concept of \u201ca felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person\u201d was finalized as subsection (d)(9) which establishes an aggravating circumstance where the \u201cdefendant has a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d)(9). Under subsection (d)(10), therefore, the defendant\u2019s \u201ccurrent\u201d conviction for murder of the first degree cannot establish that aggravating circumstance because it is not another offense for which a sentence of death or life imprisonment is imposable. However, as the final version of the significant violent felony aggravating circumstance contains no similar limiting language (such as \u201canother\u201d, \u201cother\u201d or \u201cprior\u201d felony convictions involving violence), the legislature must have considered a defendant\u2019s \u201ccurrent\u201d conviction to constitute part of his significant history of felony convictions involving violence.\nFurther indication that the legislature intentionally omitted the concept of \u201cprior\u201d or \u201cother\u201d from subsection (d)(9) is gleaned from the mitigating circumstance of subsection (e)(1), that the \u201cdefendant has no significant history of prior criminal convictions.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(e)(1). Given the rejection of the amendment discussed above (which would have established an aggravating circumstance where the defendant had been \u201cpreviously \u201d convicted of ... a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person\u201d), the use of the language \u201canother Federal or State offense\u201d in subsection (d)(10), the use of the language \u201csignificant history of prior criminal convictions\u201d in subsection (e)(1), and the conspicuous absence of similar language in subsection (d)(9), I believe it clear that the majority has thwarted the legislative intent by interpreting (d)(9) to read \u201csignificant history of more than one prior felony conviction involving ... violence\u201d, in place of \u201csignificant history of felony convictions involving ... violence.\u201d\nFinally, this Court is required to review each sentence of death to determine whether it is \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases\u201d. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(h)(3)(iii). To that end, we have directed the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts to compile and monitor an on-going, comprehensive death penalty study dealing with all aspects of cases of murder of the first degree. Commonwealth v. Frey, 304 Pa. 428, 475, A.2d 700, 707-08 (1984), cert. denied \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 360, 83 L.Ed.2d 296 (1984). This study greatly facilitates our obligation to ensure that the death penalty sentencing procedures achieve their purpose of limiting and channeling the discretion of the sentencer so as to minimize the risk of arbitrary and capricious sentencing. Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862, 103 S.Ct. 2733, 2741 (1983). Should our review disclose an arbitrary and capricious result in cases dealing with the aggravating circumstance of subsection (d)(9), this Court would then determine whether the application of the circumstance \u201csignificant history of felony convictions involving ... violence to the person\u201d is constitutionally infirm.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would hold that, for purposes of subsection (d)(9), the jury (or judge) may consider the defendant\u2019s contemporaneous conviction for murder of the first degree as part of his or her \u201csignificant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence\u201d, and I would affirm the sentence of death based thereon.\n. Goins held that it was \"the manifest intent of the General Assembly to include as an aggravating circumstance more than one prior violent-felony conviction....\u201d 508 Pa. at 284, 495 A.2d at 534. See also id., 508 Pa. at 281-283, 495 A.2d at 533 (\"it is important to note that the statute reads \u2018a significant history of felony convictions\u2019 rather than \u2018a history of significant felony convictions.\u2019 The pertinent rule of grammar to be followed is that that modifier should be placed, if possible, next to the word to be modified. If the legislature had intended that the seriousness of the prior felonies be the measure of the aggravating circumstance, the latter construction would have been correctly used.\u201d)\n. The majority\u2019s interpretation of subsection (d)(9) would also seem to conflict with this Court\u2019s recent decision in Commonwealth v. Szuchon, 506 Pa. 228, 484 A.2d 1365 (1984). In that case, a majority of this Court stated (albeit in dictum) that it was proper for the lower court to leave it to the jury to determine whether or not a defendant with a single prior conviction for robbery could be considered to have \u201cno significant history of prior criminal convictions\u201d under subsection (e)(1).\n. Moreover, the majority in Goins erred in rejecting the lower court\u2019s application of the \u2018singular/plural\u2019 rule of construction. The majority rejects this unambiguous rule of construction based upon some perceived \u201cpertinent rule of grammar\u201d which dictates, apparently, where \u201cmodifiers\u201d must be placed, and the consequences of such placement. Such construction of the statute by resort to perceived rules of grammar, see note 1, supra (for which rule no authority, source or reference is given) highlights the concern expressed in the Commonwealth\u2019s brief in Goins:\n[D]efendant argues that the word \"convictions\u201d clearly reveals the Legislature\u2019s intention to require a history of at least two convictions. In his post-verdict opinion, Judge Maimed made short work of this argument. Judge Maimed pointed to the governing rule of statutory construction, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1902, which provides that \"the singular shall include the plural, and the plural the singular.\u201d The reason for this rule is obvious; in common English usage, it is often awkward to use one form or the other. To assure that the most understandable phrasing would not result in wooden, semantical arguments over the intended meaning of such passages, the Legislature enacted Section 1902. Defendant\u2019s attempt to read the death penalty statute as though \u00a7 1902 did not exist represents the very sort of stilted statutory interpretation the Legislature sought to avoid.\nCommonwealth v. Goins, supra, Brief for Appellee at 8. Rather than indulge in such artificial, semantical arguments over placement of modifiers to arrive at the intended meaning of \"significant history of felony convictions involving ... violence,\u201d I would leave it to the common sense and wisdom of the jury to determine whether a murderer\u2019s record reveals such a significant history as to warrant the death penalty.\n. As of June 4, 1985, there have been twenty-seven convictions of murder of the first degree wherein the aggravating circumstance of significant history of felony convictions involving violence had been presented to the jury. Twenty-one of those cases resulted in the imposition of the death penalty. My review of the data compiled in those cases indicates neither excessiveness nor disproportionality but, rather, individualized determinations tailored to the circumstances of the offenses and the character of the defendant. In short, the aggravating circumstance of subsection (d)(9) has served its function of limiting and channeling the discretion of the sentencer to avoid arbitrary and capricious sentencing.",

        "text": "McDERMOTT, Justice,\nconcurring and dissenting.\nThe General Assembly has specified ten aggravating circumstances that may be weighed against mitigating circumstances by a jury considering the death penalty. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(1) et seq. Eight of them do not require a prior conviction or a \u201csignificant history\u201d of felony convictions. They speak directly to the immediate current conviction and support the penalty in and of themselves, if they are properly proved and weighed against mitigating circumstances.\nSection 9 makes a \u201csignificant history of felony convictions\u201d an aggravating circumstance. It does not specify when that history begins nor does it exclude the conviction the jury has rendered in the case before them.\nPrescinding from an obvious rationale for the inclusion of the immediate conviction as an aggravating circumstance, the majority again retreats into the daedal grammar of Goins. Stuck on the plural use of \u201cconvictions\u201d in section 9, the majority closes their eyes to what becomes the absurd consequences of refusing to count the immediate conviction.\nThere is no reason why the immediate conviction, as the second in the defendant\u2019s career ought not be counted. The legislature did not say that a significant history of prior convictions was required. They said that a \u201csignificant history of felony convictions\u201d was the aggravation. They significantly did not exclude the immediate conviction as a counter in that history; nor, indeed, should it be discounted. The consequences of disregarding the immediate conviction are literally astounding.\nWhile it is true that section 10 would authorize the consideration of a first and second degree murder conviction committed before or at the time of the immediate offense as aggravation, a homicide of lesser degree or a crippling, blinding criminal act is, per the majority, on the house. Perhaps nothing so well points the moral as Mr. Justice Hutchinson\u2019s concurring opinion in Commonwealth v. Goins, 508 Pa. 270, 495 A.2d 527 (1985), where upholding his present view, he said, \u201cIn short, this appellant [Goins] has shown that he is prone to kill under certain particular circumstances, but has not done so often enough to meet the legislative definition of \u201csignificant history.\u201d Id., 508 Pa. at 285, 495 A.2d at 534. Mr. Justice Hutchinson went further in Goins, supra, when he said, \u201cand two or more unrelated prior violent felonies may constitute a history which satisfies \u00a7 9711(D)(9).\u201d Id., 508 Pa. at 286, 495 A.2d at 535. At least therefore, one violent felony is still a bargain. The insistence by the majority that a \u201csignificant history of felony convictions\u201d requires more than one violent felony prior to the immediate conviction for murder, is the triumph of willful grammarians over the hectatombs of criminal deaths and the living deaths inflicted on this society by criminals who have not yet killed \u201coften enough\u201d.\nFor instance, a single previous robbery, where the victim was rendered into parapelegia, because the robber, doubtless lacking the experience required by the majority, failed to kill his victim, only counts for one. The blinding of a police officer in his last outing, counts for one; so too, the maiming a house wife, while gaining experience in gun point rape, or in a previous essay into violence, the defendant only succeeded in crippling and disfiguring, because his inexperienced hand shook while using his new switch blade. Some of these and a myriad of examples, would not count as aggravation, nor supply a \u201csignificant history\u201d even in the face of the present conviction for murder. The General Assembly did not specify the number of prior convictions required for a \u201csignificant\u201d history because significance transcends one or any given number of particular offenses.\nLARSEN and PAPADAKOS, JJ., join in this opinion.\n. I join in the decision to affirm the conviction.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9).\n. Commonwealth v. Goins, 508 Pa. 270, 495 A.2d 527 (1985).\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(10).",

I dissent to the majority\u2019s decision to vacate the sentence of death and remand for the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment.\nThe Appellant has criminally taken the lives of two innocent persons in two separate incidents. His criminal record includes two felony convictions involving violence to the person. Yet, the majority, again, closes its eyes to one killing and commands the jury to ignore the slaughter of Karen Meeker in determining whether Appellant has a significant history of felony convictions involving the use of threat or violence to the person. (Aggravating circumstance 9, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9)).\nWhile the majority concedes that Appellant\u2019s unlawful homicides have put quality in the significance of his history, they will not credit him with enough killings to warrant a sentence of death. The majority relies upon Commonwealth v. Goins, 508 Pa. 270, 495 A.2d 527 (1985), Hutchinson, J., concurring; Larsen, J., concurring and dissenting; Papadakos, J., concurring and dissenting) in which the same majority cavalierly rewrote the statute by inserting the word \u201cprior\u201d in the words used by the Legislature in aggravating circumstance 9 in order to justify its desired conclusion.\nThe word \u201cprior\u201d does not appear in aggravating circumstance 9, yet the majority concludes herein, \u201c... there is only a single prior conviction in this case. Therefore, we must, as we did in Goins, vacate the death sentence.\u201d (P. 1326).\nI join in the Dissent of Mr. Justice McDERMOTT. I accept the rationale in the Dissent of Mr. Justice LARSEN.
