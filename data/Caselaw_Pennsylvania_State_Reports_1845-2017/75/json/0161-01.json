        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, January 26th 1874, by\nAgnew, C. J.\nWhat is termed a naked power to refer a subject of controversy to arbitration, is undoubtedly revocable. But where the agreement partakes of the nature of a contract, whereby important rights are gained and lost reciprocally, and the submission is the moving consideration to these acts, a different rule prevails. Such agreements are compromises, and should be faithfully adhered to, unless there has been fraud or corruption, or gross misbehavior by the referees. Interest veipublicce ut sit finis litium. The agreement before us is of the latter class. Two suits were pending, one in covenant against the defendant as purchaser on the contract of sale, the other in assumpsit on a note given by the defendant with sureties upon the contract. The parties agreed to consolidate these actions and try them before referees, who should render a final award whether the defendant should pay anything, and if any, how much, and the sureties agreed to become responsible for this entire final sum, while the defendant should be relieved from the obligation to take any conveyance under the contract of sale. Here valuable rights were released and acquired on each side, and the effect of the settlement on this basis was to put an end to litigation ruinous to both sides, for the original contract of sale had become involved in inextricable difficulties. Under such circumstances, it was not in the power of the defendant at the last moment, and after the referees had gone far into the case, suddenly to give a notice of revocation, and avert a result. This is sufficient for the case; but we may add by way of caution, that it is doubtful whether anything is in the record which would enable us to reach the facts of the case. There is no appeal, and the writ of error reaches only matters upon the record.\nJudgment affirmed.",

M., April 21st 1873, before the conclusion of the trial before the referees, and before the submission had been executed by them. R. T. Cornwell.\n\u2018 \u201cAffirmed and subscribed, April 21st 1878, before\n\u201c John A. Rupert, Prothonotary.\u201d\nThe award was: \u201c We, two of the arbitrators in the within rul\u00e9 named, report, that, pursuant to the submission and order in this case, the three arbitrators within named, met at the arbitration room in the borough of West Chester, in the county of Chester, on the 10th day of April, A. D. 1873, and after being sworn and affirmed, proceeded to hear the parties, their proofs and allegations, and adjourned to meet at the same place on the seventeenth day of the same month, at 10 o\u2019clock in the forenoon of said day.\n\u201cApril 17th 1873, the subscribers met pursuant to adjournment, and again heard further the parties, their proofs and allegations, and adjourned again to meet at the same place, the 21st day of April 1873, at 10 o\u2019clock in the forenoon of said last-mentioned day.\n\u201cAnd now, this 21st day of April, A. d. 1873, the arbitrators again met, and having duly considered the proofs and allegations of the parties, we, two of the arbitrators, do award in favor of Peter Caldwell, the plaintiff, and against the said defendants, the sum of one thousand dollars, and all costs incurred by the plaintiff in the suit referred to the arbitrators.\n\u201c Witness our hands this 21st of April, A. d. 1873.\nJohn Twaddbll,\nJoseph Dowdall.\u201d\nIn discharging the rule, Butler, P. J., delivered this opinion: * * \u201c There is no doubt of the right to revoke a naked submission, if it be exercised in time. The courts have so decided, assimilating such submissions to any other naked power, granted without consideration. Whether, as is suggested in McGheehen v. Duffield, 5 Barr 499, there is such similarity between a mutual submission to arbitration and a naked power, might well be questioned, if it were not too late. We are confident the rule will not be extended. The observations of the court in Pollock v. Hall, 4 Dali. 222, where a plaintiff'sought to get rid of his submission by entering a discontinuance, are forcible and pertinent. The revocation of a submission, acted upon, tends to the increase and prolongation of strife, and generally to the prejudice of one of' the parties.\u2014 But where the submission contains more than a naked power to the referees \u2014 assumes the form and character of a contract \u2014 it is clearly not within the rule: Monongahcla Navigation Co. v. Fenlon, 4 W. & S. 205; McGheehen v. Duffield, 5 Barr 499; Hunt v. Rousmanier, 8 Wheat 174.\n\u201c In the case before us the submission contains an agreement that the case then on trial and near completion, should be withdrawn from the jury, that it, together with another between the same parties, should be consolidated; that the defendant in the latter suit should be relieved of his liability to have specific execution of his contract enforced, damages being provided for instead, and Mackey, one of the defendants in the first suit, becoming liable for their payment; that damages might also be awarded to Paist, one of the defendants, if it should appear that the plaintiff was in fault. Now how could the parties to this agreement revoke their obligations under it ? Each became entitled to have the two suits treated as one \u2014 tried together; Caldwell\u2019s right to specific execution of the contract Avas yielded up ; Mackey became responsible for the damages that might be assessed against Paist; and Paist became entitled to have his damages assessed against the plaintiff, if any appeared. This was a valid contract; the consideration was ample; the rights yielded and the obligations assumed, constituting it. Neither party could rid himself of it by saying I will not submit. And this is none the less so because an agreement to -arbitrate accompanies the other stipulations. The agreement to arbitrate itself thus became irrevocable, and lost its character of a naked power to the referees.\u201d\nThe defendants took a writ of error, and assigned for error, that the court erred in discharging the rule, and in not setting aside the award and striking off the judgment entered thereon.\nR. T. Cornwell and J. H. Brinton (with whom was W. Darlington), for plaintiff in error.\nA voluntary submission to referees may be revoked, before its execution, whether it be by deed, parol or rule of court: Vynior\u2019s Case, 8 Rep. 162 ; Power v. Power, 7 Watts 205; Wilson v. Young, 9 Barr 101; Bingham\u2019s Trustees v. Guthrie, 7 Harris 423; Coleman v. Grubb, 11 Id. 393; Wood v. Finn, 3 Penn\u2019a Law Journal 31; 2 Chitty\u2019s Practice 79, 80, 86, 87-102; Allen v. Watson, 16 Johns. 205; 2 Tidd\u2019s Prac. 748; Kyd on Awards 16; McGheehen v. Duffield, 5 Barr 499.\nJ. J. Pinkerton and J. J. Lewis, for defendant in error.\nThe evidence on Avhich the court below acted does not and cannot in such a proceeding appear of record; the Supreme Court therefore cannot determine whether any error Avas committed or not: Guthrie v. Wilson, 4 Wright 430. The presumption is, that the court below did right, and that presumption will stand until something appears of sufficient force to overthrow it; and there is a judgment entered by the prothonotary by authority of the parties to it, which cannot properly be questioned : Cook v. Gilbert, 8 S. & R. 567; McCalmont v. Peters, 13 S. & R. 197 ; Gallup v. Reynolds, 8 Watts 424; McGheehen v. Duffield, 5 Barr 497; Yates v. Russell, 17 Johns. R. 466. The Court of Common Pleas has no power to strike from the-docket summarily a judgment regularly entered : Horner & McCann v. Hower, 3 Wright 126.\nThe defendants by this agreement have elected their forum, and bound themselves to take their chances before it: Wynn v. Bellas, 10 Casey 160 ; Monongahela Navigation Company v. Fenlon, 4 W. & S. 205 ; O\u2019Reilly v. Kerns, 2 P. F. Smith 214 ; Reynolds v. Caldwell, 1 Id. 298; Howard v. The Allegheny Valley R. R. Co., 19 Id. 489; Wright v. Nutt, 1 T. R. 333; Camden v. Edie, 1 H. Blackst. 21; Farrington v. Hamblin, 12 Wendell 214."
