This excludes the subsequent instalments falling due after April 1871. The action of covenant then, being for the instalment of April 1st 1872, it is obvfous the decree does not include it, and is therefore no bar to the action. Herdic, who was the plaintiff in the bill for specific performance, not having complied with the decree in his favor, by giving his bonds and mortgage for the instalments falling due after April 1st 1871, and taking the deed Woodward filed under the decree, and the decree having made no other provision for these instalments, it is evident Herdic stands in no position to contest the plaintiff’s action of covenant, this being the only means left to him to enforce payment of these instalments.</p>
