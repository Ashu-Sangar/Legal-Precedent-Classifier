    <p class="summary" id="b157-13" data-blocks='[["BL_157.13",157,[233,1307,1154,507]]]'>“ Dr. John Todd is a practising physician, and attended professionally Jacob Willman, the deceased partner, and his family from July 4th 1868, to December 25th 1869. During the latter part of this time, by the special request of Willman, the defendant bought clothing for himself and family of firm of Willman &amp; Lorah, with the distinct and express understanding with Willman, that all that he bought should be a set-off <em>pro tanto </em>to his the defendant’s bill or demand against Willman; and such set-off actually was made by the parties. Had it not been for this agreement, the Doctor would have collected his claim long ago. Willman repeatedly urged the Doctor to buy more and he would fix it on the books of the firm as settled.</p>

But this <em>consent </em>is exactly what is necessary in order to bind a firm to an arrangement by which the partnership assets are to be taken to pay an individual debt: Noble <em>v. </em>MeClintock, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 152" data-case-ids="1853573" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0152-01">2 W. &amp; S. 152</a>; Tanner <em>v. </em>Hall, 1 Barr 417; Purdy <em>v. </em>Powers, 6 Barr 494. Ordinarily this consent may be gathered from attendant circumstances, such as the knowledge of the other partners that the goods are so being appropriated, and their silent acquiescence in €ie transaction, when they ought in good faith to speak out and dissent. But we apprehend that knowledge alone would not be sufficient to bind the other member or members of the firm, and especially where the individual creditor is being regularly charged with the goods on the firm books, and there is no assumption thereof upon such books by the individual partner. Every one is bound to know that a partner has no right to appropriate the partnership property to the payment of his individual debts, and if one so deals with him, he must run the risk of the interposition of partnership rights.</p>

    <p id="b158-13" data-blocks='[["BL_158.15",158,[1059,2307,333,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
