It is manifest that if Mrs. Nippes' be vested with the title of this property, it is by virtue of a voluntary settlement made by her husband. Not a dollar of her money was paid upon it. The property was acquired by her husband, partly by a gift of money from his father, and partly by securing the balance of the purchase-money by a judgment. It was his. He conveyed it to his wife by a conveyance through a third person, and to enable her to maintain it as a voluntary settlement, she must show that it was made under circumstances that will justify it in the light of fixed and wise rules of law. To determine the validity of a voluntary settlement made by a husband upon his wife, a series of inquiries may be applied as determining, tests. 1. Was the husband solvent at the time he made it ? 2. If solvent, was he indebted at the time ? 3. Did the settlement denude the husband of all his property ? There are other inquiries, but these embrace the facts of this case. Was D. S. Nippes solvent in 1853, when the settlement was made? Of this there is no evidence of a direct character — we are left to conjecture. But it is the duty of the wife, claiming under a voluntary settlement, to establish solvency on the part of the husband. She fails to show this affirmatively, and her case is weakened by her failure. All that the testimony discloses is, that <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>her husband owned this land valued at $1600,- that the cash paid on it came as a gift from his father, and that he was in debt for it $900, which he had secured by a purchase-money judgment. 2. We thus reach the second inquiry, viz.: Was he indebted at the time ?' This must be answered in the affirmative — for he was, and yet is indebted for the $900 judgment confessed to Mr. Ramsey for the purchase-money; but, being indebted, it devolves upon the wife the duty of establishing solvency of a sufficiency, which will rebut the presumption that then arises, that such settlement was erroneous and fraudulent: Woolston’s Appeal, 1 P. F. Smith 416. It is true that a voluntary settlement is not void if there be any indebtedness to any amount whatever — for if any degree of indebtedness would defeat it, all voluntary settlements would be virtually fraudulent; since no person is at any time absolutely free from debt. But the indebtedness of a solvent man, which will defeat a voluntary settlement, must be to such an amount as, in relation to his remaining assets, and the value of the settlement, is disproportioned to such assets. This disproportion must be such as will tend to hinder, delay or defeat creditors, and leave the' maker of the settlement so bare of property that he cannot reasonably expect to meet his existing liabilities, or those which he must necessarily create, having regard to his business and social relations. In relation to this inquiry, all that the record discloses is a debt of $900; and with the exception of a few tools, no other property save that which was made the subject of the settlement. This, then, was a voluntary settlement made upon Mrs. Nippes; and we now reach the third and last of the proposed testing inquiries. 3. Did the settlement denude him of-all his property? Did it leave him without means to meet and discharge the debts, which having reference to his business and social relations he must necessarily create in the future ? If it did, then it was erroneous and void.' So far as the record shows, the husband had no other property, except a few personal goods, that he could have retained under the exemption laws against the whole world. The policy of insurance shows that stock, crops, all the apparatus of the farm, were held by the wife. But the law strongly condemns a settle-1 ment that thus strips the husband of all his resources, as being against public policy. This rule is to'be rigidly enforced, and courts must.adhere to it, if honest creditors are to be protected and fraudulent debtors restrained. In Ammon’s Appeal, 13 P. F. Smith 285, it was held, that a voluntary settlement which denudes the husband of all or a greater part of his property is much more than a reasonable provision for the wife; for in considering what is, and what is not a reasonable provision, the circumstances of the husband are to be regarded — his probable necessities, as well as his debts': 2 Story’s Eq. 2 v. § 1374. The case disclosed by the record therefore stands thus, — first, an indebted husband; second, <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>a settlement that denudes him of all property that he is shown to have had at the time he made it; and the law arising upon these facts declares that such a settlement is void.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b478-6" data-blocks='[["BL_478.4",478,[278,515,1163,512]]]'>“ But it is said that the time which has elapsed since the settlement was made, being nearly eighteen years, has revealed, until recently, the incurrence of no subsequent indebtedness — and, that under the ruling in Goff <em>v. </em>Nuttall, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%2078" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Wright 78">8 Wright 78</a>, this settlement should, from the lapse of time, be held to be good. How the lapse of time can make that valid which, when it was made, the law, arising upon the facts, declared void, I am unable to discern. Goff <em>v. </em>Nuttall differs from the case at bar in one very important particular. There the husband paid no part of the purchase-money — here he paid it all, or secured it to be paid. The cases differ widely, and the conclusion reached in the one is not applicable to, and cannot govern in the other.</p>

Assuming this conclusion to be correct, the question still remains whether this fund,.the fruits of the policy issued to Mrs. Nippes through her husband as her agent, should be distributed to herpr to the attaching creditors of the husband. As I have endeavored to demonstrate, the wife has an insurable interest in the property of her husband. She may insure that interest, and as between him and herself she would be entitled to the fruits of the policy. But though she has this insurable interest, it is subject to the same vicissitudes which may affect her rights as wife in her husband’s property. She has an inchoate right of dower in his realty, but that right may be divested by a sale of the husband’s land, under a judgment or mortgage created by him. Her interest when insured is no more sacred than her interest as wife. If the one is destroyed by a sale under an encumbrance, the other must share the same fate. If it be resisted by creditors, who otherwise would remain unpaid, any .other doctrine than this would enable a wife to acquire an interest by effecting an insurance upon her husband’s property, which would override the rights of his creditors. It would be a fruitful and successful source of fraud. The husband would cease to insure in his own name, and obtaining policies upon the wife’s interest, would in the event of a loss which diminished or entirely destroyed the value of the property, have a fund, obtained through that loss which was beyond the reach of creditors, when the interest insured, that is, of the wife in her inchoate dower, could be sold under execution. Such a theory cannot be tolerated by any system of jurisprudence. The law, is, that as between husband and wife, the latter has an insurable interest jn the property of the former. She may recover from the insurance company, as between herself and him, but the fruits of the policy are as amenable to the hus<a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>band’s creditors as the interest assured would have been if the husband’s property had been sold at the suit of a creditor.</p>

Nippes, in August 1853, when he made the gift to, or voluntary settlement upon his wife, was indebted to Jesse W. Ramsey for the balance of the purchase-money, and that such an indebtedness invalidated the conveyance, if it was of all the husband’s property, and more therefore than a reasonable provision for the wife — came logically to the conclusion that the gift or conveyance was void against the husband’s creditors. But <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>the debt to Ramsey clearly was not such a debt as would render the conveyance void as against subsequent creditors : Williams <em>v. </em>Davis, 19 P. F. Smith 21. It was secured by a judgment which was a lien on the settled land. The deed could not have been intended to hinder, delay and defraud that creditor, the vendor, for the wife took the land subject to the lien of the judgment given to secure its payment. There was then no prior debt upon the ground, of which the subsequent creditors could claim to come in. Unless there was an indebtedness at the time, or unless the evidence disclosed a purpose of defrauding subsequent creditors, carried out by actually incurring such debts, the fact that it was all the property the grantor had at the time is immaterial. That such was the motive of a conveyance may justly be inferred from a grantor’s having entered into a new and hazardous business about the time when the conveyance was made, or from his having contracted large debts immediately thereafter : Mateer <em>v. </em>Hissim, 3 Penna. Rep. 160; Greenfield’s Estate, 2 Harris 489; Snyder <em>v. </em>Christ, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20499" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 Wright 499">3 Wright 499</a> ; Goff <em>v. </em>Nuttall, 8 Id. 81. The father of Daniel S. Nippes purchased for him and had conveyed to him the farm in question. He paid seven hundred dollars, and for the balance of the purchase-money Daniel S. Nippes confessed a judgment to the vendor. He then determined to settle this property on his wife, and accordingly it was conveyed to her in fee m the usual way through a third person. What was there to hinder him from doing this ? He owed no debt to any one which was not fully secured, and that upon the very farm in question. He was a farmer, and the evidence disclosed no intention of incurring debts from which he meant to cover up this property. If he had such an intention he certainly did not carry it out. Fourteen years elapse before any debt appears against him. During all this period Daniel S. Nippes and his. wife lived on the farm, and derived their subsistence from it. We think it very clear that this conveyance or settlement was good against the husband’s creditors, and she having insured her interest, and the improvements having been destroyed by fire, the insurance-money belonged to her.</p>

Not the property insured, whether real or personal, but the insurable interest of Mrs. Nippes in that property. If she had no insurable interest the policy was void — but that was a question exclusively between her and the insurers. They paid the money into court at her suit. What title did her husband’s creditors show to any part of it ? How was the insurance, admitting it to have been effected by the husband, with his own money, any fraud upon them unless to the extent of the premiums ?
