No objection was then, or thereafter, made that they were not the identical freeholders summoned by the sheriff. The presumption is that they were. If the defendant was not satisfied of that fact, she should then have challenged the array, or have made some objection before the jury was sworn. By going to trial without objection, it was afterwards too late to interpose a hypothetical assumption to set aside the finding of the jury and <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>aldermen: McDermott <em>v. </em>Hoffman, 20 P.
