He knew what John’s indebtedness to him amounted to; he knew that John’s debts must first be paid out of his share, or if he did not know this, the law construes his will to effect this result, and consequently the share of his other three children would be increased by the amount of John’s debts to the estate, which would have to be paid before any equalization of his bounty to his four children could be effected.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b173-9" data-blocks='[["BL_173.7",173,[234,947,1162,436]]]'>■ “ The testator bequeathed one £ equal share ’ of the balance of his estate — being one-fourth — to his son John. By a codicil he revoked this bequest, and gave the same £ equal share ’ to his daughter-in-law, Martha, wife of John. The result of this is the same as if John had not been mentioned. The circumstance that Martha is his wife, and that the bequest was originally to him, is of no importance. If it had remained to him, it would have afforded means for the payment of his debt, and the executors could have applied it by way of set-off. But now that it is hers it cannot be so applied.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b173-10" data-blocks='[["BL_173.8",173,[231,1385,1169,1040]]]'>££ It is said this view will work injustice to the other children, and that the testator .cannot therefore have contemplated it. But it is quite as difficult to believe that when he gave Martha this legacy, he contemplated that it should be applied to somebody else’s debt, and she get nothing. It is supposed he intended to give her what John would have received on settlement with the executors. But he does not say so. On the contrary, he designates the proportion she is to have, to wit: ‘ one equal share ’ with Benjamin, Mary and Lydia. This may or may not be the same that John would have received on settlement. If he had previously paid the debt, or the statute of limitation or presumption of payment had run against it, he would have received the same ; otherwise he would have received nothing. But in either case he would have gotten the entire legacy — the one-fourth. For whether the debt be paid from the legacy or from some other source, the result is the same to him. If we adopt the auditor’s view, John will still get the legacy, notwithstanding the testator’s change of mind. It will discharge his indebtedness, and the property he may acquire hereafter will be at his own disposal. The claim of the executors will be extinguished with the wife’s legacy, and no matter what his means may be, she will get nothing. If he possessed prop*erty at this time it would not be pretended that the debt should be paid from her legacy. How can the circumstance that he does not, affect her rights ?</p>

      <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>“ The auditor’s error grows out of the supposition that the bequest to John was simply of the balance, after deducting his indebtedness ; and that it is this balance which is given to Martha. This, as we have seen, is a mistake in both respects. The bequest to John was of the one-fourth — ‘one equal share’ — with Benjamin, Mary and Lydia, of the balance of estate. What is the balance of estate ? Clearly what remains of available assets after paying debts, and the legacies previously mentioned. The worthless debts of an insolvent obligor do not enter into it, whether he be a son of the testator or a stranger. If the bequest had remained to John then his indebtedness to the estate would have been available and have entered into the ‘balance.’ And, as before stated, the debt could have been collected by means of set-off. But this circumstance — that his obligations could have been used in making payment, — does not reduce the amount of the legacy. It would still be the one-fourth of the balance of estate. And it is this one-fourth which is given to her.</p>

But where the language is plain the intention is to be gathered from it. And here it is plain, designating precisely what proportion of the estate the legatee is to have. We cannot disregard it because we may suppose 'injustice will result, and that something else must therefore have been intended. Were Ave to look for the intention here, outside the terms used, we are not sure we would agree Avith the auditor. It is said the testator must be presumed to have known the law, the effects of what he did, and that John was thriftless and insolvent. He is quite as likely to have known the extent of his own estate, for it Avas small. And if he did know these things, then he also knew that his bequest to John would be fruitless ; and if he intended Martha to take simply what John would have received on settlement — nothing—he would hardly have troubled 'himself to change the bequest to her. It might be said, therefore, the fact that he did change it raises an inference that he desired to <em>avoid </em>this result, and provided something for the family of this penniless and thriftless son. But Ave cannot know his secret motives; and while his language is plain, are not at liberty to guess at them.</p>

The fact that she is John’s wife does not change her right, and make her legacy liable to John’s debts to the testator. It is not a case of legal substitution, whereby one person becomes substituted to the right of another by operation of law, but it is a case of change in the intention of the testator, whereby he suffered one person to drop out of his will and another to fall in. The very change of intention contradicts the idea of mere substitution. John was left to stand where he stood before, a debtor to the estate, and Martha was given 'the bequest in, her own right, not in his. Judge Butler’s opinion is quite satisfactory.</p>
