It was not in writing. I then mentioned this to Mr. McShain, and he verbally agreed to carry it at $1.30 during the season. I subsequently put it in writing. The whole was written awaiting signatures.’ There was no verbal agreement at the time it was signed that it was to he carried before October 1st. The first I heard of any allegation in respect to time was some two or three months after.

That subsequently, when he was asked to sign the written paper drawn up by tlie vice-president of the company (that is, the written contract of the 28th of July), upon reading it over he remarked that it was all on one side, and that it did not mention that the defendants would furnish the coal by the 1st of October; that Mr. Berwind, the vice-president, then replied, ‘ That is understood, we will furnish that and ten thousand tons more besides, by that time;’ that the plaintiff then replied, ‘ W.ell, if that is understood, I will sign it,’ whereupon he signed it.

If it was the contract that the defendants should furnish the coal by the 1st of October, of course the plaintiff was not bound to carry at the same rates after the 1st of October. Whether time is an essential part of the contract depends very much upon the agreement and the understanding of the parties, and is to be found by the jury like other facts. Ordinarily, time is not considered an essential part of a contract; but when the parties make it a part of the contract, and where its influence upon the contract is apparent, and the parties would be in a worse condition if it were not considered part of the contract, then it is proper to regard it as an essential part of the contract.</p>

If, on the other hand, you shall find that the contract was not a contract with this condition as to time in it, or that what was said about the time of delivery -was a mere representation while the negotiation was proceeding, simply part of the conversation when the parties were bargaining about it, a mere expectation or inducement held out, and did not enter into the contract at the time it was agreed upon, then, of course, it would not form a part of the contract, and the plaintiff would be bound to carry at the same rates, and the defendants would be entitled to their set-off.

This rule is put upon the ground that the attempt afterwards to take advantage of the omission from the contract, of such promise, is a fraud upon the party who was induced to execute it upon such promise, and hence he will be permitted to show the truth of the matter: Clark <em>v. </em>Partridge, 2 Barr 13; Renshaw <em>v. </em>Gans, 7 Barr 117; Dutton <em>v. </em>Tilden, 1 Harris 49.</p>

He says, after speaking of their previous parol arrangement, “ Mr. Berwind showed me the paper. I was in a great hurry. I picked it up. I glanced over it and said, ‘ Mr. Berwind, this is one-sided; it don’t mention that you will furnish the coal by the 1st of October.’ ■ He' said, ‘ That is understood; we will not only furnish that, but expect to furnish five or ten thousand more by that time.’ I made answer, ‘If that is understood, I will sign it.’” This piece of evidence showed a distinct and material condition by which McShain was induced to sign the contract. To say then, that this contract might be enforced without regard to the express parol stipulation, under which it was signed, would be to disregard long and well-established legal principles, as well as the plainest demands of common honesty. The exceptions, therefore, to the charge and admission of evidence are not sustained. The case was properly submitted, and though in fact, the weight of the evidence may have been with the defendant, the resulting error lay with the jury, not with the court, and hence, comes not within our power of correction.</p>

We may observe, however, with reference to the point made, that <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>will not lie upon a special contract, except where there has been a full performance on the part of the plaintiff, it is conceded that this proposition is correct. But the plaintiff did not rely upon the special contract; that was set up by the defend<a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>ant for the purpose of defeating the plaintiff’s claim, and as the jury found that it was not operative by reason of the defendant’s fraud, we cannot see why the plaintiff’s recovery under the <em>indebitatus </em>counts may not be sustained. So we cannot see that there was anything in the question raised by the defendant, as to the relation McShain’s employees sustained to him. It was not alleged that the company had contracted with any one but the plaintiff', or that there had been a joint undertaking by him and some one else to transport the merchandise in question. That he had employed his own firm to assist him in the performance of his undertaking,could, therefore, by no possibility, affect his right to recover.</p>
