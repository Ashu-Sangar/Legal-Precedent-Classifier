    <p id="Ab_z" data-blocks='[["BL_362.16",362,[259,1888,1178,388]]]'>In accordance with this prayer the required viewers were appointed. The duties of such a jury of viewers are very clearly pointed out in the several Acts of Assembly, and had these acts been consulted, and their directions followed, a good deal of trouble would have been saved. A preliminary step, as directed by the 53d section of the Act of June 13th 1836, is, that they <em>shPWbefore </em>they proceed to the duties of their appointment, respectivelyjnalé* oüth of'affirmation <em>to perform the same impartially^ and'aceordirig Best of their judgment. </em>' •</p>

Admitting that an oath of this <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>kind would be as binding on the consciences of honest men as any that could be framed, nevertheless it was certainly not the one directed by the act. The legislature had an object in view in the oath which is prescribed. At was designed to call the attention "oNeafih juror to the obligation resting, upon him to perform", his duty “impartially,” and to the best of his judgment. We need hardly " say.', that this intention..is not filled by a general oath to perform his duty faithfully. The act indeed may be super-cautionary, but of this neither the jury nor ourselves are the judges, it is our duty to obey that which is written. This case is certainly as strong as that of Thompson <em>v. </em>White, 4 S. &amp; R. 135; where the appellant from an award of arbitrators made affidavit “ that it is not for the purpose of delay such appeal is entered, but because he believes injustice has been done.” This was held insufficient, because the word “ firmly” prescribed by the Act of 1810 was omitted.</p>
    <p id="b363-6" data-blocks='[["BL_363.4",363,[246,1069,1161,647]]]'>But again, it appears from the report filed, that at their first meeting all the jurors, were sworn but one, who was found to be disqualified. Thereupon they adjourned over until such vacancy could be filled by the court’s appointment. This appointment having been procured, they met and proceeded to view the premises, the recent appointee making one of the jury. This occurred upon the 3d day of April 1871. After they had completed this view, they adjourned to meet at the office of the city solicitor, on the 13th of April, “at which time and place,” says the report, “ all the .jurors met, when William Dingas,” the new-juror, “was sworn and examined on his <em>voire </em>dire, and, being qualified to serve, was sworn to the faithful discharge of his duty by Alderman Delaney, by whom the oath or affirmation had been previously administered to all the other jurors, the petition having been first read in the hearing of all.”</p>
    <p id="b363-7" data-blocks='[["BL_363.5",363,[248,1717,1169,344]]]'>That this was erroneous is beyond. dispute, because, the acQ requires" the jurors to be^ sworn as the prime requisite in their qualification, and a view without this is- bad Bryson’s Road, 2 PaT~R7~20T.

As this re-reference was regular, Beigh’s Road, 11 Harris 302, it was now only .necessary that the jury should be resworn.or. affirmed, and Proceed to do'their work <em>de ñopo, </em>and all would have been right. Instead of tfiisj’ however, the jury proceed to amend their report, and certify the following: “ We, the undersigned, * * * * * reconvened by order of your Honor’s court for the purpose of reporting more fully as to the manner they were sworn to do, this 11th day of April, A. D. 1872, certify that before entering upon their duties as jurors in the above matter, they were separately sworn to perform their duties impartially, and according to the best of their judgment.” Now, the first error in this certificate is that it contained a mistake as to the nature of the order of the court. That order did not send the report back to the viewers for amendment, but it annulled that report by setting it aside; in the second place, it does not, nor can it, amend the facts so set forth in the first report, that the jurors were not properly sworn, and that.Dingas was not qualified” "unti'Uafter the view'of the premises.

Ordinarily, the party in interest must sign a petition of review, but there is an obvious distinction between such a case and that of an application for the assessment of damages. To construe the rule otherwise would, in many cases, prevent owners of land from obtaining damages at all, as their personal attention may often be impossible. So in the present case, the petitioner being a company, must act through a representative, if it would act at all, and we know none more proper than its secretary.
