In other words, we are requested to charge you that the sum, designated in the bond, is merely a penalty, and not an amount agreed upon by the parties as liquidated damages. It is true that forfeitures are odious ; and it is equally true that courts will evade a construction which involves a forfeiture. But in this case, for reasons which are controlling, we decline to charge as thus requested by the defendant; and we say to you distinctly, that the sum designated in the bond, is to be deemed and treated as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty. If, therefore, under the facts as laid before you, under the law as to this class of contracts, as we have defined it, you find that the defendant has broken the condition of the bond, the plaintiff is entitled to recover as damages the full amount specified by the bond. In addition to this, he is also entitled to recover further damages as interest upon that amount which you will, in the event that your verdict is with the plaintiff, compute from the time when Dr. Bigony was notified to desist from his infringements upon the plaintiff’s rights, if you believe he practised within the prescribed limits at the time such notice was given, and if' he had not at that time, but after-wards, and before the day upon which this suit was commenced, then you will compute interest from that day.” * * *</p>

If it be wholly disproportion^ to the actual damage caused by breach of the condition, it is to be construed as a penalty. If on the other hand it represents a sum adequate to the payment of damages, and about commensurate with them, it indicates strongly that the sum was intended as liquidated damages. We will apply the tests indicated to the condition of this bond. The nature of the agreement seems to indicate the intention of the parties. An old, skilful and well-established physician was selling his house, office and practice to a young and <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>untried gentleman. Competition was utterly ruinous to the latter, and this sum might reasonably have been fixed as the liquidated loss of the younger man if the older should violate his agreement. The nature of the case and the character of the bargain would then lead to the inference that this sum was designated as liquidated damages and not as a penalty. If a penalty under which continuous damages could have been recovered throughout the joint lives of the parties, it is entirely too small. Next, the uncertainty of the proof affords a strong and almost irresistible reason for concluding that the sum was named as liquidated damages. It by no means follows because a person in the prescribed circle was attended by Dr. Bigony, that if he had not practised there Dr. Tyson would have been the attending physician. Doctors abound throughout the land — or that all Dr. Tyson lost was the individual case treated by Dr. Bigony; but this uncertainty of proof affected also the measure of the damages and rendered it utterly impossible for any jury to determine what was the actual loss suffered by the plaintiff. This consideration, which under the proof was so clearly presented against construing the sum as a penalty, chiefly induced me, upon the trial, to construe it as liquidated damages. But these difficulties must have been on the minds of the parties, and induced them, in the language of Judge Mereur, ‘to make the damages the subject of previous adjustment.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b161-6" data-blocks='[["BL_161.4",161,[229,1371,1167,433]]]'>“ Again, the condition left it optional with Dr. Bigony to practise medicine within five miles of Skippackville, if he chose to pay a certain sum for that privilege. This is clearly what the contract was; no chancellor would restrain him from pursuing his practice after he had repurchased his right by the payment of the stipulated sum of $1000. He had his choice, either not to practise or to do so upon paying $1000. He was not bound to pay the damage he caused the plaintiff as damages, <em>eo nomine; </em>that was waived, or in lieu of action to recover damages, the right to receive and the duty to pay $1000 was substituted.” * * *</p>

The bond in the case in hand is similar in its character to that above recited, the difference between the two being found only in the condition. In the one case it is for the conveyance of title; in the other, that Dr. Bigony shall not practise medicine within five miles of the village of Skippackville. Obviously, this difference cannot of itself affect the legal construction of the bond, but one rule must govern both, unless circumstances outside of the bond control that rule.</p>

And this the more so, in view of the difficulty of ascertaining with any degree of accuracy the actual damages resulting from the interference and competition of the defendant. But these important and controlling facts are disputed by the defendant. Indeed, if he is to be believed, he executed the bond without consideration— as a mere gratuity.</p>
