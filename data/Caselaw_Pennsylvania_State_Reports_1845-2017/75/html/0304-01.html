The testator owned stock in the defendants’ company, part of which was marked as belonging to the daughters’ trust. The trustees having died, two others were appointed, aud subsequently Vezin, Lorenz and Gerhard were appointed in their stead, Lorenz changed his residence to Europe, and made general power of attorney to Vezin and another to collect, &amp;c., “ any and all" income from the trust, “ and to call in, sell or change any or all stocks or loans,” &amp;c., and transfer them, &amp;c. McMurtrie was appointed in place of Gerhard, who had died. Vezin, as trustee and as attorney for Lorenz, afterwards transferred stock in defendants’ company.

This notification, though six years elapsed, was never given us, directly or indirectly, and, until within a few weeks past, we never knew of his appointment. If the complainant had done what we think was his duty in this particular, no loss would have been suffered by his <em>cestuis que trust, </em>as we never would have permitted the transfer without his assent.

They have in their keeping the primary evidence of title, and they are justly held to proper diligence and care in its preservation. From this it results that they may rightfully demand evidence of authority, to make a transfer before they permit it to be made. Their own safety requires that they be satisfied of the right of-the person proposing to make a transfer, to do what he proposes. Generally sufficient evidence of such right is found in the possession of the legal title to <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>the stock. Yet it is well settled that it is not in all cases sufficient, notwithstanding that the true equitable ownership may be in some other than the holder of the legal right, and a transfer may be a gross wrong to such an equitable owner. To that wrong the corporation or keepers of the register make themselves parties, if with knowledge that there is no equitable right to transfer they permit it to be done.’</p>

This rule does not apply, however, to the case of executors and administrators transferring stock standing in the name of a decedent, for the reason that the law casts upon them the legal ownership of the personal property of such decedent. It is their duty to pay debts and make distribution amongst heirs or legatees. To do so, they must convert the personalty into cash, and a transfer of stock, therefore, would be in due course of administration. It would be unreasonable to hold that a corporation in such case should be held to inquire whether in point of fact the particular stock was needed for the payment of debts or legacies. The rule that a certificate of letters testamentary, or of administration, is generally sufficient to justify the transfer of stock, is recognised in Bayard <em>v. </em>The Bank, supra, and several cases cited by Mr. Justice Strong in his opinion; yet there are authorities which hold that in the case of an executor, the party permitting the transfer is bound to see that the former has authority under the will to make such transfer': Lowry <em>v. </em>The Bank, Amer.

It certainly would be no valid reason for so doing, that the creator of the trust himself considered the existing securities to be a sufficient investment.’ The same authority, *p. 281, says: ‘ In some cases the trustees will be charged with interest as well as the capital which has been lost by not calling in the improper securities.’</p>

      <em>“ </em>The remaining question for our determination is as to the validity of the sale under the power of attorney. It is elementary law that co-trustees must join in a transfer of stock. In this case the fact is admitted that plaintiff’s appointment as trustee was not communicated to the defendants, and it is not urged that his nonjoinder affects the validity of the transfer. But it is alleged that the power of attorney from Mr. Lorenz, the trustee, who was in Europe, was a delegation of discretion, and therefore void. The authorities are clear that there can be no valid delegation of a "discretion. Bulteel <em>v. </em>Abinger, 6 Jurist 412, is a leading case upon this subject. One of the trustees declined to take any part in the sale of the trust property, authorizing his co-trustee to sell the estate under their powers. A sale was effected by this co-trustee, accordingly, and on a bill for specific performance brought by the vendee, it was held: 1. That the fact of the trustees being also executors did not .give each trustee, <em>qua </em>trustee, authority to deal exclusively with the property; and 2. That Lord Abinger could not lawfully delegate to his co-trustees an authority to sell the estate to his son, without reserving to himself a veto on the contract. In Hill on Trustees, *p. 474, it is held that a trustee is not justified in delegating the power of sale to a stranger, nor even tola co-trustee. In Hawley <em>v. </em>James, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Paige%20Ch.%20487" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Paige Ch. 487">5 Paige 487</a>, the principle is thus stated: ‘A trustee who has only a delegated discretionary power cannot give a general authority to <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>another to execute the same, unless he is specially authorized so to do by the deed or will creating such power,’ and in Pearson <em>v. </em>Jamison, 1 McLean’s C. C. Rep. 197, ‘ Where an executor by the will is empowered to sell real estate in the best mode in his judgment for the interest of the estate he cannot delegate the power to another.’ In Berger <em>v. </em>Duff, 4 Johns. Ch. R. R. 368, the case was this: ‘ The testator authorized his executors B. and C. to sell certain lots of land, if under the circumstances of the times they should deem it prudent; and 0. having gone abroad, sent a power of attorney to B., his co-executor, to sell the land on such terms as he should deem expedient; held, that an agreement for the sale entered into by B. for himself and C. was not valid, and a bill filed for a specific performance of it, was accordingly dismissed. The Chancellor, in deciding the case, says : “ The agreement to sell was not valid, being made by one executor without the personal assent and act of the other. The power was not capable of transmission or delegation from one executor to the other, and the rule of law and equity on this point is perfectly well settled.” Citing Comb’s Case, 9 Co. 75; Ingram <em>v. </em>Ingram, 2 Atkyns 88 ; Sir Thomas Clark in Alexander <em>v. </em>Alexander, 2 Ves. Sr. 643; Lord Hardwicke in Attorney-General v. Scott, 1 Ves. Sr. 417; Lord Redesdale in Hamilton <em>v. </em>Royse, 2 Sch. &amp; Lef. 330; Hawkins <em>v. </em>Kemp, 3 East 410, and Sugden on Powers (2d ed.) 167. The defendants allege, however, that there was no delegation of discretion in the power of attorney; that the acts to be performed by the attorney were merely ministerial. If the facts be so, the case would be free from difficulty. A trustee may delegate a mere ministerial duty, such as signing his name to a transfer of stock, or to a deed; and if this were all this power of attorney authorized, the defendants would be right in their construction of it. But it was a general power to sell stocks, embracing everything in the estate, with authority ‘ to call in, sell or change any or all of the said stocks or loans, &amp;c.,’ with a power of substitution, and it was without any limit as to price, or reference to the time, place or manner of sale. Nor did the principal reserve any veto or check upon the act of his agent. The latter was to exercise all the discretion which was by law vested in the former. Whether the price was sufficient, or the sale itself, at the particular time, and in the then condition of the stock market was judicious, were questions which the agent was empowered to decide without any consultation with his principal. In this respect we think the power of attorney was invalid. If after making the sale the attorney had reported the same to his principal, and the latter had ratified it, <em>thus exercising his discretion, </em>I have no doubt the transfer under the power would have been good, and herein the defendants were remiss. With such a general power delegating discretion, they should have required some evidence of the <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>ratification of the sale by the principal. Any assent, the production of a letter from him, would have been sufficient. But in the absence of any such ratification on his part, we are of opinion that the defendants had no right to allow this transfer, and that they are responsible for the loss of this stock.</p>
