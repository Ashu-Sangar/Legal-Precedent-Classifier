There is no instance since Barnett’s Appeal, to my knowledge, in which this line of decision has been departed from. Yarnáll’s Appeal and Ogden’s Appeal, relied upon by the appellants as changing the current, are not exceptions, as will be shown presently. Many special trusts, and some of them for persons <em>sui juris, </em>have since been upheld, a few of which are referred to in Ogden’s Appeal, 20 P. F. Smith 507.</p>

Trusts supply the means of carrying out family arrangements, and of breaking the force of the blow death deals against the head. They furnish a protection against improvidence, indiscretion, inexperience, imbecility, misfortune, and even vice, upholding the wishes of parents and friends, and inspiring even the dying with comfort. They are contrary to no principle of justice, wisdom or morality, and therefore demand our confidence and support in proper cases. Hence, when a special trust within these limits is clearly raised by the imposition of active duties on the trustee, or for purposes making it necessary to preserve the estate intended to be given, the will of the donor gives eflicaey to the trust. <em>Voluntas donatoris in cTiarta sui manifesté expressa observanda.</em>

The <em>corpus </em>of the estate is fully and distinctly invested in the trustees, and put under their control. The bequests to the three children, Hannah, Annie and George, are only of the <em>income. </em>Their estates in the income are only for <em>life, </em>and without regard to <em>coverture. </em>
      <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>The <em>principal </em>is devised and bequeathed to the persons who would be entitled to it under the intestate law. Here is plainly an active operative trust, following a manifest intention essential to carry it into effect, by holding the <em>corpus </em>of the property itself, in the hands of the trustee, during the lives of the testator’s own children, irrespective of any purpose in regard to coverture, to enable them to receive and apply the income only to these children, and then to carry over the principal or <em>corpus </em>to their issue at their deaths. Without maintaining the trust, this plain and lawful intent cannot be carried into execution.</p>

Smith 386, the devise and bequest of Mr. Ellis was, “ in trust for the only proper benefit, use and behalf of <em>all </em>my children that may be living at the time of my decease, and the lawful issue of such of them as may then be deceased, in <em>equal parts and shares </em>as hereinafter directed and set forth.” Thus, the trust was of the estate itself and not of the income merely, and not for life, but in language that would .carry a fee under Wills Act of 1833, where no contrary intent appears. Eollowing this, was a direction to apply the income of the sons’ shares to their use during minority, and to pay the shares themselves to the sons at majority. Then came the direction as to the shares of the daughters, viz.: “ And the parts and shares of my daughters who may then be living at the time of my decease. I direct my said trustee to hold in trust, to pay the interest and income thereof to my said daughters during their natural lives, <em>free from the </em>debts, <em>control or engagements of any husband they may have or take." </em>This was followed by a power of appointment by the daughters by will, and on failure to appoint to convey their shares to those who would be entitled to take from each under the intestate law. The trusts for sons and daughters were alike of the <em>corpus </em>of the estate, the former being disabled from receiving it only during minority, and the latter being disabled for life manifestly in view of coverture only. Hence, we held as to the daughters, that the manifest'intent being to invest them with the whole estate, and the disability being in view of a coverture which never took place, the only object of the trust having ceased, the trust fell upon well recognised principles as to trusts for coverture. The question on the will was really one of interpretation in order to reach the intent of the testatrix as to the estate she intended to vest in her daughters, and the purpose of the trust. A trust for coverture is one of the well settled instances in the doctrine of special trusts, where the trust falls when no marriage is in immediate contemplation, or after the coverture has ended by the death of the husband, the doctrine of this state being that the trust does not revive by a second marriage: Megargee <em>v. </em>Naglee, 14 P. F. Smith 216, and cases cited; Wells v. McCall, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20392" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="10 Wright 392">Id.</a> 207 ; Freyvogle <em>v. </em>Hughes, 6 P.

Perhaps a reason for the fall of this kind of trust is, that the donor having expressed coverture as its purpose, no other intent is presumed. <em>Expressio unius est exelusio alterius.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b127-6" data-blocks='[["BL_127.4",127,[246,500,1166,1284]]]'>Ogden’s Appeal, 20 P. F. Smith 501, was a case precisely of the same 'nature. Our greatest difficulty there was in the interpretation of the will in order to discover the true intention of the testator. That being ascertained to be similar to the intent in Mrs. Ellis’s will, viz., to confer the entire corpus of the estate upon Mrs. Ogden, and create a trust for coverture only, the same conclusion was reached as in Yarnall’s Appeal. The opening sentence of the opinion is a key to the case, viz. : “ If the trust for Mrs. Harriet V. Ogden, under the will of her father, Cadwallader Evans, <em>be </em>active, as decided by the learned judge of the Common Pleas, his decree was right. • This, therefore, is the, real question.” We thought, the whole estate being intended to vest in her, and the trust intended for coverture only, and no marriage being in contemplation, the trust was not active, and we reversed the decision of the court below. That this court meant -no attack upon the doctrine of active or operative trusts, the whole of the first paragraph of the opinion distinctly shows. An examination of the will, and of the interpretation of it in the opinion, will prove that Mr. Cadwallader Evans’s will has no likeness to that of Mr. Earp; and that nothing in the opinion countenances a position that would break down the trust in this ease. It is proper toyemark that the decision upon one will rarely ever forms a precedent for a decision upon another. Even the same words in one are often interpreted differently in another. Instances of these various readings will be found in Yarnall’s Appeal, 20 P. F. Smith 341. The reason is, wills being interpreted by the whole instrument, the intentions of testators in the use of the same expression, are discovered often to be as various as their own individuality. Hence, that which may appear to be contrariety of decision, is simply diversity in the testator’s intention.</p>
