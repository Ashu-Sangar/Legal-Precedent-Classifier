We stood on the front platform, by the side of the driver, all the way out to Eorty-first street and Lancaster Avenue. I then said to John Stewart, who stood next to the driver, ‘ I’m going to get off here.’ I spoke loud enough for the driver to hear. The horses were going at a slow trot, and I stepped off. I took hold of the dasher with one hand and the iron on the car with the other. As I stepped off my foot slipped, and I held on as long as I could. I dragged two or three yards holding on, and the front wheel ran over my foot before the car stopped, and I was holding on trying to save myself. • The conductor was on the back platform. While we were going out he came to me and collected my fare. Neither he nor the driver offered us a seat, nor told us to go inside. They did not tell us that we- ought not to stand on the front platform, or that it was dangerous there. I was then thirteen years old. There were no fenders or gates on the front platform ; nothing to prevent us from getting on or off the front platform. My foot gave me much pain, and I was prevented from work for eleven weeks.”</p>

    <p id="b88-7" data-blocks='[["BL_88.8",88,[266,1501,1164,775]]]'>Now let us apply the law to the facts in this ease. The plaintiff was a child of the age of thirteen years. He and his companion, a boy of the same age, signalled the driver as the defendants’ car crossed Thirteenth street. The car was slackened to receive them ; they stood there by the side of the driver all the way out to Eorty-first street and Lancaster Avenue. No objection was made by either the driver or conductor to their riding there; neither of them requested the plaintiff to step inside of the car ; the conductor came to him and collected his fare; at Eorty-first street and Lancaster Avenue, the plaintiff said to his companion in a voice sufficiently loud for the driver to hear, “I am going to get off here.” The speed of the car was thereupon slackened; the plaintiff took hold of the dasher with one hand, and the iron on the car with the other, and stepped off; the car continued in motion; the plaintiff’s foot slipped; he retained his hold to save himself; he was dragged two or three yards, and until the front wheel ran over his foot, causing the injury of which he complains.

As the plaintiff was suffered to stand upon and get off from the front platform, it should have been submitted to the jury to find whether the defendants, under all the facts, exercised proper care in not sooner stopping the car. It is the duty of a railway company to cause its cars to come to a full stop, to permit a passenger to get off. Whether the defendants properly discharged this duty with a due regard to the age of the plaintiff, and of the notice of plaintiff’s desire to leave the car, should have been left to the jury. We think the learned judge erred in directing that the verdict should be for the defendants. The errors are sustained.</p>
