Green delivered possession to Mcllvaine, who sold to Blaisdell. Lindsay purchased Green’s' interest at sheriff’s sale under his mortgage ; Blaisdell sold to Maxson, seven months after the award and five after the appeal was struck off; Lindsay tendered the amount of the award to Maxson and demanded a conveyance, which being refused he brought a bill for specific execution of Mcllvaine’s contract with Green. <em>Held, </em>that Green’s equitable interest was extinguished when the award became absolute, and Lindsay standing in his place could not compel a conveyance.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b180-9" data-blocks='[["BL_180.7",180,[252,832,1158,1119]]]'>44 It is conceded that the ejectment brought by Mcllvaine against Green was one of the class known as4 equitable ejectments,’ and was instituted to recover the amount of purchase-money remaining due on the contract of sale, or otherwise to rescind the contract. It will not indeed lie in the mouth of the plaintiff in this bill to say that such is not the case. Eor if the ejectment at any time involved other elements than this, they were eliminated at his instance, and the amount named in the award was upon his intervention shorn down to the exact balance of purchase-money due upon the articles of agreement, with interest. The enforcement of this contract is therefore <em>res adjudieata, </em>and cannot, upon well settled principles, be the subject of another action, whether legal or equitable. * * * Lewis, C. J., referring to this kind of ejectment, says, it is not any ordinary judgment at law. It is regarded as containing also the substance of a decree in equity for the payment of the money party and the conveyance of the land by another. It follows that the remedies of the parties respectively must be confined to proceedings founded on that judgment. If the defendant paid the money, according to the condition, it would be the duty of the court which rendered the judgment, to compel the conveyance of the land. If he failed to pay the money, the same court would grant leave to issue hab. fac. poss. to deliver possession of the land to the plaintiff. The mere circumstance that the condition of the award in the ejectment suit is an uncertain one, does not at all impair the quality of the award itself as an adjudication of the question involved in the present suit. * * *</p>

After putting himself on the record as an appellant from the award in that very case, he would seem to be estopped from asserting that he was not a party; but apart from that, and upon considerations hereinbefore stated, it has been seen that his rights as a privy can rest no higher than those of Green, under whom he claims, and with whom he must stand or fall with the exception that he is not to be prejudiced by any act of Green which can be construed to be in fraud of his rights as mortgagee, such as the <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>premature delivery of his possessions to Mcllvaine; and no such fraudulent act was shown to have been done up to the final judgment in the ejectment. If, therefore, Mr. Lindsay has any rights, arising out of the contract of sale, between Mcllvaine and Green, not yet extinguished, his remedy for asserting them must be confined to proceedings founded on that judgment. And upon a proper showing to the court, in that case, that the time within which he was entitled to pay the amount named in the judgment of the court, was not specified, and was only limited to what was reasonable under the circumstances of the case, and that he is ready, or has offered to pay the amount within such reasonable time, or if it become important in the opinion of the court to show that he did in point of fact tender (as he alleges) the proper amount of the award to Mcllvaine within the three weeks therein named, or at least, within three weeks after final judgment, and he can show it, it is not doubted that his claims will receive all the consideration to which they are entitled. And if he is entitled, upon yet paying the money, to a conveyance, it is certainly within the power of the court in that case to compel one.* * *</p>

It is urged by the defendants that it was Joseph Lindsay’s duty to have a new time fixed, if he did not want to abide by that fixed in the award; but in the opinion of the master, it was the duty of the plaintiff in the ejectment, who sought to enforce a forfeiture, to do everything necessary to make it complete. It was a matter within his province, as the actor in the case, and equity will not help him or shift his burdens, even if Lindsay’s negligence had concurred with his own. At the former hearings in this case some testimony was taken to show that Lindsay did, within three weeks after the date of the award, offer to pay Mcllvaine the correct amount due him, and that it was declined. Also, that the offer had been made on two occasions prior to the bringing of the ejectment suit. * * * Under the aspect which the case now presents, it is certainly, unimportant to the plaintiff here to decide whether such offers were really made or not, except, perhaps, as tending to rebut the charge of laches against him. If made, they were all made <em>prior to the final judgment." </em>* * *</p>

The defendants contend, however, that even if no time were fixed for paying the amount of the judgment, Lindsay was guilty of laches in not making any offer to pay it until September 20th, five months afterwards. But in this connection, it will be recollected that at the date of the judgment, Lindsay was but a creditor of Green, and had not yet acquired title to the equitable estate of the latter under the contract with Mcllvaine. It is true that a creditor may pay the amount to the vendor and save the forfeiture, but if he does he merely protects the defendant’s title, and is not entitled to a conveyance from the vendor, unless he has purchased the equity of the vendee. Lindsay was pressing his suit on Green’s mortgage with due diligence, and it was not until August 28th 1871, that he acquired the title to Green’s interest by means of a sheriff’s sale. The tender of the amount of the judgment in Mcllvaine <em>v. </em>Green, with interest and costs, was made by Lindsay on September 20th 1871. The master <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>is of the opinion that under the circumstances this was not too late, and that the court should yet compel a conveyance to him on payment of this amount. What would he supineness in one man may not be in another under different circumstances. Lindsay, it is true, was at liberty to pay this money at any time, but it was not his interest to do so until he could demand a conveyance to himself. To put himself in this position he was active in pushing his mortgage against Green, and within a reasonable time after the sheriff’s deed, tendered the amount of Mcllvaine’s judgment. It was then positively declined. There is nothing in the case to lead to believe that if the tender had been made at any time after the appeal was dismissed in Mcllvaine <em>v. </em>Green, it would have been accepted, but much to induce the contrary opinion; and as Mcllvaine and those claiming under him had full knowledge of Lindsay’s claim, no one is injured by the delay. * * *</p>

The appellants hold the undoubted legal title. The appellee rests his equitable claim upon the following facts, to wit: Mcllvaine, a former owner of the land, agreed in writing on the 2d day of January 1865, to sell and convey the same to one Green, in consideration of the sum of $13,370.62 to be paid therefor; $1190.62 thereof to be paid upon the execution of the agreement, and the residue in subsequent instalments. Upon the payment of the whole purchase-money, Mcllvaine was to convey the land to Green, his heirs and assigns in fee. Green went into possession, and prior to the 22d September 1866, made the first payment. He failed to pay the other instalments as they became due. On the 21st day of January 1871, Mcllvaine brought an action of ejectment, and on the 23d February 1871, obtained an award of arbitrators for the land, subject, in the language of the award, to this condition, “ to be released if the defendant pay the plaintiff the sum of $12,961.17 within three weeks of the date of this <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>award, and in case of such payment, the plaintiff shall make a full conveyance of the land in fee simple.”</p>

On the 22d September 1866, Green executed a mortgage upon all his interest in the land to Rhodes &amp; Ereeman. The mortgage was duly recorded on the 25th of the same month. May 16th 1867, this mortgage was duly assigned to the appellee. He issued a sei. fa. thereon to November Term 1870, and on the 27th of July 1871, obtained a judgment. A levari facias issued thereon, under which the land was sold on the 24th August 1871, to the appellee, to whom the sheriff executed a deed therefor on the 28th of the same month. On the 20th September 1871, he tendered to the appellants the amount of the judgment which Mcllvaine recovered against Green, with interest and costs, and demanded a conveyance of said premises in fee simple. The appellants declined to accept the money and refused to convey. On the 20th November 1871 the appellee filed this bill, praying that the appellants be decreed to convey the land to him upon his paying the amount of the judgment against Green with interest and costs. The case was referred to a master, who in February 1872 reported against the plaintiff in the bill; but afterwards by leave of the court, he filed an amended bill, upon which the master reported in favor of the decree prayed for. The court below confirmed the report and decreed a conveyance accordingly-</p>

If the appellee desired any extension of time for the payment of the sum awarded, thus corrected, then was the proper time to have asked for it. I do not mean to say that by the omission to apply on that day the appellee waived all right to invoke the equitable power of the court to designate some future day before which the judgment should not become absolute, yet I think the court would not have been justified in doing more than to enforce the spirit of the award as to the time of payment; and therefore should not have extended the time of payment for more than twenty-one days after the appeal was dismissed. The case is not analogous to a conditional verdict, in which the jury has omitted to fix a time of payment. Here the award did fix the time.

The holder of the legal title was not required to make the mortgagees parties to the action of ejectment. They had a lien only on the equitable interest of Green.
