A chose in action may, however, pass by assignment, for the debt itself cannot be delivered, and the only delivery that can be had must be of this character. A gift must be executed, for if it remains executory, and there be no consideration, it is void: Kennedy <em>v. </em>Ware, <em>supra. </em>In order to execute a gift of a chose in action, there must be a delivery of the evidence of the debt, or an assignment of it. ‘ A gift/ says C. J. Gibson, in re Campbell’s Estate, 7 Barr 101, ‘is a contract executed, and as the act of execution is the delivery of possession, it is of the essence of the title. It is the consummation of the contract, which without it would be no more than a contract to give, and without efficacy for the want of consideration. If made on a sufficient consideration, it would be a binding agreement; but then the nature of the contract would be changed, and there still would be no gift. The gift of a bond, note, or any other chattel, therefore, cannot be made'by words <em>in futuro, </em>or by words <em>in prcesenti, </em>unaccompanied by such delivery of possession as makes the disposal of the thing irrevocable.’ This doctrine is cited and approved in Painter’s Estate, <em>supra.</em>

To the same purport are the eases of Duffield <em>v. </em>Elwes, 1 Bligh R. 529; Fortes <em>v. </em>Barret, 3 Mylne &amp; Keen 36; Lonsdale <em>v. </em>Lonsdale, 5 Casey 407; Adams’s Eq. 234, note.</p>

It is said that an equitable assignment of a chose in action is a declaration of trust, with an agreement to permit the assignee to sue in the assignor’s name: Butler’s Coke Litt. 232, b. note 1. But how can this undelivered endorsement be termed an assignment ? It never passed out of the control of the testator. It never conferred a complete and present right upon the assignee. It would unquestionably have been competent for <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>the testator at any time after he made these endorsements to have, cancelled them. His power over the endorsements, up to the hour of his death, was complete and ample; and up to that hour the donee had acquired no rights. Yet the converse of all this'is essential to constitute an assignment. <em>Vide </em>3 Lead. Eq. Cases, H. &amp; W.’s notes 361, where it is said, It is necessary, in order to constitute an assignment either legal or equitable, that there should be such an actual or constructive appropriation of the subject-matter assigned as to confer a complete and present right in the assignee, even when the circumstances do not admit of its immediate exercise.' * * * The characteristic of an assignment is the relinquishment of all legal or equitable interest by the assignor, and the creation of a new and independent right in the assignee Rogers <em>v. </em>Horsach, <a href="/wend/18/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="18 Wend. 319" data-case-ids="2022117" data-case-paths="/wend/18/0319-01">18 Wendell 319</a>; Cowperthwaite <em>v. </em>Sheffield, 3 Comstock 243. ‘ If the donor has perfected his gift in the way in which he intended, so that there is nothing left for him to do, <em>and nothing whieh he has authority to countermand, </em>the donee’s right is enforced as a trust, and the consideration is immaterial ’: Adams’ Eq. 233. A delivery, then, of the bond, with the endorsement, was essential to vest rights in the donee. Until that was effected the testator had done nothing to relinquish his legal or equitable interest. The whole matter was yet in his power and subject to his control. He could have cancelled the endorsements without prejudice to any legal or equitable right of his intended beneficiary. It is well settled that nothing can take effect as an assignment which does not manifest an intention to relinquish the right of dominion on the one hand and create it on the other : 3 Leading Eq. Ca. 363; Dickinson <em>v. </em>Phillips, <a href="/barb/1/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Barb. 454" data-case-ids="5777685" data-case-paths="/barb/1/0454-01">1 Barb. 454</a>; Rogers <em>v. </em>Horsach, <a href="/wend/18/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="18 Wend. 319" data-case-ids="2022117" data-case-paths="/wend/18/0319-01">supra;</a> Hall <em>v. </em>Jackson, <a href="/mass/37/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="20 Pick. 194" data-case-ids="2038904" data-case-paths="/mass/37/0194-01">20 Pick. 194</a>. This doctrine is thoroughly sustained by our own authorities. In Lonsdale <em>v. </em>Lonsdale, 5 Casey 407, it was ruled that an assignment of choses in action <em>under seal, </em>without valuable consideration, designed to take effect at the death of the assignor, where such choses in action were not delivered until after the assignor had become insane, passed no title to the assignee. This would seem to rule the point now under consideration. The same question was ruled by Judge Chapman in Jones <em>v. </em>Drake, 6 Phila.

Kindness and filial devotion are not the subjects of a <em>quantum meruit. </em>The natural love and affection of a grandparent for his grandchild, when that grandchild had been attentive and affectionate to him and his wife in their declining years, would seem to have induced the testator to make the endorsement upon the bond.

There was no delivery; and no intention to deliver by George Streeper himself in his lifetime. The endorsement of the bond cannot operate as a release as in Wentz <em>v. </em>De Haven, for there, the creditor actually delivered the bond to-the, debtor himself. The writing is not a trust nor assignment,' but simply an intended or prospective gift, to be carried into effect by his executors. In the main we agree with the opinion of Judge Ross.
