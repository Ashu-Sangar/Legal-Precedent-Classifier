On going to the defendant for the plan, he said he would not sell, unless he got $17,000. Plaintiff informed Howell that the price had been raised to $17,000, and at Howell’s request he and plaintiff fixed a time to look at the property. Plaintiff afterwards called to see the defendant, who asked him if he had got a buyer ; plaintiff said he thought <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>he had ; defendant then said, “ If your man will take it by Saturday be can have it, after this week I will not bind myself.” On Saturday Howell told plaintiff that he would take the property, and requested him to ask the defendant if he would take some mortgages on account of the purchase-money. Plaintiff went on the same day to defendant, and told him it was Howell who wished to purchase, and that he said he would like him to take some mortgages for part of the purchase-money ; the defendant replied, “ That lets me out, I won’t sell.” Plaintiff replied, “No, he only said he would like to give you the mortgages, if it suited you, but he will take the property anyhow, and pay you the cash, if you require it the defendant insisted that this let him out, saying, “ If you had said nothing about the mortgages, I was fast — I could not have helped myself.” Plaintiff said Howell agreed to take the property, and would take it, only said he would like to take the mortgages, if convenient; but defendant persisted in his refusal, and requested plaintiff to tell Howell and ask him “ to let him up.” Plaintiff told Howell who directed him to go to the defendant, and demand the papers; plaintiff did so, but defendant still refused.</p>

During an interview soon after between the parties, the plaintiff informed the defendant that he thought he had procured a purchaser and <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>that he had given him the whole of that week to decide. To this defendant replied, “ If your man will take it by Saturday, all right, he can have it; after this week I will not be bound.” The plaintiff communicated this to Howell. The latter examined the property, and on Saturday morning informed the plaintiff he would take the property. He however requested the plaintiff to ask the defendant whether it would be convenient to take some mortgages on account of the purchase-money. Thereupon the same morning the plaintiff told the defendant that his man would take the property. That it was Mr. Howell, and that he would like to give him some mortgages in part payment of the purchase-money. The defendant replied, “That lets me out, I won’t sell.” The plaintiff said “ No, he only said he would like to give you the mortgages, if it suited you, but he will take the property anyhow, and will pay cash, if you require it.” The defendant persisted in his refusal to close the sale, and Howell insisted upon the purchase, declaring his readiness to pay the cash as soon as the papers could be prepared.</p>
    <p id="b217-6" data-blocks='[["BL_217.4",217,[235,1157,1167,735]]]'>We understand the defence to rest wholly upon the fact, that when the acceptance was communicated to the defendant, it was accompanied with a request that he take mortgages for a part of 'the purchase-money. It would seem by the defendant’s answer, that at first he might have understood this request to be one of the conditions of the purchase. If so, it appears this impression was immediately corrected by the plaintiff. This is the turning-point in the case. Howell accepted the offer as to price, and upon the day designated. Did he or not change the manner of payment ? The offer to sell was for cash. Was the acceptance conditional upon the defendant’s taking some mortgages, or was it unconditional ? We are clearly of the opinion that the evidence was sufficient to have been submitted to the jury to find whether.it was not unconditional. If the jury should so find, the plaintiff had clearly sustained his averment. He had procured a person to bargain and buy the property of the defendant at the price named. We think, therefore, the learned judge erred in not submitting the case to the jury.</p>
