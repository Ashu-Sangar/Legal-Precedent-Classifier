The master reported, and the court below decreed, that the appellant execute a deed in fee simple of the land, but that one-third of the purchase-money be withheld until the death of the wife, or until her right of dower should be released.</p>

Afterwards, upon the same day, the appellant informed his wife what he had done. She thereupon declared she would not sign the deed, and has continued to persist in that refus'al.

The letter and policy of the law forbid a wife to convey her interest in land otherwise than by the exercise of her own free and untrammelled will. A purchaser by contract from her husband, must be presumed to know this essential requisite, and, therefore, that he takes the risk of the wife’s uniting in the deed, or of his common-law right of action for damages against the husband. It may be answered that the ap- ” ” .e does not ask for a decree that the wife join in the deed; but only that one-third of the purchase-money be retained to indemnify the vendee against her contingent claim, and that, therefore, her free will is not constrained.</p>

J., in Clark <em>v. </em>Seirer, <em>supra, </em>“it seems to be at last settled on principles of policy and humanity, <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>that equity stirs not to enforce a contract which involves in it a wife’s volition in regard to her property, and it seems strange to us now, that courts of chancery should ever have hesitated about it. Contrary to the benign spirit of the common law, the avowed purpose of process of contempt against the husband, is to extort a conveyance from her affection, or from her fear.”</p>
    <p id="b149-6" data-blocks='[["BL_149.4",149,[244,634,1153,519]]]'>It must now be considered the settled law of this Commonwealth, that specific performance of an agreement to sell land, will not be decreed against a vendor who is a married man, and whose wife refuses to join in the conveyance so as to bar her dower, unless the vendee is willing to pay the full purchase-money, and accept the deed of the vendor without his wife joining therein: Riesz’s Appeal, 23 P. F. Smith 485. In giving the opinion of the court in that ease, it was well said by Mr. Justice Sharswood, “ The same sound policy whieh forbids a decree for the execution of a deed by the husband, to be enforced by his imprisonment, if he cannot obey, prevents any decree looking to compensation, abatement or indemnity.”</p>
    <p id="b149-7" data-blocks='[["BL_149.5",149,[287,1154,1005,32]]]'>The decree of the court below must therefore be reversed.</p>
    <p id="b149-8" data-blocks='[["BL_149.6",149,[243,1197,1154,171]]]'>Inasmuch, however, as upon the argument the counsel for the appellee expressed a desire to accept a deed from the appellant alone, rather than have no decree in his favor, we will send the case back in order that such a decree may be made.</p>
    <p id="b149-9" data-blocks='[["BL_149.7",149,[415,1368,981,129]]]'>Decree reversed, and record remitted, that a decree may be entered conformably to this opinion, and the appellee is directed to pay the costs of this appeal.</p>
