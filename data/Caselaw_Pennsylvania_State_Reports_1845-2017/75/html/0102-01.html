Then at her death the estate goes over to her appointees or children, &amp;c. Now if the will he effective in this disposition of these accumulations, it follows that the answer of the trustee appellant is correct; it has not in its hand any estate from which her income can be increased, for it is conceded that the body of the estate cannot be trenched upon for any such purpose.</p>

It provides that no person or persons shall, after the passage thereof, by any deed, will or otherwise, settle or dispose of any real or personal property, so and in such manner <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>that the rents, issues and profits thereof shall be wholly or partially accumulated for any longer term than the life or lives of any such grantor or grantors, settlor or settlors, or testator, and the term of twenty-one years from the death of any such grantor or testator; “that is to say, only after such decease, during the minority or respective minorities, with allowance for the period of the gestation of any person or persons who under the uses and trusts of the deed, will or other assurance directing such accumulation, would for the time being, if of full age, be entitled unto the rents, issues, interests and profits so directed to accumulate.” All other accumulations are in express terms rendered void, except those mentioned in the first proviso. It does seem to us that the true interpretation of this act is not hard to reach. In the first place, it allows accumulations only in favor of one class of persons, who are to be possessed of two qualifications: (1) They must be minors. (2) They must be such persons who, if not minors when the deed or will goes into effect, will be entitled to take the rents and profits from which the accumulations are to arise. Any attempt to direct such accumulations into any other channel renders the deed or will void pro <em>tanto, </em>and the rents or profits so appropriated pass to the person or persons who would have been entitled thereto, if such accumulation had not been directed.</p>
    <p id="b108-7" data-blocks='[["BL_108.4",108,[275,1339,1164,515]]]'>If now these accumulations go not to the minor, and it be conceded that such minor must, in order to satisfy the terms of the statute, be a beneficiary, it follows that the benefit may be so small as virtually to amount to nothing. If, for example, in the present instance, the amount of eight hundred dollars <em>per annum </em>only belongs to Annie D. Washington', the minor, and we suppose the annual accumulation to amount to eight hundred dollars more, then certainly her allowance might have been four hundred and the accumulation twelve hundred dollars per year. Thus we may by the same supposition reduce her beneficial interest to an annuity of ten dollars or of ten cents. This, however, would be a mere evasion of the terms of the statute, which is not to be tolerated.</p>

    <p id="b108-9" data-blocks='[["BL_108.6",108,[272,2071,1161,217]]]'>In other words, this is the period allowed in which the estate may be permitted to accumulate, and when the period of majority arrives, this aggregated estate may be distributed according to the directions of the deed or will creating it, without any regard whatever to the person during whose minority it was accumulated.</p>

    <p id="b109-7" data-blocks='[["BL_109.5",109,[238,715,1161,476]]]'>In the English act there are four distinct cases or periods in which or during which accumulations were allowed.

III. c. 98), omitting the second and third clauses thereof. With this light, therefore, thrown upon the subject under consideration, and in view of these very significant omissions, it becomes to our minds certain that, with the exceptions stated in the first proviso, <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>the legislature intended that, there should be no accumulations of the estates of decedents, except in favor of those minors who should be beneficiaries under the deed or will by which the trust should be raised.</p>
    <p id="b110-7" data-blocks='[["BL_110.4",110,[290,537,1163,421]]]'>But we again revert to the clause of the statute which directs that these accumulations’ shall run only during the minority of those who, “if for the time being were of full age, would be entitled to the rents, issues and profits so directed to accumulate.” Now, it is a singular interpretation of the act, which, whilst it must admit of the starting of the accumulations with the minority of one who, if of full age, would be entitled to the rents, issues and profits directed to be accumulated, nevertheless insists that such person may not "be so entitled when such rents, &amp;c., have been accumulated.</p>
