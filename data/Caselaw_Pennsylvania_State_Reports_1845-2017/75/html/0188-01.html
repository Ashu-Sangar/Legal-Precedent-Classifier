He alleges that the paper originally was some two and a half inches longer than it is, and <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>that there was written on this end, that this note was only to he due and payable on certain terms. A forgery may be committed in other ways than by writing the name of another to a note. Any alteration after the note is signed, in a material part, without the consent of the drawer, is a forgery. Any addition or erasure, or any material change, will be a forgery. The first impression on our mind was, that even if this whole allegation of the defendant were true, it would not amount to a forgery. The giving of a note, as in this ease, and intrusting it in the hands of the drawee in such a way that he could alter it without it being possible to detect it, should not be available against an innocent holder without notice; but this point appears to be a difficulty ruled in Worrall <em>v. </em>G-heen, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20388" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Wright 388">3 Wright 388</a>. In obedience to the principle there ruled, we instruct you that if the part described as written on the margin of this note was made by the parties to it, at the time it was executed, and it was to be a substantive part of the note, and wa,s intended at the time to he such part and parcel of the note ; then the cutting or tearing off this part would be such an alteration as would amount to a forgery and would destroy the note. <em>But to </em>have this effect you must be satisfied that when it was put there, it was to be a part of the note and not merely a memorandum of the terms on which the note was given. If you find this point in favor of the defendant he would be entitled to your verdict.

F. Smith 59, in which it was held that the note in the hands of a bonfi fide holder without notice of the fraud and for a valuable consideration, is not affected by the separation of the written agreement, there being nothing on the face of the note to indicate that the writing had ever constituted a part of the note. The same principle is recognised in Garrard <em>v. </em>Hadden, 17 P. F. Smith 82. It is the duty of the maker of the note to guard not only himself but the public against frauds and alterations, by refusing to sign negotiable paper made in such a form as to admit of fraudulent practices upon them, with ease and without ready detection.</p>
