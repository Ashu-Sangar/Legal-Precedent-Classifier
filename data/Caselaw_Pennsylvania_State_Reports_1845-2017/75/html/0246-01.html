He said <em>‘ </em>one year, no longer.’ At the end of something like two months, I called there with my son, and he went down stairs. They took him down in the basement, He took a book out of one of the trunks, and came up-stairs with the book with him, and told me to ask the gentleman again in his presence, which I did; and he (Granger) made exactly the same answer — that was, that he would charge no storage if I could pay them for the transportation when I took them away, and that they would be kept one year. He said, ‘ we are not allowed to take storage; we will keep them for nothing and for one year.’ I never went there again until the month of February.

With regard to this last point, I am bound to say, that although there may have been a lack of authority given to the clerk to enter into any such engagement, yet if, £e being an agent of the company, intrusted with the control and management of that department of the business, did in truth and in fact, when applied to for information in regard to it by Mrs. Schlessinger, make the answer which is imputed to him, then the company is bound By it. It is impossible that the public should know all the private regulations of a company engaged in such a business as this. The public have a right to suppose that the agents and officers of such a company are authorized to answer for the company in regard to all matters which are within the scope of the particular duty confided to them. The public have a right to regard the answer of the agent as the answer of the company, if it be an answer connected with the duty which'is intrusted to the agent by the company.</p>

The important inquiry, perhaps, is whether in point of fact he did enter into such an engagement upon the part of the company, as is alleged. If he did, then the company are bound <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>by it. If he did enter into such an engagement, namely to keep this baggage for a year, then it follows as a necessary consequence that the defendants had no right to sell the trunks within a year, in order to enforce the payment of their lien for freight — at any rate, without demanding the freight. * * * Supposing, however, that no engagement was made by him on behalf of the company to keep the goods for a year, what is then the relative situation of the parties under that aspect of the case? If it is true, as Mr. Granger has testified, that the plaintiff agreed to come very shortly and give such information to the company as would enable them to send these trunks to her, then it was plainly her duty to have complied with that promise. If she entered into that engagement, she ought to have come within a reasonable time and have taken the trunks away, or given information which would have enabled the company to have delivered the trunks to her; and if she neglected to do that, and left them in the hands of the company against their consent, then the trunks would be there at the risk of the plaintiff so far as all the ordinary accidents and chances to which they were exposed are concerned. . But nevertheless the defendants were bound to take ordinary care of the property while it actually remained in their possession. In other words, the neglect of the plaintiff to take away the trunks, if she promised to do so, would not justify the defendants in making, an improper or illegal disposition of the property, subsequently, if any such disposition was made; nor does it relieve them from that ordinary care which they are bound to take of all property, left in their charge under such circumstances. I do not know that the question of ordinary diligence can arise in any aspect of this case, except one, and perhaps the evidence upon that point is hardly of sufficient magnitude or weight to .raise the question. I shall leave it to you to say whether it does or not. * * * * * * If the trunks have been opened by anybody, or the things have been abstracted while in the custody of the defendants, and if that occurred by the negligence or want of ordinary care of the defendants, then they are responsible. They are responsible for the use of ordinary care in the taking care of the property while it remained in their custody, even though they should be during that period merely voluntary bailees of the goods.</p>

That seems to me to be the real question in this case rather than any question of negligence, because we can hardly describe that as negligence, perhaps, which is due to the direct and avowed act of the party himself in the exercise of what he claims to have been a legal right. These goods remained in the possession of defendants until December 1870. * * * They were then sent to <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>auction and sold on the SOth'of December 1870, and this is alleged was done in pursuance of an order of the’ Court of Common Pleas,' which, as the defendants say, protects them in having made that sale.

If they entered into any such agreement as that which the plaintiff has described, they had no right to make the application to the Court of Common Pleas for the order of sale; and in that case the order would not exempt them from the responsibility for selling the goods. Suppose that their version of the affair is the true one, and that they only suffered the goods to remain temporarily in the premises until the plaintiff should send for them after a brief lapse of time. Then, if the defendants were in no default in that respect, and if Mrs. Schlessinger was in default in not keeping her promise to send for them within a brief period, they had a right to make the application to the court under the Act of 1868, which they did make for the order of the sale of these goods, because they were not bound to keep them for ever after the plaintiff had promised to come for them within a very short time, or to send for them, or to give the defendants information where they could send them. They were not bound to continue to be her bailees for these goods against their own consent; and if she did not comply with her promise they had a right, after the lapse of a reasonable length of time (and I think until the month of December would have been a reasonable length of time, for the goods came in April), to give her notice, and make the application, if they did not know her residence, which they did make to the Court of Common Pleas ■for the order of sale. If they made that application under such circumstances in good faith, and proceeded to execute the order in good faith, then they would be exempt from responsibility arising from the sale of the property. But a question arises here as to whether they did execute the order, the protection of which they claim. The order of the court, made under the Act of 1863, was made for the purpose of enabling commission merchants, carriers, factors and others to enforee their liens against property in their possession by ordering the sale of the property. The order of the court under the application made in pursuance of the act, was for the sale of the said goods, wares and merchandise. Was that order executed by the sale which was made of this property in the manner in which it was made? Had the defendant any right, <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>under an order, to sell trunks locked up without stating whether they had anything in them ? — in a lump,' without exhibiting them and without any notice of any kind as to the contents of the trunks, so that no one knew whether they contained stones or ingots of gold, valuable or worthless things ? Had they any right to execute this order of sale in such a manner as that ? In regard to that I am bound to instruct you most emphatically: they had no such right. It was not a proper execution of the order made by the Court of Common Pleas. * * * The defendants were bound to act in good-faith, to have exposed these goods for sale at a public auction after the manner in which goods are usually sold. * * * Therefore I feel bound to instruct you that the' defendants did not fulfil this order of the Court of Common Pleas in a proper manner, and that the sale in the manner in which they acted was an improper appropriation of the goods, and was in point of law a wrongful conversion of the goods. * * * If then this sale was conducted in that manner, it was an unlawful sale. It was not such a sale as was ordered by the court and the defendants cannot claim the protection of the order of the court unless they have complied with its terms.</p>

The jury in this matter should proceed with as much care and exactness as the evidence will permit. They should bear in mind in considering the evidence of the plaintiff, the natural bias which possibly may have influenced her from her interest in the result of this case — a bias of which she may be unconscious, and which may to a certain extent have affected her testimony, although she may have desired to state nothing but what she believed to be absolutely and strictly true. It is very important to remember the position of the plaintiff and her son, upon whose testimony, so far as the plaintiff’s case is concerned, the question of value is to be determined. You are to bear in mind, constantly, their relation to the case and to make such allowance for it as you see proper. Of course no more. It is the plaintiff’s duty to satisfy you upon that point. The value of these things is not to be affected by any considerations which are merely personal to the plaintiff herself. The value of this property is not to be affixed by any mere fancies or by any sentiments, however honorable, natural and proper those sentiments may be. An heir-loom in a family, the picture of an ancestor, or a memorial of a friend, may be of inestimable personal value to the owner. There may be sentiments connected with them, which it is impossible to measure by any pecuniary standard. It is not <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>by such considerations that you are to arrive at the value of the plaintiff’s property, for the law does not recognise any such difficult and impossible standard as a measure of value. It adopts a more practical method of ascertaining the value — a method which can he applied practically to the relations of human life, which is susceptible of some degree of certainty and which in its application will do justice between man and man. Therefore in determining the value of these things you are not to be affected in' your estimates by any such ideas as these to which I have referred. You are to set the market value upon each of these articles if you should find for the plaintiff, and you are to determine what each of them is worth pecuniarily — what they would bring if sold at a public sale. * * *</p>

I shall leave that question to you entirely, with the remark that it is necessary to be cautious, of course, in estimating the value of such property. I am sure you will look at the subject as men of business and common sense, and if there should be a verdict for the plaintiff, you will affix such a value to these articles as you think they would have brought at a public sale. You are not, if there should be a verdict for1 the plaintiff, to inflame the damages by affixing any fanciful values, but you should, in doing justice between the parties, affix such a value as you think the articles really and intrinsically possess— such a value as would be represented by the prices they would bring if they had been sold.” * * *</p>

The right to recover does not rest upon the careless and negligent manner in which the property was kept, but on the unlawful and irregular manner in which it was sold.

The act was within the general scope of the agent’s authority. It was a representation made in the course of the business intrusted to his particular care. Corporations act through agents. The public is not informed as to the specific and private instructions which may be given to them, limiting their ostensible powers. A just protection to persons dealing with corporations imperatively requires that the act of the agent, within the general scope of the business with which he is intrusted, shall bind the company, although the specific act may be in excess of his private instructions : Tanner <em>v. </em>Oil Creek R. R. Co., 3 P. F. Smith 411. If the testimony of the defendant in error was believed, the right of sale did not exist at that time.</p>

Dig. 220, pi. 6 and 7, under which the plaintiff in error proposed to sell the property, authorized the company to “expose” it to sale at public auction. The fair meaning of “ expose” in this statute obviously is “ to exhibit,” “ to bring into view,” “ display,” <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>to “ point out or show to the bystanders.” Selling the trunks with the goods locked up in them, and describing the contents as unknown, withholds from the bidders all knowledge of the character or value of the contents, and clearly was not within the meaning of the law which directs the manner of sale. This' manner of selling goods of value is unjust to the owner. It is no answer for a corporation to say that by this method its sales in the aggregate produce quite as large a sum as if the articles were exposed to view. The company may not suffer, yet great injustice be done to the owner of valuable goods. There is no just reason why his goods should be sold at a sacrifice to enable the almost worthless property of another to be sold for more than its value. Such a mode of selling is unjust to the bidders; generally they will not stand upon equal ground. The strong probability is that the contents will be known to one or more of the agents, and all packages that are really valuable will' be struck down at low prices to some one acting in the interest of the knowing agent. In this very case the evidence shows that the contents of the trunks were actually examined by one of the agents of the company before the sale, yet each was sold as contents unknown, for a few dollars. To whom they were sold, or what became of the contents, the evidence fails to disclose.</p>
