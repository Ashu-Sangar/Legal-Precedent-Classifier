The sale had been made to Hilburn &amp; Jones, April 17th; the 100 shares were sold to Fisher &amp; Brother, at sixty days; at the end of sixty- days, it was delivered by De Haven &amp; Brother; he directed us to buy it in, and we did so. June 6th, on that day sold 200 shares to Fell &amp; Brother, seller sixty; at the end of the time we bought that in at the board; De Haven &amp; Co. bought that for us August 4th; our advice does not tell who that was sold to; we had advice from our Philadelphia broker that the stock was sold; at the end of the time that was bought at the request of Mr. Maxton and delivered. On June 16th, the 100 shares were sold to O. T. Yerkes &amp; Co.; were delivered at the end of the sixty days; they were bought in upon the order of Lewis Maxton. Did not buy of Yerkes &amp; Co.-as we know of; we ordered it bought at the board; we do not know where we bought the stock. August 17th, that is on the same footing as the other; we were not advised who to; that was bought in at the same direction and delivered in the same way; we advised Mr. Maxton of these transactions when they occurred, sometimes by mail, sometimes in person; we sent all the orders to Philadelphia to be executed, and generally by telegraph; in every instance the stock was delivered ; his losses were more than the balance; his credits as cash indicate what he paid us; I cannot tell whether he ever ordered us to purchase when he did not have the money in our hands.”</p>

He had been dealing in stock before in Reading; that is, bought it and I think held it awhile at one time; we had furnished him several different investments. The first credit was a balance from the preceding year; I considered this a margin — the cash in hand. When we sell stock short, we require from two to ten dollars per share as a margin, unless the party leaves the stock with us ; we require this margin whether the seller owns the stock or not, if it is not left with us to cover our responsibility to the purchaser ; after the second sale I knew he was selling short.”</p>

Such transactions are-mere wagers. But here the stock was in every instance actually sold and delivered, and the transaction carried into final execution. The plaintiffs, who were the brokers of the defendant, were not even aware that he was selling “ short” until the term of credit was expiring, and he bought to fill his sales. It will not do to say, because there is so much gambling in stocks, that every sale “short” as it is termed, is <em>ipso facto </em>a wager. It is evidence, it is true, but there must be other facts to characterize the transaction, and to show the actual intent of the parties was to wager merely upon the prospective price. Judgment affirmed.</p>
