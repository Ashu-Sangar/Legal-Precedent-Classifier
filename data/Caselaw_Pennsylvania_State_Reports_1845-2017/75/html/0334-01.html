The language, “it shall be lawful,” contained in the thirteenth section of the Act of 15th April 1832, Purd. Dig. 406, pi. 8, is not mandatory upon the register. It does not take from him the exercise of a sound legal discretion. In the exercise of that discretion he may determine whether he will decide upon the matters of fact, or will direct the desired issue to the Common Pleas: Wikoff’s Appeal, 3 Harris 281; Cozzens’s Will, 11 P.
