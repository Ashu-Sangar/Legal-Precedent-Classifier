That then Grout gave Long a check for money, and Long gave Grout the note in question. It is claimed by the defendants below that for the purpose of paying them one thousand dollars, Grout suggested that their note for that amount should be drawn payable to him ; and that he would endorse it and have it discounted at bank, and thus obtain for them the money; and he would take it up at maturity.

In this we think he erred. The facts proved, wholly unexplained by the plaintiff below, were sufficient to have been submitted to the jury to find whether the note was not given for the accommodation of Grout. It was given at an interview in which he admitted his indebtedness to the makers, and at a time when he was asked for a payment of the sum for which the note was given. Thereupon the note was executed and delivered to him, and he gave his cheek to Long for money. After the maturity of the note it was found in his hands and he then disposed of it to the plaintiff below. If the jury should find that the note was given under the circumstances claimed by the defendants below, and taken up by Grout when it matured, then the plaintiff below took it subject to all the equities which had attached to it while in the hands of Grout, and there was a good defence: Bower <em>v. </em>Hastings <em>et al., </em>12 Casey 285; Wilson <em>v. </em>Mechanics’ Savings Bank, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20488" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="9 Wright 488">9 Wright 488</a>.</p>
