But as to defects on the face of the claim filed, they are not raised by such a plea*. <em>A fortiori </em>is this so, when the only issue is upon the plea of payment.

That the value of the services of such an architect might be enhanced by a patent right of which he was the proprietor, can hardly be doubted ; and if a specific agreement is made with him for a certain sum for the use of his patent and his superintendence in putting it up, he is certainly entitled to file a lien for that amount and to recover it upon proceeding by scire facias.</p>

The Act of Assembly under which this claim was filed was approved February 17th 1858, Pamph. L. 29, and is entitled “An Act relative to mechanics’ liens in the counties of Luzerne and Schuylkill.” It extends the provisions of the general Act of 1836 “ to all improvements, engines, pumps, machinery, screens and fixtures erected or put up by tenants of leased estates on land of others in the counties of Luzerne and Schuylkill, and to all mechanics, machinists and material-men doing work or furnishing the articles or materials therefor: Provided, That the lien hereby created shall extend only to the interest of the tenant or tenants, lessee or lessees therein, and to the improvements, engines, pumps, machinery, screens a.nd fixtures erected, repaired or put up by the mechanics, machinists, persons or material-men entering liens thereon.” The claim of the plaintiff was for work done in the erection of a patent hoisting and dumping cage, yet the claim filed is against the entire leasehold interest in the colliery. The Act of Assembly gave the plaintiff no such lien. It confines the lien clearly to the interest of the lessees in the improvement and machinery upon which his labor and services were bestowed. Upon an execution on the judgment upon this scire facias, the leasehold interest in the entire colliery could be levied upon and sold. This fatal error in the claim, though not regularly, is substantially assigned. It certainly was not waived as merely formally defective and by going to trial on the issue of payment. In Carey <em>v. </em>Wintersteen, 10 P. F. Smith 395, where the lien was filed against the owners and not the lessees of “ a certain frame engine and shaft-house,” &amp;c., judgment recovered on the scire facias was reversed on that account. For that reason the judgment in this case cannot be sustained. The defendants below were entitled to an affirmative answer to their first point. Judgment reversed.</p>
