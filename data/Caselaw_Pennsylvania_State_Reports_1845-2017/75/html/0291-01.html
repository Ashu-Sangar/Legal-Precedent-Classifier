The plaintiff in error was incorporated under the Act of 1st April 1831, Pamph. Laws 316. The sixth section of the act declares, that the “ corporation shall not consist of more than one hundred active members, ***** and also, that this corporation may bestow the privileges of honorary membership on such active members as they may think proper, and under such regulations as the by-laws may prescribe.” Thus the charter limits the number of active members, and gives no authority to make any person an honorary member, unless he has previously been an active member. In subordination to this organic law, section third, article first of the. by-laws declares <em>“ </em>Honorary membership may be conferred upon such active members of five years’ standing, who shall have paid all dues and fines, and attended a number of fires equivalent to one-half those occurring during their service; <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>and upon such others as shall pay twenty-five dollars for the privilege.

Section four declares “ Contributing members shall be elected in the same manner as active members.

The right of suffrage was denied to them. They were declared ineligible to office. They had no power or authority affecting the business of the corporation. The only duty imposed on them was the payment of a small sum annually. The only penalty imposed for a violation &lt;?f that duty, is that the delinquent’s name be stricken from the roll.</p>

It extended not to the admission of contributing members. No corporation can make valid any by-law in conflict with its charter. That would be to enable the corporation to make a new constitution for itself, and thereby wholly defeat the object of the law which gave it birth.</p>
