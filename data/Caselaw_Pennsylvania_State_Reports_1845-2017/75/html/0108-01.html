The first assignment of error raises the question as to whether he was discharged by reason of an agreement between the holder and the maker, after the note became due, extending the time of payment. It is a well-recognised rule that an extension of time by a valid agreement between the creditor and the principal, will, as a general rule, discharge the endorser. The reasons therefor are these: The liability of the endorser to the holder is secondary and contingent. On his paying the note, he has a right of action against the principal, or of subrogation to the rights of the creditor. Hence, if time has been given, or an act has been done by the creditor which prejudices these equities in the endorser, he will be discharged.</p>

It was said, however, by Lord Chancellor Eldon, in Ex parte Glendenning, <em>vide supra, </em>“Ever since Mr. Richard Buck’s case, the law has been clearly settled, and is now perfectly understood, that unless the creditor reserves his remedies, he discharges the surety by compounding with the principal, and 'the reservation must be upon the face of the instrument by which the parties make the compromise; for evidence cannot be admitted to vary or explain the effect of the instrument.” - It was held'in Wyke <em>v. </em>Rogers, 1 De G., Mac. &amp; G. 408, that parol evidence might be given to show that an agreement, which would by itself operate to release the surety, was not to have that effect.</p>
    <p id="b113-6" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[216,1159,1166,720]]]'>The ground upon which an agreement to give time to the maker, made by the holder without the consent of the endorsers, upon a valid consideration, is held .to be a discharge of the endorsers, is solely this, that the holder thereby impliedly stipulates not to pursue the endorsers, or to seek satisfaction from them in the intermediate period. It can never apply to any case where a contrary stipulation exists between the parties. Hence, if the agreement for delay expressly saves and reserves the rights of the holder in the intermediate time against the endorsers, it w'ill not discharge the latter. In such case the very ground of the objection is removed, for their rights are not postponed against the maker, if they should take up the note: Story on Prom. Notes, sect. 416. The same rule is recognised in Viele <em>v. </em>Hoag, <a href="/vt/24/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="24 Vt. 46" data-case-ids="4427968" data-case-paths="/vt/24/0046-01">24 Vt. 46</a> ; Morse <em>v. </em>Huntington, 40 Id. 488; Clagett <em>et al. v. </em>Salmon, 5 Gill &amp; Johns. 315.
