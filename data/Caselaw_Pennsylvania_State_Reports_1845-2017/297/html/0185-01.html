L. 12. The act provided for the erection, use and management of the structure, with authority in the two governing bodies to enter into an agreement to effectuate the full exercise of the powers thus conferred. This agreement covered the use and occupation of certain parts of the building by the city and of other parts by the county. Where one of the parties occupied more space than its share, a specified rate per cubic foot as rental was provided for the excess. The agreement also covered maintenance, repair, care and operation of the building. There are elevators in each end, one half of which are operated by the county with its labor, the other half by the city under a similar arrangement. The building is lighted and heated at their joint expense. It contains the county offices, the courts of common pleas, the Bar Association and the Law Library, also such city offices as the mayor’s, treasurer’s, city controller’s, police bureau, department of public safety, department of public health, public welfare, director of supplies, council chambers, city solicitor, and practically all others, including bureau of water, bureau of granting permits and licenses and all revenue-producing bureaus.</p>

Persons desiring to transact business with any of these departments are invited into the building where they may use the elevators indiscriminately, that is, either those of the city or county, irrespective of whether the visitor is on city or county business; the operators of the elevators do not know the <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>character of the journey on which their occupants are engaged.</p>
    <p id="b249-3" data-blocks='[["BL_249.4",249,[134,458,1154,807]]]'>Helen Bell entered an elevator to go to the public welfare department of the city, to obtain a permit for the city hospital. She was directed by the dispatcher to enter an elevator which was standing open, waiting for passengers. The elevator was in the part occupied by the county and was operated by its employee. There was no one else in the car when she got on. She had taken about two steps when it started upward quickly and she was thrown to the floor. The outer door of the elevator shaft had been closed but the inner door on the cage Avas still open and her right arm was caught between the elevator and shaft and almost torn from her body. She brought suit against the county and the city and recovered a verdict of $8,000 against the county, on which judgment was entered.</p>
    <p id="b249-4" data-blocks='[["BL_249.5",249,[137,1275,1153,796]]]'>The question presented is whether, when, in the joint Ownership, maintenance and operation of a building by a city and county, partly for business and partly for governmental purposes, an elevator, used indiscriminately to carry persons to and from the offices, is so operated as to injure a passenger, the county is liable for the negligent act of its servant who causes the injury. We may assume that the county in its Own separate activities was engaged in purely governmental functions and there can be no doubt that the city in many of its departments was engaged in purely business enterprises in this building, notably the water business; in the dual or joint relationship of these agencies of government, their activities must be judged from such legal aspects as their mixed relations warrant.</p>

Phila., <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a><a href="/citations/?q=31%20Pa.%20183" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="31 Pa. 183">31 Pa. 183</a>; American Aniline Products, Inc., v. Lock Haven, <a href="/pa/288/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="288 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="1100760" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0420-01">288 Pa. 420</a>. The City of Pittsburgh is engaged in the supply of water to the public, and as such its activities are those of a business corporation. In considering the joint discharge of business and governmental undertaking's through the same medium, we may liken the county itself to the federal government in its connection with the shipping board. See Haines v. Lone Star Shipbuilding Co. et al., <a href="/pa/275/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="275 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="1075670" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0260-01">275 Pa. 260</a>. When the government embarks in an industrial enterprise through corporate form (or without that form) it places its name and its sovereign position on the same plane as that of any other stock company or dealer in a similar commodity. The fact that some of the activities centered in this building are exclusively of a purely governmental nature will not affect liability, when they are joined with business activities. To separate the various journeys to these different activities by movements of time or particular instances of use would be to destroy the unity of the rule that imposes liability for negligent acts against one of the parties. A trip by one in regard to a governmental function and a trip by one in respect to business in the same vehicle cannot be separated when viewing the duty and responsibility of the carriers which transport the parties. Where these acts in furtherance of the activities of the separate agencies are at times mingled and at times alternated, there is no separation when testing their legal effect as related to responsibility for the negligent acts of servants. Reason and justice dictate that the rules governing business activities predominate. The instrumentality must always be considered in the use in which the joint arrangements placed it, namely, joint business and government use. The courts cannot be expected to unscramble the mixed relations in which the parties find themselves through their agreement.</p>

If they were acting for the city in its corporate or business capacity, the municipality may be held liable; but if they were performing duties of a public or governmental character, there is an immunity from municipal liability.” We have found that among the city’s activities, which the county joined in promoting, were certain business enterprises carried on in the building. In addition, the two bodies jointly engaged in business enterprises in leasing parts of the structure; and finally the combination of their interests to effect a given purpose through the joint building was in itself a business enterprise, in that it lessened the cost of government operation.</p>
