There would seem to be no vital difference between them; for if, as has been many times decided, the purchaser of lots according to a plan acquires a contractual right to the use of all the streets on the plan, that contractual right would appear to be entitled to protection no matter when the purchase was made.

The vacating ordinance enjoined certain conditions upon the company, but these conditions were not imposed for the special benefit of plaintiff or any of its predecessors in title, and hence it has no standing to complain of a failure to comply therewith. The court below found, without objection from plaintiff, that “Eighth Street has been continuously closed since the passage of that ordinance (September 8, 1852), and the one hundred feet of Plum Alley, complained of in this bill, has never been opened or used since the passage of the ordinance of the City of Pittsburgh on March 29, 1886....... Under the admitted facts of this case, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, which is the real defendant in the case, has had possession of the land formerly within the boundary lines of the streets in dispute, for over forty years, covered by their railroad tracks and warehouses.” It also found that neither the public generally nor any lot owner in the plan had made any use of either street during that period of time, and might have added that, so far as the record disclosed, no claim of a right to such use was made by plaintiff, or its pred<a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>ecessors in title, until about the time the present bill was filed on April 8, 1927.

It has never been doubted by us, and is conclusive of the controversy in the instant case. It is not possible to conceive of acts more clearly “inconsistent with the right” of plaintiff and its predecessors in title, to still have an easement over these properties, than “the admitted fact [that] the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, which is the real defendant in the case, has had possession of the land, formerly within the boundary lines of the streets in dispute, for over forty years, covered by their railroad tracks and warehouses.” In the case cited, thirty years adverse use was deemed sufficient to destroy the easement; here there has been forty years as to one street and nearly seventy-five years as to the other. Indeed, twenty-one years would have been ample under the Act of March 26, 1785, 2 Sm. Laws 299, the exceptions therein in favor of those “within the age of twenty-one years, feme covert, non compos mentis, imprisoned, or beyond the seas, or from and without the United States of America” not applying here, and by section 15 of the Act of April 14, 1851, P.

      <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>Evidently feeling the stress of the argument on this point, plaintiff contends that the use by defendant’s predecessor in title was permissive only and asks us to so find, and hence to exclude the defense we are considering, though pointing to neither fact nor circumstance to justify the conclusion. This, of course, we cannot do. Aside from the presumption which we have already considered, it may be said that a use will be held to be permissive in case there was an express or implied permission to use, but not otherwise. “The term ‘permissive use’ which is used interchangeably with the word ‘license’ meaning the use of a way with the consent of the landowner, which is terminable at the will of the landowner, or on completion of the specific act or acts contemplated in the permission”: Novinger v. Shoop (Mo.), <a href="/citations/?q=201%20S.W.%2064" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="201 S.W. 64">201 S. W. Rep. 64</a>. To the same effect are Alper v. Tormey, <a href="/cal-app/7/0008-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="7 Cal. App. 8" data-case-ids="4523085" data-case-paths="/cal-app/7/0008-01">7 Cal. App. 8</a>, and our own case of Conn et al. v. P. R. R., <a href="/pa/288/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="288 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="1100846" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0494-01">288 Pa. 494</a>, 502. Here there is no pretense of anything equivalent to a license.</p>

We said as early as Foulk v. Brown, <a href="/watts/2/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="2 Watts 209" data-case-ids="1840095" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0209-01">2 Watts 209</a>, 215 (1834) quoted with approval in Biddle v. Girard Nat. Bank, <a href="/pa/109/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="109 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="542256" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0349-01">109 Pa. 349</a>, 356 (1885), and cited and followed as late as Sheafer v. Woodside, <a href="/pa/257/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="257 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1032383" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0276-01">257 Pa. 276</a>, 280 (1917), that “The rule of presumption, when traced to its foundation, is a rule of convenience and policy, the result of a necessary regard to the peace and security of society. No person ought to be permitted to lie by, whilst transactions can be fairly investigated and justly determined, until time has involved them in uncertainty and obscurity, and then ask for an inquiry. Justice cannot be satisfactorily done when parties and witnesses are dead, vouchers lost or thrown away, and a new generation has appeared on the stage of life, unacquainted with the affairs of a past <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>age, and often regardless of them. Papers which onr predecessors have carefully preserved are often thrown aside or scattered as useless by their successors.” The chancellor and the court in banc should have unhesitatingly applied that principle to the instant case, for “nothing can call a court of equity into activity, but conscience, good faith and reasonable diligence”: Kinter v. Commonwealth Trust Co., <a href="/pa/274/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="274 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1072911" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0436-01">274 Pa. 436</a>.</p>
