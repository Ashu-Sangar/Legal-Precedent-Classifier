Malley as their interests may appear...... Against loss and/or expense by reason of the liability imposed by law upon the insured for damages on account of bodily injuries and/or death accidentally suffered, by any person or persons, other than employees of the insured, by reason of the ownership, maintenance and/or use of the automobile......

If suit be brought against the insured to enforce a claim for damages covered by this contract, the insured shall forward immediately to The Indemnity Exchange of America, every summons or other process and every other paper as soon as the same shall have been served on the insured. The Indemnity Exchange of America shall defend such suits in the name and on behalf of the insured. The expense of such defense shall be treated as a loss under the contract.

Otherwise, as appellee’s petition averred, he could not pay or do anything in relief of the injured plaintiff’s damages and defendant would escape its contract liability unless the question was determined whether the insurance policy was a valid, binding contract with immediate liability thereunder. As the judgment against appellee in the damage case was a continuing liability, it could always be collected if he came into funds, hence he had a decided interest in being relieved of this outstanding burden, against which he believed he was protected by this policy, at least to the extent of $5,000. Appellant admits that if appellee is entitled to relief it is entitled to it under the Declaratory <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>Judgments Act, but denies the right to relief because he has not paid the judgment, and the policy is unenforceable from a breach of the warranty of ownership.

Continuing, the Chief Justice said: “Had the parties seen fit, they could have had the help of a judicial declaration of their respective rights and liabilities before taking a definite stand amounting to an ultimatum on each side and asking for a declaratory judgment on that state of fact.” Here, if appellant’s legal position is sound, plaintiff could not have asserted his right until he had paid the judgment, and as he is without the means to do this, the insurance carrier is relieved from making payment. Such an advantage, in connection with appellee’s contention as first above stated, the law will not countenance, unless compelled to, and as there is no objection from any source all questions may as well be determined in this proceeding as any other.</p>

The undertaking to defend is of no value, and may be of great danger, to the assured, where he thus abandons all control of the suit to the com<a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>pany, if it does not mean that whatever liability is established shall be discharged. The company admits that where the assured is perfectly solvent the practice of the company is to carry the defense to a successful issue by paying the judgment without waiting for the assured to pay it. It is even more important to an assured who is in financial stress that no judgment be allowed to stand unsatisfied against him than it is to one who has abundant means to satisfy it with.” Consequently, in such cases, after recovery of a judgment against the insured, the party injured may have a remedy against the company by garnishee process or by resort to a suit in equity: Fentress v.

    <p id="b283-3" data-blocks='[["BL_283.4",283,[158,1229,1154,1069]]]'>Loss does not have an inflexible meaning and may consist of many different situations of varying gradations. Voluntary or involuntary separation from one’s money is not the only criterion of loss. Any shrinkage in value of estate or property may on proper occasions be rightfully so termed. Any depreciation or depletion of property values, as well as the destruction of all property value through judicial sale or otherwise would likewise come within the definition; the concrete result of these factors, as it affects the owner, is a loss. See Schambs v. Fidelity Casualty Co., <a href="/f/259/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="259 F. 55" data-case-ids="5389090" data-case-paths="/f/259/0055-01">259 Fed. 55</a> and <a href="/f/263/0895-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="263 F. 895" data-case-ids="3944470" data-case-paths="/f/263/0895-01">263 Fed. 895</a>. Therefore, following the above line of decisions, under a policy such as we have before us, we hold there is a potential loss, though money may not have been actually paid; the insured may sue the company directly after judgment and before he pays anything, or his creditor may institute garnishment against the company. The presence of these direct remedies would not affect the right to a declaratory judgment, for reasons unnecessary to state.</p>

When an insurance company or its representative is notified of loss occurring under an indemnity policy, it becomes its duty immediately to investigate all the facts in connection with the supposed loss as well as any possible defense on the policy. It cannot play fast and loose, taking a chance in the hope of winning, and, if the results are adverse, take advantage of a defect in the policy. The insured loses substantial rights when he surrenders, as he must, to the insurance carrier the conduct of the case. The insurance carrier is not placed in any disadvantageous situation, especially as the lack of ownership did not contribute to the loss. The estoppel to assert the breach of warranty as to title, is no higher in right than an estoppel generally to deny that the claim came under the policy. In effect, both are of equal merit. With a little diligence and within a brief time, the carrier could have procured the exact knowledge on which it now relies, and in most <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>cases may similarly prepare a defense. Here an inquiry from public officials, at the State Capital, would have revealed plaintiff’s exact relation with regard to ownership. With these facts before it, had they been deemed sufficient, it could have declined to defend the case, resting its right on the supposed breach of warranty; in deciding what course it should pursue, it is guided, as any person confronted by similar circumstances; but, once having made its decision, the rights of others in relation thereto cannot be prejudiced. The court below was amply warranted in entering the judgment here appealed from.</p>
