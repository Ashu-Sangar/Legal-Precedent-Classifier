Both sets were presented for payment by appellant, Dr. Smith, who had purchased them from Ida Hoffman. The first set, or eleven' of these certificates, had been purchased with money (belonging to the Hoffman Leaf Tobacco Company, a partnership) which had been embezzled by the husband of Ida Hoffman, who was also one of the partners. The other certificates were not so purchased. Payment to appellant on both sets was resisted, by creditors .of the tobacco company and the husband, through their trustees in bankruptcy. The court below held that the equitable title to the eleven certificates purchased with the partnership funds was in the tobacco company and title to the other set in the trustee of the husband, and refused appellant’s claim. A different question is involved as to each set of certificates.</p>

On the last day of March, 1926, M. R. Hoffman, one of the partners, and husband of Ida, re<a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>ceived a check, payable to the firm, for $22,000, which he endorsed in the partnership’s name, and purchased with this money the eleven certificates of deposit in question, for his wife. In December, 1926, his son went to Philadelphia and sold to appellant these certificates, together with the other set of three certificates, having a total face value of $11,721.68, for $8,500. At this time all the certificates were overdue.</p>
    <p id="b616-4" data-blocks='[["BL_616.4",616,[284,793,1149,527]]]'>The court below found that appellant was the father-in-law of one of the partners of the tobacco company; that he knew of the financial condition of the firm and all its partners; and that he had knowledge of the misappropriation of the $22,000 check. These findings, being supported by evidence, have the weight of the verdict of a jury: Glenn v. Trees, <a href="/pa/276/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="276 Pa. 165" data-case-ids="1077529" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0165-01">276 Pa. 165</a>; Rokeach v.

    <p id="b616-5" data-blocks='[["BL_616.5",616,[282,1333,1150,740]]]'>The money of the company was fraudulently used to buy the certificates, and, in legal contemplation, Ida Hoffman held them as constructive trustee for the firm. The question here is whether there was sufficient evidence from which the court below could find the purchaser of the securities from her, knew, or should have known, the title transferred was tainted with fraud, and that an equitable title existed in a third party. It is a universal rule that if one purchases property from a trustee, with notice of the trust, he should be charged with the same trusts as the trustee from whom he purchases : Perry on Trusts, section 217, and cases there cited. This rule applies to constructive as well as express trusts.</p>

The price paid was much less than their face value, or the sum paid for their original purchase: In re Hill, <a href="/f/187/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="187 F. 214" data-case-ids="33057" data-case-paths="/f/187/0214-01">187 Fed. 214</a>. Dr. Smith knew when he purchased the certificates that the bank was in liquidation, and that Ida’s husband, with Michael, Jr., was in bankruptcy. There was also some evidence that Dr. Smith had known of the misappropriation. The mere fact that his daughter was married to one of the bankrupts, who may have been concerned in the fraud, would not be sufficient to charge him with notice: Stewart County Bank v. Adams, 96 Georgia 529; see Clark v. Roberts, <a href="/mass/206/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="206 Mass. 235" data-case-ids="79035" data-case-paths="/mass/206/0235-01">206 Mass. 235</a>.

To charge a purchaser with notice he must have actual knowledge of the defect, or knowledge of such facts that his act in taking title amounted to bad faith.

She may purchase such securities with her own estate and credit, or receive them in any other legitimate way; but, in a contest between a married woman and her husband through creditors to decide the ownership of property, the burden is on her to establish her ownership to such property by clear and satisfactory evidence (Billington v.

Originally, title to the property of the wife was vested in the husband; she herself had no separate estate. The Act of April 11, 1848, P. L. 536, initiated a change in this impediment to ownership. The act permitted her to acquire or hold a separate estate gotten by will, descent, deed, or otherwise, before or during coverture. There is, however, no presumption in favor of the existence of such an estate when in contest with her husband’s creditors, — rather the contrary: Wilson v. Silk-man, supra. In such contests the wife must affirmatively establish ownership, not only because of the ease with which the husband’s creditors may be defrauded, but because, ordinarily, it is impossible for her to have <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>a possession separate and distinct from that of her husband. Hence one of the most obvious and prominent marks of proprietorship is, in her case, not only wanting, but such possession is usually attributed to the husband; a presumption of his ownership naturally follows by which his credit is increased: Gamber v. Gamber, <a href="/pa/18/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="18 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="969090" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0363-01">18 Pa. 363</a>. The Act of June 3, 1887, P. L. 332, and the Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 344, enlarged the powers of a married woman with respect to ownership of property. The latter act stated in this regard: “Hereafter a married woman shall have the same right and power as an unmarried person.” An unmarried woman, in possession of property, under a claim of title, has a right prima facie to the presumption of ownership when that ownership is attacked; she need not prove title until evidence has been introduced showing it was not in her. But our cases after this act did not relax the rigor of the prior rules; as a matter of public policy we held that the interest of a married woman in her husband’s welfare and the preservation of the family was so apparent, and the temptation for wrongdoing so great, that these could not be wiped out merely through the words of an act of assembly which enlarged the wife’s right to hold property; and when the title to property claimed by her was attacked, through her husband’s creditors, the rule heretofore announced as to proof of title still prevailed.</p>

On these facts notice of an interest in the latter may be found. The instances under which the question of the wife’s title arose had variously to do with loans by the wife to the husband, with loans for which either notes or mortgages were given by the husband to the wife, with title to land which the wife claimed was bought for her with her own money or with money given to her, and with the <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>title to pergonal property such as horses, carriages, or items of common household property. The only case where the husband’s possession did not appear was that of Heiges v. Pifer, <a href="/pa/224/0628-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="224 Pa. 628" data-case-ids="963050" data-case-paths="/pa/224/0628-01">supra,</a> where it merely appeared that the wife got the money to pay for the land from her brother-in-law. We have not been able to discover any cases where the rule has been applied to the possession of personal property complete in the wife or without being subject to an inference of joint possession, or to a title not traced through the husband.</p>

The mere fact that the price paid by appellant was below the face value of the certificates, or their market value, had there been one, would not be sufficient to charge notice, nor would the added fact that these securities were bought by appellant at the same time as the others, when he knew the latter were bought with partnership money. This factor would not affect the entire sale. Even if appellant had made inquiry at the only available source, the partnership, he would have discovered no equitable claim against the three certificates here involved.</p>

    <p id="b622-4" data-blocks='[["BL_622.4",622,[275,789,1154,1174]]]'>Whether or not this is a negotiable instrument is immaterial. We are here faced with the clear question whether the mere fact of coverture is enough to charge a purchaser from the wife with notice of equities in favor of the husband. To decide this in the affirmative would be to put an intolerable burden on those dealing with married women at the present day. Married women are now accustomed to deal in property of large value; many have investments of their own, in land or securities, which for obvious reasons must often become the subject of transfer, for liquidation or reinvestment. To place any such burden on their vendees would result, from a business standpoint, in a very real practical restriction on the woman’s right to own and deal in property, and so defeat the purpose of the statutes giving her those rights. Purchasers would be slow to buy what might, through no fault of their own, be successfully claimed by the husband’s creditors. In a contest between the wife and the creditors, it is feasible for her to explain the manner in which she acquired the property; hence she suffers no real injury; but the same explanation may be impossible for her vendee.</p>

The vendee’s equities may also be less where he has actual knowledge that the wife acquired title from or through her husband, or with money furnished to her by him. Since, however, these additional factors do not appear <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>in the present case, they need not be further discussed. On the face of the certificates, the wife had a legal title by endorsement, and no evidence was presented which would connect the husband in any way with them. Since coverture alone should not be sufficient to charge a purchaser with knowledge of any possible equities in the husband, we can apply the general rule applicable to sales that one buying goods from an individual having legal title gets a clear title free from equities where he has no notice of any secret trusts in favor of others.</p>

The only defenses Avhich the assignee or a purchaser has to guard against in such cases are, first, those which have arisen since the execution of the note, and which are not collateral, but which relate to the note itself; and, second, those which are inherent in the note, and which would show it to have been void ab initio, such as fraud, mistake, absence of sufficient consideration, etc.; Renwick v.

The equities between prior parties to the instrument must be distinguished from those in a third person, the reason being that the assignee can always go to the debtor and ascertain Avhat claims or equities he may have against the bond, or other chose in action, Avhich he is about to purchase from the obligee; but he may not be able Avith the utmost diligence to ascertain the latent equity of some third person against the obligee.
