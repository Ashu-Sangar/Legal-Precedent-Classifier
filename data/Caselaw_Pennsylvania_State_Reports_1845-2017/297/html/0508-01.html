A special trip of empty cars was provided each morning to transport, over its narrow gauge railroad, the fifty employees from that place to their work. They could return home by a footpath which led from the mouth of the colliery to Glen Lyon. The path was on the right-of-way of the company for the first 1,800 feet, it then turned oil and led through the <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>woods a distance of 800 feet, then returned to the right-of-way and so continued to Glen Lyon.

Permission was not given the employees to ride on the loaded cars en route to Glen Lyon and, as we view it, such permission was not material. On the other hand, appellee issued no orders not to ride on these cars, and it was the custom of the employees to ride home on the loaded trips. The coal mined <em>from </em>this colliery was conveyed to Glen Lyon in the regular small coal cars used in the mine.</p>

The case is largely controlled by Strohl v. Eastern Pa. Rys. Co., <a href="/pa/270/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="270 Pa. 132" data-case-ids="1066092" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0132-01">270 Pa. 132</a>, where compensation was disallowed on a state of facts much stronger in favor of the claimant. Stripped of all circumstances which might confuse the real issue, in that case claimant’s duty was to read a meter at the end of each day. It registered the current consumed by the street railway company in the operation of its line. It is immaterial to the determination of the case that during the day he was engaged in work for another employer. The compensation paid by the street car company for this service was transportation over its car line to and from his home in the morning and evening after the meter was read. He was injured on one of these trips. It was held that his employment as it related to the street railway company began when he en<a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>tered the premises to read the meter and ended when he left that place. Though by invitation and contract he used the company’s facilities to go home, the work on which he was actually engaged ceased when he had completed it, at the place on the company’s premises where it was performed. The return home was likened to a passenger’s riding on the car with the rights appertaining to such persons. We held that the actual payment of compensation is not employment, though it is the consideration for the contract. An employee may receive payment for his services in various ways and at various places, and a trip for that purpose was not employment. Had the employer paid to the employee in money the exact fare and he had purchased a ticket on which the return home was made, and an accident had occurred, the return would not have been in furtherance of the master’s business.</p>
    <p id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.4",572,[274,1267,1150,682]]]'>The clear legal principle to be deduced from the case just discussed is, that returning home from employment is not considered as furthering the master’s business unless there is a special contract covering such incidents.

He was not then engaged in the furtherance of the business or affairs of his employer; the accident did not happen upon his employer’s premises within the meaning of the act (Shickley v.

To sustain the award under these circumstances, it is necessary to find that the employee’s presence upon the loaded coal car was required by the nature of his employment. (Rotola v.

When the employee placed himself upon the loaded coal car, he became a mere licensee or trespasser and the relation of master and servant ceased to exist, although still upon the employer’s property, and the fact that he was accustomed to thus do, could not alter the situation.” We concur in the finding.</p>
