It is claimed that the defendant collected the funds as trustee for the plaintiff, assignee of the sums remitted. The court below held relief could not be granted under the facts presented, dismissed the complaint, and, from the final de<a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>cree entered, this appeal was taken. In reaching this conclusion, the evidence was reviewed by the trial judge, who filed a carefully considered opinion, based on findings, many of which are not excepted to. Where the contrary is true, ample competent testimony to support its determination is found in the record. All of the exceptions presented by plaintiff were overruled by the court in banc. A brief review of the evidence is necessary to an understanding of the questions involved.</p>
    <p id="b178-4" data-blocks='[["BL_178.4",178,[274,840,1171,1343]]]'>The president of the Bangor Trust Company, defendant, at the time Avhen the events uoav the subject of controversy took place, was Buzzard, and its secretary and. treasurer Floyd Hess. The-two named Avere also officers of, and deeply interested in, the construction corporation, which had entered into a contract with the State of New York for the building of a highway. Taking advantage of their position, they diverted funds of the trust company in excess of $100,000 to the uses of the private concern. As a result of interference by the banking department, those interested in the institution were compelled to raise a large sum to cover the improper advances made. To protect it in part, the road building concern, on September 24, 1924, assigned to the trust company all monies due from New York by reason of its contract, of which transfer the contraetee was advised, and the direction so to pay accepted. Thereafter, until the completion of the highway, all sums due to the Masterson Company were turned over to the then named assignee. Early in 1925, Buzzard and Hess, to secure more cash so that the construction company, personally controlled by them, could proceed Avith its building, “fraudulently used and misapplied [additional] funds” of the defendant for this purpose, as found by the court, amounting to about $42,000.</p>

After investigation, the latter agreed to advance this amount on separate individual notes of Buzzard and Hess for $12,500 each, drawn to the order of the father of the latter, Philip W. Hess, and endorsed by him, provided he deposited certain securities as collateral. The latter was interested in the success of the construction company, and was of the belief that if the road work under contract could be completed, not only would the monies already expended be salvaged, but that a profit would result. Checks to the father’s order were drawn by the discounting bank, which he endorsed, and they were deposited to the credit of the Masterson Corporation, reducing to that extent the amounts already improperly withdrawn by the makers of the notes from the trust company. Philip Hess, the father, also arranged to pay the balance of $17,000 due the latter, by assuming personal liability therefor.</p>

When the father undertook to make the advances necessary to complete the road, and thus prevent loss of the sum invested, and protect any possible equities, the trust company agreed to assign to him the monies thereafter coming due under the construction contract, and, on April 22d, passed a resolution providing that the sums payable should be applied, “first, to indebtedness of the Master-son Construction Corporation due to Philip W. Hess, or to be hereafter incurred, either through monies advanced on liabilities of said corporation by said Philip W. Hess for the purpose of completing the said contract, and, second, to the indebtedness of said corporation to the said Bangor Trust Company.” This resolution, averred by defendant never to have been adopted in the form finally appearing, — an issue of fact not important in the view we take of the case, — was not put in writing at the time, but was later placed upon the minute book, and <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>certified to by the son Floyd, as having been approved at a meeting of the directors held on April 29th.</p>

This was found as a fact by the court, and was a necessary arrangement, for, if the additional work was not executed and the necessary bills therefor satisfied, no further sums would be receivable under the contract. It may be here noted that there was paid to the time of final settlement the total sum of $50,258.32, and this entire amount had been expended in completing the work, there being no balance remaining for any one.</p>

Here, the trust company did nothing which gave its officers the right to use the resolution, as they did, for their personal purposes, and the defendant was entirely innocent in the transaction. The negligence was on the part of the plaintiff in not making proper inquiry when Philip Hess assigned his supposed right to it, for such would have disclosed beyond question the true situation as to the road contract, and the necessary application of the funds to be received in payment.</p>

Assuming knowledge so conveyed to be sufficient, we would still be met with a prior equitable assignment or reassignment by Philip Hess of all his rights under the resolution of April, 1925, by which he <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>stipulated that the trust company should first deduct the sums necessary to complete the road, which agreement was known not only to the same officers named, but also to the entire board of directors, and could not be varied without the consent of the latter. The attempted transfer to the plaintiff was subsequent to this reassignment and subject to it, even though it were held the former was otherwise legally adequate. Under the circumstances, plaintiff’s rights could in no event be greater than those possessed by its assignor, and the latter had directed how the fund should be disposed of, before any payment should be made to him, or one claiming through his assignment.</p>

Without referring to them specifically, all of the assignments of error are overruled.</p>
