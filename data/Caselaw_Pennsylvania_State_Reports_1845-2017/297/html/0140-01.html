A public highway on which the land, now divided into lots, fronts, extended from Market Street by bridge across the Susquehanna River to Wilkes-Barre. The county commissioners, believing the bridge insufficient to accommodate existing travel, petitioned the court of quarter sessions to reconstruct it. The grand jury on January 31, 1919, approved the project and the court below gave a qualified approval without committing it “to any suggested plan or detail of construction, all of which will be determined without haste and after full deliberation.” In 1926 a contract was let and approved by the court for erecting the bridge and approaches. The latter extend from the <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>river bank on Market Street into Kingston 450 feet and adjoin appellant’s land 370 feet.</p>

The average elevation in front of appellant’s land is about six feet. Market Street, originally fifty feet wide, is now 93 feet and the approach covers the entire width along appellant’s land.</p>
    <p id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[149,876,1156,914]]]'>The decorative or ornamental projection outside of the regular lines of the approach extends in a circle into appellant’s land an extreme width of forty-nine and one-half feet from the general line, gradually reducing to nothing at the general line, and is one hundred and forty feet long. The extreme width of the approach at the farthest point of the circle, including the width on the other side, is about two hundred feet. A railing or balustrade is erected along the property lines as a protection to pedestrians; it also prevents ingress and egress to and from the land facing it, now below the grade of the approach, and deprives Kingston Borough of a connection with a street along the river, also below grade. The commissioners proceeded with the work until July, 1928, when this proceeding was instituted to enjoin further construction, particularly of certain parts of the bridge.</p>

We can only decide the case from this record and statements made in the argument as they supplement the record. Ample power to condemn or appropriate land for the construction of bridges and approaches is lodged in the county under the Act of April 29, 1891, P. L. 31, as amended, aided by the Act of February 14, 1907, P. L. 3, and the Act of the same year, P. L. 523; see Carrere v.

The approach is part of the bridge. The Act of 1891 states that the county is authorized, after resolution, to construct a public bridge between any city, borough or township, and to that end may take and appropriate property; it requires plans to be prepared and submitted to the court of quarter sessions for approval. We conclude from the foregoing acts of assembly, together with our decisions above noted, that ample power is given to appropriate appellant’s lands for the bridge and the approaches.</p>
    <p id="b207-3" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[162,1636,1154,805]],["BL_208.1",208,[286,381,1153,849]]]'>The words “take and appropriate,” or others of similar import, in eminent domain statutes, contemplate an orderly and regular proceeding by the authorities in whom the power is lodged. It has in view a precedent resolution, ordinance or other affirmative act, defining the scope and extent of the proposed taking, with the purpose for which it is to be exercised. Members of council or the mayor, or the county commissioners individually or collectively, cannot in an informal manner take the action necessary to complete a lawful appropriation. Formality of procedure is here essential just as in the case of condemnation by quasi-public corporations: Foley v. Beech Creek Extension R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/283/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="283 Pa. 588" data-case-ids="1090504" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0588-01">283 Pa. 588</a>, 594.

Here, where a bridge is to be reconstructed and additional land is necessary for approaches, there must be some act descriptive of the proceeding; the land taken, with the purpose for so doing, should be recorded on the minutes of the county commissioners and filed with the proceedings of the court. The work is more than an engineering detail as in the taking of land for a railroad by quasi-public corporations, where the center line determines the width; here the county in appropriating additional land beyond street limits for a bridge must give ample information as to what it takes. It is not necessary that a bond should be filed, but an effort to reach an agreement ought to be made with the owners, and, if that is ineffectual, either party may ask for the appointment of viewers.</p>

It has, however, permitted the bridge to be so far constructed that it would be inequitable and unjust to grant the relief prayed for; we do not, on the other hand, wish to be understood, in the order to be made, as countenancing such procedure generally in the construction of public works. A modification of the decree will be suggested which will preserve all rights and place a modicum of legality on the project.</p>

This is not an effort to build a highway, but to construct an approach with an enlargement that may become a matter of vital importance in the use and operation of the bridge. We find no- limitation in the acts referred to as to the width of bridges or their <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>approaches; though the latter may be part of the highway, the taking for it is under authority to construct a bridge.

Counties may, within reason, appropriate such lands as may be deemed reasonably necessary for art and decoration.

In the cases cited, while the action of the court below was sustained in refusing leave to intervene, we decided the cause of intervention, in each case, on its merits. Here the petitioner is a municipal corporation within whose limits a part of the bridge is being constructed.

The borough has a decided interest in the adjudication of this question and asserts a public right in protecting its highways from unlawful encroachment. Equity has assumed jurisdiction over the subject-matter, and the rights of all persons in connection with this improvement should have been determined in one proceeding. No reason is given for refusing this very meritorious request and the court below was in error in so doing; this, however, will not affect the ultimate determniation of the matter before us.</p>

When charged with a duty, it cannot be impeded in its acts by lesser units of government because of a conflict of powers. The superior right must rest in somebody, — here it is the county. When it projects the bridge into Kingston and its work interferes with the highways there, the Borough of Kingston must accommodate itself to that interference. Of course the county may not construct public works in such a manner as permanently to shut off access from transverse highways in the borough; these highways, brought up to a proper grade so as to make them safe for public travel, may be joined to the approach regardless of the balustrade or railing, which must be removed.

Inter-County St. Ry., <a href="/pa/167/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="167 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="866886" data-case-paths="/pa/167/0120-01">167 Pa. 120</a>; Green v.

Super. 234" data-case-ids="285456" data-case-paths="/pa-super/7/0234-01">7 Pa. Superior Ct. 234</a>); this is so even though the nuisance is caused by a municipality. The above general rule must be taken always in connection with the physical contour of the ground or the proposed construction of a street as it relates to other streets and adjoining properties. In the present case we have an approach which has a perpendicular wall extending a distance of 450 feet, beginning at 20 feet and ending at nothing. It was highly proper for the county to erect a balustrade, along what may be called the property line and intersecting streets below grade, as a means of protection to pedestrians using the sidewalk; but when the transverse streets are raised to the grade of the approach so as not to be dangerous to traffic, and the surrounding property is likewise raised sufficiently to do away with any danger, then the county cannot maintain the balustrade to prevent access to the properties from the street. Of course vehicular traffic could use the sidewalk only at the intersection, bxxt pedestrian traffic is not to be denied the right of ingress and egress to and from adjoining lots when they are brought to grade or near grade so as not to be dangerous to the traveling public. Therefore, the position of the borough, as an intervenor, to connect its transverse streets with Market Street, and the position of the appellant with respect to permitting access to its property when brought to or near grade, must be sustained; but the balustrade is not to be taken down until the appellants have their various properties in the condition as herein indicated. At the intersection of the, <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>highways, the proper construction of the Parkway and traffic regulations will obviate danger to traffic.</p>
    <p id="b212-4" data-blocks='[["BL_212.4",212,[269,428,1154,962]]]'>It has been stated that the county in taking the land proceeded under the supposed authority of the City of Wilkes-Barre. This is a rather novel suggestion, for there is not a line of evidence to show that the City of Wilkes-Barre ever condemned anything. Certainly the resolution authorizing its engineer to appropriate appellant’s land is not sufficient. From this record, it appears that the City of Wilkes-Barre had no rights therein. Appellants had never parted with title nor had they been paid damages. It would be an entirely new principle that one corporation could justify its right to take land because another corporation had started condemnation proceedings that had never been finished and by so doing deny to the owner the compensation safeguarded by the Constitution. Appellants in this respect are in a position as though the City of Wilkes-Barre had not acted and are entitled to the full compensation allowed by law.</p>
    <p id="b212-5" data-blocks='[["BL_212.5",212,[263,1403,1157,1017]]]'>We affirm the court below in denying an injunction. Defendant has not been guilty of laches with respect to the land necessary for decorative features. It was the subject of discussion until a short time before the bill was filed and this was the principal complaint. We modify the decree so as to sustain appellee’s contention as to these features unless the county commissioners will adopt and file resolutions of appropriation for the land occupied, setting out with sufficient certainty their purpose, with a description of the land taken therefor. This, counsel for the county have agreed to do. The bill will be reinstated for the purpose of carrying out the decree of the court below as modified. Appellant may have viewers appointed under the Act of April 29, 1891, P. L. 31, to ascertain its damages as related to the condition of its land before and after the taking, indicated by the construction on the ground. As thus modified, it is affirmed, costs of this proceeding and that in the court below to be paid by the County of Luzerne,</p>
