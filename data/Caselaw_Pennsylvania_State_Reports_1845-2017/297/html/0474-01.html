Two companies offered to supply policies on both classes, and the Arkwright Company of Massachusetts, intervening defendant, limited its proposal to the six properties, valued at $3,100,000, in the second classification. The tenders of all, except the last mentioned, were faulty in form. The latter was a mutual company, and offered to insure in consideration of a premium deposit based on the rate of ninety cents per $100, in all $27,900, with an anticipated return of 85%, making the probable actual cost for three years $4,185. Under the terms of its proposed contract there was a further contingent liability by plaintiff limited to five times the initial payment. <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>Taxpayers filed a bill against the school district to restrain the acceptance of the bids of any of the companies named, but, by answer filed, it appeared all had been rejected except the one of the Arkwright Company for the properties in group 2, which was not formally approved, but it is agreed will be if legally permissible. This tender was held by the court invalid as not offering a kind of insurance of which advantage could be legally taken by a school district, and a permanent injunction was issued restraining the acceptance of its offer. Thereafter, on petition, the decree entered was revoked, and the Arkwright Company permitted to intervene as a party defendant and file an answer. Testimony was taken, findings of fact and conclusions of law made, and a final decree then entered by the court in banc, to the same effect as that originally filed by the chancellor. The School District of Erie and Arkwright Mutual Eire Insurance Company have filed separate appeals.</p>

Though the wisdom of so doing may be questioned, where the values represented are as large as here involved, yet with this exercise of municipal discretion we are not here concerned (Admiral Realty Co. v. New York, <a href="/ny/206/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="206 N.Y. 110" data-case-ids="60607" data-case-paths="/ny/206/0110-01">206 N.

In that year the School Code (May 18, 1911, P. L. 309, section 634) éxpressly authorized directors to enter into such contracts as deemed proper “with any person, firm or corporation for the purpose of insuring against loss or damage by fire, or otherwise.” This was followed by the Act of April 27, 1925, (P. L. 305), which permits policies to be taken out <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>“with any mutual fire insurance company duly authorized by law to transact business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” The Arkwright Company, a Massachusetts corporation, with power to write insurance in this State, was originally chartered to furnish protection against damage from fire to manufactories and their contents, though, by amendment, its powers were later extended to permit the coverage of other losses. It was not a stock company conducting business for profit, but a mutual concern, in which initial premium deposits were made by those becoming members. Sums collected, if not used to meet losses, were returned to the holders. If the liabilities accruing were in excess of the first deposits received, additional payments were required, but in no case could the insured be called upon for a sum greater than five times the original sum advanced.</p>
    <p id="b538-4" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[291,1269,1152,896]]]'>In effect, the consideration given by the insured is the cash deposit, — a portion of which, experience indicated, will be returned, except in case of overwhelming and unusual losses, — and the promise to pay an additional amount in case of necessity, not exceeding a fixed limit. The money advanced and the covenant to pay more, if occasion required, constitutes the real premium. That this is the proper construction is shown by our Insurance Code (May 17, 1921, P. L. 682) which provides in section 806 (page 768): “The ‘maximum premium’ payable by any member of a mutual company, other than a mutual life company, shall be expressed in the policy, or in the application for the insurance if attached to the policy. Such maximum premium shall be a cash premium and an additional contingent premium not less than the cash premium, or may be solely a cash premium.”</p>

The responsibility for an additional limited assessment is part of the consideration, and it so appears in the contract. There is no loaning of credit by the school district to the insurance company, but rather by the latter to the former, since it does not require the immediate payment of the amount of contingent liability, but refrains from asking presently more than one-fifth thereof, having under no circumstances the right to demand more than the maximum. “ ‘Assessments’ and ‘premiums’ are interchangeable words and mean the same thing.

In the present case, the school district became a member of a mutual company, but, by its contract, it did not become generally an insurer (Given v.

Dillon (Municipal Corporations, 5th ed., section 976) thus states the proposition generally: “As an incident to the power to erect and maintain a city hall, schoolhouses, and other public buildings, the municipality has the right to contract for indemnity for loss by fire by insuring these buildings; and, having the power to insure, it may insure them in a corporation organized on the mutual plan under the laws of the state in which’ the city is located. Giving premium notes for losses incurred by such company on other insurance is neither a loan of the credit of the city, <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>nor the owning of stock or bonds of the company, in violation of constitutional provisions.”</p>

City of Millville, <a href="/njl/66/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="66 N.J.L. 392" data-case-ids="316217" data-case-paths="/njl/66/0392-01">66 N. J.

It was there said, in part: “The scheme of mutual insurance in such associations does not fasten upon the members any liability which municipal corporations may not, with reasonable safety, assume, for the limit of obligation is always fixed at the time the insurance is obtained, and is rarely enforced beyond what would be charged for insurance on the nonmutual plan. By giving its premium notes, the city did not loan its credit to the company. Its promises were made for a consideration, of value beneficial to itself, and, like other assets of the company, they were purchased, not borrowed; nor did the so-called ‘membership’ of the insured render the city in any sense the owner of the stock or bonds which belonged to the company, or a holder of stock in the company, within the fair import of the constitutional prohibition. [The] right to share in a limited part of the profits of business is essentially different from [the ownership of] corporate stock, which represents a proportionate part of all the property of the corporation.” What was said in this leading case has met with approval in Johnson v. School Dist. (Oregon), <a href="/or/128/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="270 P. 764" data-case-ids="2000427" data-case-paths="/or/128/0009-01">270 Pac. 764</a>, affd. <a href="/or/128/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="270 P. 764" data-case-ids="2000427" data-case-paths="/or/128/0009-01">273 Pac. 386</a>, though, in the later decision, the premium was payable in cash without liability to further assessment. The right to insure in mutual companies was sustained in Kentucky (Dalzell v. Bourbon County Board, <a href="/ky/193/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="193 Ky. 171" data-case-ids="2370458" data-case-paths="/ky/193/0171-01">193 Ky. 171</a>, 235, S. W. 360), and in terms provided for by constitutional amendment in Ohio. Deferentially, this is the conclusion reached in California: People v. Stanley, <a href="/citations/?q=225%20P.%201" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="225 P. 1">225 Pac. 1</a>. A contrary view has been expressed in Texas: Tyler v. Texas Employer’s Ins.

      <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>Our constitutional provision was designed to prevent municipal corporations from joining as stockholders in hazardous business ventures, loaning its credit for such purposes, or granting gratuities to persons or associations where not in pursuit of some governmental purpose. Taking of insurance in a mutual company with limited liability is not within the inhibition, for the district does not become strictly a stockholder, nor is it loaning its credit. It agrees to pay a fixed sum, and can be called upon for the total only in case of some unusual catastrophe causing great loss. Until this contingency arises it is required to advance but a small portion of the maximum, and is, in effect, loaned credit as to a possible future demand by the company for the balance which may become payable. By the terms of the policy the district did not assume responsibility for losses of others insured, except as to a named and limited amount. The Act of 1925 is presumably valid, and does not so plainly violate section 7 of article IX of the Constitution as to justify us in holding the statute to be beyond the scope of legislative power.</p>

It was insisted that the defendant was without corporate power to issue policies as proposed. As to this the chancellor said: “It may be questioned also whether under its charter this insurance company has authority to insure school buildings. But whether or not such contracts are ultra vires need not be decided here.” There is no definite conclusion of the trial court as to this feature of the complaint. Though the decrees entered must be reversed, yet, since we are of opinion that the view expressed by the court below that the Act of 1925 is unconstitutional legislation, and the decrees are based on this conclusion, the proceeding will be returned for consideration of the question not as yet determined.</p>
