Claiming that the Act of April 10, 1929, P.

Each was duly served and entered an appearance. The court below refused to quash the writs of scire facias or to dismiss the proceedings as to either defendant, whereupon each prosecuted one of the present appeals.</p>

Hence, the question for us to decide is whether or not the statute is constitutional and applicable. In construing it, two things are plainly apparent: (1) The act is a remedial one. Its purpose is to avoid a multiplicity of suits; to compel every interested person to appear and defend the action by plaintiff; and to save the original defendant from possible harm resulting from loss of evidence, as might result if compelled to await the end of the suit before proceeding against those who were primarily liable in whole or in part. Hence, the statute is to be liberally construed to advance the legislative purpose: Fulton Farmers Assn. v. Bomberger, <a href="/pa/262/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="262 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="1044355" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0043-01">262 Pa. 43</a>, 47; Duggan v. Duggan, <a href="/pa/291/0556-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="291 Pa. 556" data-case-ids="1107292" data-case-paths="/pa/291/0556-01">291 Pa. 556</a>. (2) Nothing in the act shows the slightest intention to affect plaintiffs in such suits. Consequently, the adding of additional defendants will give no higher right to plaintiffs than they had before. As to them the action proceeds against the original defendant only, exactly as it would have done if the additional defendants had not been named, except that the court below, in the exercise of a sound discretion, should give to the original defendant, who acts promptly, a reasonable extra time to bring the additional defendants upon the record, before being required to file an affidavit of defense or plea. It follows, that no question can arise as to an implied repeal of the statute of limitations as between the additional defendants and plaintiff.</p>

The statute says it applies to “any action,” and this of course includes ac<a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>tions of trespass. That it also says the “suit shall continue, both before and after judgment, according to equitable principles,” is no more than to say that it is to proceed according to the long settled principles of Pennsylvania Jurisprudence (Laussatt on “Equity in Pennsylvania,” 1st Annual Report of Penna. Bar Association, page 221; Lawrence Lewis, Jr., on “The Courts of Pennsylvania in the 17th Century, Ibid., page 353; “Pennsylvania Jurisprudence,” by Hon. John W. Simonton, Ibid., page 3; Wain v. Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Phila.%20362" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="1 Phila. 362">1 Phila. 362</a>, per Hare, J.), the legislature evidently deeming it wise to so state, because plaintiff had no legal right to join “all such parties as defendants.” Nor is the statute prospective only. It is procedural in its nature; hence “it is applied, as of course, to litigation existing at the time of its passage”: Kille v. Reading Iron Works, <a href="/pa/134/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="134 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="814920" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0225-01">134 Pa. 225</a>, 227; Kuca v.

Nor is there anything in the alleged constitutional objections, since even a casual glan.ce will show that the statute contains but “one subject, which [is] clearly expressed in its title,” and that it is not a “local or special law......regulating the practice......in any judicial proceeding,” but,, on the contrary, is a general one regulating every such proceeding where the liability referred to in it may appear. It might just as well be said that a procedural act is special which applies to every action of assumpsit, because it does not apply also to actions of trespass. What has been said disposes of the appeals and requires an affirmance of the judgments; but it may not be inappropriate to outline the procedure under the statute, where, as here, no rule of court governs it.</p>

I think section 3 of the Act of 1836 relied upon in the majority opinion is inapplicable to the present case and confers no such au<a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>thority upon this court, especially in view of section 21 of that act which gives to courts of common pleas “full power and authority to establish such rules for regulating the practice thereof respectively, and for expediting the determination of suits, causes and proceedings therein, as in their discretion they shall judge necessary and proper.” Subsequent legislation preserves to courts of common pleas power to prescribe rules for practice and procedure, as indicated in the following late acts of assembly. The Act of May 14, 1915, P. L. 4S3, is entitled “an act relating to practice in the courts of common pleas in actions of assumpsit and trespass, except actions for libel and slander; prescribing the pleadings and procedure to be observed therein, and giving courts power to enforce its provisions.” That act, by its terms a “Practice Act,” is certainly sufficiently definite to cover this case and also in express terms repeals inconsistent legislation; further, the Act of May 24, 1878, P.

If the third section of the Act of 1836 ever did apply to questions similar to those now before us, which in my opinion is extremely doubtful, it has been superseded by more recent legislation.</p>
