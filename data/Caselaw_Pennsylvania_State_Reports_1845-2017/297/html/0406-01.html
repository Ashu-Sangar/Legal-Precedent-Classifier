On appeal, this decree was reversed because the tribunal named was without jurisdiction to enter such an order, having no general equity powers, and the record was returned without prejudice: Cutter’s Est., <a href="/pa/286/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="286 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="1096503" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0505-01">286 Pa. 505</a>. Thereupon a bill in equity was filed by the County of Erie and the Law Library Association on behalf of themselves and others having an interest, setting forth the facts already detailed, and asking that the mortgage be reinstated and Lamberton directed to pay back the sum received by him on October 5, 1921. The latter prayer was amended so as to request either that <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>the money with interest from the date of payment be returned to the custody of the court, or, in the alternative, that he be ordered to assign, without recourse, the security to the plaintiffs, or a trustee to be appointed, so that the sum represented thereby could be collected and distributed amongst those entitled thereto.</p>

Cutter, now Pastorius, the wife of the defaulter, and the surviving tenant by entireties,- who was joined as a defendant. It was first contended that the equity proceeding was fatally defective in not naming the estate of Cutter as a party, but this was not requisite as it had no interest in the realty, the property having passed to the survivor upon his death. The wife, who acquired the title freed from the mortgage, paid with misappropriated funds, was the real defendant. No relief was sought against Lamberton individually, except as noted, and the plaintiffs merely asked to be placed in the same position as before the fraud was committed. No rights have intervened, and he will not be harmed if the order now asked by plaintiffs is entered.</p>

The bill asked no relief against either. The only possible way in which any personal liability could be imposed upon them would be by a deficiency judgment after foreclosure of the reinstated lien, for Yaple is dead, and there could be no confession of judgment on his bond containing a warrant of attorney, and a recovery by scire facias on the mortgage would not involve a personal obligation of those who executed it: Wilson v.

Naming <em>the </em>husband and wife as tenants by entireties makes no difference in equity so far as the surviving tenant is concerned.

Many authorities have been cited by appellants to establish this principle, but an examination will show they deal with the relations between the depositor and the receiving bank. “Not infrequently public officers are called bailees, and again are said to hold public funds as trustees and clothed with their legal duties and obligations. Yet by the weight of authority a public officer is not, like a trustee or an agent, the mere bailee or custodian of the money in his hands. He is called on to account to a much more rigorous standard of responsibility”: 22 R. C. L. 468. Though in some jurisdictions it has been held the officer becomes merely a debtor when the fund is deposited in his official account, yet in Pennsylvania such moneys may be followed by those entitled thereto, and reclaimed against one into whose possession they have come, where he had actual or implied notice of their character. This was <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>early held where purchase money so paid was devoted to the use of another: Reed’s App., <a href="/pa/34/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="34 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="418028" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0207-01">34 Pa. 207</a>.

Although his sureties might be answerable for his want of fidelity, this does not prevent equity from following trust property as long as it can be identified, and reclaiming it for the benefit of those entitled. Both the creditors and sureties, in a case like the present, have such rights as entitle them to interpose.”</p>

It has been found by the chancellor that the entries in the account of the clerk of courts were there held by Cutter in his official capacity and for a definite purpose.

An equitable result can best be reached, as plaintiffs suggested on argument, by striking off the satisfaction of the mortgage, which shall be thus reinstated as of the same force and effect as immediately previous to October 5, 1921, the day of the payment, and directing that Lamberton be ordered and directed to assign, set over and transfer it, without recourse, to a trustee to be appointed by the court, the fund derived to be subject to distribution amongst those found to be entitled thereto by the orphans’ court.</p>
