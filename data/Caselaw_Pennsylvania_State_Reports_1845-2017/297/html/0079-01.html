They were riding in defendant’s automobile at his invitation. He was driving the car. About 11:30 o’clock, in rounding a sharp curve, the automobile left the road and crashed into a frame shed eight or ten feet distant from the improved part of the highway, with the result that most of those in the car were more or less injured, plaintiff’s husband by a cut in his forehead three or four inches long, which became infected the next day with streptococci, from which death resulted thirty-six hours after the collision.</p>

The photograph of the automobile attached to the record, exhibiting as it does a demolished condition, would indicate great force applied. It is undisputed that the shed, which was 20x30 feet and weighed seven tons, was knocked by the impact of the car eighteen inches off its foundation. It is difficult to understand how what happened to the car and the building could have been brought about by a speed as low as appellant mentions. The car was a closed sedan and those in it with the exception of appellant, who was at the wheel, were thrown out of it by the force of the blow. “With reference to the speed at which the truck was traveling the jury might properly conclude, from......the force and effect of the collision, that it was moving faster than <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>the defendant’s driver indicated by his testimony”: McFeeters v.

Defendant admitted full knowledge of the curve, having driven over the road many times, and himself testified that on the way out to Pittsburgh one of the party had spoken of it as the “meanest” curve on the road.</p>

We do not see how it could be said that they were contributorily negligent in view of the warning which they gave defendant as they approached the curve. The fact that he may have driven at an excessive speed elsewhere on the journey might have a bearing on the question of their contributory negligence if they had not given warning as they approached the dangerous curve; having done so, however, his rate of speed prior to that is of no consequence. “An invited guest, and especially one who occupies a rear seat in the car where no opportunity to control exists, is in a different position. He ordinarily is not concerned with the operating of the car and cannot be viewed as joining with the driver in its operation merely from the fact that he happens to be an occupant of the machine”: Davis v. American Ice Co., <a href="/pa/285/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="285 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1095156" data-case-paths="/pa/285/0177-01">285 Pa. 177</a>, 184. “Silence with regard to the driving is generally golden” when sitting on the back seat: Schlossstein v. Bernstein, <a href="/pa/293/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="293 Pa. 245" data-case-ids="1111126" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0245-01">293 Pa. 245</a>, 250.</p>

We see no impropriety in permitting her to make this explanation of the testimony of others as to what she and her husband had said.</p>

Doctor Teah, who was in charge of the hospital and who would seem to have been an unwilling witness for plaintiff, said that death was due to an acute infection as to which the forehead wound was probably a contributing cause. Speaking of the wound, he also said that it was “The <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>only knowledge that I had at the time from which, the infection could come.” Dr. Hardt, who was called in consultation and examined the injured man, testified that from the examination he made and from the history of the case he was of the opinion “that he died from an infection from the wound on his forehead.” This testimony was sufficient to warrant the jury in concluding that death was due to the infection of the wound in the forehead, which admittedly was received in the collision. Dr. Hardt’s testimony was not objected to nor was any motion made to strike it out. His ability to express an opinion on the question was not challenged in any way.</p>
