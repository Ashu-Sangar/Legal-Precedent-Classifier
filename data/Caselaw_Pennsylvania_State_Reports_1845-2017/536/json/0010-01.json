        "text": "OPINION\nMONTEMURO, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from a decision of the Commonwealth Court affirming the Board of Finance and Revenue. The Board denied the Appellants, Tool Sales & Service Co., Inc. and Tom Mistick and Sons, Inc., a claimed deduction from their average net income in determining the value of their capital stock for the purposes of the Pennsylvania Capital Stock Tax.\nThe issues presented for our review are (1) whether the term \u201cincome per books\u201d as set forth in 72 Pa.S.A. \u00a7 7601(a) must be interpreted to include a deduction for federal income taxes not actually paid by an \u201cS\u201d corporation when calculating the corporation\u2019s average net income for the purposes of the Pennsylvania Capital Stock Tax; and (2) whether a Department of Revenue (DOR) regulation that allows \u201cC\u201d corporations to deduct federal taxes when calculating income per books while prohibiting \u201cS\u201d corporations from doing so violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and the guarantee of uniformity of taxes found in the Pennsylvania Constitution.\nIn accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, the parties prepared and submitted a stipulation of facts (\u201cStipulation\u201d). Based on this stipulation we find the pertinent facts as follows:\n(1) Appellants Tool Sales & Service Company, Inc., and Tom Mistick & Sons, Inc. (\u201cTaxpayers\u201d) are corporations incorporated in Pennsylvania and conduct all of their business in Pennsylvania.\n(2) The Taxpayers elected to be treated as \u201cS\u201d corporations under both federal and Pennsylvania tax law for the 1984 tax year.\n(3) In preparing their tax returns for the 1984 tax year, the Taxpayers deducted from their Pennsylvania Capital Stock Tax report an amount equal to the federal taxes they would have paid if they were corporations subject to federal income tax. As \u201cS\u201d corporations, the Taxpayers were not, in fact, subject to any federal income taxes.\n(4) Prior to 1984, DOR allowed \u201cS\u201d corporations to deduct from their income per books an amount equal to the federal taxes they would have paid had they been corporations subject to the federal income tax. However, in 1984, DOR issued new regulations prohibiting \u201cS\u201d corporations from making this deduction although DOR allowed \u201cC\u201d corporations to continue making the deduction. This change in regulations by DOR was concurrent with a statutory change in the manner in which corporations were to determine the value of their capital stock for the purposes of the Pennsylvania Capital Stock Tax.\n(5) Using this new regulation, DOR disallowed the Taxpayer\u2019s claimed deduction, and recalculated their taxes resulting in an increase in their capital stock taxes for the 1984 tax year.\n(6) The Taxpayers appealed the DOR\u2019s settlement to the Board of Appeals which sustained the settlement. On appeal to the Board of Finance and Revenue, the decision of the Board of Appeals was affirmed. The Commonwealth Court upheld the decision of the Board of Finance and Revenue. See Tool Sales and Service Co., Inc. v. Commonwealth, 149 Pa.Commw. 389, 613 A.2d 143 (1992).\nThis court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 723(b) and P.R.A.P. 1101(a)(2) which grant an appeal to this court as a matter of right. Pursuant to P.R.A.P. 1571, which governs review of determinations of the Board of Finance and Revenue, the Appellants filed timely exceptions to the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision thus preserving the issues for our review. See P.R.A.P. 1571(i).\nOur standard of review in this matter is governed by P.R.A.P. 1571(f). Appeals taken from the Board of Finance and Revenue are de novo in nature, with no record being certified by the board. Ernest Renda Contracting Co., Inc. v. Commonwealth, 516 Pa. 325, 532 A.2d 416 (1987).\nI. Taxpayers\u2019 Statutory Argument\nA. The Pennsylvania Capital Stock Tax\nUnder Pennsylvania tax law, domestic corporations pay a tax on the value of their capital stock. See generally, 72 Pa.S.A. \u00a7 7602 (1990). This is a property tax on the assets of the corporation, not an income tax on the corporation. See Commonwealth v. Philadelphia Market Street Subway-Elevated Railway Co., 408 Pa. 357, 184 A.2d 483 (1962). The value of a corporation\u2019s capital stock is determined according to a method set by statute. Prior to 1984, the Pennsylvania Capital Stock Tax was levied on the appraised value of the corporation\u2019s capital stock, which was calculated by taking into consideration the following: (i) the average selling price of the stock; (ii) the corporation\u2019s earnings; (iii) the dividends declared; and (iv) the stockholder equity. See 61 Pa.Code 155.22. The calculation of a corporation\u2019s capital stock value was done on a case by case basis considering each of the four elements. See, e.g., Market Street Subway, 408 Pa. at 357,184 A.2d at 485.\nThe present controversy concerns only the corporation earnings element of the pre-1983 method. DOR regulations defined corporate earnings to be \u201cbook income as reported to the shareholders ...\u201d 61 Pa.Code 155.22. Book income was defined by regulation to be \u201cIncome as reported in line 1 of schedule M-l of the Federal 1120 form.\u201d Id. This line on the 1120 form is titled \u201cnet income per books\u201d. (Stipulation at para.14.) Under this statutory tax scheme, DOR\u2019s practice was to allow both \u201cS\u201d and \u201cC\u201d corporations to deduct federal income taxes from \u201cnet income per books\u201d whether or not they were actually liable for the taxes.\nFor fiscal years beginning in 1984, the General Assembly adopted a fixed formula to determine the value of a corporation\u2019s capital stock. Under this new formula, capital stock value is determined by a corporation\u2019s average net income and its net worth. See 72 Pa.S.A. \u00a7 7601(a) (1990). The statute defines average net income as follows:\nThe net income or loss of the entity shall be the amount set forth as income per books on the income tax return filed by the entity with the federal government for such taxable year, or if no such return is made as would have been set forth had such a return been made.\nId.\nConcurrent with this new statutory scheme of calculating capital stock value, DOR adopted a new policy of no longer allowing \u201cS\u201d corporations to deduct hypothetical federal income taxes from income per books. This policy was later formalized as a DOR regulation. See 61 Pa.Code 155.26(g).\nTaxpayers argue that the term \u201cincome per books\u201d as found in 72 Pa.S.A. \u00a7 7601 should be interpreted as allowing the taxpayers to deduct from their income per books an amount equal to the federal taxes they hypothetically would have had to pay. DOR argues that this interpretation is contrary to their regulation prohibiting such a deduction. We must now turn to the statutory construction of the term \u201cincome per books\u201d to resolve this appeal.\n\u25a0 B. Statutory Construction\nThe Commonwealth Court resolved this issue of statutory interpretation by applying the federal definition of \u201cincome per books\u201d to the Pennsylvania statute. See Tool Sales, 149 Pa.Commw. at 394, 613 A.2d at 146. The Commonwealth Court did so sua sponte.\nWhile this court has not addressed the incorporation of federal tax principles into Pennsylvania tax law, other courts in this Commonwealth which have considered the matter have concluded that federal principles do not apply to our tax law. See, e.g., Tygart Resources v. Commonwealth, 134 Pa.Commw. 168, 578 A.2d 86 (1990). Under the facts of the present case, we find it unnecessary to resort to federal tax law to decide the issue at hand. Therefore, we leave the question of the applicability of federal tax principles to Pennsylvania tax law undecided. Instead, we turn to the well established principles of statutory construction adopted by this Commonwealth.\nStatutes in this Commonwealth are interpreted according to the Statutory Construction Act found at 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1901-1991 (Supp.1993). Section 1903 of this act provides that \u201cwords and phrases shall be construed according to ... their common and approved usage.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1903(a) (Supp.1993). Words that have acquired a \u201cpeculiar and appropriate meaning\u201d must be construed according to that peculiar and appropriate meaning. Id. Taxpayers argue that the phrase \u201cincome per books\u201d as found in 72 Pa.S.A. \u00a7 7601 has acquired such a \u201cpeculiar and appropriate meaning.\u201d Prior to the passage of the statute, they argue, DOR maintained a policy of allowing \u201cS\u201d corporations to deduct from their income per books an amount equal to the federal income tax they would have paid had they been liable for federal income taxes. The term \u201cincome per books\u201d, the taxpayers urge, acquired the peculiar meaning of allowing this deduction because of DOR\u2019s voluntary policy. Therefore, the taxpayers assert, the General Assembly intended to include the deduction when they used the term \u201cincome per books\u201d in the 1983 Tax Reform Code.\nWe decline to find that the DOR\u2019s voluntary policy of allowing the deduction prior to 1983 created a \u201cpeculiar and appropriate\u201d meaning for the purposes of the Statutory Construction Act. The taxpayers concede that the DOR\u2019s prior practice was voluntary; no statute compelled the agency to allow the deduction. It has also been stipulated that generally accepted accounting principles do not compel or endorse this deduction. (Stipulation at para. 20.)\nOther courts have found a phrase to have a \u201cpeculiar or appropriate meaning\u201d for the purposes of statutory construction where the phrase had been defined by the General Assembly in another statute. See Commonwealth v. Dodge, 410 Pa.Super. 189, 599 A.2d 668 (1991); Tyger & Karl Complete Water Systems Co., Inc. v. Commonwealth, 5 Pa. Commw. 154, 1972 WL 14680 (1972). For example, in Dodge the court found that the term \u201cfirearm\u201d had acquired a peculiar meaning for the purposes of one act because it was specifically defined in another related act. Dodge, 599 A.2d at 672.\nIn the instant case, the General Assembly has not defined the term \u201cincome per books\u201d in this or any other act to give it the peculiar meaning that the taxpayers would find in the phrase. Nor do generally accepted accounting principles give the phrase such a peculiar meaning, as they are silent on the matter. The taxpayers\u2019 only support for giving this term a \u201cpeculiar meaning\u201d for the purposes of statutory construction is DOR\u2019s voluntary prior practice. Under the facts of this case, we hold this practice insufficient to give the term \u201cincome per books\u201d the peculiar meaning the taxpayers would find.\nThe taxpayers next urge that the term \u201cincome per books\u201d is ambiguous, and direct the court to 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921 to resolve this ambiguity. Section 1921 states that where a statute is free from ambiguity the letter is not to be disregarded to pursue its spirit. 1 Pa.C.S.A \u00a7 1921(a) (Supp. 1993). However, where the words of a statute are not explicit, a court can consider other enumerated matters. See 1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(c)(1) \u2014 (8) (Supp.1993).\nThis court agrees with the taxpayers and the Commonwealth Court that, in this instance, the term \u201cincome per books\u201d as found in 72 Pa.S.A. \u00a7 7601 is ambiguous. The term is undefined in the statute. The only definition for the term is found in regulations addressing the pre-1983 method of calculating the value of capital stock. Here, the term is defined as \u201cincome reported in line 1 of schedule M-l of the Federal 1120 form.\u201d 61 Pa.Code 155.22. This definition is unhelpful because for the years involved here there was no such line on the 1120 form filed by \u201cS\u201d corporations. (Stipulation at para. 15.)\nAs the term \u201cincome per books\u201d is ambiguous in this instance, we turn to the Statutory Construction Act to determine the intent of the General Assembly. The Taxpayers urge us to consider 1921(c)(5), which allows the court to consider \u201cformer law, if any, including other statutes upon the same or similar subjects.\u201d We find this section offers no assistance in construing the meaning of the term \u201cincome per books\u201d because there is no former law to consider. The previous statute does not define the term. The previous regulation enforcing that statute is silent on the deduction of hypothetical federal taxes from income per books. The taxpayers argue that the DOR\u2019s voluntary practice constitutes \u201cformer law\u201d helpful in determining the intent of the General Assembly. However, we find the DOR\u2019s voluntary practice to be just that \u2014 a voluntary practice which sheds little light on the intent of the General Assembly.\nThus, the cases the taxpayers have cited for the proposition that a statute does not make changes in prior existing law beyond what is expressly declared in their provisions are inapposite. For example, in Commonwealth v. Miller, 469 Pa. 24, 364 A.2d 886 (1976), the court held that a criminal statute silent on the issue of merger of conspiracy with the substantive offense did not change the common law rule that conspiracy did not merge with the substantive offense. Here, we are not dealing with a well established common law rule, or a statue, or a regulation evidencing the intent of the General Assembly in enacting section 7601. Rather, we are concerned with a voluntary policy of an administrative agency which, in the opinion of this court, sheds no light on the intent of the General Assembly.\nTaxpayers, in their brief, fail to consider 1921(c)(8) which allows the court to use \u201cLegislative and administrative interpretations of the statute,\u201d in discerning the intent of the General Assembly. We hold this section controlling in interpreting the meaning of the phrase \u201cincome per books\u201d.\nIt is a well established principle of administrative law that agencies are entitled deference in interpreting the statutes they enforce. See, e.g., Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Uniontown Area School District, 455 Pa. 52, 76, 313 A.2d 156, 169 (1973). Philadelphia Suburban Corp. v. Commonwealth, 144 Pa.Commw. 410, 601 A.2d 893 (1992), overruled on other grounds, 535 Pa. 298, 635 A.2d 116 (1993). Other courts in this Commonwealth have held that an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation should be overturned or disregarded only for cogent reasons or where it is \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d. Philadelphia Suburban, 144 Pa.Commw. at 420, 601 A.2d at 898.; Commonwealth Liquor Control Board v. Burrell Food Systems, 97 Pa.Commw. 101, 104, 508 A.2d 1308, 1309 appeal denied, 513 Pa. 636, 520 A.2d 1386 (1986). Where the statutory scheme is as technically complex as the Tax Reform Code, \u201ca reviewing court must be even more chary to substitute discretion for the expertise of the administrative agency.\u201d Philadelphia Suburban, 144 Pa.Commw. at 420, 601 A.2d at 898 (quoting Smithkline Beckman Corp. v. Commonwealth, 85 Pa.Commw. 437, 458, 482 A.2d 1344, 1353 (1984) ajfd per curiam, 508 Pa. 359, 498 A.2d 374 (1985). The court in Smithkline held that \u201cDepartment of Revenue Regulations interpreting the Tax Reform Code will not be disregarded by this court unless clearly inconsistent with the code,\u201d Smithkline, 85 Pa.Commw. at 457-58, 482 A.2d at 1354, 1356.\nFor the purposes of the present situation we adopt these general principles of administrative law as consistently applied by other courts in this Commonwealth to determine the meaning of the phrase \u201cincome per books\u201d in 72 Pa.S.A. \u00a7 7601. The taxpayers here have the burden of establishing that DOR\u2019s regulations are clearly erroneous. See 72 Pa.S.A. \u00a7 7236 (1990). We hold that the taxpayers have failed to carry their heavy burden of establishing that the DOR regulation prohibiting their claimed deduction does not comport with the law it is designed to enforce.\nSections 7408 and 7603 of the tax code give DOR the power to \u201cadopt [and] promulgate ... rules and regulations, not inconsistent with\u201d the statutory provisions regarding the capital stock tax. See 72 Pa.S.A. \u00a7 7408(a) (1990). Nothing in the regulation at issue here promulgated by DOR is contradictory to the statutory scheme of calculating average net income as set forth in 72 Pa.S.A. \u00a7 7601. The taxpayers have failed to demonstrate that the regulation is \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Much of the taxpayers\u2019 argument on this point consists of asserting that the regulation differentiating between \u201cS\u201d and \u201cC\u201d corporations is not the most sensible and equitable tax policy. This is insufficient to carry their heavy burden. On this point we will defer to the considerable expertise of the DOR to determine the appropriate tax policy for this Commonwealth within the intent of the General Assembly.\nWe find the DOR\u2019s regulation a reasonable interpretation of the intent of the General Assembly. Concurrent with a major statutory change in the manner in which the value of capital stock was calculated, the DOR reversed its policy of allowing \u201cS\u201d corporations to deduct from income per books an amount equal to the federal taxes they would have paid had they been liable for federal taxes. DOR asserts that the shift from a totality of the circumstances approach of determining capital stock to a fixed formula required this change in policy formalized at 61 Pa.Code 155.22. DOR has consistently applied this policy since the statutory change. (See Stipulation at para. 16.) Nothing in this policy is contrary to the statutory scheme of calculating average net income. Furthermore, the General Assembly has had almost a decade to reverse this regulation had it been contrary to the intent of the statute. The failure of the General Assembly to act is evidence that the regulation is not contrary to its intent. For these reasons we defer to DOR\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cincome per books.\u201d\n11. Taxpayer\u2019s Constitutional Arguments\nTaxpayers next argue that this statute and the DOR regulation enforcing it are in violation of the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. We do not agree.\nThe analysis to be applied in determining the reasonableness of classifications under the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution are the same. Leventhal v. City of Philadelphia, 518 Pa. 233, 542 A.2d 1328 (1988). A classification for tax purposes is valid when it is based upon some legitimate distinction between the classes that provides a reasonable and just basis for the different treatment. Id. \u201cSo long as the classification imposed is based upon some standard capable of reasonable comprehension, be that standard based upon availability to produce revenue or some other legitimate distinction, equal protection of the law has been afforded.\u201d Aldine Apartments v. Commonwealth, 493 Pa. 480, 487, 426 A.2d 1118, 1122 (1981) (quoting Commonwealth v. Life Assurance Co. of Pennsylvania, 419 Pa. 370, 378, 214 A.2d 209, 215 (1965)). The burden is on the taxpayer to demonstrate that a classification made for the purposes of taxation is unreasonable. Leonard v. Thornberg, 507 Pa. 317, 489 A.2d 1349 (1985).\nIn the present situation, the taxpayers assert that 72 Pa. S.A. \u00a7 7601 and the regulation enforcing it found at 61 Pa. Code 155.26(g) violate both the Pennsylvania Constitution and the United States Constitution because they allow \u201cC\u201d corporations to deduct from their income per books an amount equal to their federal tax liability, but prohibit \u201cS\u201d corporations from deducting an amount equal to the federal taxes they would pay if they were liable for federal taxes. In short, the taxpayers argue that allowing \u201cC\u201d corporations this deduction from income per books but denying the deduction to \u201cS\u201d corporations violates the guarantee of uniformity taxes required in the Pennsylvania Constitution and the guarantee of equal protection of the law found in the United States Constitution.\nUsing the standards set forth above we hold that neither the Pennsylvania Constitution nor the United States Constitution is violated by this method of determining the value of a corporation\u2019s capital stock. We find that the distinction between a \u201cC\u201d corporation and an \u201cS\u201d corporation for the purposes of this deduction is a legitimate one. Under both Pennsylvania and federal tax law, \u201cC\u201d corporations are liable for federal income taxes. In a limited number of circumstances, the owners of corporations may voluntarily elect \u201cS\u201d corporation status. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362; 72 Pa.S.A. \u00a7 7307. The consequence of this election is that the corporation will not pay federal income taxes. Instead, the income will be passed on to the shareholders who will report the income on their personal returns. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 et seq.; 72 Pa.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 7307-7309 (1990).\nIn short, the amount a \u201cC\u201d corporation deducts from its income per books under this regulation will be, most often, equal to the amount it actually pays in federal income taxes. The amount that the taxpayers wish to deduct and which the regulation prohibits is a hypothetical amount that the \u201cS\u201d corporation will not pay because it is not liable for federal taxes. It is rational to this court that when determining the value of capital stock DOR would allow \u201cC\u201d corporations a deduction for taxes they pay, but prohibit \u201cS\u201d corporations a deduction for hypothetical taxes they do not pay. Once again, much of the taxpayer\u2019s argument is that this is not the most sensible or equitable method of taxation. However, the taxpayer\u2019s burden was to demonstrate that this was not a rational method of taxation. They have failed to carry this burden.\nThe analysis for finding a violation of Article III, \u00a7 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution prohibiting special laws is the same as for the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Leventhal v. City of Philadelphia, 518 Pa. 233, 542 A.2d 1328 (1988). For the reasons discussed supra we find no violation of Article III, \u00a7 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\nAs we find no deprivation of any right under the United States Constitution, we find no violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and no reason to grant attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.\nFor the reasons stated above the opinion of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nPAPADAKOS, J., concurs in the result.\n. P.R.A.P. 1571(f) provides in its pertinent part: \"No record shall be certified to the court by the Board of Finance and Revenue. After the filing of the petition for review the parties shall take appropriate steps to prepare and file a stipulation of such facts as may be agreed to and to identify issues of fact, if any, which remain to be tried.\u201d\n. Under federal tax law \"S\u201d corporations are not subject to taxation on their income. Instead, income is distributed to shareholders who report it on their personal returns. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 et seq.\n. See Act of December 22, 1983, No. 89, \u00a7 1 (P.L. 360) codified at 72 Pa.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 7601-7602.\n. \u00a7 723.

Such timely exceptions shall have the effect ... of an order granting reconsideration of the determination previously entered by the court. Issues not raised by exceptions are waived and cannot be raised on appeal.\"\n. The statute provides that a corporation\u2019s capital stock value is to be calculated as \u201cthe product of one-half times the sum of the average net income capitalized at the rate of nine and one-half percent plus seventy-five percent of net worth, from which product shall be subtracted fifty thousand dollars ...\u201d 72 Pa.S.A. \u00a7 7601(a) (1990).\n. 61 Pa.Code 155.26(g) provides \"No adjustment to net income or loss may be made for Federal income tax which would have been paid by a corporation electing S corporation treatment under Section 1361 of the IRC (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1361) or for Commonwealth Corporate Net Income Tax which would have been paid by a corporation electing Pennsylvania S corporation treatment under article 3 of the TRC (72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7301-7361) or for Commonwealth personal income tax paid by the shareholders of the corporation.\u201d\n.

The Taxpayers and the DOR agree that, in certain circumstances, \"C\u201d corporations filing a consolidated return may receive a deduction for federal taxes from income per books even though they do not actually pay federal taxes. (Stipulation at para. 17.) This occurs because of offsetting losses from other members of the consolidated group. Id. We agree with DOR that these situations can be distinguished from \u201cS\u201d corporations because \"C\u201d corporations filing as part of a consolidated group are subject to federal income taxes while \u201cS\u201d corporations are not.",
