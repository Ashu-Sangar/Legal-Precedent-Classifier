Because the Commonwealth deliberately withheld such information throughout the hearing on Appellant’s pre-trial suppression motions and then used the information to ambush Appellant during the Commonwealth’s opening statement, we find a violation of Pa.R.Crim.P. 305 has occurred and now reverse.</p>

Penn Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On the basis of this controlled buy as well as <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>subsequent surveillance and a second controlled buy, the police secured a search warrant for the premises. On September 22, 1989, the police executed the search warrant and entered the house located at 207 E. Penn Street. Officer Cunningham did not take part in this search. Upon entering the house, the police found four people, three of whom, including Appellant, were seated in chairs in the first-floor living room. The police found a bag containing thirty-two small vials of cocaine weighing slightly over three grams under the cushion of the chair on which Appellant had been seated. From other places in the living room, the police recovered three loaded weapons, two scales and empty plastic vials.</p>
    <p id="b857-4" data-blocks='[["BL_857.5",857,[185,1006,1157,363]]]'>After the police discovered the bag under the cushion, Appellant was arrested and charged with possession and possession with the intent to deliver a controlled substance, possession of prohibited offensive weapons and possession of drug paraphernalia. No charges were brought against Appellant regarding the August 29, 1989 sale of drugs to Officer Cunningham.</p>

Guarino of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Appellant was convicted of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, possession of a prohibited offensive weapon and possession of drug paraphernalia. Post-trial motions were argued and denied. Appellant was sentenced to two and one half to seven years imprisonment and to pay a fine of five thousand dollars plus costs.</p>

The majority of the Superior Court panel found no violation of Pa.R.Crim.P. 305 had occurred. The court found that the Commonwealth and Appellant had known of Officer Cunningham’s existence and substance of the evidence he could have presented from the date the charges were filed. Furthermore, the majority noted that Appellant knew or should have known from the contents of the affidavit underlying the warrant of Officer Cunning<a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>ham’s ability to identify Appellant. The Superior Court majority reasoned, therefore, that the Commonwealth did not violate its duty to disclose to Appellant the circumstances and results of any identification of Appellant. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 305(B)(1)(d). The court concluded by indicating that the Commonwealth did not know of Officer Cunningham’s availability to testify until immediately before trial and then promptly divulged the information to Appellant.</p>
    <p id="b858-5" data-blocks='[["BL_858.5",858,[257,738,1162,854]]]'>Appellant argues that the Commonwealth violated Pa. R.Crim.P. 305 by not immediately informing defense counsel of Officer Cunningham’s intended testimony that Appellant was the heretofore previously unidentified “black man in his late twenties,” as set forth in the affidavit underlying the search warrant, who sold him drugs on August 29, 1989. Appellant contends that the Commonwealth’s last-minute announcement of such information unfairly shifted the inquiry at trial from whether Appellant constructively possessed cocaine on September 22, 1989, to whether Appellant sold drugs to Officer Cunningham on August 29, 1989. As a result, Appellant claims that he was perceived as being inextricably intertwined with drug activity when there had been no allegation that anyone ever saw Appellant selling drugs in either the police reports provided to Appellant before trial or in the pretrial hearing testimony of the police witnesses.</p>

In fact, the Commonwealth claims that this new information was disclosed only thirty minutes after it was received.

At no time during this hearing did the prosecutor inform defense counsel of the allegations despite the fact that much of defense counsel’s strategy during this hearing was designed to show that no one had associated Appellant with any previous drug sales at the house.
