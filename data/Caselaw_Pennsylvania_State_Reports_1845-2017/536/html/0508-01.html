The main issue is appellant’s challenge to DNA evidence admitted against him at trial. We hold that evidence of DNA testing is admissible and that appellant has raised no other claims that merit relief.</p>
    <p id="b808-7" data-blocks='[["BL_808.7",808,[238,826,1164,581]]]'>In the morning of September 13,1990, two hikers, Geoffrey Flood and Molly LaRue, were killed at an overnight shelter on the Appalachian Trail in Perry County. Miss LaRue had been tied, raped, and stabbed, resulting in death approximately fifteen minutes after being stabbed in the neck. Mr. Hood, her boyfriend, had been shot three times with a revolver, and died five to eight minutes after receiving the fatal shot in the lower left chest. The victims had been southbound on the trail, and on the day before they were murdered, they had been seen by other hikers and employees in several stores in Duncannon where they had purchased supplies.</p>

Witnesses testified that two days before the murders, appellant had visited a library in East Berlin, Pennsylvania, seeking a map of the Appalachian Trail and had later sought directions of others nearer the trail. Witnesses remembered that he wore black military boots and had two red duffel bags with a “Marlboro” logo. Others observed him on the trail going south after the crime. He was wearing hiking gear that had belonged to the victims. When he was apprehended, he possessed numerous articles that had belonged to the victims. A ballistics expert testified that the handgun he possessed upon his arrest was the weapon which killed Mr. Hood. He <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>also had a knife with blood on it which matched the blood type of Miss LaRue. Other witnesses identified objects found at the murder scene or along the trail south of the murders as being or resembling property of appellant.</p>
    <p id="b809-5" data-blocks='[["BL_809.5",809,[220,549,1154,364]]]'>An FBI DNA expert, Dr. Deadman, testified that appellant’s DNA patterns in three of four genetic loci matched the DNA patterns obtained from semen samples from Miss La-Rue’s vagina. He did not state a statistical probability of such a match occurring by chance; the defense expert, Dr. Acton, criticized any conclusion reached without a statistical showing that the match was not simply coincidental.</p>
    <p id="b809-6" data-blocks='[["BL_809.6",809,[218,937,1157,569]]]'>Following jury verdicts of first degree murder, a sentencing hearing was held. A physician for the prosecution testified that there was medical evidence that Miss LaRue’s hands had been tied before she was killed. The defense presented evidence that appellant had no prior convictions and the testimony of appellant’s employer who described appellant’s work and drinking habits. The defense also presented a psychiatrist who testified that appellant had a schizoid personality and suffered from an organic aggressive syndrome aggravated on the day of the killings by the consumption of alcohol and cocaine.</p>
    <p id="b809-7" data-blocks='[["BL_809.7",809,[216,1537,1156,835]]]'>The jury was instructed that the potential aggravating circumstances pertaining to the Hood murder were that the killing occurred during the perpetration of a robbery, that there was a grave risk of death to another, and that appellant was convicted of another murder. In the LaRue murder, the aggravating circumstances submitted to the jury were that the killing occurred during the perpetration of a rape, that the killing was committed by torture, and that appellant was convicted of another murder. The mitigating circumstances submitted to the jury in both killings were: that there were no prior convictions; that appellant was under extreme mental or emotional disturbance; that appellant’s capacity to appreciate or conform his conduct was substantially impaired; that he acted under extreme duress; and any other mitigating evidence concerning the character and record of appellant and the circumstances of his offenses.</p>

Appellant was observed near the scene of the crimes shortly before and shortly after the killings. Property identified as appellant’s was found abandoned on the trail south of the corpses, and when he was arrested further south, he had in his possession numerous items positively identified as those of the victims and was even wearing some of their clothing. Appellant had in his possession both murder weapons: the revolver and the knife which killed Mr. Hood and Miss LaRue. DNA testing established a strong probability that the semen <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>removed from the body of Miss LaRue was that of appellant, and the testing definitely eliminated the possibility that the semen was that of Mr. Hood or Mr. Reese, another suspect subject to investigation, who was later cleared of suspicion.

He argues that a cooling-off period of only two months was not sufficient to dissipate the prejudicial effect of the publicity, in contrast to the period of “almost a year” which significantly diluted the prejudice in <em>Breakiron.</em>

Suffice to say that the scientific processes carried out in a laboratory to compare DNA samples are now routine and fidly accepted in the scientific community. Indeed, appellant’s DNA expert, Dr. Acton, testified in substance that DNA typing was a generally accepted technique for identity testing. What has not yet achieved universal agreement is the less objective selection of the appropriate population for statistical purposes and the actual statistical analysis which is to be applied to the physical analysis carried out in the laboratory.

If the DNA sample from the crime scene matches the DNA of an accused, it is at least evidence that the DNA discovered at the crime scene is that of the accused. If the DNA sample matches the DNA of the accused <em>and no one else, </em>then it, of course, conclusively establishes that the accused is the source of the DNA found at the scene of the crime. This distinction is expressed in terms of statistical probability of the match occurring randomly in the population. A DNA expert might testify that a given DNA match will occur only once in a population of 10,000,000. Obviously, such a probability makes it highly likely that the DNA samples came from the same source. If the DNA expert’s testimony, however, is that a given match might occur coincidentally once in every one hundred samples, then it is far weaker in establishing the <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>sources of the DNA samples as being one and the same individual.</p>

Conversely, a DNA <em>mismatch </em>constitutes conclusive and certain scientific proof that the DNA samples come <em>from </em>different sources.

In a given case, then, the statistical probability of a coincidental match will differ depending upon whether the random population includes all human beings or instead is limited to a subpopulation consisting of a given race or a given ethnic group. Depending on the evidence in a case, the statistical population should sometimes be limited to a sample smaller than that of all human beings. This variable factor may account for different conclusions reached by different experts. Similarly, geographical factors also account for different genetic characteristics in various subpopulations. Such variables in a statistical analysis will affect the ultimate conclusions drawn by different experts.

Again, this reference to his silence was held to be unconstitutional. Similarly, in <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, in each of the cases, reference was made to a defendant’s silence while under interrogation or investigation for the crime for which he was later convicted under circumstances in which jurors might reasonably expect an innocent person to deny his involvement in the crime.

There could be no inference of guilt because there was no criminal investigation in progress, nor any attempt by the police to solicit a statement from appellant. The implication was totally unlike that in <em>Turner </em>and <em>Easley, supra, </em>where defendants were asked if they <em>ever </em>explained exculpatory circumstances to the police, and were thus charged with failing, over a long period of time, to deny or explain their involvement; here the reference was only to one moment during the extradition process.</p>

Referring to appellant’s silence in West Virginia when facing extradition was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and could not have contributed to the verdict. The physical evidence against appellant was overwhelming — when arrested, he was wearing clothing of the victims, was carrying their belongings, and had possession of both murder weapons. Any speculation that a negative inference might have been drawn from his silence during the extradition procedure would be swallowed up in the possibility that jurors might have drawn a negative inference from appellant’s failure to testify at his trial. In standard fashion, appellant’s jury was instructed that neither inference was permissible. The jury charge included the following: “It is entirely up to the defendant in every criminal trial whether or not to testify. He has an absolute right founded on the Constitution to remain silent. You must not draw any inference of guilt from the fact that the defendant did not testify.” We are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the reference to the West Virginia events did not contribute to the verdict.</p>

In <em>Redmond, </em>the Superior Court affirmed the trial court’s ruling that the Commonwealth’s failure to disclose the identity of a confidential informant would result in suppression of the testimony of the chief investigator, to whom the informant had given information. This holding was predicated upon Pa.R.Crim.P. 305(B)(1)(a), mandating the disclosure of any Commonwealth “evidence favorable to the accused which is material either to guilt or to punishment.... ” The unusual facts of the case, involving a murder prosecution 39 years after the killing, based on an investigation reopened after 17 years of inactivity, in which an informant concededly had supplied information on a suspect other than the accused, supported a finding that the identity of the informant was “evidence favorable to the accused.”</p>

Appellant recognizes as much, but urges extension of the <em>Redmond </em>rationale to include “information about who Mr. Reese was and why the police suspected him enough to send his blood to the lab along with that of [appellant].” We decline the opportunity to interpret Rule 305(B)(1)(a) to require disclosure of every fruitless lead followed by investigators of a crime. The mere existence of other suspects is not “evidence favorable to the accused,” but is presumably the expectation rather than the exception. Nor does investigative followup of a lead, as by blood comparison, raise a presumption that another suspect’s identity is evidence favorable to the accused which is material to guilt or punishment.

        <em>Daubert </em>relaxes, somewhat, the impediments to admission of novel scientific evidence. Under <em>Daubert, </em>expert scientific testimony is admissible if it fulfills two criteria. First, it must relate to "scientific knowledge,” thereby establishing “a standard of evidentiary reliability,” which "will be based upon scientific validity.” To constitute scientific <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>knowledge, the evidence must be grounded in the methods and procedures of science, based on more than subjective belief or unsupported speculation, and supported by appropriate validation based on what is known. The second criterion is that the evidence must be relevant; it must assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. <em>Daubert, </em>at-, <a href="/us/509/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="113 S.

Other factors are whether the technique or methodology can be or has been tested: its “falsifiability, or refutability, or testability.” Another consideration is whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication. A court should also consider the known or potential rate of error, and the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique's operation. <em><a href="/us/509/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="113 S.
