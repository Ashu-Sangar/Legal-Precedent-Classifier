The term “search” as applied to searches and seizures is an examination of an individual’s house, buildings or person, for the purpose of discovering contraband or some evidence of guilt to be used in the prosecution of a criminal action. <em>Commonwealth v. Anderson, </em><a href="/pa-super/208/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="208 Pa. Super. 323" data-case-ids="776943" data-case-paths="/pa-super/208/0323-01">208 Pa.Super. 323</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=222%20A.2d%20495" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="222 A.2d 495">222 A.2d 495</a> (1966). The police were clearly at the scene to investigate underage drinking and entered the apartment in question searching for evidence of underage drinking. The Superior Court rejected this analysis, and resolved the issue using the Fourth Amendment arrest jurisprudence. As an initial matter, there is no evidence that the police entered the apartment with the intention of arresting anyone, and, in fact, the appellants were not arrested. Instead, they were issued summary offense citations. Furthermore, even assuming the arrest jurisprudence was applicable, Superior Court’s conclusion that the appellants had no remedy for an illegal arrest was erroneous.</p>

However, the fact patterns presented in this line of cases are distinguishable from the present situation. The court in <em>Sudler </em>found that, “[t]he only fruit of the allegedly unlawful arrest which the appellant has identified is his person.” <em>Sudler, </em><a href="/pa/496/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="496 Pa. 295" data-case-ids="1772869" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0295-01">496 Pa. at 304</a>, <a href="/pa/496/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="496 Pa. 295" data-case-ids="1772869" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0295-01">436 A.2d at 1380</a>. These cases properly stand for the proposition that the defendant himself is not a suppressible fruit of an illegal arrest. Thus, where a defendant has been illegally arrested but has been prosecuted with evidence independent of the illegal arrest, the conviction will stand despite an illegal arrest.</p>
    <p id="b425-5" data-blocks='[["BL_425.5",425,[242,1135,1159,693]]]'>Here, the appellants are not arguing that they themselves were suppressible fruits of an illegal arrest. Instead they argue that the police obtained evidence necessary to support the summary offense citations as a result of an illegal search. This evidence includes police observations as reflected in the officers’ trial testimony, police questioning of the appellants and appellants’ answers thereto, identification of the appellants as “underage” and physical evidence in the nature of alcohol seized by the police. Thus, the cases cited by the Superior Court supporting its holding that the appellants were without a remedy for an illegal arrest are inapposite, and an examination of this case using traditional Fourth Amendment search jurisprudence is appropriate.</p>

Mr. Fifoot testified: “I did not give permission. I was not asked. I didn’t say you <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>cannot come in, or stop; but I didn’t say yes, come on in.” (R.R. at 37a-38a)</p>
    <p id="b429-4" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[252,415,1156,588]]]'>We find that Mr. Fifoot, under these circumstances, did not provide an “unequivocal, specific, and voluntary consent.” Mr. Fifoot never gave his express consent for the police to enter. The police basically spoke briefly to the owner and entered the apartment without announcing why they were present. Had the police announced their purpose, we could then infer consent had the owner failed to refuse access. However, here, to stop the police, the owner would have had to order them out of his apartment without knowing why they were present. The law of consent in this Commonwealth does not require this on the part of a residence owner.</p>

The Commonwealth asserts that there is little difference between possession of drugs such as cocaine and possession of alcohol by a minor for the purposes of determining exigent circumstances. However, in <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, <a href="/us/466/0740-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="466 U.S. 740" data-case-ids="6205546" data-case-paths="/us/466/0740-01">466 </a></em><a href="/us/466/0740-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="466 U.S. 740" data-case-ids="6205546" data-case-paths="/us/466/0740-01">U.S. 740</a>, <a href="/us/466/0740-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="466 U.S. 740" data-case-ids="6205546" data-case-paths="/us/466/0740-01">104 S.Ct. 2091</a>, <a href="/us/466/0740-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="466 U.S. 740" data-case-ids="6205546" data-case-paths="/us/466/0740-01">80 L.Ed.2d 732</a> (1984), the United States Supreme Court held that the warrantless entry of an individual’s home to arrest him for a civil nonjailable traffic offense was prohibited by the special protection afforded the individual in his home by the Fourth Amendment. The Court found that an important factor when determining whether an exigency exists is the gravity of the underlying offense. We find a critical difference between the criminal possession of illegal drugs and the summary offense of underage drinking. Nevertheless, because we hold that the police had no probable cause in the instant case, it is not necessary to determine whether the summary offense of underage drinking is serious enough to create "exigent circumstances.”</p>
