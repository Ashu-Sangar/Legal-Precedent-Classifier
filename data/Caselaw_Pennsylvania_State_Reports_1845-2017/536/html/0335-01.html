Claimant was employed by Allied for more than forty years — first as a millwright, and then, since 1980, as a toolroom attendant. While employed by Allied, the Claimant was frequently exposed to asbestos.</p>

It was subsequently determined that the arthrogram had been misread and the diagnosis of asbestosis was erroneous. In an initial examination of Claimant on January 16, 1985, Dr. Cantagallo heard bilateral rhonchi in Claimant’s lungs. However, upon referral for pulmonary and cardiac evaluations, no signs of cardiac disease or active asbestos were seen. Despite the fact that he was advised that the arthrogram report was in error, Claimant continued to believe that he suffered from asbestosis. Dr. Cantagallo concluded that Claimant’s disability, i.e., shortness of breath, was the result of Claimant’s belief that he had a severe pulmonary disease.</p>

Radio-graphic films of Claimant’s chest revealed significant bilateral pleural thickening and calcification with very minimal, if any, signs of interstitial fibrosis (asbestosis). A study of arterial blood gases and a ventilation scan yielded normal results. Dr. Sokas opined that Claimant had become fixed on the erroneous arthrogram and that his resulting anxiety precluded him from returning to his prior duties.</p>

The referee also relied in his adjudication upon the portion of Dr. Swartz’s testimony where that doctor conceded that Claimant has bilateral pleural plaque thickening with minimal interstitial disease (asbestosis) caused by exposure to asbestos. For these reasons, the referee determined that Claimant experienced a severe emotional reaction as a result of a physical injury to the pleura of his lungs, precluding his ability to perform his work duties beginning January 12, 1985, and awarded total temporary disability benefits. Simultaneously, the referee rejected Claimant’s argument that he sustained a work-related shoulder injury. That conclusion was not challenged on appeal. Finally, the referee declined to assess counsel fees and penalties.</p>

The Board reasoned that because no physician testified that Claimant was physically disabled from any work-related injury or trauma, Claimant’s case is one actually involving a mental cause and a mental disability— the classic mental/mental association. However, the Board determined that Claimant failed to show that his injury was caused by actual objective abnormal working conditions, as opposed to subjective, perceived, or imagined employment events. The Board concluded, therefore, that the referee erred in failing to apply the burden of proof necessary to prove a mental/mental condition and failing to find that Claimant never offered the objective evidence necessary to support this burden of proof.</p>

General Battery moved Lash and <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>Jablonski to lower-paying non-lead hazard positions in 1975 as a preventive matter on the recommendation of the company physician because they had become lead absorbers, i.e., they had begun to absorb lead into their bloodstreams at an abnormally high rate, making further lead exposure hazardous. Because these positions were less remunerative than their former lead hazard positions, Lash and Jablonski sought occupational disease benefits. The referee concluded as a matter of law that they had failed to prove by sufficient competent evidence that they sustained a work-related injury or occupational disease within the meaning of the Act.

To require appellants to remain exposed until their condition had progressed to the advanced stages of lead poisoning in order to qualify for partial disability benefits would be unconscionable. We also indicated that in the interpretation of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, the word “disability” is to be regarded as synonymous with loss of earning power. Accordingly, we found that the claimants were entitled to an award of partial disability benefits because, having become abnormally fast absorbers of lead after eight years of job-related exposure, they suffered a loss of earning power when forced to accept lower-salaried non-lead hazard positions.</p>

We also agree with Allied’s position, which is supported by Drs. Cantagallo and Sokas, that Claimant’s psychic injury is attributable to the misreading of the arthrogram. We decline, however, to find that a misdiagnosis is a physical stimulus such as could be the basis for an award of benefits.</p>

Allied contends that Claimant failed to address the issue before the Commonwealth Court as to whether Claimant sustained a physical disability under the rationale of the <em>Lash </em>case. Therefore, Claimant, according to Allied, has waived this issue. Our review of the Claimant’s brief to Commonwealth Court reveals that Claimant’s argument was implicitly incorporated into the questions presented for review, and for that reason, Allied's claim of waiver is meritless.
