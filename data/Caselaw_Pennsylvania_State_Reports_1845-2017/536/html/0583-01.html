      <p id="b894-6" data-blocks='[["BL_894.8",894,[265,1718,1160,632]]]'>. Paylor asserts that the "family car exclusion” is repugnant to the purposes and policy of the MVFRL because the exception does not appear in the uninsured/underinsured motorist provision of the statute. She contends that the only exception to recovery of benefits under the uninsured/underinsured motorist provision is that set forth in 75 Pa. C.S.A. § 1731(d) which states, "A person who recovers damages under uninsured motorist coverage or coverages cannot recover damages under underinsured motorist coverage or coverages for the same accident.” If accepted, Paylor's analysis would require us to overrule the long line of decisions of the Superior Court that have upheld the "family car exclusion” when the plaintiff has attempted to recover the limits of liability under the tortfeasor’s policy and underinsured motorist coverage under the same policy. Paylor’s argument is self-defeating because it fails to recognize the difference between liability coverage and underinsured motorist coverage which underlies the precedent developed by the Superior Court and our decision in this case.</p>
