Geisz of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County of murder of the first degree, kidnapping and criminal conspiracy. As required by the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711, a sentencing hearing was held, and the same jury determined that two aggravating circumstances existed, <em>ie., </em>that the victim (22 year old David Bernstein) was a prosecution witness to a felony committed by the defendant and that the victim was killed for the purpose of preventing his testimony against Appellant in a criminal proceeding (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(5)), and that the defendant committed the killing while in the perpetration of a felony (kidnapping) (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6)). <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>The jury did not specifically find that any mitigating circumstances were present, and, as required by the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(l)(iv), fixed a sentence of death on November 16, 1983.</p>

Appellant sought to review that decision in the Canadian Courts and, once again, during the review process, Appellant escaped from the Parthenais Prison in Montreal on October 23, 1986, and remained a fugitive for almost two years, until after information on Appellant was broadcast on a television program “America’s Most Wanted.” Appellant was spotted and arrested in St. John, Province of New Brunswick and returned to custody in September 1988.

Appellant argues that it was an abuse of discretion to dismiss his post-verdict motions and allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel or not to allow him to have these motions considered once he was recaptured and returned to Pennsylvania. Furthermore, he asks that these motions be considered at this time and that the record in this matter be remanded to the trial court so that it can fulfill its duty to dispose of his post-verdict motions on the merits.</p>

The United States Supreme Court has recently reviewed its own case law which permits its appellate courts to dismiss pending fugitive appeals and has reaffirmed the principle that where there is a connection between a defendant’s fugitive status and the appellate process, the sanction of dismissal of the appeal is a reasonable response. <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>

Multiple blows to the head were observed which were later shown by a medical examination to be consistent with blows from a bat and bruises were seen to the chest consistent with being made by the electric prod.

From the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body, the jury could infer that the killing was intentional and malicious. <em>Commonwealth v.

However, under the instant facts, I am constrained to agree that the <em>trial court </em>possessed full authority to dismiss Appellant’s post-verdict motions by virtue of Appellant’s escape and absence while those motions were pending.</p>

This conclusion parallels that of Mr. Justice Zappala as stated in his dissent in <em>Passaro, </em>that the appeal of an ex-fugitive should be reinstated in the appellate court’s discretion if, after being returned to custody, the fugitive-appellant can show a compelling reason for having his claim heard.</p>
