It did not change the elements of the offense or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt. Nor did it increase the punishment which the law annexed to Young’s crimes when committed. Finally, it did not alter the legal rules of evidence, so as to require less or different testimony than the law required at the time of the commission of the crimes in order to sentence appellant to death. In seeking the death penalty, the Commonwealth was once again required to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of aggravating circumstances sufficient to outweigh any mitigating factors. In challenging application of the amended law to him, appellant does not complain that § 9711(h) denied him any procedural protections relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence. Nor does he complain that he was deprived of any avenue of review for correcting sentencing errors. Indeed, it was precisely such a review which prompted us to vacate appellant’s first death sentence and order a new hearing. What appellant is really <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>complaining about is the loss of a procedural windfall that he would have enjoyed had the law not been amended.

One was stricken for cause by agreement of counsel, and the second was accepted and ultimately served on the jury. The third, Ms. Moody, was challenged for cause but the challenge was rejected. The Commonwealth then exercised a peremptory challenge and the court asked for a reason for the challenge. As noted by the trial judge, he did not find that a prima facie case of discrimination had been established; he asked for a reason in the interest of developing a complete record. The District Attorney offered several reasons for the challenge, including his doubts about Ms. Moody’s ability to be impartial, her ability to follow instructions, and the seriousness with which she viewed the task of serving on the jury. As explained by the District Attorney, Ms. Moody’s brother had been successfully prosecuted for burglary by his office that year. Although Ms. Moody denied that the conviction would affect her ability to remain unbiased, the Commonwealth pointed out that she had been less than candid in her response to questioning. She did not raise her hand when the jury pool was asked “whether or not either you or any member of your family was convicted of a crime.” In addition, the prosecutor noted that Ms. Moody’s facial expressions and laughter in response to certain questions asked of the jury pool caused him to question her fitness to serve. Based on these facts, we simply cannot conclude that the trial court’s <em>Batson </em>ruling is erroneous. Appellant has not established any facts and circumstances which raise an inference of purposeful discrimination.</p>

      <em>Beasley </em>makes it clear that a sentencing court does not err when it refuses to limit evidence of this particular aggravating circumstance to a certified record and sanitized summary of the circumstances of the prior crimes. The jury is entitled to know more than the mere fact of conviction. A review of the record reveals that the witnesses’ testimony was confined to the facts necessary and essential to understanding the nature of the offense and appellant’s character.

At no time did the prosecutor ask about the actual penalty imposed in the other death penalty cases in which Dr. Cooke testified; nor did the witness offer such information. The prosecutor did mention the name of one of the prior cases in which the death penalty was imposed. Appellant now claims that this mere mention was prejudicial enough to warrant a mistrial because some juror might have been aware that the death penalty was imposed in that case and might have found Dr. Cooke’s testimony less persuasive on that basis.

He stated that the fact that the appellant had carelessly discarded evidence near the crime scene did not change this opinion. On cross-examination, the prosecutor attempted to show that a criminal might leave evidence where it could be readily discovered without necessarily suffering from diminished capacity. He offered as an example the contract killer, who sometimes deliberately leaves such evidence while fully understanding the criminality of his action.

The diagram of the six convictions was also fair comment on prior testimony that appellant had in fact been convicted of six separate felonies. In regard to the remarks concerning the aggravating circumstance, we note that, while it is properly the role of the court to instruct the jury on the law, the prosecutor did not misstate the law. As such, his comments did not mislead the jury and provide no basis for a mistrial. Likewise, the prosecutor’s comment on admissible but inadvertently omitted evidence does not warrant a mistrial.

As correctly noted by the Commonwealth, the same pre-revolutionarywar concerns shaped the ex post facto provision of the constitutions of Pennsylvania and the United States. See <em>Calder v.

As our interpretation of the state constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws has been consistent with that of the United States Supreme Court’s interpretation of the federal prohibition, the analysis of appellant's federal ex post facto claim disposes of his state claim as well.</p>

The dissent, in concluding that § 9711(h) is an ex post facto law, seems to regard the remand process as a pivotal event capable of transmogrifying both the offense and the permissible penalty. It continually emphasizes that the "potential maximum sentence on remand has been increased," ignoring that the ex post facto prohibition does not attach to specific procedural stages in a case. What is forbidden is to change "the law annexed to the crime when committed,” not to bar reimposition of sentence on remand. The notion that return to the sentencing court is a determinative factor in finding impermissible retroactivity, confuses substance and procedure. The substance, as we have already explained, consists of the fact that the penalties legislatively designated for first degree homicide, were at the time of appellant's initial sentencing, and continue to be, at the time of remand, and now, either life imprisonment or death. The section in question introduced no alteration to these potential sentences, merely permitting the reimposition of a sentence already legitimately imposed. If the sentence had not been legitimately imposed, that is, was without sufficient evidence supporting aggravating circumstances or was disproportionate to the sentence imposed in similar cases, then the statute provides that the sentence be altered to life imprisonment. Thus only the protocol involved in pronouncement was affected by the statutory change, since no decisions as to substance, that is, which sentence was appropriate, was predetermined.</p>

However, the distinction between this case and <em>Miller </em>is readily apparent. In <em>Miller </em>the sentence imposed on the appellant was increased by several years, from a presumptive sentence of 314 to 4 *4 years to the 7 year term actually imposed, under the provisions of a retroactive statute. The statute increased the severity of the penalty pursuant to a point system which also increased the points to be assigned to the appellant’s particular crime. These changes did not occur until well after the <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>crime had been committed, and the enhanced penalty was imposed before the effective date of the statute.

The witnesses included Sylvia Young Bailey, the ex-wife of the appellant, who testified briefly about the appellant’s conviction for shooting her in the head in October of 1986. Another victim, Junior Brown Henderson, related the appellant’s conviction for shooting him in 1976.

Indeed, had this Court heard appellant’s appeal more expeditiously, he would have had his case remanded for resentencing before the legislative change in the statute and <em>could not have been </em>sentenced to death. Appellant filed his appeal in this Court on August 18, 1988.
