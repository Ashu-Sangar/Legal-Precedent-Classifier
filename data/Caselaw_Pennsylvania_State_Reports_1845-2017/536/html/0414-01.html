Jones had not paid a municipal lien for the improvement of the street in front of his house in the amount of $400. Because of his failure to pay, the lien was increased to $1700 when interest and costs were added.</p>

Two <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>days before the scheduled sale, Jones met with Alper and his associate, one DeCoatsworth, a real estate investor.</p>
    <p id="b713-4" data-blocks='[["BL_713.5",713,[241,450,1157,532]]]'>As a result of this meeting, Jones and Alper executed an agreement of sale for Jones’ house. The agreement provided that Alper, acting through a real estate investor, would buy Jones’ house for $1.00, satisfy other debts which were secured by the property, and refinance the property. In return, Jones executed a deed to the property with the understanding that he had the option to lease the house for $300 per month, purchase the property outright, or enter into a lease-purchase option in which the rental payment would be applied to the purchase price.</p>
    <p id="b713-5" data-blocks='[["BL_713.6",713,[240,1008,1155,315]]]'>Because Jones’ estranged wife, Odessa, was not at the meeting, Alper approached her separately the day after his meeting with Jones, and paid her $1,000 in return for which she executed a deed. Odessa had not lived at this address for twenty years. The next day, Alper paid the judgment lien and effected a stay of the sheriffs sale.</p>
    <p id="b713-6" data-blocks='[["BL_713.7",713,[239,1349,1154,469]]]'>Alper discovered that there were two mortgages on the property for which he was obligated under the terms of the sales agreement. He did not pay these obligations and the mortgages remained unsatisfied. At settlement, on January 4, 1984, the consideration was shown to be $10,000, not $1.00 as agreed, and Alper effected the assignment of the deed to DeCoatsworth as security for the $1,700 DeCoatsworth had paid to satisfy the municipal lien. Jones received nothing from the sale to DeCoatsworth.</p>
    <p id="b713-7" data-blocks='[["BL_713.8",713,[235,1851,1160,529]]]'>Later in January Jones received a communication from DeCoatsworth stating the three options under their sales agreement for remaining in the house. The purchase price of the house was $15,000, which was to be paid over twenty years at fourteen percent interest, the prevailing rate at the time. Since Jones himself subsequently satisfied the mortgages, the $15,000 did not include payments made by DeCoatsworth to satisfy the mortgages. Among other things, the $15,000 covered a $5,000 profit to DeCoatsworth, a $3,175 fee to Alper, and the $1,000 paid to Odessa.</p>

In September of 1984 DeCoatsworth sued to evict Jones and Jones counterclaimed, alleging fraud in the transaction which deprived him of his property. Neither party joined Odessa, Jones’ estranged wife. The jury rejected DeCoatsworth’s eviction claim, and awarded Jones $35,000 damages, allowing him to remain in the house rent-free. Title to the property remained in DeCoatsworth. Posttrial motions were denied and DeCoatsworth appealed to Superior Court, seeking reversal on the grounds that the jury allowed DeCoatsworth neither to evict Jones nor to charge him rent. On August 28, 1989, Superior Court affirmed the lower court, with Judge Kelly dissenting. Judge Kelly would have required Jones either to rescind the contract, thus retaining ownership of his home, or affirm the contract, leave his home, and elect damages. As Judge Kelly indicates, although DeCoatsworth retained title to the property, Jones received both full damages <em>and </em>continued possession of his home.</p>
    <p id="b714-5" data-blocks='[["BL_714.5",714,[250,1284,1157,96]]]'>DeCoatsworth petitioned this court for allowance of appeal, and on August 20, 1990, we denied allocatur.</p>
    <p id="b714-6" data-blocks='[["BL_714.6",714,[247,1403,1161,736]]]'>Meanwhile, on December 31, 1985, Jones also initiated suit against Alper, alleging fraud. Alper demanded that Odessa be joined as an indispensable party, but Jones failed to comply and the court deferred the matter until after trial. The jury found that Alper defrauded Jones and awarded compensatory damages of one dollar and $18,000 in punitive damages. The trial court granted Alper’s post-trial motions for J.N.O.V. on the grounds that Odessa was an indispensable party and she had not been joined. The trial court’s theory was that the fraud had been committed upon the entireties and, therefore, the lawsuit required the presence of Jones’ wife. Jones argued that when title was transferred to DeCoatsworth, the entireties estate ended and that he was entitled to pursue his personal tort claim without joining his wife.</p>
    <p id="b714-7" data-blocks='[["BL_714.7",714,[249,2159,1159,205]],["BL_715.1",715,[228,326,1155,204]]]'>Jones appealed the <em>Alper </em>case to Superior Court, which, in a memorandum opinion of January 10, 1992, reversed. The court reasoned that since the conveyance terminated the estate by the entireties and Jones affirmed the conveyance, it <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>was error for the trial court to conclude that the fraud was committed upon the entireties and that Odessa was an indispensable party. Superior Court vacated the entry of J.N.O.V. and reinstated the jury verdict.</p>
    <p id="b715-4" data-blocks='[["BL_715.5",715,[229,553,1157,1163]]]'>Shortly after allocatur was denied in the <em>DeCoatsworth </em>case in August of 1990, on November 9, 1990, DeCoatsworth petitioned <em>pro se </em>to strike the trial court’s judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction over Jones’ counterclaim. For the first time, DeCoatsworth claimed that because Jones and Odessa owned the property as tenants by the entireties, Odessa was an indispensable party. The petition to strike was denied and Jones was awarded $2,500 counsel fees on the ground that DeCoatsworth had filed a “blatantly frivolous” petition. The trial court reasoned that DeCoatsworth was at all times aware of Odessa’s involvement; that Odessa was available as a witness; that DeCoatsworth should have raised the indispensable party claim before trial, during trial or on post-verdict motions; that there is no reason to believe the outcome would have been different had Odessa been joined, since her involvement was simply selling her interest in the property; that DeCoatsworth’s petition to strike was an abuse of the system in that he was attempting to relitigate his case after having lost at trial, before Superior Court and after having the Supreme Court deny allocatur; and that the court of common pleas may not have jurisdiction under Pa.R.A.P. 1701.</p>
    <p id="b715-5" data-blocks='[["BL_715.6",715,[223,1748,1159,631]],["BL_716.1",716,[250,311,1164,475]]]'>DeCoatsworth then appealed this decision to Superior Court, his second appeal in this case. A panel of Superior Court reversed the trial court’s determination that Odessa was not an indispensable party. It reasoned that one must be joined who otherwise, not bound by the decree, might assert a demand against the defendant which would be inequitable after the defendant performed under the decree; that as Jones was alleging fraud in the sale of entireties property, his wife was essential, for Jones and his wife were “an indivisible whole”; that Jones could not himself affirm the contract and elect money damages as a remedy, for he was not the only owner of the property; that DeCoatsworth did not waive his <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>claim because Pa.R.C.P. 1032 requires a court to dismiss a claim in which an indispensable party has not been joined “whenever” it arises; that it is never too late to raise a claim that the court had no jurisdiction; that Odessa cannot now be joined as an indispensable party as the statute of limitations for fraud had expired; and that the lower court misapplied the law in DeCoatsworth’s petition to strike. Accordingly, Superi- or Court reversed the lower court’s order denying the petition to strike judgment and requiring payment of attorney fees.</p>

Husband and wife holding real property by the entireties may sever the estate during their lifetime only by joint acts, such as joint conveyance, divorce, or agreement. <em>Clingerman v.

Here, Jones and his estranged wife jointly conveyed their interest in the real estate and thereby severed the entireties estate. Jones’ complaint, both in the <em>DeCoatsworth </em>case and also in the <em>Alper </em>case, sought damages, not the restoration of his interest in the property. His suit was for an alleged injury personal to him, not to the entity which had formerly owned the real estate.</p>

Odessa relinquished her interest in the property in exchange for $1,000 as part of the same transaction in which it was determined that Jones was defrauded. If she has a claim at all, it would be related to Jones’ claim in that it arose from the same transaction.</p>

    <p id="b720-12" data-blocks='[["BL_720.11",720,[241,1406,1161,311]]]'>The third factor is whether Odessa’s right or interest is essential to the merits of the issue.

By the time DeCoatsworth filed his petition to strike judgment in 1990, the statute of limitations for fraud with respect to Odessa had expired. Odessa was barred from suit at that point and she could not, therefore, have been joined as a party. No due process rights of hers were jeopardized by failing to join her, since she had no remedy of action in any event.</p>
