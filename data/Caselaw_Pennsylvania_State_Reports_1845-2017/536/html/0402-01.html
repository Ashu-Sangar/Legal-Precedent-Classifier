The vast majority of photos offered by the prosecution were excluded from evidence. The few that were admitted served to provide the jury with a better understanding of the crime scene. They also exposed the exceedingly malicious manner in which the murders were committed. By allowing the jurors to gain insight into the full extent of the harm wrought, the jurors were placed in a better position to assess the nature and intent of the crime’s perpetrator. A jury can often best perform its function if it has not been unduly insulated from gaining a full understanding of the crime itself. The photos in the present case served to enhance that understanding.</p>

    <p id="b704-5" data-blocks='[["BL_704.5",704,[251,406,1164,421]]]'>The photos had additional evidentiary value in that there was a dispute regarding the weapons used against Tammy Mock. While the prosecution and defense agreed that many of her wounds had been inflicted with a knife, the defense contested the prosecution’s evidence that the claw end of a hammer had also been utilized. By seeing pictures of the wounds, the jury was better able to draw inferences about the weapons employed.</p>
    <p id="b704-6" data-blocks='[["BL_704.6",704,[250,851,1162,251]]]'>Our review of the record, and of the photos themselves, reveals that the trial court carefully exercised its discretion to limit the number and type of photos shown to the jury so as to minimize any possibility of prejudice to appellant.

    <p id="b704-7" data-blocks='[["BL_704.7",704,[251,1142,1161,476]]]'>Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecution to ask its expert witness, a forensic pathologist, to state the manner in which the victims died. The pathologist had already stated the causes of death, to wit, that Tammy Mock died of stab wounds and that Holly Jacobs drowned. When the prosecution attempted to elicit an opinion regarding the manner of death, however, the defense objected on the basis that the manner of death was for the jury rather than the expert to determine.</p>
    <p id="b704-8" data-blocks='[["BL_704.8",704,[250,1640,1161,693]],["BL_705.1",705,[211,290,1151,97]]]'>The jury was sent out of the courtroom, and the pathologist was questioned regarding his opinion. He stated that both deaths were “homicides” and that he was using the term “homicides” in a medical rather than legal sense, meaning only that the deaths were not self-inflicted. Defense counsel indicated that he did not object to testimony that Tammy Mock’s death was a homicide, but objected to testimony that the death of the infant, Holly Jacobs, was a homicide. The jury was then brought back to the courtroom and the expert testified that both of the victims’ deaths were, in a medical sense, homicides. To eliminate the possibility of any misunderstanding, he testified further that “[t]he medical definition of homicide is that the person could not have done it to himself or <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>herself and in order for this to have occurred it involves the intervention of another human being.”</p>
    <p id="b705-4" data-blocks='[["BL_705.5",705,[211,413,1154,366]]]'>To no extent did the expert indicate that homicides, in a legal sense, were involved. The expert’s testimony established only that the victims did not succumb to self-inflicted causes of death. This can only be taken to mean that Tammy Mock did not intentionally or accidentally stab herself 200 times, and that Holly Jacobs, the baby, did not commit suicide or accidentally climb into the bathtub and drown.</p>
    <p id="b705-5" data-blocks='[["BL_705.6",705,[207,805,1157,316]]]'>No prejudice could have accrued from this testimony. Appellant’s own testimony was that he fatally stabbed Tammy Mock. Hence, appellant did not take the position that Mock’s wounds were self-inflicted; the expert’s opinion that the wounds were not self-inflicted was therefore harmless to appellant’s case.</p>
    <p id="b705-6" data-blocks='[["BL_705.7",705,[205,1146,1158,693]]]'>Similarly, the expert’s opinion that Holly Jacobs’ death was not self-inflicted was consistent with appellant’s case. Appellant did not take the position that the baby committed suicide or that she drowned herself accidentally. Appellant testified at trial that he placed Holly into the tub of water and that Tammy Mock, who was already in the tub, drowned her. This testimony was, of course, inconsistent with the admission he made to his mother that he killed both victims. Nevertheless, whether appellant admitted that he drowned the baby or claimed that Tammy Mock did so instead, the fact remains that no one took the position that the baby inflicted her own drowning. Hence, the expert’s opinion that the baby’s death was not self-inflicted was harmless to appellant’s case.</p>
    <p id="b705-7" data-blocks='[["BL_705.8",705,[205,1864,1155,205]]]'>Further, during its charge to the jury, the court very clearly instructed that the expert’s opinion regarding homicide in a medical sense was not to be construed as an opinion regarding homicide in a legal sense.

He also stated that he had an appointment to see a doctor later that day. The court excused the juror with the requirement that the juror provide a note from his doctor after his appointment.

She testified that appellant told her that he killed Tammy <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>Mock. She also testified that she was “not quite sure” what appellant said regarding the baby, Holly Jacobs. Surprised by this claimed uncertainty, the prosecutor introduced as substantive evidence portions of two prior statements that Delois Jacobs had given. One was a transcript of a tape recorded statement given to the police. The other was testimony from appellant’s preliminary hearing. In these statements, Delois Jacobs said that appellant admitted during the telephone conversation that he killed both victims, and that, when asked why he killed the baby, appellant replied, “Mommy, because I didn’t want Tammy’s family to have her.”</p>

In short, the order in which the elements of a charge are set forth is not critical, so long as the charge as a whole fairly conveys the applicable principles of law.

The aggravating circumstances were that the murder was committed by means of torture, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(8), and that appellant had been <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>convicted of another murder committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(ll). The mitigating circumstances were that appellant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2), and that there was other evidence of mitigation concerning his character and record and the circumstances of his offense, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8).</p>
    <p id="b709-4" data-blocks='[["BL_709.5",709,[208,668,1158,944]]]'>The facts of this case clearly support the jury’s finding that the murder of Tammy Mock was committed by means of torture. We have defined torture, for purposes of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(8), as an intentional infliction of “a considerable amount of pain and suffering on the victim which is unnecessarily heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity.” <em>Commonwealth v. Thomas, </em><a href="/pa/522/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="522 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1818950" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0256-01">522 Pa. 256</a>, 277, <a href="/pa/522/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="522 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1818950" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0256-01">561 A.2d 699</a>, 709 (1989). Appellant inflicted numerous blunt force injuries on Mock in addition to more than 200 stab wounds. The wounds covered many areas of Mock’s body, including areas where no vital body parts were located. A substantial number of the stab wounds were shallow in depth and were positioned where they would not be expected to cause a rapid death, for example on Mock’s face, hands,• arms, shoulders, buttocks, etc. This, as well as the sheer number of wounds inflicted, provides ample basis for belief that appellant intentionally inflicted a considerable amount of pain and suffering and that his actions manifested exceptional depravity.</p>

The record, therefore, fully supports the jury’s findings as to aggravating circumstances. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3)(ii).</p>

We perceive no excess or disproportionality in the sentence imposed. Further, the record does not provide any basis for belief that the sentence was the “product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3)(i). Accordingly, the sentence of death, as well as the sentence of life imprisonment, must be affirmed.</p>
