When construing statutes under Pennsylvania law, it is assumed that the legislature does not intend a result which is absurd or unreasonable. <em>Zimmerman v. O’Bannon, </em><a href="/pa/497/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="497 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="1775346" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0551-01">497 Pa. 551</a>, 556, <a href="/pa/497/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="497 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="1775346" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0551-01">442 A.2d 674</a>, 677 (1982). The policy behind Pennsylvania product liability law is that a manufacturer of a defective product is subject to liability for injury caused as a result of that defect. <em>Webb v. Zern, </em><a href="/pa/422/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="422 Pa. 424" data-case-ids="1901701" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0424-01">422 Pa. 424</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=220%20A.2d%20853" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="220 A.2d 853">220 A.2d 853</a> (1966). This policy would be undermined if manufacturers of products were able to claim that the statute of repose relieves them of liability merely because their products somehow have become part of "improvements to realty." A manufacturer must make its product safe for its intended use and will not be insulated from liability merely because the purchaser of a defective product incorporated it into the design of a structure.</p>

The record reflects Appellants pleaded in their complaint that Appellee assisted in the design and planning of the construction of the roof trusses into the real property. Appellee denied participating in any of these activities in its answer to Appellants’ complaint. Then, Appellants provided affidavits with their Motion in Opposition to Summary Judgment stating that Appellee did not participate in any of the above-mentioned activities, in direct contradiction to the facts as pleaded in their complaint.</p>
      <p id="b398-8" data-blocks='[["BL_398.9",398,[249,1941,1127,390]]]'>The purpose for filing "supporting affidavits” pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1035(a) is to <em>support </em>allegations of fact which appear in the pleadings. Appellants cannot use affidavits in order to supply factual allegations essential to avoid the statute of repose which were omitted from the initial pleading. While Appellants can ask the court for permission to amend their pleadings to comport to the facts as stated in their affidavits, Appellants have not done so. Therefore, Appellants’ affidavits must be ignored at this time for summary judgment purposes and the determination of whether there is a disputed issue of material fact must be made on the basis of the pleadings alone.</p>
