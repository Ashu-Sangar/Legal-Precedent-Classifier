For this purpose, at least, an award of benefits for partial disability may be viewed as a “partial suspension” of benefits: the causal connection has been established, the employer’s liability for the injury has not terminated but the claimant’s earning power is such that benefits for total disability are not necessary, benefits for partial disability being sufficient.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> If a claimant whose benefits have been entirely suspended may have them reinstated on proof “that through no fault of his own his earning power is once again adversely affected” by the injury which gave rise to <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>his original claim, we can discern no basis for requiring a claimant who receives benefits for partial disability to prove more, i.e., that his physical condition due to his injury has worsened.</p>

We have reviewed the record and conclude that the referee’s findings that Dillon was able to perform sedentary work but that there was no work of this type available to him are supported by substantial evidence. The Board committed an error of law in reversing the award of compensation for total disability which was based on these findings.</p>

We recognize the possibility that unscrupulous employers or claimants could abuse the system by filing modification petitions with great frequency. The Act, however, provides that a party may seek modification "at any time". We can do no more to discourage vexatious litigation than enforce the Act by requiring the parly seeking the modification to prove what the statute defines as grounds for such: “that the disability ... has increased, decreased, recurred, or has temporarily or finally ceased....” As we observed in <em>Kachinski, </em>"[ojbviously the viability of this system depends on the good faith of the participants.” <a href="/pa/516/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="516 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="1808596" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0240-01">516 Pa. at 252</a>, <a href="/pa/516/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="516 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="1808596" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0240-01">532 A.2d at 380</a>.</p>

It is interesting to note that the Act itself accords a certain similarity of character to suspension of compensation and compensation for partial disability in the final proviso of section 413. “... And provided further, That where compensation has been suspended because the employe’s earnings are equal to or in excess of his wages prior to the injury that payments under the agreement or award may be resumed at any time during the period for which compensation for partial disability is payable, unless it be shown that the loss in earnings does not result from the disability due to the injury.” 77 P.S. § 772. Thus an employee who returns to work at wages equal to or greater than his pre-injury wages, and thus has his compensation suspended, is in the same position after 500 weeks, see 77 P.S. § 512, as an employee who returned to work at reduced wages and thus received compensation for partial disability, i.e., the employer’s liability for benefits is terminated.</p>
