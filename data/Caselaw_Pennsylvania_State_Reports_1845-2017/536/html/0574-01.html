The athletic program was, historically, overseen by an “athletic director.” The position of athletic director was voluntary and part-time in nature, and was occupied by a full-time teacher who was a member of the bargaining unit represented by the association. As the extracurricular activities offered by the district expand<a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>ed through the years, there developed a need for the athletic director to assume extracurricular responsibilities exceeding the bounds of athletics. Accordingly, the district issued a revised description for the position of “athletic director.” In response, the association filed a grievance challenging the new job description. An arbitrator sustained the grievance.</p>

The district informed the association that the position of athletic director had been eliminated and that Willard O’Neil would be the new assistant principal. Mr. O’Neil was a full-time elementary teacher who, until that time, had served also as the athletic director. He had applied for the new position, and voluntarily left his bargaining unit to assume his new responsibilities.</p>

This time it alleged that elimination of the position of athletic director resulted in a transfer of bargaining unit work to a non-bargaining unit employee in violation of the collective bargaining agreement. After a hearing, an arbitrator found the grievance arbitrable and sustained it on the merits. The district subsequently filed in the trial court an application to vacate the arbitration award, arguing that the subject matter of the dispute was not arbitrable and that the award should;, therefore, be vacated.</p>

The part-time position of athletic director for the District ,had been included in the collective bargaining agreement between Appellant and Appellee for at least eighteen years, and the part-time position had always been filled by a bargaining unit member. During the seven years prior to the beginning of the 1989-1990 school year, the position was filled by Mr. William O’Neil, an elementary school teacher and a bargaining unit member. When the 1989-1990 school year commenced, the Appellee School District assigned Mr. O’Neil to the newly created position of “Assistant Principal for Student and Supplemental Activities.” The new position was clearly supervisory in nature and thus the individual holding it could not continue to be a member of the bargaining unit. However, part of the job description for this new position was to “assume all the duties previously discharged by the part-time position known as athletic director.” (R., p. 171a).</p>

    <p id="b878-6" data-blocks='[["BL_878.7",878,[223,1238,1163,466]]]'>The collective bargaining agreement also contains Appendix B, a schedule of coaching salaries which lists the position of athletic director, and Appendix D which is addressed to “supplemental positions,” including those of “head coach/director/sponsor” of activities. The provisions of Appendix D to the collective bargaining agreement clearly state that qualified bargaining unit members have priority in selection for the supplemental positions, and that “established posting procedures will be used to fill vacancies.”</p>
    <p id="b878-7" data-blocks='[["BL_878.8",878,[221,1738,1160,196]]]'>Clearly, the position of athletic director is bargaining unit work. To transfer that work without an agreement between the parties explicitly violated the collective bargaining agreement.</p>

When a matter is arguably and reasonably within the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, as here, arbitrability is for the arbitrator.
