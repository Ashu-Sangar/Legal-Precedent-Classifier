On March 13, 1989 at about 8:00 p.m., Andrew Eric Huffman conspired with Eric Grier, to burglarize Grier’s place of employment, the Patterson Dump Truck Company. Grier occasionally lived at the Patterson Dump Truck Company site, in a room next to the victim, who also lived there. Grier had left a door to the office area unlocked the day of the murder. That evening, the conspirators walked together to the office area. One or both of the conspirators entered the office and beat the <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>victim about the head with an iron pry bar.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The conspirators took some telephones and a typewriter, left the Patterson Dump Truck Company site, sold the stolen items and bought drugs with the proceeds.

On March 14,1989 Edward Grier turned himself in. On April 13,1989, Appellant was arrested.</p>
