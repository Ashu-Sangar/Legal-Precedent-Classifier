On April 5, 1990, upon reporting to work at 11:00 p.m., Sergeant Bryan Lee Parana of the Johnsonburg Borough Police Department became involved in the investigation of the theft of a vehicle owned by Richard Wolfe. Wolfe had notified the police around 10:00 p.m. that he had left his keys in his truck, with the doors unlocked, and that his truck was not where he had parked it. Wolfe further stated that he left a pistol, containing a loaded clip, between the seats of the truck. At about 11:45 p.m., a radio call came in from the St. Mary’s Borough Police Department, indicating that a vehicle fitting the description of Wolfe’s truck had been located in a cemetery in St. Mary’s. Sergeant Parana arrived at the cemetery ten minutes later, determined that the truck was registered to Wolfe, and noticed that the pistol was not in the vehicle.</p>

Bullers entered the car in St. Mary’s at about 2:00 or 2:30 a.m., and he exited in Johnson-burg at about 2:45 or 3:00 a.m.</p>

Sergeant Parana knew Bullers from previous juvenile proceedings against him involving theft and improper use of vehicles. Bullers stopped upon Sergeant Parana’s second request, and the officer left his vehicle and approached Bullers in order to ask him questions regarding <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>the theft of Wolfe’s truck. After engaging Bullers in conversation, Sergeant Parana detected the odor of beer on his breath. Knowing from previous experience with Bullers that he was nineteen years old, the officer arrested him for underage drinking, 18 Pa.C.S. § 6308.</p>

A later search at the station revealed Wolfe’s loaded, holstered pistol hidden beneath Bullers’s jacket, inside his belt and against his back. Bullers had no license or permit to carry a concealed firearm.</p>

Following a bench trial on October 12, 1990, where it was determined that the other items found on Bullers were stolen from cars owned by Joan LeGrys, Herbert Straub, and Pattye Vollmer, Bullers was also found guilty of three counts each of theft by unlawful taking, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3921(a), and receiving stolen property, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3925(a).</p>

It appears from the Superior Court opinion that the only procedure available against one accused of underage drinking is to issue a citation. We are not convinced that this conclusion is accurate since it would render the words "making an arrest” in § 6308(d) meaningless, and would preclude an officer from obtaining a warrant and then arresting the individual for the violation. The precise issue before us today, however, is whether a <em>warrantless </em>arrest under the circumstances is invalid.</p>

The Commonwealth alternatively argues that if we find that no authority exists for the arrest, we should consider the admissibility of the evidence incident to a pat-down search conducted while taking Bullers into custody for purposes of notification. This claim is also meritless.

While the majority finds justification for its construction largely by going outside of the four corners of the statute, I prefer to stay within the limits of the language itself, and in this regard I have no difficulty in deciding that the authority to arrest exists in subsection (d) for a violation of subsection (a). For all of its broad analysis, the majority opinion fails to <em>explain </em>the meaning of “making an arrest” for a suspected violator of subsection (a) by simply <em>ignoring </em>the words altogether or rolling them into the language of other types of statutes (theft, domestic violence, vehicle code).</p>

The terms of the statute under subsection (d) also authorizes a warrantless arrest, assuming probable cause. The words “arrest for a suspected violation of subsection (a)” must have meaning manifesting legislative intent.</p>
