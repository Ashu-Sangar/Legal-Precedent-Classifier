DER’s regulatory activity and authority may be affected by an adju<a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>dication of this lawsuit. Third, we must ask whether DER’s interest is essential to the merits of the issue. Because DER’s regulatory activity may be affected by any order entered in this case, and because compliance with that order may require the cooperation of DER, its interest is essential. Finally there is the question of whether justice can be afforded in the absence of DER. If DER were not party to this suit, it may withhold permits necessary to carry out remedies which may be ordered or it may seek to commence a multiplicity of actions in which the same or related matters are at issue. We regard this as more than speculation, given DER’s insistence in its brief that a court is powerless to order certain of the relief sought and any adjudication of this case will not affect its rights.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In this posture, it seems likely that DER would not cooperate in the carrying out of any judicial remedy which it might perceive as usurping its authority.
