Jurisdiction in this case is noted pursuant to section 722(7) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 722(7), which mandates a direct appeal to this Court whenever the Court of Common Pleas holds a statute of this Commonwealth invalid as repugnant to the Pennsylvania Constitution. The issue presented for review is whether the separation of powers doctrine permits the General Assembly to pass an administrative regulation requiring every person placed on probation to pay a supervisory fee as a part of their probation order. For the reasons that follow, we find that the regulation is not violative of the separation of powers doctrine and, therefore, reverse the Order of the Court of Common Pleas.</p>

Like many other judgments, interlocutory in character, from which an appeal is allowed ... the defendant is not <em>obliged </em>to appeal until a final judgment — which in criminal cases is the sentence — is entered.”</blockquote>

The trial judge below mistakenly relied upon the notion that the judgment of sentence was final because the appeal period had passed. This was incorrect because “a judgment of sentence may never be imposed on a criminal defendant who is placed on probation----” <em>Commonwealth v. Gilmore, </em><a href="/pa/465/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="465 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="1712660" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0202-01">465 Pa. 202</a>, 205, <a href="/pa/465/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="465 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="1712660" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0202-01">348 A.2d 425</a>, 427 (1975). In the instant case, Appellees would not be sentenced unless they violated a condition of their probation, at which time they would be given a hearing. If there is a judicial determination that a probation violation has occurred, a sentence may be imposed and judgment at that point becomes final. That has not occurred here; there can be no finality based on the entry of the order of probation.</p>

As such, “[t]he court may at any time ... lessen or increase the conditions upon which an order of probation has been imposed.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9771(a).

The fee in this case is analogous to the imposition of costs in a criminal proceeding. The imposition of costs in a criminal case is not part of the sentence, but rather is incident to the judgment. <em>Commonwealth v. Cauffiel, </em><a href="/pa-super/97/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="97 Pa.

The conditions of probation may therefore be modified as necessary to accommodate the needs of the court, the supervising agency, and the probationer.</p>
