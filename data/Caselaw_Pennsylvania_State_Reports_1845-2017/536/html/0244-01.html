It is this testimony which provides the essential facts from which we must decide if an inference can be drawn that Martin Chmiel was an accomplice.</p>
    <p id="b549-4" data-blocks='[["BL_549.5",549,[209,596,1156,694]]]'>Martin Chmiel’s testimony reveals his own involvement in the events leading to the triple homicide. By his own admission, Martin Chmiel identified the Lunario home as the source for fast money. Martin Chmiel’s intention to pursue the resulting criminal activity is clear from him making plans to rob the house in Throop. The extent of his commitment to these plans is evidenced by his use of the sleeves from his old brown sweater to fashion masks which were used in this criminal enterprise. Although he testified that he changed his mind about participating in the robbery, Martin Chmiel told Appellant what the Lunarios’ house looked like, how to get to Victor Lunario’s bedroom, and where in that bedroom the money was hidden.</p>
    <p id="b549-5" data-blocks='[["BL_549.6",549,[209,1317,1158,368]]]'>Equally clear from his testimony is the fact that Martin Chmiel falls within none of the exceptions to the definition of an accomplice as set forth in 18 Pa.C.S. § 306(f). Although he allegedly terminated his complicity prior to the commission of the offenses, at no time did he deprive it of effectiveness in the commission of the offenses, attempt to prevent the crime, alert the police, or warn the intended victims.</p>

Nevertheless, the Commonwealth contends that it was Appellant’s trial strategy not to use an accomplice testimony instruction, which would have also implicated Appellant, but instead to suggest to the jury that Martin Chmiel was the sole perpetrator of these crimes. Such an assertion is not borne out by the record which indicates that Appellant’s trial counsel argued that these crimes were committed by two <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>actors, one of whom was Martin Chmiel. For this reason, there was no reasonable basis for prior counsel’s failure to request an accomplice testimony instruction from the trial court. Finally, we conclude that such error was prejudicial to Appellant because, if given, the jurors might well have concluded, under proper instructions, that Martin Chmiel was an accomplice whose testimony was of little value. <em>See Commonwealth v.
