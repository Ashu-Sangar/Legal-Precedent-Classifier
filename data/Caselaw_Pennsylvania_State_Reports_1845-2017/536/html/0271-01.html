    <p id="b573-7" data-blocks='[["BL_573.7",573,[190,1005,1157,478]]]'>Appellant, Frederick E. Mayhue, was convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree on January 6,1988. Following this verdict, a sentencing hearing was held on January 7, 1988, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711. At the close of the hearing, the jury unanimously imposed a sentence of death. In reaching this decision, the jury found the aggravating circumstance of “contract to kill for pay” outweighed any mitigating circumstances. The trial court then filed an order sentencing appellant to death on January 8, 1988.</p>

The victim’s skull was broken. Dr. Leon Rozin, who performed the autopsy, testified that these injuries were consistent with blows from a baseball bat or similar object. (Trial Transcript (T.T.) 12/10-15/87 at 238). Dr. Rozin also noted that the victim’s neck bone was fractured. (T.T. at 242). In addition, the autopsy revealed that Mrs. Mayhue had been shot between the eyes and in the left temple. Two .25 automatic caliber bullets were found in the victim’s head. According to Dr. Rozin, the minimal hemorrhaging along the tracks of these bullets indicated that the victim had still been alive at the time she was shot. (T.T. 12/10-15/87 at 241). Dr. Rozin determined the cause of death to be trauma to the head. Based upon his examination of the body, he was of the opinion that the victim had first been beaten, then strangled, and finally shot. (T.T. 12/10-15/87 at 246).</p>
    <p id="b574-5" data-blocks='[["BL_574.5",574,[260,1277,1162,523]]]'>The chain of events that culminated in this brutal murder began in August of 1981, when the victim filed for divorce from appellant. Due to extensive litigation regarding tax liabilities and business holdings, however, the divorce had still not been finalized at the time of the victim’s death. These bitter and protracted proceedings resulted in appellant’s harboring an extreme animosity toward Mrs. Mayhue and her boyfriend, Barry Carle, appellant’s former financial advisor, with whom Mrs. Mayhue became romantically involved in December, 1981.</p>
    <p id="b574-6" data-blocks='[["BL_574.6",574,[260,1823,1160,419]]]'>At the time of her murder, Mrs. Mayhue was residing at what had been the family residence, an 18 acre horse farm on Sunflower Road (Route 68) in Daugherty Township, Beaver County. Barry Carle frequently stayed there as well. In addition, due to past abuse, Mrs. Mayhue had secured a court order prohibiting appellant from entering the property. Appellant, meanwhile, was living in a condominium in another part of Beaver County.</p>

She was driving a 1984 Oldsmobile belonging to Barry Carle. Appellant had called Debbie at about 9:00 p.m., and had been informed by Debbie that her mother was at the party. Appellant stated that he was at his parents’ house processing a deer, and would be unable to attend.</p>
    <p id="b575-5" data-blocks='[["BL_575.5",575,[214,701,1154,533]]]'>At approximately 1:30 a.m. on the morning of December 16th, Barry Carle telephoned the Meyer residence seeking Mrs. Mayhue, who was not at home when he arrived there at 12:45 a.m. Knowing that the trip from Debbie’s home in New Galilee, Pa. to Mrs. Mayhue’s home on Sunflower Road typically took twenty-five to thirty minutes, Debbie’s husband, Jeff Meyer, and Mr. Carle decided to drive along the route usually taken by Mrs. Mayhue in case her car had broken down or she had been in an accident. After this search proved to be of no avail they called the state police.</p>
    <p id="b575-6" data-blocks='[["BL_575.6",575,[212,1260,1155,479]]]'>At approximately 2:45 a.m., David Kisow arrived at his home in Allegheny County accompanied by Donald Meerdo. The two men had been Christmas shopping earlier in the evening and had subsequently stopped at a local bar. Upon their arrival at Kisow’s house, they noticed a strange car, later identified as Barry Carle’s Oldsmobile, backed against Kisow’s garage door with the keys in the ignition. After removing the keys, Kisow and Meerdo opened the trunk and found the body of Harlene Mayhue.</p>
    <p id="b575-7" data-blocks='[["BL_575.7",575,[210,1765,1154,256]]]'>Upon making this discovery, Meerdo wanted to call the police. Kisow, however, urged him not to stating that, “if he didn’t get rid of the car he’d be dead”. Despite Kisow’s requests, Meerdo called the police. This call was logged in by the Findlay Township Police at 2:59 a.m.</p>

Upon their arrival, the detectives examined the trunk of the car. There they observed the body of a white female, her severely beaten face pointing toward the trunk opening. The victim’s head <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>was partially wrapped in a white scarf, which appeared to have a bullet hole in it, but due to the victim’s extensive facial injuries, the detectives were unable to determine if she had been shot. Two spent .25 automatic caliber shellcasings were later found beside the vehicle. A bloody baseball bat was lying between the victim’s legs. After the victim’s driver’s license was found, the police were able to make an initial identification of the victim as Harlene Mayhue.</p>
    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.5",576,[239,746,1159,257]]]'>When interviewed by the police, David Kisow initially denied having any knowledge concerning the murder.

Since 1981, Kisow had been traveling to Colorado to perform construction work, returning to Pennsylvania each year from December through April. According to Kisow, upon his return in 1981 appellant had approached him and asked if Kisow would chop up a car for him. Kisow stated that he would. This favor was to be payment for the proceeds of a cocaine sale made by Kisow for appellant in 1980/81, which had been stolen from Ksow’s house before the money could be given to appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Ksow testified that upon his return to Pennsylvania in 1982, appellant’s request changed to whether Ksow would mind chopping up a car-if it had a body in it. (T.T. at 89). Appellant then repeated this request each time Ksow returned home from 1982-1986. Upon Ksow’s return in September, appellant paid him a visit and asked him if he had <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>thought about their deal. (T.T. at 92-93). Kisow, however, was in a hurry and did not answer. Kisow stated that he next heard from appellant a few weeks later when appellant called and told him not to be surprised if he found a car in his driveway. (T.T. at 95). As previously indicated, Kisow subsequently found a car in his driveway on the morning of December 16th when he and Donald Meerdo made their gruesome discovery.</p>
    <p id="b577-4" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[199,749,1156,739]]]'>After finding Mrs. Mayhue’s body, the police proceeded to her residence on Sunflower Road. There they discovered patches of blood in the driveway near the entrance to the garage. The blood had been covered with gravel and leaves in an apparent attempt to conceal it. In addition, the officer’s found two buttons from the victim’s coat and one of her gold earrings near one of the house’s window wells. Although police originally believed Mrs. Mayhue had been killed at her home in Beaver County, the discovery of the two spent cartridges at the Kisow residence coupled with the coroner’s determination that the victim was still alive at the time she was shot, caused them to conclude that the death had actually occurred at the Kisow residence in Allegheny County after Mrs. Mayhue had been beaten and abducted at her home.</p>
    <p id="b577-5" data-blocks='[["BL_577.6",577,[199,1509,1158,258]]]'>Appellant was interviewed by the police on the morning of December 16th.

(T.T. at 161,735).</p>

Hardin was the elected police/public safety commissioner for Rochester Township. He was also a very good friend of appellant’s. When Zarillo arrived at Hardin’s home, he observed Hardin speaking with an individual named Steve Gavura. Hardin concluded his conversation with Gavura and approached Zarillo, stating that he had just learned of the murder from Gavura. Hardin also said that he would probably become involved in the investigation since he had been <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>with appellant the previous evening. According to Hardin, appellant had called him on the evening of the 15th to ask for a ride home. Hardin said he had picked appellant up, taken him home, and stayed with him until 12:30 a.m. While at appellant’s residence, they had watched Monday Night Football and drunk a few beers. Zarillo relayed this information to the investigating officers. A few days later Hardin told Zarillo that Mrs. Mayhue had died at 2:00 a.m. Information regarding the victim’s time of death, however, had yet to be released. Zarillo again relayed this information to the investigating officers.</p>
    <p id="b578-5" data-blocks='[["BL_578.5",578,[250,907,1163,520]]]'>After speaking to Zarillo, Troopers Schneeman and Veil of the Pennsylvania State Police arranged to interview Hardin on the evening of December 16th. Hardin told the troopers that on the evening of the 15th, after babysitting until 10:00 p.m., he had driven appellant home, had watched television with him, and had returned to his own home at 1:00 a.m. At trial, Trooper Schneeman testified that Hardin was nervous throughout the interview. Although the troopers knew Hardin’s statement was inconsistent with that of appellant, they did not confront Hardin with this inconsistency.</p>
    <p id="b578-6" data-blocks='[["BL_578.6",578,[248,1451,1164,683]]]'>Investigators subsequently learned from Officer Terry Johnke of the Rochester Township Police that after concluding an investigation with the Game Commission on the evening of the 15th, Johnke returned to Rochester Township Police Station between 8:30 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. Johnke testified at trial that when he arrived at the station, Hardin was there, and announced to Johnke that he was expecting a visitor; when the man arrived, Hardin wanted Johnke to leave. Approximately twenty-five minutes later, appellant walked into the station. Johnke stated he knew appellant from a prior occasion and said hello. Johnke left the station about five minutes later, per Hardin’s request. When he returned to the station after 11:00 p.m., no one was there.</p>

At that meeting, which also occurred at the police station, Hardin told Johnke that he had been at appellant’s house on December 15th watching football, and <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>that appellant was using him as an alibi. Hardin asked Johnke if he remembered Hardin’s telling him on the 15th that he and appellant were going to watch football. In addition, Hardin asked Johnke to verify that he (Hardin) had been in the station at 10:30 p.m. on the evening of the 15th. Hardin again stated that a man was coming to the station and requested that Johnke leave. Johnke testified that he left the station when appellant arrived shortly thereafter.</p>

After seeing a television news report concerning the murder, Shackleford told a fellow inmate, Alphonso Pittrel, that he knew appellant and had had some dealings with him concerning his wife. Pittrel relayed this information to the warden who in turn contacted the police. The police then arranged to interview Shackleford.</p>
    <p id="b579-6" data-blocks='[["BL_579.7",579,[241,1320,1154,206]]]'>After a series of denials, Shackleford admitted to police that appellant had solicited him to kill Harlene Mayhue, but that his attempts had been unsuccessful. At trial, Shackleford described appellant’s efforts to have his wife killed.</p>
    <p id="b579-7" data-blocks='[["BL_579.8",579,[234,1566,1159,791]]]'>Shackleford testified that he first met appellant in the Beaver County Jail when appellant was incarcerated on contempt charges in 1985. After both men were released, they chanced to meet on the street. During the course of their conversation, appellant offered Shackleford $10,000 dollars and a pound of high grade cocaine to kill his wife. (T.T. at 560-61). The two men also discussed three possible plans for carrying out the murder. One plan included bludgeoning Mrs. Mayhue to death with a baseball bat. Another involved shooting the victim in the head, while a third involved arranging the murder to look as if it had occurred during the course of a robbery. (T.T. at 562). In addition, appellant assured Shackleford that he knew judges and lawyers who could help him if anything went wrong. The two men exchanged phone numbers.</p>
    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.4",580,[217,314,1166,995]]]'>
      <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>Appellant and Shackleford began meeting on a regular basis. According to Shackleford, however, he did not plan on killing appellant’s wife but wanted to see what he could get out of appellant. Specifically, Shackleford thought that if he appeared to go along with the scheme, appellant would give him a job. Shackleford was able to obtain an initial payment of $500 from appellant after Shackleford told him that he needed certain equipment before he could go to the victim’s residence. Appellant later gave Shackleford another $700 to buy a gun and a ten speed bike,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and a half-gram of the “high grade” cocaine appellant had previously offered Shackleford so that Shackleford could test its quality. Following these payments, appellant gave Shackleford a .22 caliber pistol, which they had practiced shooting at a local gun range. This gun was to be used by Shackleford to kill Mrs. Mayhue. Shackle-ford, however, gave the gun to a friend, Sylvestor Waters. Waters then attempted to sell the gun, but was arrested for possessing a firearm as an ex-convict. The gun was then confiscated.</p>
    <p id="b580-5" data-blocks='[["BL_580.5",580,[214,1341,1162,793]]]'>Once the two men began to meet regularly, appellant took Shackleford to the victim’s residence four or five times. On one of these occasions, the two were accompanied by James Hardin. According to Shackleford, appellant and Hardin picked him up and drove to a country road near the victim’s residence. Appellant, who was dressed in camouflage clothing, then led Shackleford through the woods to Mrs. Mayhue’s home. Once there, appellant identified the various buildings on the property for Shackleford, and described the intended victim. The two fled when a truck arrived at the property. Appellant then contacted Hardin on a walkie talkie to come and pick them up. On the ride back to Shackleford’s home, appellant and Hardin decided that Shackleford could find his way through the woods, and that the back road would be the drop off point when the time came to kill Mrs. Mayhue.</p>
    <p id="b580-6" data-blocks='[["BL_580.6",580,[218,2154,1156,91]],["BL_581.1",581,[204,305,1158,961]]]'>On three occasions after this incident, appellant called Shackleford and told him that Hardin would drive him to the <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>road behind the victim’s residence so he could kill Mrs. Mayhue. After each call Hardin picked Shackleford up. On each of these occasions, however, Shackleford failed to commit the murder. On the first occasion, Shackleford merely wandered in the woods after Hardin dropped him off at the appointed spot. He later told appellant that he had been unable to find his way to the victim’s residence. Following this botched attempt, appellant placed reflector tags on the trees to insure Shackleford could find his way. Hardin then drove Shackleford to the appointed spot once again. This time Shackleford followed the reflectors to the Mayhue property. Once there, however, he merely sat and watched the horses and again returned home without committing the murder. On the third occasion, Shackleford told Hardin that he didn’t feel like killing the victim that evening, and asked Hardin to tell appellant that they had gone to the victim’s property but were unable to commit the deed. Hardin agreed and the two went to dinner at the Red Bull Inn.</p>
    <p id="b581-4" data-blocks='[["BL_581.5",581,[203,1300,1157,259]]]'>Following these unsuccessful attempts, appellant apparently changed his plan as to how the murder should be carried out. Appellant told Shackleford that he could kill Mrs. Mayhue, put her body in her car, and drive it to Kisow’s residence, where the car would be chopped up and the body disposed of.</p>
    <p id="b581-5" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[201,1586,1156,413]]]'>Having by now realized that appellant could not be persuaded to forgo any plans to kill his wife, Shackleford took it upon himself to warn Mrs. Mayhue of appellant’s plot to have her killed. On June 10, 1986, he called Mrs. Mayhue from a residence in Ambridge, and, without identifying himself, told her that her life was in danger and that she should be careful.

McCarthy suggested that Lau make it look like a robbery, and either hit the victim with a baseball bat, stab her, or strangle her. McCarthy explained that if Lau hit her in the head with a baseball bat it would be just like hitting a watermelon. McCarthy also assured Lau that if he were caught, everything would be taken care of because they knew people in Beaver County.

Following the murder, the robbery charges against the defendant proceeded despite the death of the witness. In June 1979, at the close of the Commonwealth’s evidence, the defendant fled from justice. The trial, however, continued in the defendant’s absence and he was found guilty of robbery. While at large, the defendant began threatening the Assistant District Attorney who had obtained his conviction and who was directing the search for the defendant.

At issue was the admission of inculpatory statements made by the defendant, who was in the York County Jail awaiting trial on the murder charges against him, to an informant, whom the District Attorney’s Office had allowed to remained unsentenced in the County jail for three years due to his propensity for obtaining confessions from other inmates. No formal agreement, however, had ever been made between the informant, known as the “monsignor,” and the District Attorney’s Office. We subsequently held the statements to be inadmissible. In doing so we concluded that the informant was a <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>Commonwealth agent due to the “implied understanding” that he would not be sentenced for his conviction for third degree murder, so long as he continued to obtain confessions.

In <em>Kuhlmann, </em>the police placed an informant, who had previously agreed to listen to the defendant’s conversations and report his remarks to the police, in the same prison cell as the defendant following the defendant’s arraignment on robbery and murder charges. The informant had been specifically instructed not to ask any questions of the defendant, and did not do so. When the defendant first discussed his participation in the crime, however, the informant had remarked that the defendant’s explanation for his presence at the crime scene, “didn’t sound too good.” The defendant later admitted the crime to the informant. The court held that the defendant’s right to counsel had not been violated by the incident. In doing so, it first noted that a defendant does not make out a violation of that right simply by showing that an informant, either through prior arrangement or voluntarily, reported his incriminating statements to police. Rather, the defendant must demonstrate that the police and their informant took some action beyond mere listening that was designed deliberately to elicit incriminating remarks. The Court then concluded that the informant’s actions did not constitute deliberate elicitation since the informant had merely listened to the defendant’s “spontaneous” and “unsolicited” statements.</p>

It is well established that whenever a court construes one section of a statute, it must read that section not by itself, but with reference to, and in light of, the other sections. <em>Consulting Engineers of Pa. v. State Architects Licensure Board, </em><a href="/pa/522/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="522 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="1818965" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0204-01">522 Pa. 204</a>, <a href="/pa/522/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="522 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="1818965" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0204-01">560 A.2d 1375</a> (1989). In the present case, the “plain meaning” argument put forth by the Commonwealth fails to undertake such a reading. Examination of the remaining fifteen aggravating circumstances listed under § 9711(d) reveals that each concerns a circumstance arising from or surrounding the actual transaction which resulted in the victim’s death, i.e., the killing act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> In light of this fact we find it <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>doubtful that the legislature intended § 9711(d)(2) to be the only circumstance which could arise completely independently of the killing of the victim. Rather, we find the requirement of a causal link between the contract to kill and the death of the victim is clearly mandated by a contextual interpretation of § 9711(d)(2).</p>
    <p id="b605-5" data-blocks='[["BL_605.9",605,[183,655,1158,588]]]'>Finally, we find that a requirement of causation under § 9711(d)(2) is in accord with the well established principle that causation constitutes an essential element of the offense of murder which the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and which “cannot be established in the criminal context on a ‘but for’ or civil law proximate cause basis.” <em>Hackett, </em>534 Pa. at 225, 627 A.2d at 727 (Justice Cappy concurring) (citing Burkoff, <em>Criminal Offenses and Defenses in Pa.
