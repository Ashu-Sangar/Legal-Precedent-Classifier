The prosecutor then drew a comparison between Appellant and a runaway locomotive, a runaway automobile, and a raging forest fire. The importance of this comparison in his argument was that there exists a mechanism to correct the problem, and in this instance, the only way to prevent the Appellant from killing again was to impose the death penalty.
