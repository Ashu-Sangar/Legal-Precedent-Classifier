Consol had previously acquired the rights to coal <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>under the Willisons’ land. Consol acquired the oil and gas lease for the purpose of plugging the well, to allow the extraction of valuable coal which would otherwise have had to remain in place to provide physical support for the operating well. Consol promptly gave the Willisons notice of its intent to plug the well and remove related equipment. The well was still producing natural gas, but not in large quantities. Some of the gas was being used on-site by the Willisons, since the lease entitled them to use the gas, without charge, for domestic purposes.</p>

It held that the lease permitted Consol to remove its equipment if there had been a failure of gas production, but that it did not permit the abandonment of a producing well. In reaching this result, the court relied on a number of treatises on oil and gas law. E.g., Kuntz, Law of Oil &amp; Gas § 50.3(c) (1972); Williams, Oil &amp; Gas Law § 674.2 (1988). Those treatises, and the cases cited therein, favor imposing limits on the effect of clauses which provide that termination may occur “at any time,” so as to further the extent to which lessors and operators continue to share in the profits from production. The trial court surmised that the purpose of the lease was to share in these profits for as long <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>as possible. The court relied upon what it perceived to be an implied covenant, derived from decisions in other states, that requires a lessee to continue to operate a well as long as it is profitable to do so. E.g., <em>Okmulgee Supply Corp. v. Anthis, </em><a href="/okla/189/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="189 Okla. 139" data-case-ids="8892092" data-case-paths="/okla/189/0139-01">189 Okla. 139</a>, <a href="/okla/189/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="189 Okla. 139" data-case-ids="8892092" data-case-paths="/okla/189/0139-01">114 P.2d 451</a> (1940).</p>

Pennsylvania authority concerning the discontinuance and removal of oil and gas production facilities, <em>during </em>the terms of applicable leases, is scarce. In the <em>Black </em>and <em>Shellar </em>decisions there is dictum indicating that a lease provision that equipment can be removed “at any time” should be given effect to allow a lessee to remove equipment, during the term of the lease, without restriction. <em>Black v.

My review of the lease leads me to conclude that Consol must operate the well until it is no longer profitable to do so. Therefore, as the question of the well’s profitability is a genuine issue of material fact, the grant of Willisons’ motion for summary judgement was improper.
