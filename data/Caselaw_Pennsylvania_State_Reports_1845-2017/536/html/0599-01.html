Appellant then drove the victim’s car to Bonnie Sue Pflugler’s residence in Allentown.

They then drove to an area known as the 27th Street Extension located in the Borough of Northampton where the victim was removed from the trunk of his car and his nude body was buried under a pile of brush.</p>

The defense then filed supplemental post-trial motions arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>the Commonwealth’s failure to disclose Moser’s statements.

The Commonwealth did so based solely on circumstantial evidence and inferences. No murder weapon was ever located and while appellant’s fingerprints were found on items located inside the victim’s apartment as well as in his automobile, Pflugler’s prints were also discovered in the victim’s vehicle. As the Commonwealth’s closing argument at guilt phase amply demonstrates, it was the Commonwealth’s objective to have the jury believe that appellant, and not his co-conspirator, actually shot Officer Bowser by referencing the facts that the victim was of a heavy build; that appellant was much bigger than Pflugler; and that he lifted weights and thus was the only one of the two who was strong enough to move a person the size of the victim. The Commonwealth argued this even though there was no evidence suggesting that the victim was shot or killed before having been transferred in the trunk of his car. Alternatively, the Commonwealth argued to the jury that it could find appellant guilty of murder of the first degree even if they did not conclude that he was the actual shooter on the <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>basis that he and Pflugler shared guilt under the law for each other’s actions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

First, Moser’s statements to the police in no way implicated appellant in the murder. Instead, they implicated only Pflugler. Moreover, knowledge of Pflugler’s statement to Moser certainly would have opened another avenue of investigation for the defense that may well have led to further exculpatory evidence. Had the defense been aware of Moser’s statements, it may also have altered its trial strategy, especially in regards to appellant’s decision not to testify since Moser’s statements were consistent with appellant’s own statements to the police.</p>
    <p id="b902-5" data-blocks='[["BL_902.6",902,[233,1030,1161,584]]]'>The omitted evidence was also clearly relevant and material to the issue of appellant’s punishment. It is beyond peradventure that the statements of Moser would have provided the defense with strong evidence of mitigation. During the penalty phase, the Commonwealth incorporated all the evidence from guilt phase and argued therefrom that the evidence showed that appellant alone shot Officer Bowser twice in the head and that appellant alone transported Officer Bowser in the trunk of his car to a secluded area and executed him. Again, the Commonwealth argued this without any direct evidence in support thereof.</p>

The trial court then concluded that the statement given by Moser would not be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule as a declaration against penal interest because it was not given under reliable circumstances. We do not agree that <em>Brady </em>requires that the omitted evidence be admissible before it can be deemed material.</p>
    <p id="b903-4" data-blocks='[["BL_903.5",903,[195,714,1158,1010]]]'>In <em>Brady, </em>as here, the evidence withheld by the prosecution was a statement made by the co-defendant admitting the actual homicide. Contrary to the statement at issue here, however, the undisclosed confession in <em>Brady </em>clearly implicated Brady as also wanting to kill the victim. Specifically, the undisclosed confession contained statements to the effect that while both Brady and his co-defendant wanted to kill the victim, they disagreed on the manner for so doing. Because Brady had admitted at trial his participation in the murder, claiming only that he did not do the actual shooting, the Court there correctly held that the omitted evidence would not have reduced Brady’s offense below first degree murder since that evidence did not absolve the defendant of criminal liability for the murder and was, therefore, significant only as to the punishment of Brady. Thus, it is clear that the holding in <em>Brady </em>as to the admissibility of the evidence was based solely upon the precise facts of that case and in no way mandates that the evidence first be admissible before it can be deemed “material” to the defense.</p>
