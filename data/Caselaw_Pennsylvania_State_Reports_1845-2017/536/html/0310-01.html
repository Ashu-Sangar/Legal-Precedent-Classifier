    <p id="b608-5" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[232,432,1164,739]]]'>On May 31, 1990, an evidentiary hearing was conducted before an Administrative Law Judge, where an enforcement officer testified that at approximately 9:40 p.m. on Thursday, September 28, 1989, he entered Appellant’s establishment and seated himself across from the bar to observe the patrons. The officer further testified that at approximately 10:20 p.m., he observed a patron at the bar drinking a bottle of beer who exhibited a fixed stare into space and who had impaired hand and eye coordination which was manifested by his knocking over the beer he was drinking. This patron staggered as he walked and slurred incoherently as he tried to order a six-pack of beer. At 10:30 p.m., the patron was served the six-pack, which he placed on the floor and was also served another beer to drink at the bar.</p>
    <p id="b608-6" data-blocks='[["BL_608.6",608,[232,1204,1160,530]]]'>Within five minutes, this same patron complained that someone took his six pack (which lay at his feet) and ordered another six-pack of beer which was also served to him. The patron seated at the next bar-stool picked up the first six-pack and placed it on the bar in front of the male patron as he was finishing his beer. He then tried to get off his chair with his two six-packs, showing little balance or coordination. Before he staggered out of the bar, the .barmaid was heard to ask this patron “Can you make it out all right?” and the patron responded, “Full steam ahead.”</p>
    <p id="b608-7" data-blocks='[["BL_608.7",608,[233,1758,1160,471]]]'>The barmaid did not recall the episode. The Administrative Law Judge found the Enforcement Officer’s testimony to be credible and that it established a violation of the proscription against serving visibly intoxicated patrons, embodied in Section 493(1) of the Liquor Code, 47 P.S. § 4-493(1), and imposed a $500.00 fine. An appeal followed to the Liquor Control Board, which, finding substantial evidence to support the findings of the Administrative Law Judge, affirmed his order.</p>

The court reasoned that as its review of this matter, under Section 471 of the Code, 47 P.S. § 4-471, was <em>de novo, </em>it required the Commonwealth to present something more than the record of the proceedings taken before the Administrative Law Judge and Board to establish a case against Appellant.</p>

Applying that standard, the Commonwealth Court found the Administrative Law Judge’s decision to be supported by substantial evidence and without error of law or discretion. Accordingly, it reversed the order of the Court of Common Pleas and ordered the reinstatement of the fine against Appellant. <em>Pennsylvania State Police, Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement v.

The trial court apparently felt that the Commonwealth had to retry the case in its entirety rather than relying upon the record created before the Administrative Law Judge. This was error. The trial court has the duty of receiving the record of the proceedings below, if introduced in evidence, together with any other evidence that is properly received, and then make its own findings of fact, conclusions of law and assess the appropriate penalty, if any.</p>
