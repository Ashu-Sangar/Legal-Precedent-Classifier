In both <em>Ludwig </em>and <em>Lohman, </em>we held that the use of closed circuit television to transmit the testimony of a witness violated Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. However, neither of those appeals <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>addressed the constitutionality of 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 5984 or 5985(a) since both sections were adopted subsequent to the trials in <em>Ludwig </em>and <em>Lohman. </em>This appeal presents us with the opportunity to address specifically the constitutionality of both provisions. Because we find that §§ 5984 and 5985(a) fail to limit the use of video tape in closed circuit television to those instances in which the accused’s right to face to face confrontation has been otherwise satisfied, we must hold both provisions unconstitutional. Subjective fears of the witness, without more, are insufficient to restrict the accused’s constitutional right to confront a witness face to face. Furthermore, in light of our disposition of the constitutional issue requiring a new trial for the Appellees, we must address the issue raised by the Commonwealth regarding the suppression of the tapes recorded from the residence adjacent to Appellees’ residence.</p>

At the time of certification, wife resided with her Appellee-husband, Larry E. Louden, Sr. (hereinafter referred to as husband), in one-half of a double house with a common party wall. The husband’s mother and step-father (Kuloviches) resided in the other half of the double house. Because Mrs. Kulovich was ill, husband’s sister, Carol Wolfe, frequented the Kulovich home daily. Beginning in July of 1986, while visiting the Kulovich home, Ms. Wolfe began hearing, from the adjoining house, adults using obscene language, directing obscenities at particular children, and arguing over explicit sexual issues. Furthermore, Ms. Wolfe would hear threats being made at the children followed by smacking noises and children crying and screaming. At some undetermined point of time, the children who attended the Appellees’ day care center began to misbehave and to act violently. Children also became clingy and withdrawn, and extremely wary of adult males. Some children also experienced nightmares.</p>

Because Ms. Wolfe was advised that no action could be taken against the Appellees unless parents complained or a child was hurt, Ms. Wolfe decided to use a tape player to obtain additional evidence which would substantiate her complaints. As such, she placed her tape recorder in the hallway of her mother’s home on those occasions when she heard activity which caused her to become concerned for the welfare of the children attending Appellees’ day care center.</p>

Prior to the Appellees opening their day care center, Ms. Wolfe would hear loud and explicitly sexual arguments between the Appellees. This did not concern Ms. Wolfe because she believed the arguing was the Appellees’ problem and did not impact upon her. However, after Appellees opened their day care center, Ms. Wolfe believed the continuing arguing in front of small children changed her attitude towards those arguments. At this point, she testified that she contacted a representative of a Commonwealth licensing department in Harrisburg, as well as several police officers of the North Cornwall Township Police Department. Ms. Wolfe testified that she was advised that any investigation could not be started unless parents complained or a child was injured. Therefore, Ms. Wolfe embarked on her own course of action to obtain evidence to convince the proper authorities that the Appellees were committing harmful acts with regard to the children in their care. Thus, whenever Ms. Wolfe was present in her mother’s home and heard loud arguments, she would activate a tape recorder she had placed in her mother’s house and record the Appellees’ voices. At no time did Ms. Wolfe testify that she heard these arguments while standing outside of the Appellees’ home nor did the Commonwealth present <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>evidence from any other witnesses standing outside of the Appellees’ home who heard Appellees’ arguments.</p>

If nowhere else, an individual must feel secure in his ability to hold a private conversation within the four walls of his home. For the right to privacy to mean anything, it must guarantee privacy to an individual in his own home. As then Justice Roberts stated in <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b491-6" data-blocks='[["BL_491.5",491,[227,485,1157,897]]]'>In <em>Shaw, </em>the defendant was engaged in his own affairs on the second floor of his family’s home. The police were admitted to his family’s home to inquire of his knowledge of a recent robbery and killing. An eyewitness to the shooting had informed the police that one of the perpetrators was a friend of a man by the name of “Shaw.” When the police entered the house and called out to the defendant, a detective heard feet shuffling on the second floor. Because the defendant did not respond to the detective’s call, three police officers ran upstairs without a warrant or permission. We held in that instance that the governmental intrusion was unreasonable given the defendant’s legitimate expectation of privacy in his own home and therefore the intrusion violated the defendant’s right against unreasonable searches and seizures. While the facts of <em>Shaw </em>differ from the appeal now before us, the principle involved is identical. An individual has a constitutionally protected right to be secure in his home.</p>
