The charges arose as a result of the shooting deaths of two employees of a McDonald’s restaurant located in Chester County, Pennsylvania, on the morning of January 8, 1989. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the convictions and the judgment of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b655-12" data-blocks='[["BL_655.12",655,[229,1907,1157,367]],["BL_656.1",656,[243,282,1161,202]]]'>Shortly after the murders occurred, appellant was arrested in Delaware which is but a short distance from the scene of the murders. Following his arrest, appellant was extradited to Pennsylvania and incarcerated at Chester County Prison. On petition of defense counsel, a hearing was held on February 10, 1989, to determine appellant’s competency to stand trial. Following the hearing, the court entered an order <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>committing appellant to Norristown State Hospital for evaluation and testing and staying the proceedings pending completion of said evaluation. Ultimately, appellant was found by the court to be competent to stand trial.</p>
    <p id="b656-5" data-blocks='[["BL_656.5",656,[237,508,1164,515]]]'>On September 28, 1989, a hearing was held on appellant’s motion to suppress certain physical evidence and statements following which the court denied the motion in its entirety. After three days of jury selection, appellant elected to forego a jury trial and instead, entered a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea of “guilty but mentally ill.” The court then gave a lengthy colloquy, informing appellant of all of those rights which he would be relinquishing as well as the elements of the offenses with which he was charged. The court then accepted the plea as tendered.</p>
    <p id="b656-6" data-blocks='[["BL_656.6",656,[234,1056,1163,363]]]'>However, later that same day, both counsel and the court agreed that the proper procedural posture in which appellant could present a defense of “guilty but mentally ill” was a non-jury trial and not a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea. The court again informed appellant of his right to a jury trial whereupon appellant signed the waiver form. The case then proceeded as a bench trial with stipulated facts.</p>

    <p id="b657-6" data-blocks='[["BL_657.6",657,[221,1249,1156,584]]]'>On January 8, 1989, two employees of the McDonald’s restaurant located in the Parkway Shopping Center in West Goshen Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, were found murdered, each by a single gunshot wound to the head. On that date, at approximately 5:15 a.m., James Jenkins was delivering newspapers at the shopping center when he noticed a blue and white automobile in the parking lot of the McDonald’s restaurant. Upon being shown a photograph of appellant’s car, Mr. Jenkins was of the opinion that the car depicted in the photograph was identical to the one he saw in the parking lot on the day of the murders.</p>
    <p id="b657-7" data-blocks='[["BL_657.7",657,[218,1855,1155,314]]]'>At approximately 5:30 a.m. that same morning, an employee of the McDonald’s, Brian Burnette, arrived for work. As he was about to enter the building, he noticed a man standing inside the restaurant waving a gun in the direction of the manager, Jean Reider, who was carrying cash drawers from the safe and placing them on the counter.</p>

Titus also observed a person, approximately six feet tall, standing inside the restaurant with arms extended as though holding something in his hand. Both Titus and Burnette then went to a nearby store to call the police.</p>
    <p id="b658-5" data-blocks='[["BL_658.5",658,[252,563,1165,565]]]'>When the police arrived at the scene, they discovered the bodies of Charles Hegarty and Jean Reider. The body of Charles Hegarty was found in the exact location where Brian Titus had seen someone lying earlier. Jean Reider’s body was found in the corner of a room. The blood stains on the wall indicated that she had been shot while sitting with her legs crossed and curled up. The safe was open and the cash drawers had been taken out and left on the floor. No money was left in the cash drawers except for some rolls of coins. Six crumpled one dollar bills were found next to a dumpster outside the McDonald’s.</p>
    <p id="b658-6" data-blocks='[["BL_658.6",658,[248,1160,1162,619]]]'>At approximately 6:30 a.m. that same morning, Steven Quigley, proprietor of a local towing business, received a telephone call from a man who asked to be picked up at the Abbey Green Motel which is located approximately six tenths of a mile south of the McDonald’s restaurant. The man requested that Quigley tow the man’s blue Plymouth to Jack Wolfs Sunoco so that it could be repaired. When Quigley asked the man why he did not use Wolfs tow trucks, the man responded that all of Jack Wolfs tow trucks were out and unavailable. However, when Quigley drove past Wolfs Sunoco he observed that all of Wolfs tow trucks were in, not out as the caller had indicated.</p>
    <p id="b658-7" data-blocks='[["BL_658.7",658,[245,1811,1160,521]],["BL_659.1",659,[213,296,1154,256]]]'>When Quigley arrived at the Abbey Green Motel at approximately 6:50 a.m., appellant appeared from between the buildings. As he walked to Quigley’s truck, appellant was holding his side with his arm as though he was either hiding something or hurt. When Quigley asked appellant where his car was parked, appellant responded that the Birmingham Township police had towed it. Quigley suspected that was not true as he, himself, performed all towing work for the Birmingham Township police. Moreover, Quigley knew that the Abbey Green Motel was not located in Birmingham Township. Nev<a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>ertheless, Quigley agreed to drive appellant to the Tally Ho Motel in New Castle County, Delaware. Upon their arrival there, appellant paid Quigley the sum of $25.00 in crumpled five dollar bills. Quigley last saw appellant speaking with the desk clerk at the Tally Ho.</p>
    <p id="b659-5" data-blocks='[["BL_659.5",659,[211,575,1155,310]]]'>After requesting the desk clerk to call a cab for him, appellant then went to an adjacent Wawa Market to purchase a soda. Appellant left the Wawa Market after purchasing the soda, but returned shortly thereafter requesting a paper bag. Appellant then took a cab to the Clemente bus station located in Wilmington, Delaware.</p>
    <p id="b659-6" data-blocks='[["BL_659.6",659,[208,907,1159,1260]]]'>At approximately 8:30 a.m. that same morning, Officers Cottingham and Boyd of the Wilmington Police Department, while on routine patrol, received a radio broadcast dispatching them to the area of the Clemente Bus station to look for a possible fugitive from Pennsylvania who was wanted for an outstanding warrant. The officers arrived at the bus station and after noticing no one in the waiting room area of the station matching the description broadcast over the radio, one of the officers entered the men’s restroom. Once in the restroom, the officer noticed someone matching the description. The officer then exited the restroom and informed his partner that he believed the suspect was in the restroom. They then radioed for backup assistance. As appellant exited the restroom, Officer Boyd asked him his name and after appellant responded in a hostile manner, Officer Boyd explained to appellant that they were looking for a fugitive from Pennsylvania. Appellant remained hostile, refusing to comply with any of the officers’ requests. A struggle ensued during which a .38 revolver fell from appellant’s pocket. As all three struggled to retrieve the gun, Officer Boyd struck appellant with his blackjack. Appellant was eventually transported to a hospital as a result of injuries he incurred during the struggle. Upon his arrest, appellant had in his possession a Wawa bag and a Colt 6 shot revolver.</p>
    <p id="b659-7" data-blocks='[["BL_659.7",659,[207,2197,1157,150]],["BL_660.1",660,[264,283,1164,369]]]'>Upon examination of the Colt revolver, Officer Cannon of the Wilmington Police Department observed two spent cartridges as well as four live rounds of .38 caliber ammunition. <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>The Wawa bag seized from appellant contained a blue American Bank bag in which was found various papers subsequently determined to have been taken from the McDonald’s restaurant, as well as a sum of money. The Wawa bag contained a second bank bag inside of which was found another sum of money. Six live .38 caliber special ammunition were seized from the right pocket of the jacket appellant was wearing.</p>
    <p id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.5",660,[257,691,1164,1123]]]'>While at the hospital, appellant, after having been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, was advised that he was a suspect in a double homicide and robbery which had occurred at the McDonald’s restaurant to which he responded, “If I knew I was being arrested, it would have been your life.” Appellant also stated that the revolver had been purchased by him at a gun shop in Malvern, Pennsylvania. He claimed, however, that the bullets had been spent at a park. He then told the police that his name was “Tony” and that the money in his possession belonged to him, part of which he claimed to have received from a man by the name of John Rodriguez. Appellant described John Rodriguez as a twenty-five year old Puerto Rican male and claimed that he had previously telephoned Rodriguez to arrange a meeting that morning at the Wawa near the Tally Ho Motel so that Rodriguez could pay appellant the money, in partial satisfaction of a debt. Contrary to appellant’s assertions, however, the records obtained for appellant’s home telephone did not reflect any calls to Rodriguez. Moreover, the clerk who attended to appellant that morning at the Wawa Market did not see any Puerto Rican male in the presence of appellant.</p>
    <p id="b660-6" data-blocks='[["BL_660.6",660,[255,1855,1174,474]]]'>A blue and white Plymouth Volare was found parked on Cheyney Drive which is located directly south of the Abbey Green Motel. A search warrant was issued for the car and a ’ box of .38 caliber ammunition was recovered from the car. Also found within the car was a sales receipt for the vehicle in the name of Terrence Russo of 99 Concord Meeting Road, Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, that being the same address that appeared when the police ran a driver’s license check under the name of Robert T. Hughes.</p>

      <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>It was also determined that the gun which was seized upon appellant’s arrest had been purchased by him just two days prior to the double murder. The record reveals that appellant had originally ordered a Charter Arms .38 caliber short barrel gun from the Malvern Gun Shop, but after having phoned the store several times inquiring about why it was taking so long for his order, appellant appeared at the gun shop on January 3, 1989, decided that he wanted a Colt gun instead and ordered the same. He took delivery of the Colt gun on January 6, 1989 and was, at that time, also supplied with human silhouette targets. He did not have a license to carry a gun.</p>
    <p id="b661-5" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[214,955,1156,785]]]'>On January 5, 1989, just three days before the murders, appellant was observed at approximately 4:00 a.m. in a parked car outside a McDonald’s restaurant in Delaware County. When appellant was approached by an off duty police officer, he claimed to be having battery problems. On the evening of January 6, 1989, the manager of a McDonald’s restaurant in Exton, Pennsylvania, received a telephone call from a man who identified himself as an employee of a McDonald’s located in California. The caller then “asked about the opening procedures for McDonald’s in Exton.” N.T. 11/3/89, 140-41. That same evening, an identical call and inquiry was made to a McDonald’s in Downingtown, Pennsylvania. Appellant’s telephone records were obtained pursuant to a search warrant which records revealed that both calls were made from appellant’s home.</p>
    <p id="b661-6" data-blocks='[["BL_661.6",661,[212,1771,1156,466]]]'>As noted previously, it was determined that Charles Hegarty died from a contact gun shot wound to the head. The nature of the wound was consistent with the victim’s head having been on a hard floor at the time he was shot. The other employee, Jean Reider, also died of a gun shot wound to the head. The pathologist opined that Reider had been shot from approximately a foot and one-half to two feet away and that she was shot while sitting in a corner with her head turned to the right.</p>

Ballistics experts also stated with certainty, that the bullets that were removed from the victims’ heads, the live rounds seized from appellant’s gun, the bullets found in appellant’s jacket pocket and the bullets found in appellant’s car all contained lead from the same homogenous pot.</p>
    <p id="b662-4" data-blocks='[["BL_662.5",662,[255,783,1164,926]]]'>A former high school classmate of appellant, Darlene Devakow, received a letter from appellant postmarked March 17, 1989, in which appellant confessed to the murders. He claimed that he shot one of the employees because that employee had reached for a gun. He also told her that he could lie to others, but not to her and that he had fabricated much of what he told to the psychiatrists and physicians in order to fake insanity. In that letter, appellant told Ms. Devakow that he would call her on March 23, 1989, at 7:05 p.m. Appellant did, indeed, telephone Ms. Devakow on that date and repeated much of what he had written in the letter. He admitted that his motive was robbery and that he knew that he had fooled the psychiatrists and doctors. Because Ms. Devakow would not consent to a recording of the conversation, the Commonwealth obtained prior court approval to intercept that conversation. At trial, the Commonwealth introduced into evidence the transcript prepared from that tape as well as the actual tape.</p>
    <p id="b662-5" data-blocks='[["BL_662.6",662,[255,1731,1160,411]]]'>Clearly, the above facts were sufficient to support appellant’s convictions for two counts of first degree murder and one count each of robbery, possession of instruments of crime and violation of the Uniform Firearms Act. In fact, appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence of his convictions. Having concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions, we shall now address appellant’s particular claims of error.</p>

Officer Lacko then read appellant his <em>Miranda </em>rights from the Standard Police Interrogation Card. Appellant orally indicated that he understood each right. The officer then asked appellant whether he wished to give up these rights and talk with the officers. Appellant responded that he did not understand what this was all about. Detective Smith then stated that they were investigating a double murder and robbery that occurred at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania. Appellant then responded: “If I knew I was being arrested, it would have been your life.” The police then questioned appellant about the gun. Appellant stated that the gun was his and that he had bought it on November fourth at the Magnum Gun Shop in Malvern. Upon further questioning by the police, appellant told them that the money found in his possession belonged to him and that part of it was money given him by one John Rodriguez in satisfaction of a debt. He claimed that he had arranged to meet Rodriguez at the Wawa store located near the Tally Ho. When the officers asked him what he had done prior to going to the Tally Ho, appellant <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>responded that he wished to speak with a lawyer.

As noted above, he clearly and unequivocally indicated after each right was read to him that he understood. And, while he did not directly answer the question as to whether he wished to waive those rights and speak with the officers, he did continue to manifest his understanding of those rights. Moreover, the statements made by him in response to the officers’ questions were not even incriminating. For instance, while he did admit that he recently bought the gun, there was nothing particularly incriminating in that response as the gun was found on his person at the time the officers apprehended him in the bus station. He added that he had been at a range in a park, practicing his shooting. Then, in an attempt to explain the money found in his possession, appellant stated only that a portion of the money was his and the remaining amount had been given to him by Rodriquez in satisfaction of a debt.

Specifically, appellant argues that the court failed to inform him that if he had elected to plead “guilty but mentally ill” and if the trial judge were to ultimately determine not to accept the plea, appellant would have been entitled to withdraw his plea and proceed to a jury trial.

At trial, appellant called one Dr. Kratsa, a psychiatrist, in an effort to establish that appellant had exhibited signs of mental illness since his early childhood. However, Dr. Kratsa had never clinically evaluated appellant, nor had he ever reviewed any records pertaining to appellant’s mental state. Rather, Dr. Kratsa, who was a friend of appellant’s family, gained his knowledge regarding appellant’s alleged history of mental illness solely from conversations he had with appellant’s family members who had called Dr. Kratsa on several occasions seeking advice. The only other contact Dr. Kratsa had with appellant was during certain athletic events in which appellant participated and Dr. Kratsa coached. Moreover, Dr. Kratsa had not even seen appellant during the three year period immediately preceding the murders. Accordingly, he could not testify to appellant’s mental state at, or near, the time that the murders occurred.</p>

No such connection was ever made and counsel for the prosecution moved to strike Dr. Kratsa’s testimony. This testimony was clearly not probative of the issue of appellant’s mental state at the time of the murders and thus, was not relevant or admissible. See, <em>Commonwealth v. Stewart, </em><a href="/pa/461/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="461 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="483826" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0274-01">461 Pa. 274</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="461 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="483826" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0274-01">336 A.2d 282</a> (1975). Nevertheless, the trial court refused to strike Dr. Kratsa’s testimony, noting that if appellant could later make the requisite connection, the court would consider the testimony. The trial court, therefore, provided appellant every opportunity to establish the relevancy of this testimony. Appellant, however, failed to subsequently provide that connection. Appellant, having failed to establish the relevancy of Dr. Kratsa’s testi<a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>mony, cannot now be heard to complain that the trial court erred in disregarding this testimony.

Appellant also argues that the court improperly focused upon whether the mental illness <em>caused </em>the appellant to act as he did rather than focuses upon whether, because of the mental illness, appellant lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. He then claims that the trial court’s alleged error also caused the court not to find mitigating circumstance (e)(3), 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

While <em>Faulkner </em>was decided after the trial of the instant case, the law regarding the use of “guilty but mentally ill” as espoused therein was an affirmation of the well established legal principle that a verdict of “guilty but mentally ill” does not address a defendant’s legal responsibility for the acts committed, but <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>rather reflects a penological concern and therefore, is properly considered during the sentencing phase. <em>See, Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b673-5" data-blocks='[["BL_673.5",673,[213,526,1160,1012]]]'>Here, contrary to appellant’s assertions, the trial court found during the guilt phase that appellant, at the time of the commission of the murders, was not laboring under any mental illness sufficient to deprive him of his ability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his acts or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. The trial judge then heard further evidence during the penalty phase regarding appellant’s mental state and again reiterated his finding that the defense had not established that appellant was “guilty but mentally ill” at the relevant time. In an apparent attempt at fairness, the trial judge then found that mitigating circumstance (e)(2) could be read more liberally than the “guilty but mentally ill” statute, concluding that (e)(2) can properly be found where there is evidence that a defendant suffers from mental illness at the time of sentencing. While the trial judge’s conclusion was clearly in error given the clear and unambiguous language of subsection (e)(2), this Court will not render a mitigating circumstance invalid as there has been no error resulting therefrom to the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b673-6" data-blocks='[["BL_673.6",673,[211,1577,1157,637]]]'>As for appellant’s claim that the trial judge should have also found mitigating circumstance (e)(3), we cannot agree. The trial court clearly found that appellant failed to suffer from the requisite degree of mental illness, if any, at the time of the offenses. Mitigating circumstance (e)(3) tracks the language of the “guilty but mentally ill” statute and thus, provides that only where the defendant lacks substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law <em>at the time of the offenses </em>will he meet the criteria. Accordingly, because the trial judge in the instant case found no such mental impairment at the time of the instant murders, (e)(3) could not properly be found.</p>

Appellant claims that his good behavior while in prison demonstrates character traits which are relevant mitigating evidence and therefore, should have been found under (e)(8). Specifically, he claims that his ability to peacefully adjust to life in prison and his alleged non-violent nature while in prison are relevant character traits bearing on mitigation.

Indeed, the Commonwealth called as a witness, a psychologist employed at Delaware County Prison who testified that on one particular occasion while he was making rounds he noticed that a radiator located in appellant’s cell had been tampered with and that when the guards arrived to check the cell, he witnessed appellant attack the guards. Given this contradiction in the evidence, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred in finding insufficient evidence to support these alleged mitigating factors.</p>

In support of his claim, appellant argues that the trial court, in weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, impermissibly considered the gravity of the offense.

Such considerations <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>are valid and provide no basis for a finding that the sentence imposed was the result of any prejudice or other arbitrary factor. <em>See, Commonwealth v.
