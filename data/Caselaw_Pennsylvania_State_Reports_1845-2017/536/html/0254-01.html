    <p id="b552-9" data-blocks='[["BL_552.10",552,[208,1426,1161,801]]]'>The fines and suspension arose out of an incident which occurred in the early morning hours of August 8, 1987 at Appellant’s premises, a licensed establishment. Based upon the eyewitness observations of Dennis Ondek, an enforcement officer of the Pennsylvania State Police, Liquor Code Enforcement, three citations were issued to Appellant alleging: that Appellant permitted lewd, immoral or improper entertainment upon the licensed premises in the form of a male stripper in violation of Section 493(10) of the Liquor Code, 47 P.S. § 4-493(10); that Appellant was permitting this entertainer to come into contact with or associate with patrons in violation of Section 5.32(d) of the regulations of the Board, 40 Pa.Code § 5.32(d); and, that Appellant was selling alcohol after hours in violation of Sections 406(a)(2) and 493(16) of the Liquor Code, 47 P.S. § 4-406(a)(2) and § 4^93(16).</p>

The dancer straddled some of the patrons so as to rub his genital area against the face or breasts of the patrons and allowed at least one of the patrons to kiss his genital area. The officer also testified that he purchased three beers after 2:00 a.m. at prices which were a quarter higher than those charged before the mandated closing time. He also observed other patrons being served after 2:00 a.m. and he saw additional patrons enter the premises after closing time by knocking on the door and being admitted. Officer Ondek also testified that Gloria Brugnoli, the president, stockholder and manager of the licensed establishment was present and observed the dancing performance.</p>
    <p id="b553-4" data-blocks='[["BL_553.5",553,[258,1065,1159,471]]]'>This evidence was sufficient for the administrative law judge to conclude that violations of the Liquor Code and Regulations had been established. Accordingly, the administrative law judge imposed a fifteen day suspension and $2,000.00 fine for the lewd dancing violation, a fifteen day suspension and $1,000.00 fine for the associating with patrons violation, and a $1,250.00 fine for the selling of alcoholic beverages after hours violation. These suspensions were imposed consecutively. An appeal followed to the Board and that body affirmed.</p>

The Board filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to narrow the scope of review to be exercised by that court to what it believed was mandated by the recent amendments to Section 471 of the Liquor Code, amended by Act of June 29,1987, P.L. 32, 47 P.S. § 4-471 and which had gone into effect on July 1, 1987.

The trial court also heard from four other witnesses, whose testimony was found to be corroborative and offered no new facts. The trial court was of the opinion that because it could find no new facts or an abuse of discretion in the actions of the administrative law judge, that it was required to affirm his order and an order to that effect was entered.</p>

    <p id="b556-4" data-blocks='[["BL_556.5",556,[243,678,1163,628]]]'>While both versions of the statute provide in identical language that aggrieved parties have a right to appeal in the same manner as provided for in appeals from refusals to grant licenses (Section 464), the Commonwealth Court was not convinced that the directions on the scope of review in Section 464 could be invoked to fill the void created by the amendments to Section 471. This view, critical to the entire analysis, is based on the erroneous conclusion that the manner of review and the scope of review were included as separate and distinct considerations in former Section 471 but that the amended Section 471 speaks in terms only of manner of review and that no provision for scope of review is made.</p>

The manner of review prescribed is by “appeal” <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>and the scope of review is the same as that in license refusal cases. Prior to the 1987 amendments, § 471 provided for “the right to appeal to the court of quarter sessions or the county court of Allegheny County in the manner as herein provided for appeals from refusals to grant licenses.” This language, as in the amended statute, provided that the manner of review was to be by “appeal” and that the scope of review would be the same as in appeals from refusals to grant licenses. Of course, the old statute also included specific instructions on how the trial court was to conduct its review in such appeals which the Commonwealth Court concluded was the “scope of review.” We read this language, however, merely as an explanation of the scope of review referred to in the previous sentence.</p>
    <p id="b557-4" data-blocks='[["BL_557.5",557,[258,1052,1159,572]]]'>It may be that the Commonwealth Court reached its conclusions concerning the significance of this language based on the fact that the amended § 471 no longer contains this detailed explanation of how the trial court is to conduct its review and that, searching for a reason for this deletion, it drew the conclusion that for the legislature to have removed this language it must have been displeased with this type of review or with the interpretation we ascribed to this language in our <em>Adair </em>decision. It can easily be said that the deleted language was surplusage and therefore deleted to simplify the section.</p>
    <p id="b557-5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.6",557,[259,1654,1155,302]]]'>It cannot be argued, however, that the deletion of the specific instructions on the scope of review was in response to our decision in <em>Adair. </em>The Liquor Code amendments went into effect on July 1, 1987, and our decision in <em>Adair </em>was not reached until July 28, 1988, after the amendments became effective.</p>

If anything, <em>de novo </em>review by the judicial branch assures litigants that license suspensions based on violations of the Liquor Code will only be enforced when neutral judicial officers, detached from the bureau charged with the task of monitoring and enforcing the liquor laws of this Commonwealth are satisfied that violations have, in fact, been established. Given the lack of evidence to. support a view that the deletion of the detailed instructions on the scope of review in § 471 appeals was a legislative response to dissatisfaction with <em>de novo </em>review in such cases, we are unwilling to read amended § 471 as the Commonwealth Court has, thereby creating a hole in the statutory scheme when it comes to trial court review in such cases.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The adjudication of the administrative law judge is reviewable by the board, which must affirm the administrative law judge (on the record before the administrative law judge) unless the decision is not based on substantial evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Finally, in the appeal provisions, a new section has been added which allows additional hearings to be held to determine whether the appeal should operate as a supersedeas.</p>

The trial court properly exercised its discretion in accepting as its own the findings and conclusions of the administrative law judge. Thereafter, the trial court failed to exercise its discretion in determining whether the penalty imposed by the administrative law judge was proper under the facts of the case because the trial judge believed that the penalty could not be altered once the findings and conclusions of the administrative law judge were adopted. The trial judge apparently believed that the penalty could not be altered unless findings of fact were made different from those of the administrative law judge. This was error.</p>

Furthermore, the court concluded that the type of review most appropriate, given the substantial changes in new Section 471, would be the type utilized when appealing a final decree in equity, <em>i.e., </em>limited to determining whether the chancellor’s findings are <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>supported by substantial evidence, whether there was an error of law committed, or whether the chancellor abused his discretion. <em>Iggy, </em>at 176, <a href="/pa-commw/140/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="140 Pa.

This conclusion would also appear to be at odds with the <em>Iggy </em>court conclusion that § 464 scope of review allows a court to modify the board’s decision only when there as been a manifest abuse of discretion, or the trial court makes findings of fact which vary from the findings made by the Board. The statutory language does not condition the court’s statutory authority upon such a predicate and, as in <em>Adair, </em>we conclude that such a limitation on the authority of the lower court is based upon a misreading of the section. In short, <em>Iggy </em>is of no precedential value.</p>
