We find these arguments unpersuasive. Appellee first argues that his suspension is a criminal penalty because the statute mandating the suspension, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 6310.-4(a), is found in Title 18, the criminal code. We recognize that under the rules of statutory construction the title of the statute may be used in the construction thereof. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1924. However, the title of a statute “shall not be considered to control ...” <em><a href="/pa/520/0552-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="520 Pa. 552" data-case-ids="1815635" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0552-01">Id.</a> </em>We conclude that placement of § 6310.4(a) in the criminal code does not render it a criminal penalty. Nowhere in the sentencing statutes, 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9701-9781, is suspension of the operating privilege authorized as a penalty which a criminal court may impose for a criminal conviction. Suspension of operating privileges is not one of the six authorized sentences enumerated in 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 9721 that may be imposed, for conviction of a criminal offense such as a violation of 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 6308. Nor is it a mandatory penalty under Chapter B of the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9711-9719, or included as a sentencing alternative in Chapter C of the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9721-9729. Also, we note that the mandatory fines and imprisonment sanction for driving under the influence or conviction for homicide by vehicle are found not in Title 18, <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>but in Title 75, the Vehicles Code. The placement of these penalties in the Vehicles Code does not render them civil sanctions. Our examination of these related statutes leads us to the conclusion that our legislature did not intend to rigidly classify them as civil or criminal according to where they are located in the code. Thus, we conclude that the placement of the operating privilege suspension in Title 18 does not render it a criminal sanction.</p>
    <p id="b738-5" data-blocks='[["BL_738.5",738,[257,734,1166,1267]]]'>Appellee next argues that the operating privilege sanction cannot be a collateral civil consequence because it is ordered by the court. A consequence is civil in nature where, “imposition has been vested in an administrative agency over which the criminal judge had no control and for which he had no responsibility.” <em>Brewster v. Department of Transportation, </em><a href="/pa-commw/94/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="94 Pa.

We recognize that § 6310.4(a) is different from other sections of the Vehicle Code in that it mandates that the judge order a license suspension and transmit this order to DOT.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> However, we find that the act of the judge is more ministerial in nature than one involving “control” or “responsibility.” Section 6130.4(a) mandates that the judge “shall” order the suspension of the operation privilege. Thus, the judge has no control over whether the sentence will be imposed. In addition, DOT calculates the period of the suspension based upon any prior incidents, and then imposes the sentence on the driver. The judge does no more than guarantee that DOT receives timely notice of the conviction requiring license suspension as a collateral consequence.</p>

In my view this direct involvement by the sentencing authority in what is termed a “collateral consequence” makes a significant difference, particularly where one is precluded from driving, indeed a severe sanction, call it what you will, in today’s world. I must, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>
