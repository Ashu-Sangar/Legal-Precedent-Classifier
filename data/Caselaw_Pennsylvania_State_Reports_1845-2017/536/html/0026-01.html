In late 1985, Jackson discussed with Anonymous Attorney the possibility of Jackson working part-time, without pay, as a paralegal for Anonymous Attorney. Jackson indicated that this arrangement would help Jackson stay current with <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>the law and assist him in obtaining reinstatement of his attorney’s license. Initially, Jackson worked two to three days a week. Anonymous Attorney testified that he advised Jackson to make sure that he informed every client that he was working only as a paralegal and not as an attorney. At no time was Anonymous Attorney given or made aware of the contents of the Bar Association’s Guidance Opinions which each suspended attorney is given. Accordingly, Anonymous Attorney assumed a suspended attorney could do what a normal paralegal could do, which included interviewing the clients; obtaining information from clients; undertaking legal research; and preparing, under supervision, legal documents. While Jackson was working as a paralegal in Anonymous Attorney’s office between January of 1986 and March of 1987, Jackson’s name did not appear on any office signs, on Anonymous Attorney’s legal stationery or on legal business cards, and the telephones were answered only by reference to Anonymous Attorney’s name. Finally, Anonymous Attorney indicated that he did, in fact, supervise Jackson between January of 1986 and March of 1987, and oversaw all of Jackson’s actions as a paralegal.</p>

These ethical violations can be characterized as the unauthorized practice of law, accepting employment in workmen’s compensation matters which an attorney had previously served as a referee, and the sharing of legal fees between an attorney and a non-attorney. As to Anonymous Attorney, it is alleged that he violated the same code provisions by aiding and abetting Jackson’s unauthorized practice of law, being aware of and not preventing Jackson from engaging in cases Jackson previously served as a referee, and by sharing legal fees as a means of assisting Jackson in his unauthorized practice of law.</p>

Garb was well aware of the fact that Jackson was under suspension but did not care as he was interested only in results. The plan was to have Jackson do all the behind-the-scenes legal work and merely have King make all public appearances and execute all formal documents.</p>

Apparently, a problem developed in meeting King’s busy schedule in setting a hearing on the petition. In any event, on July 9, 1986, the date of the final hearing on the Petition for Commutation, Garb represented himself with Jackson present in the room. Prior to that hearing, Jackson and Garb met to review Garb’s testimony in support of commutation. Garb testified that Jackson advised him to <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>advise the referee that he intended to start a business and that is why he wanted his benefits commutated. Furthermore, Garb testified that this statement was false. Garb subsequently received an award of approximately $24,000. It is in dispute as to how much Garb paid Jackson. Garb testified that he paid Jackson 20% of the award, or $4,800, while Jackson indicated that he received no monies from the award, but rather received a gift of $2,000 based upon years of personal friendship.</p>

In these respects, Jackson confirms essential facts of Garb’s testimony: namely, Jackson received funds at or about the same time Garb received his benefits, and Jackson provided Garb business information which arguably Garb used to base his testimony for the commutation hearing. We are thus satisfied that the ODC presented <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>sufficient evidence to establish violations of Disciplinary Rule 1 — 102(A)(4), (5) and (6).</p>

If Garb’s commutation hearing was as simplistic as Jackson argues in his brief, then why was it necessary for Jackson to attend the hearing? Having had at least eight years experience as a workmen’s compensation referee, little if any knowledge could be gained by his attendance at such a simplistic hearing. Of course, the more logical conclusion is that Jackson had an interest, both professional and financial, in the proceeding and that is why he was in attendance. Also of interest is the fact that Jackson failed to disclose his work with Anonymous Attorney either on his application for reinstatement or at the hearing regarding reinstatement. If Jackson was not undertaking a course of questionable conduct, then why would he have not disclosed that conduct in support of his reinstatement?</p>

For such conduct, there is no other sanction available which will impress upon him the seriousness of his action except disbarment.

The testimony of ODC’s witnesses was weak at best. In fact, in most instances, the witnesses lack any credibility. Some witnesses denied having any contact with Anonymous Attorney yet were presented with correspondence from him. Others admitted executing pleadings and fee agreements, but never took the opportunity to review those documents to see that Anonymous Attorney had signed them. In one instance, a witness indicated that Jackson’s name was displayed on the window outside of Anonymous Attorney’s office in 1986 when he really meant after March of 1987 when Jackson was reinstated. In fact, that witness had no conception of the time frame involved. That same witness denied that Anonymous Attorney was present during a discussion with Jackson of a potential medical malpractice claim. However, Anonymous Attorney produced detailed notes in his handwriting from that same meeting.</p>

Without us accepting the circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy between Anonymous Attorney and Jackson produced by these witnesses, ODC fails to meet its burden. Clearly, the Hearing Committee and the Disciplinary Board were justified in refusing to accept the testimony of ODC’s witnesses. Both the Committee and the Disciplinary Board found the credibility of ODC’s witnesses lacking. Our independent review of the record confirms this conclusion. Accordingly, we find no violation with respect to the accusation that Anonymous Attorney conspired or agreed to assist Jackson in the unauthorized practice of law.</p>

There can be no question but that Jackson, as a suspended lawyer, is a “non-lawyer” within the meaning of the rules. The purpose of this legal mandate is to maintain a lawyer’s independent professional judgment, unhampered by monetary obligation to a party other than his client. In addition, the purpose is to protect the Bar against the unauthorized practice of law by persons the system does not recognize as presently licensed to practice. The' only exception to the rule prohibiting sharing fees with non-lawyers is the payment by a law firm into a profit-sharing plan in which non-lawyer employees of the firm share in the profits earned by the lawyers, obviously from fees. The exception is sustainable because there is no direct link between a specific fee and a specific payment to a non-lawyer. In this case, that very evil is present.</blockquote>

Furthermore, the fees were paid after the period of suspension had ended, yet before formal reinstatement occurred. We are satisfied with Anonymous Attorney’s assurances that there will be no future occurrences, keeping in mind that we are not condoning his actions.

We have reviewed that petition and find that it asserts nothing new. While it is true that the original petition for discipline did not specifically charge Jackson with assisting Garb in committing perjury, it is clear that the Disciplinary Counsel raised that issue through Garb's testimony on November 8, 1989. The final hearing on this matter was held on February 5, 1990. The gap between hearings provided Jackson sufficient opportunity to prepare a defense to Garb’s damaging testimony. Furthermore, at the hearing on February 5, 1990, the Chairman of the Hearing Committee extensively questioned Jackson with regard to the Garb matter. At that time, neither Jackson or his counsel requested a continuance to permit Jackson to present any additional testimony. Finally, the offer by way of affidavit set forth in Jackson's Petition for Submission is attested to by one of Jackson’s witnesses who did appear at the hearings. This affidavit merely corroborates the testimony that Jackson himself gave with regard to the preparation of business packages for Garb. Therefore, we see no basis for granting this request.</p>
