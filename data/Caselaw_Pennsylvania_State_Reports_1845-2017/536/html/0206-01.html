The issue in this case is whether the <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>trial court properly ordered the third blood test. We hold that the third test was not properly ordered.</p>
    <p id="b504-4" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[267,421,1161,874]]]'>The facts are as follows. Ms. DeAngelo gave birth to Arden Ann DeAngelo and filed a complaint alleging Mr. Murray to be the father. Mr. Murray has maintained that he is not the father. On May 5, 1987, the trial court ordered Mr. Murray, Ms. DeAngelo and her child to submit to red cell typing and human leucocyte antigen blood tests to determine paternity. A report prepared by Dr. Leslie Johnson concluded that the calculated probability of Mr. Murray being the father was ninety percent. Also, Dr. Johnson recommended that further genetic studies be considered. In an effort to refute the findings of Dr. Johnson, Mr. Murray retained Dr. Paul Oldfather who, upon examining the results of the first test, concluded that more testing is required in the human leucocyte antigen and red cell systems. Thereafter, Ms. DeAngelo filed a petition for Mr. Murray to submit to further blood tests. Subsequently, the trial court ordered all parties to submit to a second test.</p>
    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[265,1325,1160,511]]]'>The second test consisted of DNA fingerprinting analysis. The report from the second test stated that “[i]t is not possible” for Mr. Murray to be the biological father. Record at 31(a). Dr. Johnson expressed concern over the second test and recommended that red cell enzyme and serum protein tests be performed. On February 8, 1990, Mrs. DeAngelo filed a petition for a third blood test to be taken. Mr. Murray objected and argued that substantial testing had already been conducted. On July 17, 1990, the trial court ordered a third blood test.</p>
    <p id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.7",504,[265,1865,1161,360]]]'>Appellant filed an interlocutory appeal to the Superior Court from the trial court’s Order requiring a third round of blood tests. Appellant claimed that the trial court erred when it ordered a third blood test absent a showing by a preponderance of evidence that the two previous tests were defective or inaccurate.

Mr. Murray argues that the first two tests are not contradictory, but rather, that the first test was inconclusive, and the second test should be viewed as having eradicated the ambiguity which resulted following the first blood test.</p>

The results of the second test do not contradict the results of the first test; rather, the results of the second test confirmed the 10.0% possibility that the first test yielded, which was that Mr. Murray was not the father.
