In his appeal to this Court, Appellant raises four issues for review and asks to be awarded a new trial. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court in part and grant a new trial on the charges of rape and indecent assault.</p>
    <p id="b509-7" data-blocks='[["BL_509.7",509,[198,1146,1156,473]]]'>Appellant’s conviction arose out of the following set of facts. On the evening of May 8, 1987, Appellant paid a visit to his former girlfriend, Lillian Maldonado, and she admitted him into her home. During the course of the visit, sexual intercourse occurred between the two and there was a struggle that left Maldonado injured. Appellant claimed that the sex was consensual and that he injured Maldonado while defending himself against her attack. The prosecution contended that Appellant forcibly raped Maldonado.</p>

The first of these claims is that he was denied his constitutional right to due process when, after closing arguments, the trial judge, <em>sua sponte, </em>injected into the jury instructions a theory of guilt based upon Maldonado’s mental capacity to consent under section 3121(4) of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121(4), after that theory had been expressly abandoned by the prosecution prior to trial. Appellant’s theory is that the indictment and information was <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>constructively amended when the prosecution gave oral assurances that the section 3121(4) charge would not be pursued.</p>

The Commonwealth further claims that, because the indictment and information was never formally amended, the section 3121(4) offense offered a permissible basis for a conviction and, in light of the evidence admitted at trial, was properly included in the court’s charge to the jury. In any event, the Commonwealth asserts that Appellant was not prejudiced.</p>

Second, Appellant was denied an adequate opportunity to defend himself because the court refused his request to examine the complainant in order to rebut the charges contemplated by the jury instructions. Third, to the extent he was denied an opportunity to fully develop his defense, Appellant was denied an opportunity to be heard on issues that related to one theory of guilt submitted to the jury for its consideration.</p>

The Commonwealth’s theory is that, because the jury found Appellant guilty of indecent assault, which, according to the court’s instructions, requires a finding of nonconsent without reference to the victim’s capacity, the jury determined that Maído<a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>nado did not consent to have sex. That finding of nonconsent, the argument goes, necessarily precludes the possibility that she lacked the capacity to do so. This attempt to dissect the jury’s decision to determine the validity of its verdict on the charge of rape amounts to nothing more than speculation.</p>
    <p id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[208,628,1159,1411]]]'>When a court instructs the jury, the objective is to explain to the jury how it should approach its task and the factors it should consider in reaching its verdict. <em>Commonwealth v.

When multiple offenses are charged, one factor may have a bearing on the defendant’s guilt as to one offense but not as to others. In the case at bar, the trial judge indicated that the victim’s capacity to consent was relevant to a charge of rape but not to a charge of indecent assault. Therefore, Appellant’s guilt for indecent assault does not predetermine his guilt for having sex with someone incapable of consenting. Since we do not know whether the jury found Appellant guilty of rape on the basis of section 3121(4), an offense against which he was denied an opportunity to adequately defend himself, we find that the trial court’s actions worked to his prejudice. <em>See <a href="/pa/471/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="471 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="1725188" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0243-01">id. </a></em><a href="/pa/471/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="471 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="1725188" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0243-01">at 248</a>, <a href="/pa/471/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="471 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="1725188" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0243-01">369 A.2d at 1290</a> (quoting <em>Commonwealth v.

Even though the trial judge did not introduce the issue of the victim’s mental capacity on the indecent assault charge, we find that the erroneous instruction on the rape charge was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant the grant of a new trial. We base our conclusion on the fear that the jury’s determination of Appellant’s guilt on the indecent assault charge may have been improperly affected by the trial judge’s subsequent introduction of complainant’s mental capacity. Thus, the convictions for rape and indecent assault must be reversed.</p>
