However, on September 6, 1990, the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board (JIRB) filed a notice of formal charges against Pekarski alleging ten violations of the Rules of Conduct, Office Standards, and Civil Procedures for District Justices (Code). By our order dated February 27, 1991, we vacated our original order of Court to the extent that we no longer barred Pekarski from holding other judicial offices but withheld action on her reinstatement request pending a hearing before JIRB.</p>

Most of these rule violations, or at least the most serious violations, arise out of Pekarski’s relationship with the Simeone family. As such, this relationship and the violations arising out of this relationship serve as the basis of our determination.</p>
    <p id="b646-4" data-blocks='[["BL_646.5",646,[243,626,1162,309]]]'>Michael Simeone, Jr., was charged on January 22, 1986, with driving while under the influence of alcohol following an automobile accident in which he had been involved. Officer Michael Maloney of the Bristol Township Police Department filed a criminal complaint against Michael on that date alleging the drunk driving violations.</p>
    <p id="b646-5" data-blocks='[["BL_646.6",646,[242,960,1160,304]]]'>The record establishes that Pekarski and the Simeone family had a close personal relationship. In fact, Michael lived with Pekarski for several months in 1982 after his father beat him with a baseball bat. Michael’s aunt and uncle, Laurel and Anthony Simeone, were good friends and often socialized with the Pekarskis.</p>
    <p id="b646-6" data-blocks='[["BL_646.7",646,[241,1293,1160,423]]]'>In 1982, Pekarski’s husband, James, borrowed $15,000.00 from Anthony Simeone to be used in an ongoing bar business in New Jersey owned jointly by Pekarski and her husband. To secure this loan, Pekarski’s husband used $20,000.00 to $25,000.00 of equipment as collateral. Both Pekarski and her husband testified that Pekarski was unaware of this loan until 1987 when she approached her husband about this loan while he was hospitalized.</p>

Pekar<a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>ski testified that in those circumstances she advised J &amp; R’s adversary of the fact that the son of the owner of J &amp; R had a business relationship with her husband and gave the parties the opportunity to request her recusal. On those occasions when she was requested to recuse herself, she did.</p>

As indicated, Michael was arrested on January 22, 1986. The first two scheduled preliminary hearings were continued due to Michael’s inability to appear as a result of the injuries he sustained in the accident. The March hearing was allegedly continued because Michael had not received notice of the hearing. Michael did appear for an arraignment on April 7, 1986, apparently without notice to Officer Maloney.</p>
    <p id="b647-5" data-blocks='[["BL_647.6",647,[225,1123,1172,841]]]'>It is undisputed that Pekarski drove Michael to and from his arraignment on April 7, although it was disputed as to whether Pekarski picked Michael up at his residence or at the Pekarski home. In any event, on the evening of the arraignment, Michael drove to Pekarski’s home and gave her a third party check in the amount of $1,666.67. Pekarski then gave Michael a piece of paper on which she wrote, “4-7-86 I owe you $1,666.81 [sic]” and signed it. Pekarski endorsed this check and used it to purchase money orders payable to her mortgage company, her son, and herself. Pekarski has never' repaid the $1,666.67. Michael’s father testified that he sent the money to Pekarski following a discussion with her regarding her financial problems. Pekarski denied that she had any such conversation with Mr. Simeone but did testify that she had mentioned her financial problems to Michael when driving him to his arraignment.</p>

However, Pekarski did not allow him to waive the preliminary hearing at the time of his arraignment on April 7 because she believed that he could not do both at the same time. Although Pekarski apparently attempted to schedule a preliminary hearing in May of 1986, none was held, and no further <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>attempts were made to schedule a preliminary hearing until December 1986.

    <p id="b648-5" data-blocks='[["BL_648.5",648,[231,591,1163,412]]]'>At the preliminary hearing, Michael appeared with his attorney. When Pekarski realized that Michael was not going to waive his preliminary hearing, she asked Michael’s attorney and Officer Maloney to meet with her in her chambers.

For this reason, Pekarski contends that she could not disclose this financial interest to litigants in hearings in which the Simeones were parties. However, Rule 8 B imposes a duty upon a District Justice to know the extent of a spouse’s financial interests. Furthermore, Pekarski was a part owner of the business that used the funds loaned by Anthony Simeone. Because of Pekarski’s position in the bar business and her failure to make the relevant inquiries of her husband knowing full well the financial straits they were in, the Board has proven sufficient facts to establish a violation of this rule.</p>

However, because of the impossibility of conveying the extent of that relationship, Pekarski should have taken the initiative and preliminarily recused herself from any matter before her in which the Simeones were involved.</p>

    <p id="b650-5" data-blocks='[["BL_650.6",650,[238,682,1166,1064]]]'>Without question, the Board has established violations of Rules <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.%208" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="2 A. 8">2 A, 8</a> B and 12 B by clear and convincing evidence. Our only remaining task is to adjudge the appropriate sanction. In <em>Cunningham, </em>supra, we had no problem removing all eight Common Pleas’ judges from their offices based upon a finding that each accepted cash “gifts” which appeared to compromise the integrity of the judiciary. This was so even though no ethical canon specifically prohibited the acceptance of a cash “gift.” In <em>Matter of Chiovero, </em>supra, we did not find any ethical violation on behalf of a Common Pleas judge who received a new roof, which he did not pay for, when insufficient evidence was presented establishing his knowledge of the installation of the roof prior to its completion. Furthermore, the person who paid for the roof was not in a special position to influence that judge. Finally, in <em>Matter of Braig, </em><a href="/pa/520/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="520 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="1815619" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0409-01">520 Pa. 409</a>, <a href="/pa/520/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="520 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="1815619" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0409-01">554 A.2d 493</a> (1989), we dismissed all ethical charges against a Common Pleas judge who received a cash Christmas gift.

Although in <em>Chiovero </em>the judge had no knowledge of the benefit he received (much like the $15,000.00 loan from Anthony Simeone to James Pekarski), the person who paid for the installation of the new roof was not in a special position to influence the judge. Likewise, the similarities between <em>Braig </em>and this appeal are <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>illusory. Unlike <em>Braig, </em>Pekarski did participate in 33 cases in which Anthony Simeone was involved and did participate in Michael Simeone’s case when she was the direct recipient of a $1,666.67 payment. Thus, the present appeal is most similar to the issue raised in <em>Cunningham, </em>i.e., receipt of a gift with the appearance of compromising the integrity of the judiciary. In fact, this appeal goes one step further than <em>Cunningham </em>in that the Code specifically prohibits the acceptance of a gift or a loan from a party or person whose interests are likely to come before that District Justice. In light of that clear ethical violation, we must conclude that the appropriate sanction is removal.</p>
