    <p id="b299-9" data-blocks='[["BL_299.10",299,[227,977,1156,1058]]]'>This matter arises out of a fire that occurred at the Springfield Shopping Center in Delaware County on May 10, 1983. The fire broke out in the basement of Michael D’s Carpet Outlets (hereinafter “Michael D’s”), consuming Michael D’s store and severely damaging the shopping center owned by Kimco Development Corporation (hereinafter “Kimco”). The premises of several of Kimco’s tenants were also severely damaged. A negligence, warranty and strict liability action was commenced by Kimco and five (5) of its tenants against Michael D’s and various other defendants, including General Foam Corporation (hereinafter “General Foam”), the manufacturer of polyurethane foam carpet padding stored in Michael D’s basement. A second negligence, warranty and strict liability action was commenced by a sixth tenant against Kimco, Michael D’s and General Foam, amongst others, while a third negligence, warranty and strict liability action was commenced by Michael D’s, as plaintiff, against Kimco, General Foam and others. The three cases were consolidated for purposes of trial, which began on May 26, 1987, in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas.</p>
    <p id="b299-10" data-blocks='[["BL_299.11",299,[225,2058,1156,308]],["BL_300.1",300,[244,300,1163,671]]]'>On June 3, 1987, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Kimco, as plaintiff, and all tenant plaintiffs in the first two actions against General Foam on negligence and strict liability theories, and against Michael D’s on a negligence theory. In response to special interrogatories, the jury determined that General Foam was 20% negligent, and that Michael D’s was <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>80% negligent in causing the fire and resulting damage. No separate allocation of causal responsibility was made between Michael D’s, on a negligence theory, and General Foam on a strict liability theory. The jury specifically found that Michael D’s was not negligent in failing to install a sprinkler system on the premises. In the third action, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Michael D’s and against General Foam in the amount of $597,934.43 on the theory of strict product liability. The trial court refused to reduce Michael D’s recovery against General Foam by the percentage of negligence the jury had attributed to Michael D’s. Following the verdict, Michael D’s requested an award of delay damages which request was denied.</p>
    <p id="b300-4" data-blocks='[["BL_300.5",300,[239,1003,1163,842]]]'>The evidence adduced at trial and viewed in a light most favorable toward the verdict winners shows that shortly before the fire, Michael D’s received a large shipment of polyurethane foam carpet padding from General Foam which was stored from floor to ceiling in Michael D’s basement. It appears that the foam padding had been stored too close to ceiling light bulbs and that this caused the foam padding to ignite. The foam carpet padding had not been defectively designed, manufactured or packaged. However, General Foam faded to warn of the highly inflammatory nature of the foam padding and its capacity for causing rapid and uncontrolled spread of fire after ignition. In answers to special interrogatories, the jury found that General Foam had been negligent in failing to give adequate warning and that, hence, the product was “defective” under strict product liability theory because of the failure to warn.</p>

We have carefully reviewed the record in this case along with the opinions of the trial judge, and of the Superior Court, and we conclude that General Foam’s arguments are without merit. Likewise, we conclude that General Foam’s <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>argument that amended Pa.R.C.P. 238 is inapplicable to this case must be rejected as well. Appeal on that issue is now premature since the Superior Court remanded the case for the trial court to determine whether, under Rule 238, as amended (and hence held applicable to this case since the amended rule was expressly made applicable to cases pending on its adoption), delay damages were justified by the facts.</p>
    <p id="b302-4" data-blocks='[["BL_302.5",302,[230,686,1166,1482]]]'>General Foam finally contends that comparative negligence should constitute a defense to a products liability case brought under § 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts and specifically in the products liability case brought against it by Michael D’s in this litigation. We granted allocatur here to consider this important issue which has not been previously addressed by this Court. The Superior Court thought that “logic and simple fairness” demanded that the jury’s apportionment of negligence (80% to Michael D’s and 20% to General Foam) should have been applied in determining General Foam’s liability for Michael D’s fire loss. Nonetheless, the Superior Court concluded that the current state of the law in Pennsylvania is to the contrary. The Superior Court relied on our opinion in <em>McCown v. International Harvester Co., </em><a href="/pa/463/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="463 Pa. 13" data-case-ids="1707999" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0013-01">463 Pa. 13</a>, <a href="/pa/463/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="463 Pa. 13" data-case-ids="1707999" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0013-01">342 A.2d 381</a> (1975), where we specifically rejected contributory negligence as a defense in products liability actions brought under § 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. <em>McCown </em>was decided prior to the enactment of Pennsylvania’s Comparative Negligence Statute, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 7102 (effective June 27, 1978), and we have yet to consider the precise issue at stake here. Nonetheless, the Superior Court was persuaded to apply <em>McCown </em>by analogy on the theory that this Court has steadfastly refused to allow strict product liability actions to become “contaminated” by negligence principles. A similar conclusion was recently drawn about the current state of Pennsylvania law in this area by the United States Third Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Dillinger v. Caterpillar, Inc., </em><a href="/f2d/959/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="959 F.2d 430" data-case-ids="10520811" data-case-paths="/f2d/959/0430-01">959 F.2d 430</a> (3d Cir.1992).</p>

In <em>Kinard v.

In an era of giant corporate structures, utilizing the national media to sell their wares, the original concern for an emerging manufacturing industry has given way to the view that it <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>is now the consumer who must be protected. Courts have increasingly adopted the position that the risk of loss must be placed upon the supplier of the defective product without regard to fault or privity of contract.</blockquote>

Comparative negligence principles should be involved in product liability actions brought in accordance with Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. Imposition of liability on business enterprises which manufacture and sell products, without regard to their proportionate faults in bringing about the injuries complained of, is to burden them with an unwarranted and fundamentally unfair liability, which works to the serious detriment of our economy. Business enterprises are burdened with liabilities, frequently enormous, often bearing little relationship to the actual faults that caused injuries. To the extent that our decision in <em>McCown v.
