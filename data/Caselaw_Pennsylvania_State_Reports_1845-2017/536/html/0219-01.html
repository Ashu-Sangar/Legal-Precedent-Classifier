In addition, First Federal was required to maintain a private mortgage insurance policy for that portion of the mortgage and mortgage note in excess of seventy-two percent of the appraised value of the property. This insurance coverage was intended to protect the mortgage holder, U.R.A, in the event of default by the borrower.</p>

She applied for a loan in the amount of $50,000 for the purchase and rehabilitation of a house in one of the designated areas of the City of Pittsburgh. The loan application, which was completed by a First Federal representative during an interview with Foster and signed by Foster, reflected that Foster would make a down payment of three thousand dollars and that no part thereof consisted of borrowed funds.</p>

    <p id="b519-5" data-blocks='[["BL_519.6",519,[228,764,1157,585]]]'>When Foster defaulted on these loans, a claim for loss was filed by First Federal with Verex on June 6, 1988, and a supplemental claim for loss was filed on August 8, 1988. Verex investigated these claims and determined that Foster had borrowed three thousand dollars to make the down payment. Verex, thereafter, gave notice to the U.R.A. that it intended to rescind its certificate of insurance because of the misrepresentation which Foster had made on the mortgage loan application.

In response to a motion by First Federal, the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County entered a partial summary judgment in favor of First Federal and against Verex on the grounds, <em>inter alia, </em>that any alleged fraudulent misrepresentation by the borrower concerning the source of her down payment cannot be imputed to the insured, First Federal.</p>

The U.R.A. argues, therefore, that the parol evidence rule prohibits Verex from using parol evidence to add a term to the insurance policy.</p>
