However, to the east of Peirce’s plot and thirty feet away is “Commercial Drive” — a 70 feet wide driveway — which constitutes the main entrance to the Industrial Park and between Peirce’s land and Commerce Drive is a 30 feet strip of land which is occupied by a sewage pumping station, part of the Township’s sanitary sewer system. To the west of Peirce’s plot is the remainder of Peirce’s land— having a frontage of approximately 300 feet on the Avenue — now under lease for the storage of equipment and materials for a sewer contractor engaged in laying sewers for the Township. Adjoining this other land of Peirce to the west are three residences and next to them are a residence with a shop (used as a contractor’s shop and garage), an office and an apartment in the rear.</p>

The party seeking the variance has the burden of proving justification for its grant and he does not do so by proving a mere hardship but must prove an ‘unneces<a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>sary hardship’.” The difficulty arises in the application of the law to the facts of a particular case.</p>
    <p id="b288-4" data-blocks='[["BL_288.4",288,[260,481,1150,1665]]]'>An examination of the findings and opinion of the Board clearly indicates that the Board recognized that this lot of land was subject to a “hardship”. The Board stated, inter alia, “[Peirce] complains that the lot which he desires to sell, and the purchaser desires to use for a gasoline station, is contiguous to a limited industrial area, also a heavily traveled highway, that it faces a commercial area in an adjoining township, that it is subject to annoying chemical odors from Chemical Concentrates Company in Whitemarsh Township. <em>None of these facts are disputed■, </em>but while true, it must also be remembered that the remaining part of [Peirce’s] land and that of his residential neighbors is also subject to the same”. (Emphasis supplied). Furthermore, and most important on the question of “hardship”, there is uncontradicted testimony that this lot can not be sold for any purpose pei*mitted within the present zoning classification. Peirce testified that he had “received no offers for it” although efforts to that end were made; a Mr. Dager stated that, as a realtor, he had attempted to sell the property for over a year and had received no offers for it and, in his opinion, the property could not be used for residential purposes; a Mr. Leese, another realtor, stated that the property was not salable for any use permitted under the ordinance. That this lot is subject to a “hardship” is clear beyond question. It is not a situation, such as presented in <em>Crafton Borough Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/409/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="409 Pa. 82" data-case-ids="1883277" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0082-01">409 Pa. 82</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.2d%20533" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="185 A.2d 533">185 A. 2d 533</a>, where the property <em>could </em>be used for residential purposes but could be <em>more gainfully used </em>for the purpose of conducting a gasoline station.</p>

That employment of the land for such purposes is unfeasible and impossible is proven by the experience in trying to effect a sale of it for such purposes.</p>
    <p id="b289-4" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[208,699,1151,748]]]'>The crux of the decision of the Board is that, even though this land was subject to a “hardship”, the “hardship” was not unique to the property. In this respect, the Board completely ignored the realities of the situation. This property is: (1) the <em>only </em>property adjacent to the sewage pumping station; (2) the <em>only </em>property located in immediate proximity to the entrance to the Industrial Park and to the commercial and industrial enterprises located therein; (3) it is the <em>only </em>property in direct line from the chemical plant and the <em>first </em>property to get the odors when they emanate from the plant; (4) it is the <em>only </em>property which it has been shown, without contradiction, is unsalable for residential purposes.</p>

However, the rationale of <em>Ferry </em>is presently applicable because in both situations unless the variance is granted a confiscation of this land for practical purposes results. The Board, in effect, suggests that the remedy open to Peirce is by way of re-zoning by the Commissioners; that remedy has been exhausted and re-zoning has been denied. Peirce well argues that the position of the Board is: “We are inclined to agree that your land is being confiscated; however the land of your neighbors is equally being confiscated; therefore there is nothing unique in the confiscation taking place with respect to your land . . . .” As a practical matter, if this variance be denied, Peirce’s land is being confiscated but <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>we need not rest our determination upon this ground for the record clearly shows that Peirce has proven that this plot of ground is subject to an unnecessary “hardship” which is unique and peculiar to this particular lot and that the grant of this variance in nowise affects or injures the public interest.</p>
