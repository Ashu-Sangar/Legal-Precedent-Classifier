Sutliff, individually and as partners, t/d/b/a Sutliff Chevrolet Company.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Service of the summons was made on Leo E. Sutliff, the individual in charge of the Chevrolet Company. A complaint was subsequently filed in which the defendants were designated in the same manner as described in the summons above. After the statute of limitations had run, plaintiff-appellant discovered that Sutliff Chevrolet was a corporation and not a partnership. He thereupon moved to amend his complaint to change the designation of the defendant-company from a partnership to a corporation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The court below refused to permit the amendment on the grounds that it would introduce a new party into the action after the statute <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>of limitations had run against such party. This appeal followed.</p>

In that case, the original complaint designated the defendant as the “ ‘Pleasant Hills Realty Company, a corporation.’ ” After the statute of limitations had run, plaintiff attempted to change the description of the business entity from a corporation to a partnership. The test laid down by Justice Stern was whether “the right party ivas sued but under a wrong designation” — in which event the amendment was permissible — or whether “a wrong party was sued and the amendment was designed to substitute another and distinct party” — in which event the amendment was not permissible.

The amendment was not an attempt to impose additional liability on the individual owners of the company, but rather merely sought to correct the description of the business entity already made a party to the proceedings. The assets subject to liability were the same both before and after the amendment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
