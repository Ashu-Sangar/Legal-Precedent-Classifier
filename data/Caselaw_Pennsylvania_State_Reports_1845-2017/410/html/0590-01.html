The cases relied upon by appellees, among which were <em>Steiger Will, </em>9 Fiduc. Rep. 147 (Orphans’ Ct. Phila. Co. 1958) and <em>Brock’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/247/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="247 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1009545" data-case-paths="/pa/247/0365-01">247 Pa. 365</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=93%20A.%20487" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="93 A. 487">93 Atl. 487</a> (1915), do not support their position. In <em>Steiger, </em>a properly executed will was modified by a subsequent marriage. The codicils signed after the marriage had the legal effect of republishing the will. The will and codicil in <em>Brock’s Estate, </em>once valid, were later invalidated by a tearing of the single sheet on which they were written. Both were held republished when testator again affixed his signature to the torn sheet. The subsequent modification of the <em>Steiger </em>will and the destruction of the will and codicil in the <em>Brock </em>case were not defects in the initial signing of the instruments. Each, therefore, was capable of republication by subsequent appropriate act of testator. Here, however, the defect was failure to sign a testamentary disposition “at the end thereof.”</p>
