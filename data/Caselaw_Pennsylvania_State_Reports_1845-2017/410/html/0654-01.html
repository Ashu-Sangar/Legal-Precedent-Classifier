When Salary Board refused to act on the request, Local instituted a complaint in mandamus to compel Salary Board to establish this panel. Both parties moved for judgment on the pleadings, Salary Board contending that the Allegheny County Board of Prison Inspectors (Prison Board) was the proper party to appoint a panel under the Act of 1947. The lower court entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of Salary Board and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b678-4" data-blocks='[["BL_678.4",678,[237,1061,1147,582]]]'>The Act of 1947 provides, inter alia, that: “In order to avoid or minimize any possible controversies by making available full and adequate governmental facilities for the adjustment of grievances, the <em>governmental agency involved, </em>at the request of the public employes, shall, within fifteen (15) days of such request, set up a panel of three members, one to be selected by the employes, one by the governmental agency, and the two so selected to select a third member.” Act of June 30, 1947, P. L. 1183, §1, as amended, 43 P.S. §215.1 (1962 Supp.) (Emphasis supplied).</p>
    <p id="b678-5" data-blocks='[["BL_678.5",678,[235,1655,1147,197]]]'>The narrow issue confronting us, therefore, is whether Salary Board is the “governmental agency involved” under the aforesaid Act. We conclude that it is not.</p>

L. 829, Prison Board is responsible for the control, management, maintenance, and discipline over prison matters and prison employees. See <em>Miller v.

Since Prison Board is the agency exercising direct supervision over the employment activities of the members of Local, it is the body to whom the legislature contemplated that grievances should be submitted.</p>
    <p id="b679-4" data-blocks='[["BL_679.4",679,[201,635,1148,360]]]'>In addition, the salary schedules of prison employees cannot be considered by Salary Board without a request first being made to that body by the executive head of Prison Board.

Likewise, a more flexible <a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>procedural attitude by appellant might have produced an earlier approach to the merits of the. dispute.</p>
