Paper ballots were used to submit the question to the electorate and more than 28,000 votes were cast. The final result, as indicated by the open returns, gave a plurality of 99 votes against the adoption of the plan.</p>

It was the amendments to the code, by the Act of January 8, 1960, P. L. (1959) 2142, 25 P.S. §3063(a), that first permitted the use of a check (V) mark. In fact the code in effect as of the date of the <em>Norwood </em>decision provided: “Any ballot marked by any other mark than an (X) in the space provided for that purpose shall be void and not counted.” As enunciated in the <em>Norwood </em>case, the power to throw out a ballot for minor irregularities should be sparingly used. It should be done only for very compelling reasons. Again, in <em>Bauman, </em>supra, we said at page 456: “Marking a ballot in voting is a matter not <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>of precision engineering bnt of an unmistakable registration of the voter’s will in substantial conformity to statutory requirements.”</p>

The additions were mere surplusage. To say that the minor irregularities rendered the votes void, would disenfranchise these votes for very picayune reasons. In this connection it is noted that in the printed instructions on the ballot it did not say, USE A CROSS (X) OR A CHECK (V) ONLY.</p>

The provision in the code in respect to this subject must be construed. with great liberality: <em>Bauman Election Contest Case, </em>supra. In that case, a voter inserted a cross (X) in the proper square and added a horizontal line through the (X). In two other instances, voters inserted check (V) marks as well as the cross (X) in the voting square. It was held that these additional marks did not void the ballots. Certainly, the additional insertion of a horizontal line through a cross (X) is much more susceptible to identification than the additions involved herein. See also, <em>McCaffreys’ Appeals, </em><a href="/pa/337/0552-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="337 Pa. 552" data-case-ids="1197284" data-case-paths="/pa/337/0552-01">337 Pa. 552</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20A.2d%20893" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="11 A.2d 893">11 A. 2d 893</a> (1940), wherein it was said at page 559: “[N]ot every mark which may separate and distinguish a ballot will necessarily result in a declaration of invalidity, but only such marks as cannot be reasonably supposed to have been made by the voter except for the very purpose of distinguishing his ballot and which are appropriate to that end.” It appears unreasonable to us to say that the additions involved herein were for identification purposes, when such a large number of ballots were challenged for substantially the same reasons, and the inadequacies in the ballot instructions coincided with the reasons for the challenged votes.</p>

      <em> </em>This completely negates the fact that the marks were placed on the ballots by the voters for the purpose of identifying their ballots. That the voter placed the marks thereon for this purpose is basic to the conclusion that they were in fact identifying marks. See, <em>McCaffreys’ Appeals, </em>supra.</p>

    <p id="b89-4" data-blocks='[["BL_89.5",89,[163,1193,1155,1071]]]'>The main contention of counsel for appellee is that the amendment to the code by the Act of 1960, supra, in effect overruled the decisions of this Court previously cited herein, and constituted a clear expression of legislative intent that from the date of that enactment, a voter had to mark the ballot with an (X) or a (V) mark and nothing more. We do not so interpret the Act of 1960. The pertinent words involved which constituted an addition to the Act of 1937, supra, are as follows: “Provided, That all markings on the ballot are made by the same pen or pencil and that all markings on the ballot are the same type of marking either a cross (X) or check (V)-” This provision does not refer to the situations involved. It said and said only that a ballot shall be marked with the same markings throughout and with the same pen or pencil. It did not say that any additional minor insertions would nullify a ballot. If the legislature intended to overrule <em>Norwood, Bauman </em>and <em>James, </em>supra, language could easily have been set forth giving such expression.</p>
