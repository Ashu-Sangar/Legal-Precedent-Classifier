It is hornbook law that Sections 2 and 3 must be read and construed together, as well as in conjunction with any other pertinent provision of the Act. If Section 2 stood alone, we would consider it ambiguous and equally susceptible to the interpretation sought by the Commonwealth on the one hand and by the executor on the other hand. However, Section 3 provides, we repeat, that with respect to bequests to take effect after a life estate (or an estate for years) the tax on such estate shall not be payable or demandable “until the person liable for the same shall come into actual possession of such estate [and] the tax shall be assessed upon the value of the estate at the time the right of possession accrues to the owner, but the owner may pay the tax at any time prior to his coming into possession.” There is not the slightest doubt that, contrary to the contention of the Commonwealth, a tax is not demandable by the Commonwealth, nor can it compel a remainderman to pay inheritance tax on his future remainder interest <em>at or ■as of testator’s death. </em>The tax is payable <em>at the election, </em>not of the Commonwealth but, <em>of the owner </em>when he comes into actual possession or at his election “at any time prior to his coming into possession.” The Act further provides that “In such cases the tax shall be assessed on the value of the estate [not as of death but] at the time of the payment of the tax, after deducting the value of the life-estate or estates for years. . . .” Reading and construing these two sections <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>together it is clear that there is no merit in the Commonwealth’s contention. We agree with the appellee that Section <em>2, </em>when construed in conjunction with Section 3, refers to a tax on present interests as distinguished from a tax on present and/or future interests. If the Commonwealth’s contention were sound it would sometimes result that the owner of a remainder testamentary interest would not only receive nothing from the testator but would owe the Commonwealth, Pennsylvania Inheritance taxes. For example, if the value of the securities or assets in the trust substantially depreciated from the date of death to the date when the right of possession accrued (or payment was made by the remainderman if the tax is prepaid years after testator’s death but prior to possession) and in computing the <em>clear value of the remainder interest </em>as of date of payment with the Federal Estate taxes and the Pennsylvania Inheritance taxes (which had been paid years before) added on to the value of the remainder interest at date of payment, the tax on such remainder interest might easily exceed the market value of the then remaining assets.</p>
    <p id="b667-4" data-blocks='[["BL_667.4",667,[175,1555,1150,583]]]'>The contention of the Commonwealth that the remainder interest is claiming the Federal Estate taxes as a deduction- — whereas in reality .the Commonwealth is trying to resurrect the Federal Estate tax by adding it back to the value of the future interest at time of payment — was met and ably answered by Judge Le-fever in <em>Oberdorfer Estate, </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/20/0719-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="20 Pa.

We find no merit in this contention. When considered with all the language of that section and the purpose and objective of the' Act, the words “value of the estate” in Section 3 clearly and undoubtedly refer to the value of the owner’s <em>interest </em>at the time the right of possession accrues to the owner or at his election at the time of prepayment of the tax.
