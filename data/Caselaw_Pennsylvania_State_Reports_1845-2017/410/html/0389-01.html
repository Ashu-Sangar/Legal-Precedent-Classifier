    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.5",414,[231,1285,1148,529]]]'>The income from this testamentary trust initially was paid, in accordance with the trust’s terms to testator’s widow and children, all of whom are now dead. The income is now payable to testator’s living grandchildren and spouses and descendants of deceased grandchildren. One of testator’s grandchildren (whose share of the trust income was 5/48s), Geoffrey Tower, died on March 26,1957. Surviving him were his widow who died on December 4, 1959, two <em>natural </em>children and two children <em>adopted </em>in 1941.</p>

On January 16, 1962, a petition to review the adjudication, which awarded the income to the two natural children, was presented to the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County and the adjudication was opened to determine what, if any, rights the two adopt<a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>ed children had to share in Geoffrey Tower’s portion of the income from the trust. On March 20, 1962, Judge Lefever, the auditing judge, decided that the two adopted children had no rights in the testator’s estate. On exceptions filed to this supplemental adjudication, the court en banc, speaking through Judge Bolger, confirmed this supplemental adjudication.</p>
    <p id="b415-4" data-blocks='[["BL_415.4",415,[193,760,1149,577]]]'>The question presented upon this appeal is: “Where: A testator gives a share of income to a grandson for life and directs that at the grandson’s death such income shall pass to the grandson’s ‘children and issue of deceased children ... in the same shares and proportions they would take in distribution under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania from their deceased parent’ and [t]he grandson dies leaving four children— two by birth and two by adoption; . . ."<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> do the two <em>adopted </em>children share equally with the two <em>natural </em>children the share of such income?</p>
    <p id="b415-5" data-blocks='[["BL_415.5",415,[186,1365,1153,855]]]'>After a careful examination of the will of this testator and the authorities cited in the excellent briefs submitted by appellants and appellees, we find ourselves in full agreement with the conclusion reached by the auditing judge and confirmed by the court en banc: “. . ., the instant testator’s will controls the controversy. His meaning must be determined from his will in the light of the law in effect on July 24, 1889. His will begins with words of <em>blood, </em>viz., ‘children’, ‘grandchildren’, ‘issue’ and ‘lineal descendants’, and closes with ‘descent from me’, also words of blood. It is inescapable that testator, by the language he used, intended to include only relatives of his blood and to exclude strangers to the blood, as subsequent takers of income on a grandchild’s death. [The adopted children], therefore, are not entitled to share.”</p>

    <p id="b416-4" data-blocks='[["BL_416.5",416,[252,427,1148,638]]]'>The conclusion of the majority places too limited and too narrow an interpretation upon testator’s language, Ms intention and the future objects of his generosity. I am unable to conclude that testator, in 1889, in employing the words “children” and “issue”, intended to exclude the two adopted children of his grandson (adopted by him in 1941) from participating with that grandson’s natural children (at the grandson’s death in 1957) in the share of income formerly received by their father. I would construe testator’s language to include his grandson’s children by both adoption and birth. I dissent.</p>
