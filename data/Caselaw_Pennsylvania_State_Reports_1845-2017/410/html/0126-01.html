Nesselsons were then haying financial difficulties. The People’s National Bank &amp; Trust Company (Bank) held a first mortgage against Nesselsons’ interests upon which mortgage was owing $117,388.82, the United Refining Company (United) held a $5651.30 judgment and there were other judgments totalling $8262.31, all junior in lien to the Bank’s mortgage. The Bank was then threatening a foreclosure of its mortgage.</p>
    <p id="b150-4" data-blocks='[["BL_150.4",150,[213,900,1153,1182]]]'>Nesselsons interested W. L. Jenkins, Jr., (Jenkins), an accountant without experience in oil production, in purchasing their interests. Jenkins contacted United and the Bank about resetting their respective loans. According to Jenkins, United’s president, a Mr. Logan, (now deceased) informed him that lack of finances prevented proper operation of Nesselsons’ operations, that United bought and would continue to buy their oil, that an increase in the price of oil was anticipated and that United, not an oil producer, was not interested in taking over Nesselsons’ operations. After viewing Nesselsons’ properties, Jenkins approached the Bank about the possibility of refinancing its loan but the Bank was not then receptive. Jenkins so informed Logan and Logan promised to use his influence with the Bank. The Bank then became receptive to the possibility of refinancing the loan and eventually made a proposal to Jenkins under which Jenkins would post $40,000 in an escrow account for improvement of the properties. Jenkins could only provide from his own funds $25,000 but he secured the promise of United to advance the additional $15,000 when- needed.</p>

On December 8, 1955, the Bank agreed to refinance the mortgage provided Jenkins place $50,000 for improvements of the properties in an escrow account and as<a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>sign to the Bank all the proceeds from the sale of oil to be used in paying the interest and principal on the mortgage and in operating costs. On December 19, the Bank modified its proposal by reducing the amount from $50,000 to $25,000 with the understanding that, when requested, Jenkins would deposit an additional $15,000. The Bank, on December 20, wrote United, enclosing a copy of its letter of December 19 to Jenkins, and requesting that United execute a letter stating that it would loan Jenkins $15,000 to be repaid <em>after </em>payment of the Bank’s mortgage. On December 28 United wrote the Bank that the proposed letter was unacceptable inasmuch as it would not wait to be paid until the Bank’s mortgage had been paid. On January 3, United wrote the Bank that it would loan $15,-000 to Jenkins on a note “payable to [United’s] order, and at a rate [to be agreed upon between United and Jenkins] which will not interfere in any way with his obligation or commitments under the mortgage loan at [the Bank] or with the orderly development of the property until <em>January 1, 1958, </em>after which definite monthly installments of $500 will be provided for to continue to the final liquidation of the note.” (emphasis supplied). On January 5, the Bank wrote Jenkins outlining the terms upon which it would refinance the mortgage; that all proceeds from the oil properties would be assigned to the Bank; after January 1, 1958, 25% of the oil proceeds would be applied to the mortgage interest and principal but, if 25% was insufficient, then as much as necessary to pay on interest and principal; the remaining 75% (if not required) would be available for payment on United’s loan to Jenkins and the balance held by the Bank as further security; after August 1, 1958, 10% of the oil proceeds was to be applied to payment of mortgage interest and principal if such was adequate for the purpose; that “. . .

On February 13, 1957, Jenkins Avrote United requesting an additional $7,000 and enclosed a $10,000 promissory note (covering the original $3,000 and the additional $7,000) Avhich note limited the recourse-thereon to Jenkins’ properties in McKean County. On February 20, United returned this note stating,-inter alia: “However Ave have no particular objection to an additional $7,000 but we do object to loaning it on -a note which limits payment to money that you may eventually recover from the Nesselson property <em>... in all of our discussions it has been agreed that we were to loan you money on your own signature but this is the first time the question of advancing money against the property alone has been raised.” </em>(emphasis supplied).

The court below should not have permitted the introduction of parol evidence to affect the terms of this note, complete on its face, in the absence of any averment of fraud, accident or mistake. Without such parol evidence, the record clearly shows that United was entitled to a verdict against Jenkins and the court below should have so directed. Not having done so, the court erred.</p>

    <p id="b158-4" data-blocks='[["BL_158.4",158,[242,690,1147,573]]]'>The basis upon which Jenkins seeks a recovery against United in his counterclaim is the so-called crude oil purchase agreement of April 1, 1957 under which United agreed to purchase and Jenkins agreed to sell all the crude oil produced by Jenkins. So far as herein pertinent, this agreement was to continue <em>“so long as there remains unpaid awy indebtedness a/nd interest thereon of </em>[Jenhins] <em>to </em>[United] . . . .” On March 19, 1958, this agreement was cancelled by United upon the ground that Jenkins had defaulted in payment of his indebtedness to United.</p>

    <p id="b158-6" data-blocks='[["BL_158.6",158,[240,1732,1148,582]]]'>Jenkins’ interpretation of this clause of the agreement is that as long as Jenkins owed United an indebtedness, regardless of whether Jenkins was in <em>default </em>in paying this indebtedness, the agreement continues in full force and effect. In his brief, Jenkins makes clear this position: “In any event, what difference does it make whether Jenkins defaulted or did not default? The agreement does not contain any language predicated on a default. . . . even if there were a default, the fact remains that the indebtedness was unpaid.”</p>

In its opinion, the court below, in construction of the language of the agreement, stated: “The agreement does not contain any language predicated on a default. It [the agreement] is specific in its terms that it ‘was to continue so long as there remains any unpaid indebtedness and interest thereon”, <em>so even if there were a default the fact remains that the indebtedness was </em>unpaid.” (emphasis supplied). It is obvious that the theory on which the court proceeded was erroneous in two respects; in its premise that the note could, by parol evidence, be altered as to its source of payment and in its premise that, even if a default on Jenkins’ part had occurred, such default would not justify a cancellation of the agreement.</p>
