Richette, is an attorney in good standing at the Philadelphia Bar. E. W. Richardson, was an employee of the Pennsylvania Railroad, working as a station cleaner. On Aug. 13, 1957, he was injured in an accident involving the railroad company. On March 28, 1958, he engaged L. J. Richette as his attorney, signing a power of attorney to that effect. On April 3, 1958, Attorney Richette received a letter from Richardson, which stated that he was revoking his power of attorney to him. In due time, Mr. Richette concluded that Richardson had been coerced into signing the revocation of power of attorney by certain representatives of the Brotherhood of <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>Railway &amp; Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express &amp; Station Employees (hereafter called the Union or Brotherhood), and of the Pennsylvania Railroad. He brought a suit in trespass against the named individuals involved, as well as the Brotherhood and the Railroad, charging them with having illegally interfered with the contract outstanding between him and Richardson, and claiming compensatory damages in the sum of $10,000, plus punitive damages in the sum of $120,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Various post-trial motions were filed. The court entered judgment n.o.v. as to punitive damages and ordered a new trial on the compensatory verdict.</p>
    <p id="b32-5" data-blocks='[["BL_32.5",32,[229,1208,1146,260]]]'>The case is now before us with the plaintiff asking that the verdict of the jury, as originally rendered, be restored, and the defendants asking that the order for a new trial be reversed and judgment n.o.v. be entered on the compensatory verdict.</p>

With that kind of light illuminating the printed pages, the following facts stand out practically in bold type. As already stated, Richardson was injured on August 13, 1957, the injury being a fractured ankle. He was treated at the Presbyterian Hospital in Philadelphia where he was visited by Robert E. Shultz, railroad claim agent, who informed him that it would be to his best interests to deal with the railroad company in settling his case. By February, 1958, Richardson’s <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>railroad retirement benefits were exhausted and Mr. Shultz on March 6, 1958, advanced to him $250 to provide living necessities, the amount to be credited against his ultimate settlement with the railroad company.</p>
    <p id="b33-3" data-blocks='[["BL_33.4",33,[203,627,1149,534]]]'>In the latter part of March, 1958, Richardson called on Bernard Spencer, a “protective committeeman,” or shop steward of the Brotherhood, to speak about his accident and hoped-for monetary remuneration. Spencer said that he would turn Richardson’s case over to Samuel D. Solomon, another protective committeeman of the Union, who would call on him the following day. Solomon failed to make the call promised by Spencer, and Richardson accordingly engaged L. J. Riehette to represent him as his attorney.</p>
    <p id="b33-4" data-blocks='[["BL_33.5",33,[202,1172,1148,529]]]'>The evening after engaging Riehette, Solomon called at Richardson’s home and, after learning of the attorney relationship, said to Richardson: “You did the wrong thing.” Richardson testified to the following conversation: “He said, ‘Mr. Shultz won’t let you have any more money.’ I said: ‘I will need some money to live on. I haven’t got anything. I have a wife to support. There is nothing coming in.’ He said: ‘You can’t have any time for that lawyer. You are going to be out of a job.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b33-5" data-blocks='[["BL_33.6",33,[199,1714,1150,639]],["BL_34.1",34,[228,348,1146,318]]]'>The next day Richardson went to see Shultz in his office. Solomon was there. Richardson testified that the following conversation occurred at that time and in that place: “Q. Will you tell us what went on in Mr. Shultz’s office? A. Do you mean what was said in there? Q. Yes. A. I went in there. Mr. Shultz said, ‘I heard you retained a lawyer.’ I told him I did. He went into the other room and then came out and said, ‘We can’t do anything for you as long as you have got that lawyer.’ I said, ‘I need something now to live on because I have not got anything.’ He said, ‘Is the $250 gone?’ I said, ‘That is done and gone.’ Q. What <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>else did Mr. Shultz tell you? A. He walked into this other room and then came out and said he could not let me have any more money until I got shed of this lawyer. Q. This is the second shed’? A. I asked him how would I go about getting shed of the lawyer. In other words, what steps would I take.”</p>
    <p id="b34-4" data-blocks='[["BL_34.4",34,[226,676,1146,524]]]'>Richardson then explained that Shultz gave him a typed letter and told him to go outside the office. Solomon went along with him and instructed him to copy in his own handwriting the words on the typed letter. He did this and the letter was mailed by Solomon to Richette. The letter read as follows: I am hereby revoking my power of attorney I signed with you as I have never wanted any attorney to represent me and my claim against the penn R-R. Elford W. Richardson.”</p>
    <p id="b34-5" data-blocks='[["BL_34.5",34,[225,1220,1146,310]]]'>The letter was introduced as an exhibit in the case and reveals the handwriting of a person obviously a comparative stranger to writing instruments. It is also patently clear that the language in the letter was one which could hardly come from Richardson, a person of extremely limited education.</p>
    <p id="b34-6" data-blocks='[["BL_34.6",34,[223,1541,1147,694]]]'>Richardson testified further that while in Shultz’s office he was asked many questions and then he was handed a paper to sign. "Q. When all of this typing was completed, did Mr. Shultz or Mr. Solomon sit down and read this to you? A. No, they did not read it to me. Q. Will you tell us what happened? A. He handed it to me and told me to read it. I told him I could not read all that stuff. Q. You are not educated enough to read that stuff. A. I am not educated enough to read all that stuff. . . . Q. Did you have any idea as to what it stated in that affidavit? A. No, I don’t. I know I was getting shed of my lawyer on account of the pressure that was on me.”</p>

We have here a practically illiterate naan, 58 years of age at the time, injured, unable to get around except on crutches, destitute, hoping to get funds which would assure him of food for himself and wife, being threatened that if he didn’t discharge his attorney who could help him to get what he was entitled to for his injury, he would not only receive no immediate funds but he would lose his job, the only train in which he could ride on, over the bumpy tracks of an uncertain economic world.</p>
    <p id="b35-3" data-blocks='[["BL_35.4",35,[205,965,1149,413]]]'>All this unquestionably spelt out a case of coercion. Richardson’s testimony was controverted, it is true, in places it was self-contradictory, but the jury passed on his credibility, it reconciled the inconsistencies in his testimony, and it concluded that the proved facts in the trial warranted a conclusion that he had been intimidated into breaking his contract with the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b35-4" data-blocks='[["BL_35.5",35,[197,1399,1154,966]],["BL_36.1",36,[242,370,1148,684]]]'>The jury was warranted in finding from the evidence presented that the named defendants coordinated, through wile, stratagem and deception to separate an attorney from his client. It could not be said, as a matter of the law, that the jury went astray when they concluded, as they must have, that Richardson did not voluntarily write a letter revoking his power of attorney to Richette. Logic, sequence of events, and palpable circumstances justify their conclusion that the railroad company representatives prepared a letter of revocation, that they employed a maneuver to have Richardson copy that letter outside the railroad company office, thinking that this would wipe away their participation in the affair; that they supplied Richardson with the paper on which he was to copy the letter of revocation; that Solomon, working with the railroad, supervised the copying, and supplied the envelope, in which he placed the letter, which he consigned to the <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>United States mails. The jury were warranted in concluding that all the named defendants were a part of this plan and participated fully in the enterprise which finally resulted in depriving a member of the Philadelphia bar from legal business properly his. With these facts in the case, the jury was justified in imposing punitive damages on the defendants to the end that they, as well as all other persons and entities, should become aware that it is contrary to law and fair dealings in the United States, to sledgehammer a wedge between a lawyer and his client when both are satisfied with each other and have not invited intermeddling and officious intervention.</p>
    <p id="b36-4" data-blocks='[["BL_36.4",36,[242,1082,1148,802]],["BL_37.1",37,[203,365,1148,153]]]'>It is evident from the results that the jury paid no heed, and laudably so, to the banal, commonplace animadversions passed generally on lawyers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Judge Alessandronl, who presided at the trial, excellently put these hackneyed, mirthless, pointless so-called witticisms to rest when he instructed the jury: “Everyone engaged in the legal profession is aware of a longstanding opinion that a layman has had of lawyers, generally. Frankly it is not a good one. Rightly or wrongly, the opinion of the average layman towards a lawyer, is one of suspicion except with respect to his own lawyer. Then when he has his own lawyer, or chosen his own legal representative, his relationship with his lawyer is very much like the relationship of patient and doctor. He has complete confidence and <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>respect in Mm. You have got to get out of your mind any general impression you have, or strong impressions you may have about lawyers as a class or as a group.”</p>
    <p id="b37-3" data-blocks='[["BL_37.4",37,[201,529,1150,641]]]'>The trial judge also held the scales of justice equally balanced when he discussed corporations and unions: “It is also general information that there are many people who have no time for corporations; who have no time for railroads, transportation companies, taxicab companies, or public utilities. They have the impression that they are oppressive groups because of their magnitude, and financial power, because they crush the little man. That is a lot of nonsense. If there is any one in the jury that have such ideas about the defendants in this case dealing in that category, he should get out of the jury at once.</p>
    <p id="b37-4" data-blocks='[["BL_37.5",37,[196,1181,1150,362]]]'>“Now, there are some people who do not like unions. That is too bad. Unions serve a very fine purpose and a very important need in the hands of proper men. If there are any one of you members that have any prejudices against the union or the brotherhood in this case, he should get out of the jury because he is not fit to serve.”</p>
    <p id="b37-5" data-blocks='[["BL_37.6",37,[192,1564,1152,583]]]'>The evidence in the case justified the verdict which was rendered. Anyone has the right to advise a person in legal difficulties to change lawyers just as one concerned about a friend’s health may recommend him to a doctor other than the one presently prescribing for him. Such advice, however, must not be accompanied with threats. The use of such threats, all accruing to the serious disadvantage of the persons involved, may well be interpreted as reflecting that kind of malice, vindictiveness and wanton disregard of the lawyer’s or doctor’s rights which would call for punitive damages.</p>
    <p id="b37-6" data-blocks='[["BL_37.7",37,[191,2158,1148,207]],["BL_38.1",38,[242,363,1147,578]]]'>The court en banc, passing upon the various post-trial motions, held that the defendants were not subject to punitive damages because it said one of them, Bernard Spencer, was not really part of the conspira<a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>torial enterprise charged by the plaintiff, and that, therefore under the rule announced in <em>McCarthy v.

This Court said in the <em>McCarthy </em>case: “. . . the jury should have been instructed, as respects exemplary damages beyond compensation for the injury done to the plaintiff, to assess them according to the acts of the most innocent of the defendants, and if any defendant was not liable for exemplary damages, none should be included in the verdict . . .”</p>
    <p id="b38-4" data-blocks='[["BL_38.4",38,[243,959,1146,739]]]'>The jury in the case at bar did find Bernard Spencer responsible with the other defendants for the damages suffered by the plaintiff, and included him as liable for both compensatory and exemplary damages. The court en banc said that “there was no evidence to substantiate that Spencer said or did anything that could remotely connect him with the revocation of plaintiff’s power of attorney or that Spencer’s acts were malicious, vindictive or committed with wanton disregard of plaintiff’s rights. Therefore, the claim for punitive damages as to defendant Spencer must fall and with it falls the plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages against the joint tortfeasors who are the other defendants in the case before us.”</p>
    <p id="b38-5" data-blocks='[["BL_38.5",38,[244,1718,1146,639]],["BL_39.1",39,[187,357,1147,261]]]'>Although the court en banc excluded Spencer from the punitive damages, it did not reverse the verdict of the jury with regard to his involvement for compensatory damages. The jury found, and properly so, that Spencer was an active agent in the series of events which resulted in Richardson’s revoking the power of attorney he had given to Richette. Whether that participation was of such a character as to charge Spencer with a wanton disregard of the plaintiff’s rights was a question of fact for the jury. The jury found he did so wantonly disregard the plaintiff’s rights. The phrase, “malice, vindictiveness and wanton disregard” <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>of another’s rights as used in this type of a ease does not necessarily mean a malignant scheming against another person. It encompasses that kind of conduct which is so wholly reckless of another’s rights as to call for a monetary penalty.</p>
    <p id="b39-4" data-blocks='[["BL_39.4",39,[182,629,1150,643]]]'>The record shows that Spencer was the first link in the chain of circumstances which finally pulled Richardson out of Richette’s law offices. Spencer testified that when Richardson came to him for advice and assistance he said he would refer the case to their “local chairman” A1 Nowak, and he promised Richardson he would write to Nowak. Spencer testified he wrote a letter but did not date it or mail it. He explained he did not send the letter because “I felt that my fellow representative Samuel Solomon <em>and myself </em>could better take care of this man than our local chairman.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>
    <p id="A6v" data-blocks='[["BL_39.5",39,[176,1282,1153,693]]]'>It will be recalled that it was Solomon who threatened Richardson with loss of his job and who colluded with Shultz to exert “pressure” on Richardson, and who had Richardson copy the letter which was prepared in Shultz’s office discharging Richette, and it was he who mailed that letter. Spencer stated that he consulted with Solomon about the case, that Solomon reported to him after he had talked with Richardson, that he kept in “close touch or harmony” with Solomon, that he discussed “arrangements” with Solomon, that he advised Solomon to go see Shultz, that Solomon reported back to him, and that he knew that a lawyer for Richardson was involved.</p>

It is to be noted also in this connection that Shultz, who closed the railroad purse strings to Richardson, admitted that he talked to Spencer about the case, after first denying he had done so.</p>
    <p id="b40-4" data-blocks='[["BL_40.4",40,[264,622,1147,690]]]'>Spencer’s name is so intertwined in the whole story of this whole extraordinary happening that it is impossible to say as a matter of law that he should have been excluded from the jury’s consideration. Spencer’s attitude in court was something to give the jury pause. He spoke derogatorily of Richardson’s visit to him, stating that “He came to me for ridicule rather than assistance.” Such a statement could not possibly agree with the facts because it was quite clear that Richardson went to him because he needed money since he was unable to work on account of his fractured leg and it was with considerable effort that he dragged himself to the office of Spencer to ask about his case.</p>

When he was asked about the letter he wrote to Nowak but never mailed and as to when he dated it, he replied: “As near as I can answer that question, sir, was when I realized that Mr. Richette was going to make a case out of this case.”</p>
    <p id="b40-6" data-blocks='[["BL_40.6",40,[265,1811,1146,423]]]'>When he manifested some evasion in answering questions put to him on cross-examination, the trial judge said: “Do you think you gentlemen are far apart from each other now?” To this, Spencer replied: “I told the man before if I get anywhere excited, I scream.

This statement contains three adjectives, but they are not necessarily cohesive. In construing a contract, each and every part of it must be taken into consideration and given effect if possible. <em>(Ivey Co. v. Franklin </em>Associates, <a href="/pa/370/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="370 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="1234538" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0225-01">370 Pa. 225</a>). The court below having amputated away the “irrevocable” feature of this case, there is no point in constantly referring to the contract as irrevocable.

A champertous agree<a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>ment is one in which a person having otherwise no interest in the subject matter of an action undertakes to carry on the suit at his own expense in consideration of receiving a share of what is recovered. This, of course, is abstract language. An agreement can be regarded champertous only when it is demonstrated that it does what the law does not allow. The adjective “champertous”, as here used in the brief adds nothing to solving the problem on appeal. It is simply ornamental, so that the only part of the accusatory statement which is left is that one which designates the Richette-Richardson agreement as a “contingent fee” agreement.

But the facts do not sustain this view. Contingent fees are not illegal. They enable some just claims to be recovered which the circumstances of the parties would otherwise defeat, while on the other hand they certainly tend to encourage litigation of a speculative and unfounded character, which is against the true interests of society. But, wisely or unwisely, a point on which opinions may fairly differ, the law has long been settled that contracts for such fees are lawful and enforceable by the courts and <em>something more than the mere contingency of the compensation is necessary to make them champertous.” </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>

In addition, the concept of justice itself would be dealt a staggering blow. Our present Chief Justice John C. Bell has said: “However, I regard the contingent fee as a necessity for a poor man. A poor man is entitled to representation by a lawyer of his choice, whom he considers able or very able. In many civil and criminal cases a poor person is unable to engage such a lawyer except on the basis of a contingent fee.

But a new trial may not be ordered merely because of abrasive answers which are made to questions which seek to demolish the reliability and credibility of the witness.

    <p id="b52-4" data-blocks='[["BL_52.4",52,[274,525,1149,965]]]'>Richardson was injured. Thereafter he signed a contract employing Richette as his attorney to represent him in his claim for damages. Under the terms of this contract Richette was to receive a fee of one-third of the amount Richardson recovered, out of which third Richette was to be repaid such expenses as he had advanced. Richardson wrongfully discharged Richette as his attorney and settled directly his claim for the injuries he had suffered. Richardson received in settlement $8,500. On the basis of such settlement, Richette would have been entitled to one-third, less the amount of his expenses. A majority of this Court has now decided to award Richette, inter alia, compensatory damages in the sum of $10,000, on the theory that a jury would have awarded Richardson a verdict of <em>more than $80,000. </em>On the face of it, an award to Richette in compensatory damages alone of more than Richardson received would appear unjust.</p>
    <p id="b52-5" data-blocks='[["BL_52.5",52,[272,1501,1149,692]]]'>The injustice of such an award by this Court is made even clearer by the opinion of the lower court which pertinently said: “The verdict of the jury in awarding compensatory damages in the sum of $10,000 was excessive and perverse. ... In addition to the ex-cessiveness of the verdict a new trial must be granted because of the numerous prejudicial remarks of the plaintiff on the witness stand .... In addition to the foregoing a new trial should be granted because plaintiff’s witness, Richardson, repeatedly admitted that he lied in his deposition of June 1958 as he was trying to hold a job with the Railroad Company. A verdict based upon such testimony cannot stand.”</p>

It will suffice to say that the evidence in this <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>case is so widely and highly conflicting and the amount which Richardson could likely have recovered if his case had been tried, is so <em>conjectural, </em>that I am convinced it is impossible for this Court to fairly and justly fix the dollar amount of compensatory damages.</p>
    <p id="b53-4" data-blocks='[["BL_53.4",53,[208,627,1147,150]]]'>For these reasons I would affirm the order of the lower court granting a new trial in respect to compensatory damages.</p>
