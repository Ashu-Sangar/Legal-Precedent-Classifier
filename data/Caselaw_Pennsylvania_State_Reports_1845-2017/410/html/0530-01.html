Haviland, sixty-seven years of age, a passenger in an automobile owned by the Lumbermans Mutual Casualty Company (Lumbermans) and operated by one Robert E. Lee, was lulled when the automobile was struck by a bus owned by the Philadelphia Transportation Company and operated by one of its employees.</p>

The plaintiff, Girard Trust Corn Exchange Bank, Executor of Haviland’s estate, sued the same defendant under the Pennsylvania Survival Statute. Lumber-mans and Lee were joined as additional defendants in both actions, which were consolidated for the purposes of trial. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs and against the original defendant, the Philadelphia Transportation Company alone.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The award <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>in the wrongful death action was $35,300 and in the survival action $132,210.</p>

Lumbermans’ automobile, operated by Lee, was proceeding west in the most southerly lane of. the north tier of the parkway. This is a one-way thoroughfare for westbound traffic and it is 80 feet in width. The bus was traveling south on 22nd Street, which was for one-way southbound traffic. Twenty-second Street is 50 feet wide and there is a single set of transit trolley car tracks located in the center of the roadway. The intersection was controlled by a traffic light and the testimony at trial was in sharp conflict as to which vehicle was proceeding on the green light. The front of the bus struck the right side of Lumbermans automobile, when the latter vehicle was more than two-thirds through the intersection. The force of the impact threw Lumbermans’ automobile up against a tree located on the grass plot maintained between the north and south tiers of the parkway. Haviland was forcibly ejected or thrown from the automobile, suffering injuries which caused his death nineteen days later.</p>

It is the contention of the transportation company that Lee’s own testimony convicts him of negligence as a matter of law, that the plaintiffs are bound by his <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>testimony and that his negligence is imputable to Haviland. It is urged that Lee admittedly did not look to his right at the intersection (the direction from which traffic was approaching on 22nd Street), until the automobile he was operating was at least two-thirds through the intersection. If this be the fact, Lee was guilty of negligence as a matter of law. At an intersection, an operator of a motor vehicle must be vigilant and look for approaching traffic before attempting to cross the intersecting street. This responsibility is no less binding at an intersection controlled by a traffic light: <em>Perpetua v.

On direct examination, he stated that <em>before </em>proceeding through the intersection, he looked to his right and to his left. Again, on cross-examination, he said he first looked in both directions “before I entered the intersection.” Subsequently, on cross-examination, he testified that the first time he looked to his right was when the automobile was almost through the intersection. <em>The witness was not confronted with this conflict or contradiction. </em>The case of <em>Smith v.

On part of it he was plainly entitled to go to the jury, on the other part equally plainly he was not. Under these circumstances the case must go to the jury, whose province it is to reconcile conflicting statements, whether of the same or different witnesses, or to draw the line between them and say which shall prevail.’ ” Further, it is fundamental that in considering the merits of a motion for judgment n.o.v., the testimony must be read in the light most favorable to plaintiffs’ case, <em>Stimac v. Bar</em>

Additionally, contributory negligence, as a matter of law, should be declared only in a very clear case and only where the evidence of such is so clear and palpable that there is no room for fair and sensible men to differ as to its existence. See, <em>Dougherty v.

    <p id="b558-7" data-blocks='[["BL_558.7",558,[252,1131,1147,532]]]'>Haviland was employed by Lumbermans in the role of Senior Vice-President.

Peculiarly, he was immediately rehired to perform substantially the same duties in consideration of the payment of about one-half his former salary plus the furnishing and maintenance by Lumbermans of an automobile and a chauffeur for his personal exclusive use. He continued to receive the pension payments.</p>
    <p id="b558-8" data-blocks='[["BL_558.8",558,[252,1675,1148,688]]]'>The automobile was provided by Lumbermans. Lee, the chauffeur, was selected by Haviland with Lumberman’s approval. Lee was paid by Lumbermans. He had never worked for Lumbermans previously and was not so employed after Haviland’s death. The automobile was garaged at Haviland’s home. Lee drove Haviland exclusively and received daily directions from him alone. On the usual day, Lee drove Haviland' from his home to the office; picked him up at noontime and drove him to his club for lunch; drove him back to the office; picked him up later on in the day and drove him to his club for dinner; later on drove him back to his home. On one occasion, he drove him to Florida.</p>

      <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>On tbe day in question, Lee drove Haviland to Summit, New Jersey, to attend a business meeting for Lumbermans. That evening, Haviland represented the company at a dinner-business meeting in tbe Warwick Hotel in Philadelphia. It was on tbe way home immediately following tbe dinner meeting that this unfortunate accident occurred.</p>
    <p id="b559-3" data-blocks='[["BL_559.4",559,[169,741,1150,1460]]]'>There is no question that on tbe occasion involved, Lee was acting in tbe furtherance of Lumbermans’ business. At trial, it was admitted that it was answerable for any existing negligence on the part of Lee. However, a person may be tbe servant of two masters or at least subject to tbe exercise of tbe right of control of two different individuals at one and tbe same time. See, <em>Koontz v.
