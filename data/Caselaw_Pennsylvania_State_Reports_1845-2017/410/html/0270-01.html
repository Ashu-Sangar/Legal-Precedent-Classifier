It is to be noted that this statute provides that the city [Authority] <em>may </em>tender its bond to the property owner and may present its bond to the court. In view of the basic purpose of this statute, i.e., the <em>securing </em>of compensation to property owners in accord with the constitutional mandate, the word “may” must be construed as “shall”, as mandatory rather than permissive: <em>Hotel Casey Co. v. Ross, </em><a href="/pa/343/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="343 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="1208315" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0573-01">343 Pa. 573</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.2d%20737" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="23 A.2d 737">23 A. 2d 737</a>; <em>Melnick v.

      <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>The Act of 1903, supra, requires that, if the Authority and the property owner cannot agree upon the price or damages to be paid, the Authority must tender a bond and <em>then, </em>upon refusal or nonacceptance by the property owner of the bond tender, the Authority must proceed in court. Obviously, the statute requires these steps to be taken <em>preliminary </em>to any court procedure. In this connection it is most important to note the position taken by our courts on the <em>nature </em>of such preliminary steps. In <em>Darlington v. U.S., </em><a href="/pa/82/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="82 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="1047956" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0382-01">82 Pa. 382</a>, this Court held that the condemnor’s failure to establish that an attempt had been made to agree with the property owner on the price or damages to be paid was of such nature as to deprive the court of <em>jurisdiction </em>to appoint viewers. <em>In re Bond of Equitable Gas Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/72/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="72 Pa.

This Court said (p. 410) : “The jurisdiction given to the Common Pleas, in this respect, is a special one, contrary to the course of the common law, and must therefore be strictly pursued. It is not shown that the owner . . . was requested to permit an entry, or to agree upon the compensation, or to join in the appointment of men to assess the amount. <em>In the absence of these preliminary steps, the application to the Common Pleas was </em>

A review of these authorities clearly indicates that the condemning authority’s failure to establish compliance with the preliminary steps required by the statute does go to the <em>jurisdiction </em>of the court. Such being so, it is the duty of the condemning authority to establish such jurisdictional facts or to show that it would have been vain and useless under the particular circumstances to pursue the preliminary steps.</p>

It would have been a useless and idle ceremony to have made a tender . . . .” The legislature never intended the performance of the futile act of tendering a bond to a property owner whose actions so <em>completely </em>indicated that under no circumstances would such tender have been accepted. Under the instant facts performance of the statutory requirement of tendering a bond should be excused. The jurisdiction of the court below, <em>which clearly had jurisdiction over cases of this general character, </em>could not be ousted because of the non-performance by the Authority of an act the performance of which appellant’s own actions had clearly frustrated.</p>

In that case, the question of “the damage [was] a subordinate question; the predominant <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>and controlling one [was] the right to enter” and the “right of a younger franchise to take possession of and appropriate the franchise and property of an older one . . . .” (p. 359).</p>
