The purpose of the foregoing rule is to discourage secret liens or equities against property, particularly real property, where the owner of the lien, encumbrance or equity may record it or institute proceedings immediately, and make it a matter of permanent record from which those who deal with the property thereafter may learn that the owner does not have a perfect title to the land involved: <em>Puharic v.

It appears that for the years 1880 to 1917, inclusive, the land was assessed in the name of “Mrs. Jennie Francis.” In the year 1918, the assessment was changed to read “Mrs. Jennie Francis Estate” and so remained until the year, <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>1927, when it was changed to read, “Jennie Francis Estate.” From the years 1938 to 1946, inclusive, it was assessed against “Margaret Francis, (nonresident).”</p>

The legal answer to this position is that an assessment record is not sufficient to convey notice of the existence of a legal or equitable title. See, <em>Morey v. Herrick, </em><a href="/pa/18/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="18 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="969158" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0123-01">18 Pa. 123</a> (1851); and 32 P.L.E. 373. Additionally, there was nothing in the public records in Potter County when Morgan or the appellees took title to indicate in any degree that Maggie Franeis was an heir of Mary Jane Francis or Jennie Francis, deceased, or that she was a tenant in common of the title involved. At no time prior to the filing of the complaint in the action to quiet title on September 23, 1955, did the public records of Potter County show the fact of death of Mary Jane Francis or Jennie Francis, the place of death, the probate of any will, the issuance of letters incident to the administration of her estate or the names of her heirs, if any such existed. It must also be noted that actually Maggie Francis inherited nothing from Mary Jane or Jennie Francis. Her interest descended through the death and intestacy of her husband several years later. The public records in the county also failed to show the fact of his death or the existence of any estate. Finally, in this connection, it is significant to note that at the time of the sale to Morgan, the only one in possession of the property was Maggie Francis. It was then unoccupied, consisted of remote woodland far removed from any occupied land. As stated in <em>Salvation Army Inc., Tr., v.

    <p id="b371-5" data-blocks='[["BL_371.5",371,[171,417,1148,537]]]'>The majority recognizes in its opinion that it has long been the law in Pennsylvania that if a tenant in common purchases a property at a tax or other judicial sale, such property inures to the benefit of all the cotenants. The purchasing cotenant is presumed to act for all. Conceding this rule, the majority attempts to avoid its impact by invoking cases from jurisdictions which have established statutory laws to cover such situations. They are not applicable in Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b371-6" data-blocks='[["BL_371.6",371,[170,971,1150,858]]]'>Here, the record title disclosed that Maggie Francis purchased the land at a tax sale. This revelation was sufficient notice to a purchaser that an examination of the tax sales record must be made to determine whether the land was acquired by a cotenant at the tax sale. Further reference to the records would reveal that this land was assessed in the name of the Estate of Jennie Francis, which was such a “red flag” that the purchaser was again put on notice and required to investigate who actually were Jennie Francis’ heirs. A superficial inquiry would have disclosed the heirs of Jennie Francis and would have disclosed that Maggie Francis was a cotenant with the other heirs of Jennie Francis. Hence, her acquisition of the land was for the benefit of herself and all the cotenants at the time of her purchase.</p>
    <p id="b371-7" data-blocks='[["BL_371.7",371,[170,1848,1147,361]]]'>I would hold that the appellees’ failure to recognize the implications of the tax sale <em>disclosed by the records </em>and the failure to pursue an inquiry outside of the records to ascertain the heirs of Jennie Francis, prevents them from asserting that they are bona fide purchasers and hence they cannot cut-off the rights of prior owners.</p>
