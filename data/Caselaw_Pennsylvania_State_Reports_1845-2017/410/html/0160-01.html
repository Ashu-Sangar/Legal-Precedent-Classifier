Where the existence of a conspiracy is established, the law imposes upon a conspirator full responsibility for the natural and probable consequences of acts committed by his fellow conspirator or conspirators if such acts are done in pursuance of the common design or purpose of the conspiracy.

The conspiracy in which Thomas took part had as its goal and objective the robbery of the deceased, a robbery which was to take place in Pennsylvania wherein the deceased was a resident; as a conspirator, Thomas became criminally responsible for the acts of his fellow conspirators, Wilson and Ellsworth, which acts were committed in Pennsylvania, and such responsibility included not only the robbery— the objective of the conspiracy — but also the homicide which was a contingency of the natural and probable consequences of the robbery. Such criminal responsibility attached to Thomas even though he was not physically present in Pennsylvania when the robbery and homicide occurred; in the eyes of the law, Thomas, as a conspirator, was constructively present when the robbery and the homicide occurred.</p>

The proof of the Commonwealth clearly reveals that in this conspiracy Thomas played a principal role and the act of robbery committed by Wilson and Ellsworth in Pennsylvania, in the course of which deceased met her death, was a natural and probable consequence of the conspiracy. For the acts committed by his co-conspirators Thomas is legally liable and, even though not present when the contemplated acts took place, Thomas must assume the responsibility for the consequences of the conspiracy and the acts of his co-conspirators. In our view, the courts of Pennsylvania, where the conspiracy took effect, clearly had jurisdiction to try Thomas.</p>

Smith, an Adelphia Hotel chambermaid, testified that on Friday, July 3, 1955 — two days prior to the homicide — , as she entered deceased’s room in the course of her duties, deceased was speaking on the telephone in a very excited <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>manner and, shortly thereafter, deceased told Miss Smith she had been trying to contact a “Sheriff in Miami”; (b) Edwin Thomas, a taxi driver requested by deceased to drive her to Florida, testified that en route to Washington, D.C. from Philadelphia, deceased told him she intended to settle in Florida and that “she had some business that she wanted to get off her mind with Sheriff Thomas”; (c) James Jerdon, a chauffeur for a Philadelphia livery-hire firm, was requested by deceased to drive her to Virginia on Wednesday, July 6, 1955, that she telephoned him on Sunday, July 3 — the day of the homicide — and cancelled the trip, stating: “ ‘We won’t be able to go Wednesday. I was just talking to my Deputy Sheriff. We will have to go Thursday’ ”; (d) Albert Schuckerp, an Adelphia Hotel bellman, testified that he accompanied deceased to a Western Union office in Philadelphia on Friday, July 1, — two days before the homicide — where she directed Schuckerp to fill out a money order blank to be made payable to Robert Thomas and sent to the Dade County Sheriff’s office, that the money order blank required the insertion of the sender’s name but the deceased refused to sign her name thereto and, when Schuckerp questioned her refusal to sign, the deceased said: “. . . that Mr. Thomas ... didn’t want her name on the telegram”; (e) Adeline Walker, a personal friend of the deceased, testified that she and the deceased had planned to take a trip to Connecticut on Tuesday, July 5; that deceased called her on Sunday, July 3 — the day of the homicide —and postponed the trip stating: “. . . she had sent Mr. Thomas a money order for $250 and they were up in an airplane going after Ridgeway [the object of deceased’s amorous pursuit] with tommy guns” and “that they feared for her safety, that they were going to send a bonded chauffeur to move her to another downtown hotel, that she wasn’t to tell anyone or let anyone in her room or tell anyone where she was going, but she <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>said she would call me as soon as she had gotten into this other hotel.”</p>
    <p id="b192-4" data-blocks='[["BL_192.4",192,[232,463,1147,1127]]]'>In <em>Commonwealth v. Wilson, </em>supra, pp. 599-601, we discussed similar testimony given by Mrs. Walker in that trial; “Mrs. Walker’s testimony, if believed, was indicative of an intent on the part of [the deceased] to stay in her room until a ‘bonded chauffeur’ arrived and the fact is that she met her death in that room nine to ten hours later. Regardless of whether [the deceased] was acting rationally or irrationally in arriving at this expressed intent and regardless of whether her story about a call from Thomas was real or fancied, nevertheless her statements to Mrs. Walker evidenced her then existing intention.” We admitted such testimony on the ground that the declarations of the deceased indicated an existing intent or state of mind of the deceased-declarant and, since such declarations were made in a “natural manner” and were material and relevant, their admission could be justified as an exception to the hearsay rule. That Thomas, not Wilson, is the defendant does not affect the admissibility of such evidence. In our view, the court properly admitted Mrs. Walker’s testimony.</p>

If we view this testimony in the light <em>most unfavorable </em>to Thomas, such testimony, if believed, would point to a relationship between Thomas and the deceased. That such relationship <em>did exist </em>was shown by <em>other </em>evidence — the admissibility of Avhich is not questioned — presented by the Common<a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>wealth. Thus, the admission of such evidence did no harm to Thomas and an examination of the instant record in its entirety fully confirms the fact that the admission of the testimony of these witnesses, even if erroneous, did not prejudice Thomas.</p>

More specifically, Thomas urges that the trial court did not treat in depth the evidence contradicting the identity of Thomas, misquoted the evidence and permitted the jury to speculate as to Thomas’ guilt or innocence. An examination of the record and the charge of the court in its entirety indicates clearly that this contention is without basis in fact. The trial court, in every respect, fairly, logically and in depth instructed the jury upon the applicable law, carefully and adequately reviewed the testimony both of the defense as well as the Commonwealth, and properly placed the determination of Thomas’ guilt or innocence in the hands of the jury.</p>
