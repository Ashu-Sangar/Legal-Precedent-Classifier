Petruzzi, there remained outstanding but one unpaid claim, that of appellant, E. A. Noons, for $3,-900.62. This amount, it was alleged, represented the balance due on purchases of livestock by decedent totalling $4,200.62.</p>
    <p id="b577-10" data-blocks='[["BL_577.14",577,[171,1449,1147,423]]]'>Appellant argues that the administratrix admitted the debt when she listed it in the statement of debts and deductions filed with the register of wills and in two petitions for leave to sell real estate. In these documents, however, administratrix made no such admission; she merely listed claims which had been filed against the estate, nothing more. See <em>Compton v.

The book, containing pencil entries of dates, names or initials, numbers, and the like, was offered for admission under the Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
      <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>•Appellant testified to the time and manner of preparation of the entries and explained particularly that an X in front of an amount meant that it had been paid. He testified also that decedent had paid $300 on account, although this payment was not recorded in the book. Left unexplained was the erasure of an X in front of one item ($504) here claimed due. Appellant’s son and daughter-in-law testified that the book was in appellant’s handwriting and that the entries were made substantially at the time of the transactions recorded.</p>

Appellant’s testimony of the payment by decedent of $300 is not competent to reconcile this discrepancy. Such testimony is beyond proof of the business record itself and seeks to establish a transaction not there recorded. This is in direct violation of the Dead Man’s Rule.</p>
