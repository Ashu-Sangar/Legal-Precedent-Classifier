He alleged that his wife had fraudulently conveyed to herself a property which was held by them as tenants by the entireties, and prayed that the deed be declared void. From the Order of the lower Court which dismissed his motion for judgment on the pleadings, plaintiff took this appeal. The Order (a) is interlocutory and (b) no appeal therefrom is authorized by any statute. The Order is therefore unappealable: <em>Sagot v.

This rule did not, nor did it intend, to enlarge appellate jurisdiction. The Act of June 21, 1937, P.
