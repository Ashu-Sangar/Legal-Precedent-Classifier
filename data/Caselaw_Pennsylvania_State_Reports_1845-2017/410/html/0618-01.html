The complaint in equity sought, inter alia: a declaration that the defendants held certain land as trustees for the cemetery association; an order directing defendants to reconvey the land to the cemetery association and an order directing the defendants to account for any profits realized from the resale of said property. The chancellor made findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered a decree nisi which, in effect, held that defendants stood in a fiduciary rather than a trustee capacity and ordered them to reconvey land to the cemetery association, but directed the cemetery association to reimburse defendants for expenses incurred in improvement of the property during the period of defendants’ ownership, and directed that costs of the case be divided between the parties. Plaintiffs filed exceptions to the findings and conclusions of the chancellor and to the decree nisi, which exceptions were overruled and the decree nisi made final. The cemetery association appeals, seeking a reversal of that portion of the decree of the court below which orders reimbursement of the defendants and a division of the costs.</p>

L. 289, §315C, as amended, 15 P.S. §2851-315, which provides in part, ’“The directors of any such corporation [formed for the purpose of conducting or maintaining a cemetery] are hereby made trustees of any such funds so received or set aside [perpetual care funds], and neither such funds nor the income derived therefrom shall be used by such trustees for any purpose other than the purpose for which the same were set aside, donated, bequeathed or othenvise acquired . . .”. Having impressed the funds, and presumably the mortgages, with a trust, the court below proceeds to terminate the trust when the mortgages were foreclosed and the property acquired by the association. This termination of trust is accomplished by reference to other sections of the Act of May 5, 1933, supra, specifically §§307 and 506 (15 P.S. §2851-307 and 15 P.S. §2851-506). Section 307 provides: “A nonprofit corporation may, at any tax or judicial sale of <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>any property upon which the corporation holds a mortgage or has a lien of any nature whatsoever, hid in such property if necessary for the protection of its interests.

      <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>The entire rationale of the decision below is dependent on the holding that the real estate in question was not held by appellees as trustees for appellant. With this holding we do not agree. The assets of the perpetual care fund were held by the officers and directors as trustees for the association. Whether these assets were in the form of cash, mortgages, real estate or any other form, they were assets of the perpetual care fund and, as such, were impressed with a trust. “Where the relation of trustee and cestui que trust has once been established as to certain property in the hands of the trustee, no mere change of trust property from one form to another will destroy the relation”. 39 P.L.E. Trusts, §387; <em>O’Neill v. O’Neill, </em><a href="/pa/227/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="227 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="1008752" data-case-paths="/pa/227/0334-01">227 Pa. 334</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20A.%2026" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="76 A. 26">76 A. 26</a> (1910); <em>McLaughlin v.

It is, therefore, our conclusion that the real estate purchased at judicial sale was held by the officers and directors of the association as trustees, and their duties and liabilities must be measured as such. “The trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary to administer the trust <em>solely in the interest of the </em>beneficiary”. Restatement (2d), Trusts, §170. (Emphasis supplied). In the case at bar, there is no questioning the fact that appellees bought the real estate for the purpose of securing personal profits. This action clearly constituted a breach of their duty as trustees of the perpetual care fund.</p>

It is immaterial that the trustee acts in good faith in purchasing trust property for himself, and that he pays a fair consideration.</p>

Thus, he cannot properly purchase trust property for himself on a foreclosure sale or tax sale or sale on execution of a judgment. To permit him to do so would create a situation where his personal interest would be in conflict with his duty as trustee. It is his duty as trustee to prevent the sale if possible or to see that the property is sold for as much as can be obtained. If he were permitted to bid in the property for himself at the sale, it would be for his personal advantage not to prevent the sale and to have as few bidders and as low bids as possible. The trustee who bids in the property for himself at such a sale is not permitted to keep the property, even though in the particular case he attempted to secure as many bidders and as high bids as he could and the amount which he bid was a fair consideration for the property.</p>

This finding is merely a conclusion of law and is, therefore, reviewable: <em>Sechler v. Sechler, </em>supra. The lower court based its conclusion that the defendants acted in good faith solely on the ground that they acted under the advice of counsel. What protection does a cestui que trust have when a finding that the trustee acted in good faith need only be based on advice of counsel? The advice of counsel was only one circumstance to be considered in determining the good faith of the defendants. A trustee is not liable for a mere error in judgment. <em>Wanamaker’s Trust Estate, </em><a href="/pa/340/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="340 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="1203363" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0419-01">340 Pa. </a><a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a><a href="/pa/340/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="340 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="1203363" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0419-01">419</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.2d%20380" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="17 A.2d 380">17 A. 2d 380</a> (1941).

However, advice of counsel is not a complete justification for a finding of good faith but is a factor to be considered in determining whether good faith exists: <em>Borden Trust, </em><a href="/pa/358/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="358 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="8845187" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0138-01">358 Pa. 138</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.2d%20108" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="56 A.2d 108">56 A. 2d 108</a> (1948).</p>
    <p id="b650-4" data-blocks='[["BL_650.4",650,[247,743,1150,1557]]]'>The defendants were advised by counsel that the trust was not properly established to hold the property in question. But they were <em>not </em>advised that the twenty-two lots should be released from the lien of the mortgage. Prior to the sale in question, the trust held mortgages on properties valued at $32,500. The unpaid balance on these mortgages totalled $21,769.15. Subsequent to the purchase by defendants and the release of the twenty-two lots from the mortgage lien, the trust held a mortgage of $21,700 on real property valued at $12,000. Moreover, the defendants owed $1500 in interest arrearages on the mortgage, approximately one week prior to the present suit. The defendant, Stillwagon, made numerous unsecured personal loans from the trust. In fact, an unsecured automobile loan of $2500 made in 1957 by Stillwagon had only $100 in payments made thereon in a two year period. The defendant, Dehner, purchased the land without any examination of it. Both defendants testified they entered into the venture for personal profit. The beneficiaries were not informed of the transaction. When consideration is given to these surrounding circumstances, we think the finding that the defendants acted in good faith is clearly erroneous and that the overwhelming evidence supports a finding of bad faith. Assuming that the defendants acted in bad faith, the next question to be answered is whether they may be reimbursed for expenditures made in improving the property.</p>

This right is limited, however, to transferees who had no knowledge of the breach of trust. Surely a breaching trustee should stand on no better footing than his transferee who had notice of the breach. We also note that should we require the association to reimburse appellees for improvement expenditures, we might be allowing appellant to be improved out of its property. Nor can we say that appellees are entitled to reimbursement on any theory of restitution. Restitution is required only to the extent that justice between the parties requires: Restatement, Restitution, §158. Here, justice between innocent beneficiaries and defaulting trustees does not require a depletion of the perpetual care fund in order to pay for improvements made without authorization and for the private profit of defaulting trustees. We conclude, therefore, that appellees are not entitled to recover the amounts expended by them in improving the property. We think the rule is to allow reimbursement only where the good faith of the trustees is evident and the benefit to the trust is without doubt; and, to refuse reimbursement otherwise.
