While this litigation was still pending, Binenstock in 1947 created for the benefit of his four daughters and their issue an inter vivos trust consisting of all the capital stock of J. A. Dougherty’s Sons, Inc., Distillers (Dougherty). The Commonwealth in 1949 finally obtained a judgment against Binenstock in the amount of $864,924.01 which was affirmed by this Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In order to meet the payments due the Commonwealth, Binenstock secured loans from Dougherty. The federal government claimed, and the tax court held in May 1961, that these loans were, in effect, dividends from Dougherty to the trust and hence subject to federal income tax in the amount of approximately $450,000. Appeals from the decision of the tax court are also presently pending.</p>

After some investigation, the trustees secured an offer from Robert Fleisher and Raymond Pearlstine whereby 75% of the stock would be sold for $900,000 in cash and, under a “put” arrangement,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the trustees could compel the purchasers to buy the remaining 25% for $850,000 within the next <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>three years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

An answer to the petition was filed by one of the income beneficiaries alleging that another purchaser stood ready to buy the stock for a sum substantially in excess of $1,250,000. After hearing testimony on the petition and answer thereto, Judge Burke concluded that better offers could be obtained for the stock. He consequently ordered a public sale of all the Dougherty stock with sealed bids to be submitted by March 21, 1962. Under the court imposed terms of sale, all bids had to exceed $1,275,000 <em>and sale was conditioned on the trustees obtaining the consent of the Commonwealth thereto. </em>If such consent was not obtained by May 31, 1962, the sale was to lapse.</p>

(Publicker), in the amount of $1,411,000. At this point, Judge Burke apparently decided to dispense with the need for the Commonwealth’s consent to the sale, for he entered a decree directing the trustees to sell the Dougherty stock to Publicker. Exceptions to this decree were filed by the Commonwealth, one of the trustees, one of the beneficiaries, and by the guardian and trustee ad litem.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Without ruling on these exceptions, the orphans’ court en banc referred the matter back to Judge Burke for the purpose of taking more testimony.

It is well-established that orderly judicial procedure dictates that the court which first acquires jurisdiction over a matter be permitted to decide all questions relating thereto.

Appellants contend, however, that the October 1961 proceeding should be “tacked-onto” the earlier 1943 escheat proceeding against Binenstock which was also commenced in the Court of Common Pleas No. 1 of Philadelphia County. But the 1961 action is an independent action prosecuted under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act to set aside a trust which was not involved in the earlier escheat action. Nor can it be considered as one in execution of the prior in personam judgment. The 1961 action possesses a separate docket number, and it was only by the accidental turn of the prothonotary’s wheel that it was listed for the same Court of Common Pleas No. 1 which had decided the earlier escheat action. Consequently, the Commonwealth’s suit to set aside the trust should have been instituted in the orphans’ court and that court properly ignored the pending common pleas action.</p>

In this regard, appellants raise two objections: (1) that the orphans’ court incorrectly evaluated the Fleisher-Pearlstine offer; and (2) that the Act of May 24, 1945 prevents a court from rejecting a contract made by a fiduciary because of the presence of higher offers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

    <p id="b454-6" data-blocks='[["BL_454.6",454,[231,1229,1147,528]]]'>In disputing the lower court’s evaluation of the Fleisher-Pearlstine offer, appellants argue that the “put” agreement is worth far in excess of the $350,000 placed upon it by the orphans’ court. After reviewing the substantial amount of evidence presented before the court below as to the value of this speculative item, we cannot say that the orphans’ court acted unreasonably or without sufficient evidence in concluding that the guaranteed $350,000 was the top value which should be placed on the “put” arrangement.</p>
    <p id="b454-7" data-blocks='[["BL_454.7",454,[232,1769,1145,258]],["BL_455.1",455,[168,378,1149,368]]]'>Also, the Act of May 24, 1945 did not prevent the court below from considering the possibility of higher offers for the Dougherty stock.

In such a situation the purchaser should realize that the judgment of the orphans’ court having been invoked, that court must consider the best interests of the trust, including the possibility of higher offers for the trust property. See <em>Stone </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/358/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="358 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="8845530" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0335-01">358 Pa. 335</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.2d%20664" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="56 A.2d 664">56 A. 2d 664</a> (1948).</p>
    <p id="b455-4" data-blocks='[["BL_455.4",455,[167,758,1150,469]]]'>Appellants next contend that the power of the court below was limited to approval or disapproval of the petition for acceptance of the Fleisher-Pearlstine offer and that it had no power to order a public sale of the Dougherty stock. Since three of the four trustees approve of a public sale of the trust asset, this argument assumes that unanimous agreement of the trustees was required by the settlor in this matter. We do not so construe the deed of trust.</p>
    <p id="b455-5" data-blocks='[["BL_455.5",455,[165,1247,1161,640]]]'>An examination of the trust instrument reveals that the first paragraph of the section dealing with the powers of the trustees refers to the important power of investing and re-investing in trust property. Here the settlor explicitly stated that the decision of a majority of trustees should govern. In the following paragraphs of this section other powers of the trustees are spelled, out, many of them redundant and none of them mentioning explicitly the vote required for exercise of that particular power. In the paragraph relating to the sale of trust assets, settlor stated that the power should be exercised “as to my ‘trustees’ may seem proper.”</p>

They argue that the settlor used that word in contrast to the earlier declaration of majority rule to indicate the requirement of unanimity. Such a construction, however,, would lead to the anomalous result that a majority of trustees could decide to invest in trust property but, in order to sell trust assets to raise the capital necessary for the investment, the consensus of all the trustees would be required. In addition, such a construe<a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>tion would seem to conflict with the settlor’s clear purpose of granting to the trustees great freedom and flexibility of action.

On this point, the Commonwealth claims that under the agreement entered into by it with the trustees, it had an absolute veto power over the sale of the stock so long as any indebtedness remained. It is true that paragraph three of this agreement might admit of such an absolute power. Paragraph two of the agreement, however, states that the trustees may convey trust assets where “ordered and directed by the final judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.” We would interpret this paragraph as permitting a court of competent jurisdiction to order a sale without the Commonwealth’s consent where it determined that the sale would not prejudice the rights of the Commonwealth vis-a-vis the trust. Clauses of a contract, such as paragraphs two and three, which seem to conflict will be construed, if possible, as consistent with one another. See 3 Corbin, Contracts §547 (1960). Consequently, we interpret the agreement as providing alternative methods in regard to the sale of trust assets, i.e., obtaining <em>either </em>the consent of the Common<a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>wealth <em>or </em>the approval of a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

The legal rights of the Commonwealth seem adequately protected by the decree below since the proceeds of the sale should be more than adequate to pay the claims of all possible creditors. We conclude, therefore, that the court below did have the power to order a sale of the stock Avithout the Commonwealth’s consent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

Here we believe the lower court committed its sole error. In the first place, this change in the “rules of the game” Avas unfair to potential bidders. More importantly, however, the presence of the release provision surely deterred higher bids and hence prevented the court from obtaining its objective of securing the best possible price for the Dougherty stock. For example, the intervening appellant alleges that he would offer $1,600,000 for the stock absent this condition of sale. Since, as pointed out above, a release is unnecessary to protect the interests of the Commonwealth, we conclude that another public sale<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> should take place absent this provision.</p>
