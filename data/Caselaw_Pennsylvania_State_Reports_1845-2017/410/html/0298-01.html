      <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>In October, 1960, the Banking Board had refused the application of First Bellefonte Bank and Trust Company for a branch bank in State College approximately three-fourths of a mile away from the location of this proposed branch. While the Secretary of Banking held two hearings sur the present application, we are convinced that he reached his decision to disapprove the present application because of a misconception of Section 204.1 B. That section pertinently provides, “The decision of the Banking Board [either approving or disapproving the action of the department] shall be binding upon the department.” The language and meaning of this provision is clear. It means that the decision of the Banking Board shall be binding on the Department <em>in the particular application </em>which was at that time before the Banking Board, even though the Secretary of Banking or the Department were of a contrary opinion and had made a contrary decision with respect to that particular application. That provision or sentence did not mean and could not mean, as we believe both the Attorney General and the Secretary of Banking have construed it, that the Banking Board’s decision in a particular case should forever bind the Department with respect to subsequent or different applications. The burden is of course upon the applicant to prove a need for banking services or facilities in the trade area. Cf. <em>Philadelphia Saving Fund Society v. Myers, </em>406 Pa., supra, page 440. In this case and in other <em>similar </em>cases it will be necessary for the applicant to prove (1) that substantially different circumstances or conditions exist from those which existed at the time and place of the rejected application for a branch bank, and (2) that “‘there is a need for banking services or facilities such as are contemplated by the establishment of such branch [citing-cases].’” <em>Philadelphia Saving Fund Society v.
