At the time of the accident, 15th Street was a one-way street for southbound vehicular traffic. There were no cars parked on the east side of 15th Street northward toward Market Street which intersects 15th Street at right angles and runs generally east and west; on the west side of 15th Street was Sweigert’s automobile.</p>

At the point where Sweigert proceeded to cross there was no regular pedestrian crossing and Market Street was 80 to 90 feet to the north. Sweigert testified that at the east curb he looked north toward Market Street — the direction from which any vehicular traffic might be anticipated — and “there was no traffic nearer than Market Street, when [he] started to cross the street.” Sweigert further stated that he continued to look north as he crossed the street and first saw the automobile owned and operated by George Mazer when it was “one or two car lengths” from him at which time he jumped back trying to avoid being struck and was struck. Sweigert had almost reached the middle of 15th Street when he was struck by the left front fender of Mazer’s car.</p>

He then proceeded across the street, still continuing to look to the north, and reached a point approximately the middle of 15th <em>Street- </em>— 18 <em>feet from the east curb </em>— when he saw one to two car lengths from him the oncoming Mazer automobile. There is no evidence whether the Mazer auto<a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>mobile — proceeding at 20 to 25 miles an hour — had turned into 15th Street from Market Street or proceeded on 15th Street directly across Market Street.

This Court held in <em>Auel </em>that the plaintiff if he had looked could have <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>averted the danger and thus was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. The Court stated (pp. 215, 216) : “Since the undisputed testimony for plaintiff disclosed that he was struck just as he crossed the center line he must have, or at least should have seen the defendant’s vehicle approaching. There was nothing to show that plaintiff’s view was in any way obscured, and, therefore, he was bound to see that which must have been plainly visible at the time it became his duty to look. <em>The inference is unavoidable that if plaintiff had looked he could have averted the danger. </em>No other reasonable conclusion can be drawn from the testimony presented in plaintiff’s case. If he failed to look he was negligent and if he looked he must have seen defendant’s moving vehicle and in stepping in front of it or into it was equally negligent. What was said in Dando v. Brobst, <a href="/pa/318/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="318 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="1159565" data-case-paths="/pa/318/0325-01">318 Pa. 325</a>, 327, <a href="/citations/?q=177%20A.%20831" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="177 A. 831">177 A. 831</a>, is apposite here: <em>. . </em>plaintiff must inevitably have seen the car if she had looked, and if she saw nothing she could not have been looking. As we have repeatedly pointed out, it is vain for a person to say he looked when, in spite of what his eyes must have told him, he moved into the path of an approaching car or train by which he was immediately struck.’ (citing cases).” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

In <em>Cardiff, </em>the highway being negotiated was a two way street whereas in the case at bar the street was a one way street requiring a concentration of the pedestrian’s attention primarily in the one direction; in <em>Cardiff </em>the pedestrian was carrying an umbrella and leading a dog on a leash whereas the instant pedestrian was not so encumbered; in <em>Cardiff, </em>in the direction from which the motor vehicle approached there was the crest of a hill which could have obstructed the <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>pedestrian’s view whereas in the instant case there was no such obstruction; in <em>Cardiff, </em>the pedestrian had crossed all but eight inches of the highway whereas in the case at bar the pedestrian had barely crossed to the middle of highway when struck. The facts present in the case at bar emphatically indicate that Sweigert “walked into the path of” Mazer’s vehicle whereas in <em>Cardiff </em>the point of impact completely negatives any supposition that the pedestrian “walked into the path of” Updegrave’s vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b99-5" data-blocks='[["BL_99.4",99,[173,918,1149,747]]]'>The language of this Court in <em>Catens, </em>supra, is particularly applicable in the instant situation: “His failure to observe appellee’s motor vehicle not only is unexplained but inexplicable.” (p. 160) With an unobstructed and unimpeded view in the direction from which the Mazer automobile approached, at 20 to 25 miles per hour, Sweigert’s failure to observe the Mazer automobile until it was within “one to two car lengths” from him was due either to Sweigert’s own failure to look or in looking and failing to observe that which was clearly within the range of his vision. In either event, Sweigert has presented a case which clearly shows that he is guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law.</p>
