However, this is a general rule and does not mean that every Occupation Privilege Tax to be valid must impose a tax which varies with the particular mode of employment. <em>Banger’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/109/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="109 Pa. 79" data-case-ids="542246" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0079-01">109 Pa. 79</a> (1885); <em>Ping v.

    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[269,1128,1150,626]]]'>Even before the passage of the Act of 1947, supra, a municipality had the authority to license and tax operations and transactions performed within its corporate limits. See, <em>Allentown v. Gross, </em><a href="/pa/132/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="132 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="970502" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0319-01">132 Pa. 319</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20A.%20269" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="19 A. 269">19 A. 269</a> (1890); <em>Altoona v.

Further, it was indicated in <em>Banger’s Appeal, </em>supra, that a flat rate levy on all occupations was valid and that if such appeared to be unjust that this question was one for the legislature and not the courts. The uniformity of the tax removes the stigma of unconstitutionality under Art. IX, §1, of the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b340-6" data-blocks='[["BL_340.6",340,[269,1775,1148,583]],["BL_341.1",341,[199,364,1147,588]]]'>It is our conclusion that the tax imposed was purely an Occupation Privilege Tax despite the fact that it does not assess a varying levy according to the nature of the employment. It taxes the <em>privilege </em>of all to engage in occupations within the municipality’s territorial limits. This power was given by the legislature under the Act of 1947, supra. Section A. thereof, authorizes the imposition of taxes on “persons, transactions, occupations, privileges, subjects and personal property within the limits of such political subdivision.” In Section E of the Act, the legislature specifically treated <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>a head or poll tax separately and distinctly from an Occupation Privilege Tax and clearly expressed an intention that such distinct and separate taxes could be imposed. It is fundamental that every law is to be construed, if possible, to give effect to each and every provision, Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, §51, 46 P.S. §551, and <em>Commonwealth v. McHugh, </em><a href="/pa/406/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="406 Pa. 566" data-case-ids="1304908" data-case-paths="/pa/406/0566-01">406 Pa. 566</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=178%20A.2d%20556" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="178 A.2d 556">178 A. 2d 556</a> (1962). Moreover, the legislative intent is further clarified by the imposition of <em>separate </em>limitations on the amount of the levy that can be imposed in the various enumerated categories.</p>
    <p id="b341-3" data-blocks='[["BL_341.4",341,[197,962,1148,307]]]'>The validity of the ordinance was also attacked in the court below on the grounds that it results in double taxation and is taxation without representation. We find no semblance of merit in either contention; nor do we find any violation of the Constitution of the United States or of this Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b341-4" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[192,1290,1152,899]]]'>Finally, it must be noted that the court below reluctantly declared the ordinance invalid because of language employed in <em>Danyluk v. Johnstown, </em>supra. The decision of the Superior Court in <em>Guernsey v. Midland Borough, </em>supra, was also influenced and based thereon. The factual situation in <em>Danyluk </em>was patently different. It was admitted therein that the tax involved was intended to be a per capita or head tax on residents and nonresidents. This admission, coupled with the fact that the tax bore none of the incidents <em>that generally </em>are found in a true Occupation Privilege Tax led the court to conclude that the tax was not an occupation tax. We did not intend to rule that an occupation tax in order to be valid must of necessity vary according to the value of the mode of employment. The language involved must be read in view of the admitted facts in the case.</p>

We stated in that case: “Finally, even if the tax were truly an excise tax upon the privilege of engaging in occupations within City . . . much the same conclusions follow except that the unjustified distinction would be between occupations of residents and those of non-residents rather than between the residency or non-residency status of the individuals themselves.”</p>

Since the majority has properly decided that the instant tax is an occupation tax, and since this tax was applied equally to all individuals engaged in an occupation within the City of Allentown, I also conclude that the ordinance is a valid tax enactment.</p>
