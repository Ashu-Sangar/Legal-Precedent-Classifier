The Commission invoked the provisions of the Milk Control Law, Act of April 28, 1937, P. L. 417, as amended, 31 P.S. §700j-101 et seq., seeking to enjoin the defendants, from purchasing and receiving, handling, selling or distributing, or in any other way, handling milk in the capacity of a milk dealer as defined by the Milk Control Law, without first obtaining a milk dealer’s license from the Milk Control Commission, or, by operating in such a manner as to be exempt from such licensing provision as is provided in Section 402 of the Milk Control Law.</p>
