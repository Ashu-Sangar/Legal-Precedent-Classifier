Corp. (Kennedy), a concern which has a plant and factory at Danville, Pa., for the manufacture and delivery by Kennedy, inter alia, of a two and a quarter million pound stone crusher to be located on Co-play’s land. This stone crusher was manufactured and, in the late winter or early spring of 1955 (possibly March, 1955), was delivered to Coplay in accordance with the contract.</p>

This crusher was to be housed in a building which was to be approximately 50 feet high. For the unloading, assembling, and installation of the stone crusher and erection of the building to house the crusher Coplay had entered into a contract with Lloyd S.

By that date the crusher itself had been set in place, inside of and at the base of the building, above the open pit or quarry.

This contract did provide that Coplay, in its judgment, could avail itself of the services of Kennedy’s “engineers, millwrights or mechanics . . . for the purpose of superintending the erection or operation of the machinery” covered by the contract upon the payment to such engineer, millwright or mechanic of a specified daily rate for the services plus expenses by Coplay; in the event any such Kennedy employee should be so hired the contract recited that such employee should be eon<a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>sidered Coplay’s employee for whose acts Kennedy would assume no liability or responsibility and for whom Coplay would assume liability and responsibility.</p>

The common sense of this arrangement is apparent. Coplay, a cement manufacturer lacking knowledge in its organization of the <em>manner of installation </em>of a stone crusher, availed itself of the services of one who was familiar with the manner in which a stone crusher should be installed so that Coplay might be assured that Keifriter — with whom Coplay had contracted to install the crusher — was installing the crusher in accordance with the plans and specifications and in a proper and workmanlike manner.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In effect, Coplay had “borrowed” Warfield from Kennedy and Warfield became the employee of Coplay, not Kennedy, an employee paid by and under the control of Coplay.</p>

From this provision it is argued that on the date of accident ownership of the crusher was in Kennedy and not Coplay and from such ownership arose responsibility, at least in part, for this accident. Such argument lacks merit under the factual situation presented. The retention of ownership and right of possession was simply a security arrangement between <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>Coplay and Kennedy<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> because the actual <em>possession </em>and the <em>control </em>of the crusher as between Coplay and Kennedy was in the former.

The basis upon which Hader claims negligence is that he was not provided with a safe place to work, i.e., the failure to place planks over the open spaces between the girders and the spider and keep the tops of the girders and the spider free from slippery substances. It is obvious that with such acts or omissions to act Kennedy had naught to do. The line of cases represented by <em>Bisson v. J. B.

They have, however, set forth indicia of such relationship to be used as guides in making such a determination, some of which are: Control of manner work is to be done; responsibility for result only; terms of agreement between the parties; the nature of the work or occupation; skill required for performance; whether one is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; which party supplies the tools; whether payment is by the time or by the job; whether work is a part of regular business of the employer, and also the right of employer to terminate the employment at any time, [citing cases].” Applying these indicia to the instant factual situation it is clear beyond question that Keifriter was an independent contractor.

Haydt, another fellow-employee, testified that Warfield never gave him orders, that he had asked Warfield for technical advice, that he received his orders from Keifriter’s foreman and superintendent and that War-field was on the job to see that the crusher was installed in accordance with the specifications. An examination of the record clearly reveals that Warfield was acting as a “watchdog” for Coplay to make sure that Keifriter installed the crusher and erected the housing in accordance with the plans and specifications.
