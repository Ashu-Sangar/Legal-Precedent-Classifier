Tbe land proposed to be used is at the rear of the main building or tavern (known as Boyal Oaks Tavern, Bestaurant, or Inn) and abuts a portion of a public highway by-pass.

Tbe tavern (or restaurant) has been in operation since at. least 1945. In 1952, the township granted a building permit for the construction of locker rooms and showers on tbe site in question. Although tbe application for tbe building permit described the use of tbe building as an “Inn”, it was for several years thereafter operated as a swim club (probably separately from tbe restaurant).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Sometime in <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>the fall of 1959, the tavern and club facilities were closed as a result of action taken by the Internal Revenue Service.</p>

The by-laws provide that eligibility for membership requires the purchase of one share of stock, and no member is permitted to purchase more. Although the membership may not exceed 300 families, the club intends to limit membership to 200 families. However, the Board, in granting the special exception, restricted the number to 175 families.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In addition to the purchase of stock,- membership would be subject to an annual assessment of approximately $125 to $150 per family to cover the costs of operating the club.</p>

The record owners of the realty are unwilling to sell the property directly to the non-profit corporation because they desire security for their purchase money mortgage obligation, which the non-profit corporation cannot provide. The club site is to be leased to the non-profit corporation for a 15 year term, at an annual rental of $8,000 (annual mortgage payment being $7,500 plus 4% to cover the expense of holding title) with an option to renew for an additional similar term at a substantially lower rental (since mortgage payments will have been completed).</p>

Section 501(3) (H), permits club houses, lodges or fraternity houses, provided “that the principal activity shall not be one which is customarily carried on as a business and provided that all services shall be for members and their guests.” The Board imposed certain conditions and restrictions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and, as so limited, found, inter alia, that the proposed swim club use is a non-commercial or non-profit recreational use.</p>

      <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>Appellants contend that the Board committed error of law in incorrectly applying the requirements of the zoning ordinance (to the facts before it) and in finding that the proposed swim club is a non-commercial recreational use. Appellees, it is argued, fail to meet the non-commercial or non-profit provisions of the ordinance. Appellants point to the substantial financial gains likely to accrue to appellees as a result of the lease with the non-profit swim club: acquisition of the $85,000 property for the initial investment of $15,000, plus the value of any improvements placed upon the land by the club, and the salaries to be received by two of the appellees for management services. It is vigorously argued that these are characteristics of a purely commercial or profit-making venture and preclude the finding that the club use is non-commercial. In dealing with this contention, the lower court correctly said: “. . . the appellants seem to have confused the <em>use </em>of the premises by the swim club and the financial arrangements between the applicants and the swim club. The swim club and the applicants are separate entities and the swim club will not be a profit-making organization. The club’s facilities will be used, exclusively by the members of the club and not by the public. Upon the record before it, then, the Board of Adjustment properly concluded that the use of the premises by the club will be ‘non-commercial’. This is all that is necessary to bring the use within the terms of the ordinance, and the fact that the applicants stand to receive an appreciable gain from this non-commercial use of their property by the swim club, a non-profit corporation, does not render the Board’s decision erroneous. There is no requirement in the ordinance that the use be such that no one will profit financially therefrom, and the Board of Adjustment did not commit an error of law in concluding that the proposed use is ‘non-commercial’.”</p>

      <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>It should perhaps be observed that the gains which appellants attribute to appellees are by no means realities, and their possible future realization (even partially) depends upon many uncertain and changing factors involving (among other circumstances) the ability 'of the non-profit corporation to attract members (up to 175 under the restrictions imposed by the Board) willing to pay annual assessments (for 3 month club privileges) over the 15 year lease term. It is evident that the salaries to be paid under the management contract are not profits or gains to the recipients but rather compensation for services rendered. To conclude that the swim club is a commercial or profit-making venture because the lessors may profit financially is to subject every admittedly non-commercial or nonprofit activity or organization to the same challenge because profit may be derived by those who sell goods and services (or rent facilities) to such organizations.</p>
    <p id="b467-5" data-blocks='[["BL_467.4",467,[165,1364,1147,985]]]'>Appellants contend also that the Board abused its discretion in concluding that the proposed use would not adversely affect the safety, health and welfare of the community. Strong emphasis is placed on the testimony of protestants that several years earlier, the operation of the previous swim club resulted in a great deal of noise, littering and other objectionable conditions. The former unpleasant experience may not be attributed to the proposed use, especially in the light of the adequate safeguards taken by the Board in imposing detailed conditions and restrictions for the operation of the club and its finding that the present use would be free of such objections. The record contains no evidence sufficient to support a contrary finding. The burden of proof is not with appellants to show that their use would not adversely affect the health, safety and welfare of the community. <em>Archbishop O’Hara’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/389/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="389 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1273994" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0035-01">389 Pa. 35</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.2d%20587" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="131 A.2d 587">131 A. 2d 587</a> (1957).</p>

Our examination of these cases satisfies us that neither compels or even suggests the conclusion that the proposed swim club is not a non-commercial use or that the Board abused its discretion in granting the special exception. In <em>Kotzin, </em>the Board refused special exceptions for a non-commercial recreational swim club and day camp, because it found that granting the application would adversely affect the health, safety and welfare of the community. In <em>Upper Providence, </em>the Board denied the special exception for several reasons, including lack of sanitation facilities, traffic congestion, poor access, failure to furnish required survey, and the absence of plan for adequate parking.</p>
