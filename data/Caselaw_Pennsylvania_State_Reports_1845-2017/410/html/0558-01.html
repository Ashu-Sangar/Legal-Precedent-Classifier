In the center of East Ohio Street — which is approximately 42 feet wide and runs generally east and west — are two railway tracks owned by appellant which tracks are flanked on both sides by lanes for vehicular traffic. The vehicular portion of East Ohio Street is paved with asphalt while that portion of the street immediately adjacent to and between the several rails is paved with cobblestones. East Diamond Street — approximately 32 feet wide — runs generally north and south and intersects East Ohio Street. At this point, East Ohio Street — on the north side of which is the Carnegie Library and on the south side of which is the North Side Market — is generally subject to heavy vehicular traffic but at the time of the accident such vehicular traffic was practically nonexistent.</p>

At a point approximately five or eight feet west of the pedestrian crosswalk located at the intersection of East Ohio and East Diamond Streets, appellee left the sidewalk on the north side of East Ohio Street and started to cross to the south side of that street. When appellee had traversed approximately 24 feet of East Ohio Street she came to the fourth or most southerly rail and when she <em>“got to </em>the fourth track, <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>there was a hole there and [her] foot slid in” and she fell, sustaining personal injuries.</p>

After a trial before the Honorable F. G. Weie and a jury, the jury returned a verdict in favor of appellee and against appellant in the amount of $25,479.40. Appellant’s motion for judgment n.o.v. having been refused, judgment was entered on the verdict and this appeal was taken.</p>

The cobblestones were inside the rail, and outside the — the inside were the stones going crossways, three or four of them on the ends were deep down in” and that part that was two inches deep was “right up against the rail”. On cross-examination, Fairtrace stated that, judging from “a one and a half inch mark on the toe of [appellee’s] shoe”, appellee must have tripped on the rail; that the depressed condition of the cobblestones was “about one and a half or two inches” over a width of “twelve to fifteen, maybe eighteen inches long.”</p>
