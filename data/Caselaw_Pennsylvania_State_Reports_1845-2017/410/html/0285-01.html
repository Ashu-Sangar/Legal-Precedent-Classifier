She stayed two days and nights and returned to her home with Josephine and Boy McCompsey. Boy McCompsey, a friend of the Gooslins, testified that Sadie said, “Josephine, don’t leave me. You’ll be sorry for it.” The defendant’s 15-year old son, Earmel Gooslin, testified that during the six weekends previous to Mrs. Gooslin’s death his parents had quarreled on four of them and that during one of these quarrels he heard the sound of dishes breaking. Miss Mary Sheila Beirne, a third-year medical student, testified that on August 8 at 2 a.m. she treated Mrs. Gooslin at Jennersville Hospital for a scalp wound.

Shortly thereafter defendant and Mrs. Gooslin came downstairs and went into the kitchen. Bennett testified that he heard the sound of breaking glass coming from the kitchen and that the defendant told his wife “if she didn’t start cooking, quit running around, he was going to bust the stove <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>up and throw it out.” Bennett left the house and returned at 9 p.m. While Bennett was away from the house, defendant was alone with his wife except for their young children.

Defendant denied that he had killed his wife and failed or was unable to explain how or why she was constantly in a “beaten-up” condition, after every weekend on which he was home.

Her death was of traumatic origin and her body was brutally injured. She had received severe beatings on prior occasions when Defendant was home, particularly the two weekends immediately previous to that when she died and in December, 1959. When questioned about her death Defendant said once that she must have done it herself and another time that she died from drinking alcohol. Her blood tested negative for alcohol at the autopsy. Defendant denied killing his wife. He further denied striking her except for a single slap two or three years before. In cross-examination of Commonwealth witnesses his defense implied that either Bennett or one Oleo Miller caused the death, but he called no testimony in the defense to support that theory. Nor did Defendant when testifying try to explain his wife’s injuries on the fatal weekend or at any previous time when he was home. . . .” Defendant’s explanation as to the cause of his wife’s death was so obviously false and fabricated, that it tended to further confirm his guilt.</p>
