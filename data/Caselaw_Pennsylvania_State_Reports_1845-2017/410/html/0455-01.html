B. J. Alpers, a well known and highly respected neurologist and psychiatrist. On October 14, 1947, appellant became an in-patient in the Pennsylvania Hospital Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital (Institute) in Philadelphia where she remained, under Dr. Alpers’ care, until November 19, 1947 at which time she was transferred to the 44th Street division of the Pennsylvania Hospital (44th Street division),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> where she remained until March 5, 1948, when, apparently then mentally competent, she was permitted to “go out on visit” to her home. On August 11, 1948, appellant was readmitted to the 44th Street division where she remained until December 4, 1948 when she was transferred to the Institute until March 1, 1949 at which time she was transferred back to the 44th Street division where she remained as a patient until April 27, 1949 when she was released. Upon her release, appellant went to New York, in the company of a nurse specially trained in psychiatry, for interpretive analytical therapy with Dr. John Rosen. On August 16, 1949 she was readmitted to the 44th Street division as a patient of Dr. Joseph Hughes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

As the court below found: “During 1949 [appellant] was a typical picture of paranoid schizophrenia. She was actively hallucinating, with auditory hallucinations, much purposeless laughing, many mannerisms, and very little insight into her illness. She had a good deal of impulsive behavior, . . .” The record fully supports the conclusion that, during this period, appellant was mentally incompetent and unable to transact any business affairs with understanding.</p>

The court below found that the purpose of sending her to New York was “to determine whether a change in environment would result in an improvement in her mental illness.

The trust agreement, although dated June 28, 1950, was executed by appellant on June 29, 1950 and witnessed by Mr. and Mrs. Gold-stein. <em>Only </em>the validity of the execution of this trust agreement is herein attacked.</p>

It is undisputed that since May 23, 1955 appellant has been mentally competent and has made a remarkable recovery.</p>

Mr. Meyers, as trustee, has filed three accounts in the Orphans’ Court of Cambria County; the first account was filed in 1954, the second account in 1957, and the third account on June 28, 1960. At the audit of the third account, appellant filed this petition to rescind the trust and to have the balance in the hands of the trustee awarded to her on the ground that she was mentally incompetent at the time she signed the trust agreement on June 29, 1950. To this petition separate answers were filed by Morton Meyers, trustee, Mr. Girsh, and Marjorie Girsh, the latter as a remainder-man under the trust and appellant filed separate replies to new matter pleaded by Mr. Girsh and Marjorie Girsh.</p>

Appellant filed exceptions to certain of the court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law and to the failure of the court to rule on the admissibility of certain notes of Dr. Hughes.

Mr. Meyers, who represented appellant’s father in the early part of 1950 in negotiating with Mr. Girsh’s counsel the separation and property settlement documents, on April 11, 1950 visited appellant in the Institute, found her unable to discuss business matters and urged her father to have a guardian appointed for her which the father hesitated to do. On June 3, 1950 Mr. Meyers visited appellant in her hotel apartment in New York and found her very confused, hallucinating and engaged in bizarre behavior.

On the occasion of that visit, Mr. Meyers found appellant “indeed improved”, “pleasant” and she “talked intelligently” to him; he discussed with her the pending agreements and property settlement. While he would not express any “pyschiatric opinion” as to her competency, he did testify: “She talked to me. She knew me. She appeared to understand what I was telling her.” Mr. Meyers, who at that time was again negotiating with Mr. Girsh’s counsel the property settlement and separation agreements, insisted that, before any of the agreements be executed, Dr. Hughes give his opinion as to appellant’s mental competency.</p>

We cannot substitute our own judgment for that of the chancellor on the question of credibility; his opportunity to resolve <em>that question </em>was much greater than ours.

While Dr. Hughes did not see appellant on that date, nevertheless he had talked with and had observed appellant on June 24 and June 27; his observations were those of a <em>trained </em>observer, one whose experience with appellant’s behavior extended over a ten month period and whose objective in his observations on June 27 was to ascertain and determine whether appellant possessed sufficient mental competency to execute, with understanding and appreciation, the separation and trust agreements. Viewed in this light, the testimony of Dr. Hughes bears considerable weight. Moreover, the testimony of Attorney Meyers is most significant. One cannot help concluding, after reading Attorney Meyer’s testimony, that he was most conscientious in his protection of appellant’s rights. On April 11 and June 3, appellant’s behavior in his presence was that of an incompetent person and his testimony so reveals; however, his testimony as to her behavior on June 25 clearly indicates that appellant was then in a state of remission.</p>

As we view this attack it is basically an attack upon the credibility of the witnesses.
