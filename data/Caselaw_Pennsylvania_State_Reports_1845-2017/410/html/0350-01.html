The defendant, James Vento, whom the Commonwealth charged “aided, abetted, procured and assisted” Dominquez in the commission of the crime, was arrested and jointly indicted with him on the charge of murder. The Commonwealth requested and obtained a severance and then elected to proceed to trial against the defendant, Vento, alone.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At trial, a jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree and fixed the punishment at life imprisonment.

The trial judge in receiving it in evidence indicated that this was the basis for its admission. A consonant declaration may be admitted in contradiction of evidence tending to show that the testimony of the declarant at trial is a fabrication of a recent date and to show that the same statement was made before its ultimate effect on the question trying could have been foreseen. <em>Risbon v.

In this respect, the charge was inadequate. The failure to charge on the relevancy of a prior consonant declaration in the absence of a specific request would not, in itself, be sufficient to require the grant of a new trial in every case. See, <em>Commonwealth v. Ford, </em>supra. However, we are here concerned with the admission in evidence of a prior statement in the nature of a confession made by a co-conspirator after the conspiracy terminated,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and wherein the jury is left completely in the dark as to its evidentiary purpose or the consideration to be given it. The jury may well have concluded that it constituted evidence against Vento and had a direct bearing upon the question of his guilt. This conclusion is fortified by the following portion of the charge of the court: “A large part of the Commonwealth’s ease depends upon the <em>statement</em>
      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">
        <em>3</em>

      <em>wealth v. Hudson, </em>supra, that if a defendant wished to avoid the risk incident to a joint trial, with respect to the admission into evidence of the confession of a co-defendant, a severance could he requested. Could it be logically said that the defendant, Vento, should be exposed to these risks without qualification where the severance was requested by the Commonwealth? We think not. The occasion for the introduction of the confession was the attack on the credibility of a witness. Subsequent cautionary instructions in the charge of the trial judge, limiting this evidence to the question of the credibility of the witness, were absolutely essential to insure the defendant a fair trial. The error, under the circumstances, was highly prejudicial and requires a new trial.</p>

The trial judge correctly and adequately charged the jury that before this evidence could be considered that the jury had to be convinced that the statements were voluntarily made.

The court en banc concluded that he meant the testimony of the witnesses as to the circumstances incident to the giving of the statement. A reading of the charge in its entirety leads to the conclusion that this is correct. However, we wish to make it clear that in determining if a statement or confession is voluntarily made, the jury is not to take into account the <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>circumstances of its truth or falsity.
