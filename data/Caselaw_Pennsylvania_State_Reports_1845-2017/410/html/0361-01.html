However, appellants argue that the agreement was <em>an invalid restraint on alienation </em>because the price was <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>clearly very <em>unfair </em>and <em>unchangeable. </em>The contention that a stock option or purchase price must be flexible is unrealistic and utterly devoid of merit, even if we overlook the fact that the price was not unchangeable since in 1939 the parties entered into the present written agreement changing the price on options, purchases and sales from $50 to $1. Moreover, we repeat, the agreement clearly and expressly set forth the <em>intention </em>of all the parties — they wanted to keep the family business in the Mather family and to give each other and their personal representatives the options, rights and obligations hereinabove recited. There was a limited but not an absolute restriction on sale, since if the option was not exercised by a living signatory to the family agreement “the holder of said stock or his personal representatives shall have the right to sell same upon the open market without restrictions.” In this free land of ours where even a State cannot impair the obligations of a contract, we cannot understand how it can be seriously contended that this written family agreement — and family agreements are always favored in the law — when made by adult business men without any overreaching or fraud, is “a scrap of paper”.</p>
