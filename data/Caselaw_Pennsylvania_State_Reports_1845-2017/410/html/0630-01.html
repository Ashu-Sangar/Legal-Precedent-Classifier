The funds which appellant seeks to escheat<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> involve various sums of money received by the Company (more than seven years previously) from certain of its customers (or their contractors) for work performed in the installation of underground electric service-supply lines, at rates alleged to be higher than permitted under Company tariffs filed with the Commission.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The Company filed preliminary objections and a motion for a protective order, asserting, inter alia, that: (1) jurisdiction to determine the validity of tariffs and their application to particular charges is vested exclusively in the- Commission; (2) the petition reveals it is-not seeking property subject to escheat, and (3) the dis<a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>covery sought could not substantially aid in the preparation of pleadings for any proceedings for escheat.

    <p id="b655-3" data-blocks='[["BL_655.4",655,[173,750,1148,858]]]'>Appellant’s position is that the Company, in installing underground electric service facilities for certain customers, had “overcharged” by requiring and receiving payments representing more than “the excess costs” permitted for such installations in its filed tariff. It is contended that the Company was without legal authority to receive and customers to pay these overcharges, and that the excess charges constitute property without lawful owner and, therefore, are escheatable to the Commonwealth. The escheator asserts also, that since he is without knowledge or information as to the amount of such overcharges or the identity of customers from whom they were received, the information he seeks is relevant to the subject matter of the contemplated escheats and will substantially aid in the preparation of pleadings in such proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b655-4" data-blocks='[["BL_655.5",655,[171,1627,1149,422]]]'>The Company contends that only the Commission is initially vested with jurisdiction to decide whether its charges were in excess of the applicable rates listed in its tariffs.
