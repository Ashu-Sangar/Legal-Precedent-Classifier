The building has a licensed capacity for 32 patients, and, ordinarily, some patients are housed on the third floor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> It is proposed to erect a one story addition, 45 feet wide and 60 feet long, to be connected to the present home by a passageway 20 feet long.

Both structures will be able to accommodate a total of 45 patients.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The cost of the proposed addition is approximately $60,000.</p>

We do not agree that the ordinance limits the grant of a special exception to the facts and conditions recited in this portion of the ordinance. The lower court’s exclusive reliance on the precise language of this sub-paragraph overlooks the significance of the broad introductory directive that: “In the exercise of this power, the Board <em>may, among other variances, modifications and interpretations, authorize a permit to be issued,” </em>for the uses recited in the 19 succeeding sub-paragraphs. (Emphasis supplied.) This language clearly indicates that the illustrated uses are not the only ones permitted. We find nothing in the ordinance itself which restricts the Board’s authority to the instances detailed; hence there is no basis for imposing <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>such limitation upon the discretionary powers entrusted to it. This view of the Board’s authority is in accord with the earlier portion of the paragraph which provides: “Where, by reason of topographical conditions, ... or because of other exceptional circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this Ordinance would result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon the owner of any specific property, <em>the Board, </em>in passing upon appeals, <em>shall have the power to vary or modify such strict application </em>or to interpret the meaning of this Ordinance so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided that such variance modification or interpretation shall remain <em>in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Ordinance, </em>so that the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the community shall be conserved and substantial justice done.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
