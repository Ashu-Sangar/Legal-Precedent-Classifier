In 1949, O’Brien and National Southern Products Corporation (National) organized the Alabama Binder &amp; Chemical Corporation (Alabama).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> This corporation was to be the sales corporation for plasticizers and binders which were to be manufactured by National.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Under the 1949 arrangement, O’Brien was named president of the newly formed corporation with National owning 50% of the stock of Alabama and O’Brien and his wife owning the other 50%. From the time Alabama was formed until his employment terminated, O’Brien was the entire sales department of Alabama, selling to the various national manufacturers of floor tile.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In addition to this sales function, O’Brien was instrumental in developing formulas for different types of binders and plasticizers manufactured by National.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>This arrangement proved lucrative for all parties concerned. In June of 1957, O’Brien and Ms wife entered into two written agreements with Alabama. One of the agreements provided for the sale to Alabama of the stock owned by the O’Briens in return for a certain percentage of Alabama’s gross profits to be computed over a five-year period in an amount not to exceed $500,000. This agreement also provided that all formulas and technical information in the possession of O’Brien and Alabama at the time of the agreement, and all formulas and technical information thereafter developed and acquired by O’Brien relating to the products sold through Alabama, should be the exclusive property of National. Pursuant to this agreement, the O’Briens earned the $500,000 maximum consideration over the five-year period.</p>

This agreement contained a provision which stated that O’Brien was to refrain, during the term of his employment and for five years thereafter, "from at any time engaging in or taking any part or interest in, directly or indirectly, any business, occupation or pursuit that competes or conflicts with the business of Alabama or is contrary to its interests.” The agreement further provided that <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>O’Brien was not to give or disclose any formulas or technical information to any competing company.</p>
    <p id="b240-4" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[217,471,1148,688]]]'>The relationship between O’Brien and National continued to be an amicable and profitable one, with O’Brien remaining as president of Alabama and performing the same duties. Before O’Brien had completed his five-year term of employment, National was involved in a series of mergers in January 1961, with Alabama finally merging into National and National changing its name to Alabama Binder &amp; Chemical Corporation (New Alabama). O’Brien was made a vice-president of the new corporation and continued to work for and receive his salary and share of the profits from New Alabama in accordance with his agreement with its predecessor.</p>
    <p id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.5",240,[216,1172,1147,473]]]'>O’Brien’s employment expired in June 1962 and he and New Alabama were unable to come to terms in their negotiations for a new contract. A month later O’Brien was employed by appellant, Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical Corporation (PICCO), a Pennsylvania corporation which was a competitor of New Alabama in the field of binders and plasticizers, which employed O’Brien with knowledge of the restrictive provisions contained in the aforementioned agreements.</p>
    <p id="b240-6" data-blocks='[["BL_240.6",240,[211,1656,1150,529]]]'>On learning of O’Brien’s new employment, appelleeNew Alabama brought a complaint in equity praying for an injunction to enjoin O’Brien from continuing in the employ of PICCO and to prevent him from disclosing any secret processes and formulas protected under the 1957 agreements. New Alabama also seeks an accounting for any profits resulting from the alleged misconduct of appellants O’Brien and PICCO. After hearing voluminous testimony,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> the court below issued a temporary injunction pending a final hearing.</p>
    <p id="b241-2" data-blocks='[["BL_241.3",241,[202,356,1148,639]]]'>
      <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>For the purposes of granting the temporary injunction, the court below held that the five-year restriction in the contract was reasonable as to time and space. In regard to the geographical breadth of the covenant, the lower court stated that the market for binders and plasticizers sold by both Alabama and PICCO was confined to a limited number of floor-tile manufacturers<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> having offices throughout the United States and it was therefore reasonable and proper to insert a restriction covering the territorial United States. As to the time of the restriction, the court again felt that under all the circumstances this provision was not unreasonable.</p>
    <p id="b241-3" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[202,1007,1148,311]]]'>With respect to the disclosure of trade secrets, the court stated that “ ‘[w]here confidence is reposed, and the employee by reason of the confidential relationship has acquired knowledge of trade secrets, he will not be permitted to make disclosures of those secrets to others to the prejudice of his employer.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b241-4" data-blocks='[["BL_241.5",241,[201,1330,1148,636]]]'>And finally, the court held that New Alabama had standing to enforce these agreements despite appellants’ contention that these agreements were non-assignable personal service contracts. It cited several cases supporting the proposition that “restrictive covenants not to compete are just as assignable as any other asset of the employer’s business.” Moreover, it held that even in the absence of assignability, New Alabama has standing to enforce the contract since O’Brien had ratified the assignment of his contract when he knowingly continued to work for the new corporation under the same contract he had with the old corporation.</p>

Lindenfelser, </em>supra, the court below had <em>apparently reasonable grounds </em>for its action, especially in view of the fact that the re<a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>strictive covenant was made in conjunction with a buy-sell agreement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> As we have traditionally held, covenants not to compete which are ancillary to a buy-sell agreement will not be subject to as stringent a test of reasonableness as that applied to employment contracts.

    <p id="b242-4" data-blocks='[["BL_242.4",242,[216,737,1146,423]]]'>Appellants also maintain that the aforesaid covenant of nondisclosure is void because it contravenes the patent laws of the United States, citing <em>Scott Paper Company v.

O’Brien was in a position to pass on to a competing company secret formulas which he had acquired while in the employ of Alabama and its successor and there is evidence in the record indicating that O’Brien was asked about these formulas by officials of PIOOO. In addition, the fact that New Alabama and PIOOO sold to the same limited group of customers who were previously serviced by O’Brien placed O’Brien in the position to draw customers away from appellee and perhaps transfer them to his new employer. Not only is <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>there an immediate threat of injury but such injury would also be irreparable since it would be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain the damages inflicted upon appellee. See <em>Philadelphia, Ball Club, Limited v. Lajoie, </em><a href="/pa/202/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="202 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="992374" data-case-paths="/pa/202/0210-01">202 Pa. 210</a>, 216, <a href="/citations/?q=51%20A.%20973" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="51 A. 973">51 Atl. 973</a>, 974 (1902); <em>Stuart v.

    <p id="b243-3" data-blocks='[["BL_243.4",243,[215,743,1148,536]]]'>Second, greater injury would result by refusing the preliminary injunction than by granting it.

In comparison to the immediate and irreparable harm that appellee is subjected to, O’Brien would suffer no serious injury. At worst, he will be deprived of his salary from PICCO, which may be compensated by damages in the event it appears at final hearing that the injunction was improvidently granted.</p>
    <p id="b243-4" data-blocks='[["BL_243.5",243,[215,1288,1148,694]]]'>As to the effect of the injunction on appellant PICCO, the degree of injury imposed on it. would be far less than the injury which would be sustained by appellee if the injunction had not been granted. Since O’Brien is still a new employee of PICCO and has not become indispensable, PICCO can obtain a replacement for him. Moreover with respect to the trade secrets, once they are fully disclosed no order can possibly restore their secrecy, whereas, if after the final hearing it is determined that PICCO may have access to this information, then the only harm which PICCO will suffer is the short delay that takes place until the final hearing.</p>
