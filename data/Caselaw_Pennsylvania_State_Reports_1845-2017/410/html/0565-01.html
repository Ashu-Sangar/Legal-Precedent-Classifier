    <p id="b588-10" data-blocks='[["BL_588.18",588,[251,1490,1147,529]]]'>Appellants are residents of a development known as the McNary Plan located in Peters Township, a second class township of Washington County. The lots in the subdivision are connected by five roads which were constructed by the developers of the McNary Plan and are presently open to and used by the public. Desiring that these five roads be made a part of the public road system, and hence maintainable at township expense, appellants made an offer of dedication to appellees, the supervisors of Peters Township.</p>
    <p id="b588-11" data-blocks='[["BL_588.19",588,[251,2031,1149,313]],["BL_589.1",589,[175,351,1148,369]]]'>Appellees refused to accept the offer of dedication until appellants undertook certain improvements so that the roads would conform with township requirements for public roads. Unwilling to make these improvements, appellants sought to achieve their objective by proceeding under section 1101 of The Second <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>Class Township Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In accordance with that section, they presented a petition to appellees to “survey, lay out, and open” the five roads as public roads. When the supervisors failed to act within 60 days, appellants presented a petition to the court below for the appointment of a board of viewers. The court below refused to appoint viewers and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b589-5" data-blocks='[["BL_589.4",589,[175,732,1149,531]],["BL_590.1",590,[243,354,1149,362]]]'>We hold that the court below correctly decided that section 1101 of the Code was improperly invoked in this case. That section gives a court of quarter sessions power to appoint a board of viewers to “survey, lay out [and] open” roads as public roads where the township supervisors fail to so act. But the roads in question here have already been surveyed, laid out, and opened by the developers of the McNary Plan, and thus there is no reason or basis for the appointment of viewers under section 1101.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Appellants’ objective is <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>not to have roads laid out and constructed as public roads, but rather to have roads already constructed maintained at public expense. See <em>In re Milford, </em><a href="/pa/4/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="401901" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0303-01">4 Pa. 303</a> (1846). In such a situation, the proper procedure is to comply with the provisions of The Second Class Township Code dealing with dedication of private roads.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In <em>Lank, </em>however, we had no occasion to consider the propriety of proceeding under section 1101 since the only question before us there was whether mandamus would lie to compel supervisors to maintain roads which had already “been judicially made a part of the Scott Township road system.” (<a href="/pa/402/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="402 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="1296765" data-case-paths="/pa/402/0284-01">402 Pa. at 287</a>). Here, we are faced with the question — not decided in <em>Lank </em>— whether these roads can judicially be made a part of the township road system by the appointment of viewers under section 1101.</p>
