L. 872, as amended, 18 P.S. §4699.15, prohibiting the sale of certain personal property on Sunday. After hearings before a justice of the peace, the defendants were found guilty and sentenced to pay fines. Appeals were allowed to the County Court of Allegheny County. The cases were then heard by a judge of that court without a jury. After hearing the testimony of several Commonwealth witnesses, counsel agreed to stipulate all of the facts deemed material. Subsequently, the court entered orders in each case <em>adjudging the defendants “not guilty.” </em>The Commonwealth appeals.</p>

Obenreder, </em>supra, at 254-255: “It is well settled in this State that the Commonwealth cannot appeal from a judgment of acquittal in criminal prosecutions, except in cases of nuisance, forcible entry and detainer, and forcible detainer .... And this is so whether the prosecution be by indictment ... or by summary proceeding .... And, if the former, it does not matter whether the verdict be rendered by the jury of its own accord or by direction of the court .... Such a verdict or judgment of acquittal is not to be confused with the quashing of an indictment, or an arrest of judgment following a verdict of guilty, or a judgment sustaining a demurrer to the evidence, which raise only questions of law <em>and do not result in a verdict of not guilty or judgment of acquittal,</em>

      </a>
      <em> </em>and accordingly in those cases, the Commonwealth may appeal.” This rule was reiterated by Judge (now President Judge) Rhodes in <em>Commonwealth v. Kerr, </em>supra, wherein at 602, he said: “[T]he result of the verdict of not guilty is that the Commonwealth is precluded from appealing from the judgment of acquittal.” As pointed out in <em>Commonwealth v. Heiland, </em>supra, at 189: “The rule is the same whether the result is an error committed by the trial court or a perverse finding of the jury.” Even in a case wherein the court below sustains the defendant’s demurrer to the Commonwealth’s evidence and in addition erroneously enters a judgment <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>of not guilty, the Commonwealth may not appeal. <em>Commonwealth v.

On appeal from a conviction before an alderman, the case was tried below before a judge without a jury on an <em>agreed statement of facts </em>and the decision of the court was based solely on a construction of the relevant statute. Prom a judgment of “not guilty,” the Commonwealth appealed. The Superior Court at 162, said: “The correctness of the construction of the statute by the Court below may involve an important question, but the more important the question the stronger the reason for withholding an expression of an opinion upon it until it arises in a real dispute, where the appellate court has jurisdiction of an appeal by a defendant alleging that he has been improperly convicted. When the question argued on this appeal arises upon the record of a case properly before us, it will deserve most careful and serious consideration. <em>The defendant having been adjudged not guilty by the court which had jurisdiction to try him, we are without authority, in the circumstances here presented, to reverse that judgment and order a new trial.” </em>(Emphasis added).</p>
