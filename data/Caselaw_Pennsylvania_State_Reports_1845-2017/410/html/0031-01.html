In an action involving damages arising out of a tortious accident, is it proper to inform the jury that the injured person is receiving or has received workmen’s compensation? That question has already been met in other cases but it is presented here in a slightly different form.

For instance, it would he entirely improper, in a personal injury case, for the defendant to show that the plaintiff was receiving benefits under an accident insurance policy, or that he was on a pension, or was obtaining assistance from the government as a war veteran or in any other capacity. It is no less irrelevant in a trespass action for the jury to be informed that the plaintiff, during the period he is claiming damages for injuries allegedly inflicted by the defendant, was paid workmen’s compensation as a result of the same injuries for which he is claiming damages. A tortfeasor may not ride to immunity from his wrong on the back of workmen’s compensation paid by someone else. His disability is direct and may not be transferred.</p>

    <p id="b56-4" data-blocks='[["BL_56.4",56,[244,729,1149,851]]]'>The pertinent facts in the case at bar follow. Irene Boudwin, an employee of the Perfect Photo, Inc., of Philadelphia, was seriously injured on October 24, 1957, when the car which she was driving for her employer, was struck by a cab of the defendant Yellow Cab Company. She brought suit against the cab company and, in the ensuing trial, the jury returned a verdict in her favor in the sum of $16,000. She asks for a new trial on the ground that the verdict inadequately covered her injuries which impaired her vision and affected her spinal column to the extent that she has been unable to work at gainful employment ever since the accident. She was hospitalized five different times for varying periods for examination and treatment in the fields of neurology, neurosurgery, opthalmology and orthopedics.</p>
    <p id="b56-5" data-blocks='[["BL_56.5",56,[242,1593,1148,310]]]'>From the date of the accident up to the time of the trial she lost $9,166 in unpaid wages; her medical expenses amounted to $3,451.

    <p id="b56-6" data-blocks='[["BL_56.6",56,[240,1916,1147,422]],["BL_57.1",57,[194,361,1145,98]]]'>It could be argued that, in the absence of trial errors, or palpable misapprehension of the facts, the jury is in a better position than an appellate court, to assess the damages due a plaintiff who has proved negligence against the defendant. The plaintiff submits here, however, that there were indeed trial errors and that these errors occasioned what she claims is a grossly inadequate verdict. The most serious of those as<a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>serted trial errors was the introduction of evidence on workmen’s compensation.</p>
    <p id="b57-3" data-blocks='[["BL_57.4",57,[193,476,1149,587]]]'>The accident occurred, as already stated, on October 24, 1957. The plaintiff was paid workmen’s compensation, through her employer’s insurance carrier, Aetna Insurance Company, from October 24, 1957 to November 24, 1960. In his cross-examination of the plaintiff, defendant’s counsel sought to inquire into this workmen’s compensation. Plaintiff’s counsel objected. Defendant’s counsel argued: “I offer this not as evidence in diminution of the plaintiff’s right to recover, but simply in connection with the issue of credibility . . .”</p>
    <p id="b57-4" data-blocks='[["BL_57.5",57,[191,1080,1150,525]]]'>The trial court overruled the objection and the plaintiff was required to answer, which she did, admitting that she had received workmen’s compensation. This evidence threw confusion into the jury box. The court said to the jury: “Let me say to the jury at this point, the fact she was receiving workmen’s compensation has nothing to do with the mitigation of damages and you will not have that in your minds at all, or diminution of damages, merely the fact it was received.”</p>
    <p id="b57-5" data-blocks='[["BL_57.6",57,[190,1631,1147,206]]]'>This explanation could not remove from the minds of the jury the fact that the plaintiff had already received moneys for the same injuries for which she was now claiming damages from the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b57-6" data-blocks='[["BL_57.7",57,[188,1857,1148,468]]]'>The defendant argues that no harm was done to the plaintiff’s case by this testimony because no mention was made of the actual amount of workmen’s compensation paid. The absence of that particular information perhaps aggravated rather than lessened the harm done the plaintiff because the jury was allowed to believe that the workmen’s compensation was equivalent to the plaintiff’s full salary, which, of course it was not.</p>
    <p id="b58-3" data-blocks='[["BL_58.3",58,[252,347,1152,1395]]]'>
      <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>Defendant’s counsel argued at the trial, as he does here, that he opened up the subject of workmen’s compensation for the purpose of attacking Miss Boudwin’s credibility, asserting that since there was testimony at the trial that she was not in fact grievously disabled, she, by continuing to receive compensation, told, in effect, a falsehood. But how could such evidence prove that Miss Boudwin had engaged in falsehood? The Aetna Insurance Company certainly was not compelled to pay the plaintiff compensation merely because she <em>said </em>she was unable to work. If the insurance company continued to send her workmen’s compensation checks it could only be because it was <em>convinced </em>that, because of her disablement, she was entitled to them. If the insurance company believed, and could prove that, Miss Boudwin was not in fact incapacitated, all it had to do, in order not to be imposed upon, was to take appropriate action before the Board of Workmen’s Compensation. It is not even within the realm of speculation that the insurance company may have paid compensation to Miss Boudwin out of charitable impulses. Nor would it be permitted to do so. How then, can it reasonably be argued that the uncoerced payment of compensation by Aetna for three years in any way established that Miss Boudwin was lying by áccepting it?</p>
    <p id="b58-4" data-blocks='[["BL_58.4",58,[250,1754,1147,421]]]'>If it was proper to show that Miss Boudwin was not entitled to workmen’s compensation, then it should have been equally proper for her to introduce as much evidence as she desired to prove the contrary, which would have meant, of course, a retrial of the workmen’s compensation case within the framework of the damage case. Such a procedure could only result in evidentiary chaos.</p>

What other <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>purpose could there have been? Even, however, accepting the violent hypothesis that <em>that </em>was not the intent of defendant’s counsel, such absence of intent would not scour impropriety from the improper question he put to the plaintiff. It is not what counsel intends that counts; it is the effect on the jury of what he says which counts; and one cannot exclude the possibility, if not probability, that a discussion of workmen’s compensation in a personal injury case produces the impression that the plaintiff is seeking double remuneration for one set of injuries.</p>
    <p id="b59-3" data-blocks='[["BL_59.4",59,[164,951,1149,421]]]'>It is admitted by the defendant that it could not have introduced in its direct case the fact that the plaintiff received workmen’s compensation. But, getting the same subject before the jury through an indirect method does not make such. introduction legal. Evidence which cannot be brought into a case through the front door of direct evidence may not be introduced through the chimney of improper cross-examination.</p>
    <p id="b59-4" data-blocks='[["BL_59.5",59,[158,1383,1151,683]]]'>Bringing the matter of workmen’s compensation into this case harmed the plaintiff in another way. If the jury found, as defendant wanted it'to find, that the plaintiff received compensation to which she was not entitled, this finding would not discharge the debt the plaintiff owes the insurance carrier. She would still have to pay back all that she received legally and properly, but since the jury would already have deducted from her verdict what they <em>thought </em>she had not been entitled to, she would thus have to pay the insurance carrier an amount she did not receive in the damage case, which would in effect work a double deprivation.</p>
    <p id="b59-5" data-blocks='[["BL_59.6",59,[155,2087,1148,260]]]'>During the trial defendant’s counsel asked the plaintiff: “Now, you testified to certain hospital and medical bills which have been incurred in connection with your injuries.

      <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>The trial court properly sustained the objection made by plaintiff’s counsel, but already the plaintiff’s case had been dealt an unfair disadvantage by this question because it allowed the jury to assume that there were bills which the plaintiff did not have to pay, and the only conclusion the jury, on that premise, could reach would be that the bills were paid by the same company that paid her workmen’s compensation. Which, of course, had nothing to do with the case. This is another illustration of thé pitfalls into which a trespass trial may stumble when it leaves the solid rock highway of the principal issue and rambles into the marshes of irrelevancy of workmen’s compensation.</p>

There, the subject of workmen’s compensation was adverted to only indirectly and under circumstances wholly different from those in the case at bar. In that very case the Court’s opinion referred to several decisions of this Court which clearly disapprove of the introduction of evidence on collateral benefits received by the plaintiff. It called attention to <em>Ridgeway v. Sayre Elec.

Isn’t it a fact that on the evening of December 11, 1959, you met a friend, a girl, at Charley’s Bar and Grill on North Broad Street about 10 p.m., and then you ran across North Broad Street to get a taxicab <em>; </em>then you went in the taxicab to meet a date at. the Orpheum Theatre, on Chelton Avenue?
