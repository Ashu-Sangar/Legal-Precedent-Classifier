Thall, appellant, was employed as a teacher in the Sullivan County school system for 31 years. In 1958, the county superintendent had discussions with appellant and his supervising principal in regard to complaints about appellant’s teaching ability. In the fall of 1958, two announced visits were made to appellant’s classroom and further discussions took place concerning observations made during these visits. Nothing further developed until 1961 when the county superintendent made three unannounced visits to appellant’s classroom. After the third visit, the county superintendent rated appellant’s performance as unsatisfactory on the rating card provided by the De<a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>partment of Public Instruction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> This was tbe first rating made of appellant’s competency during Ms teaching career.

The court below, stating that it was “not bound by any finding of fact or conclusion of law of the Superintendent of Public Instruction,” concluded that the evidence did sustain the charge of incompetency.

    <p id="b248-6" data-blocks='[["BL_248.7",248,[245,1551,1147,206]],["BL_249.1",249,[192,369,1156,1127]]]'>Section 1123<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> provides that “In determining whether a professional employe shall be dismissed for incompetency . . . the professional employe . . . shall be rated by an approved rating system ... in accordance <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>with standards and regulations for such scoring as defined by rating cards to be prepared by the Department of Public Instruction . . . .” In pursuance of this legislative directive, the Superintendent of Public Instruction has compiled a rating card listing 27 areas for rating under the four subdivisions of “personality,” “preparation,” “technique,” and “pupil reaction.” In addition, the Superintendent has ruled that a final unsatisfactory rating is required in order to dismiss for incompetency; that two preliminary unsatisfactory ratings are necessary before such final rating can be made,, the first one serving as a warning that improvement in performance is essential;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> that notice of an unsatisfactory rating, together with substantiating anecdotal reports, be sent to the professional employe as quickly as possible. The purpose of this rating scheme is not only to establish more concrete standards to judge competency, but it is also designed to stimulate improvement in the general level of teaching by drawing attention to existing deficiencies.

In justification of its actions, the Board stated that appellant was aware since 1958 of the dissatisfaction with his performance but resisted any suggestions for improvement. Moreover, the county superintendent testified that he did not like to issue unsatisfactory ratings unless absolutely necessary. Although we have no doubt that the Board was sincerely motivated in this matter, nevertheless its failure to comply with section 1123 and the regulations passed thereunder cannot be excused. If a dismissal <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>is to be justified on tbe grounds of incompetence the legislative provisions for supervising the competency of professional employes must be strictly followed. Cf. <em>Streibert v.

    <p id="b250-5" data-blocks='[["BL_250.4",250,[240,747,1152,856]]]'>Section 1125 of the Public School Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> provides that school boards shall establish permanent ratings for each professional employe and that <em>“No professional employe shall be dismissed under this act </em>unless such rating records have been kept on file by the board. . . .” (Emphasis supplied). The purpose of this permanent rating system is both to improve the performance of professional employes, and also to make comparative ratings available in case circumstances dictate a decrease in the staff of professional employes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> The county superintendent in our ease described his rating system as one where the absence of a rating indicated satisfactory performance.

This judicial reluctance to reverse a dismissal unrelated to matters involved in the rating system is quité understandable.
