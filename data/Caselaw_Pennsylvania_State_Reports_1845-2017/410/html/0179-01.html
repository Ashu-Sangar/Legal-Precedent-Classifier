At the conclusion of the entire charge the following colloquy took place: “Me.

Davis, </em><a href="/pa/408/0267-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="408 Pa. 267" data-case-ids="1308424" data-case-paths="/pa/408/0267-01">408 Pa. 267</a>, 271, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.2d%20745" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="182 A.2d 745">182 A. 2d 745</a>, wherein we stated: “Where an erroneous instruction consists of a palpable misstatement of the law, it is not cured by a conflicting or contradictory one which correctly states the law on the point involved, for ’the jury, assuming, as is their duty, that the instructions are all correct, may as readily have followed the incorrect as the correct one and it is impossible to know which they accepted: [citing cases].” In our view, the instructions given by the trial court to the jury that a motorist at street intersections is ordinarily held to the highest degree of care were clearly erroneous and it cannot with any certainty be said that such erroneous instructions did not mislead this jury and, therefore, a new trial must be granted.</p>
    <p id="b208-4" data-blocks='[["BL_208.4",208,[244,1221,1147,307]]]'>In view of the grant of a new trial we might well not give any consideration to the second point raised by Lieberman, i.e., the refusal of one of his points for charge. However, since the case must be retried, we deem it expedient to pass upon this point which might be raised at the second trial.</p>
    <p id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[242,1548,1148,736]]]'>Lieberman requested the court to charge: “If you find that the PTC bus driver was driving over to his left of the center of the highway, so far to the left that a car coming the other way could not have passed, then you may find him negligent”. The court below refused to so charge. Both factually and legally the court was correct in its refusal to so charge. There was no evidence that the bus was being operated so far to the left that a car coming south on Greene Street could not have passed it and the record reveals nothing which could have sustained a finding that the position of the bus to the left or wrong side of the imaginary center line of Greene Street was a proximate cause of this collision.</p>
