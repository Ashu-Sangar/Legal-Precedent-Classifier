For the use of these facilities, P.T.C. pays the City a substantial license fee in lieu of a minimum rental, and the City is entitled to a share of P.T.C.’s profits in excess of a specified amount. P.T.C. also pays the City a rental on 270 subway and elevated railway cars. By virtue of certain agreements between the City and P.T.C., the City has an option to purchase from P.T.C. the facilities of the transit system which the City does not already own; and City Council has a right to select several members of the P.T.C.’s Board of Directors, in addition to the Mayor, who is, ex officio, a director of that Company.</p>

For many days prior to January 15th, the P.T.C. and the Union, with the aid of Federal, State and local mediators, had bargained “collectively” concerning the terms of a new contract, but their efforts were unsuccessful.

In the Complaint plaintiffs averred, inter alia, several of the above recited facts. They also averred that (a) by its refusal to permit the incorporation of any “no lay-off” clause in any proposed agreement with the union, P.T.C. was not bargaining in good faith; (b) that the continuance of the strike was not only working extreme hardship to all the citizens of Philadelphia, but was also subjecting the City, in its proprietary capacity, to irreparable financial damage and that this was due to the company’s failure to properly operate the transit system and to properly maintain the facilities of that system belonging to the City, thereby causing a loss of current rentals, as well as a probable permanent loss of patronage by the P.T.C. and consequent loss of rentals to the City. Complainants also averred that P.T.C.’s conduct of negotiations with the union, its refusal to agree to a “no lay-off” clause, and its insistence on an increase in fares before any agreement could be made with the union constituted “gross mismanagement” and <em>tended </em>to impair its solvency.</p>

The complainants also requested the Court to appoint a receiver to take (possession of all the assets and property of P.T.C. and to operate its transit facilities “until a new labor agreement between P.T.C. and the representations of its em<a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>ployees has become effective.” General relief was also prayed for.</p>

On January 24th the P.T.C. filed a responsive answer admitting many factual averments in the complaint but denying all of appellees’ averments of law and conclusions, including the right of the City to the relief prayed for. Included in such Answer was New Matter in which P.T.C. averred that it had been engaging in collective bargaining in good faith, and that none of the representatives of the City who were members of P.T.C.’s Board of Directors had suggested the desirability of adopting different policies, and that Mayor Tate had entered into the negotiations contrary to the wishes of defendant and had interfered with and obstructed defendant’s negotiations. P.T.C. prayed for an injunction against the plaintiffs to restrain them from further interference with collective bargaining between P.T.C. and its employees.

The President by executive order directed the Secretary of Commerce “to seize and operate” the mills. The goal and the objective in that case was exceptionally desirable — to keep the mills working for the welfare of our entire Country. In order to justify this temporary seizure the President alleged that his action was taken in order to protect, preserve and promote the national security, but the effect was the same as in the present action and decree — to take from the employer his property and his right to operate his property and to bargain freely with a labor union. The Supreme Court of the United States expressly, specifically and flatly decided in that case that the attempted temporary seizure of the steel mills — even in time of war and for an exceptionally worthy objective — was illegal and unconstitutional !</p>
