But argue the appellants, this does not conclusively establish that the insured knew they were false or intended thereby to deceive and defraud the company. It is speculated that the false statements were made inadvertently and unintentionally. As stated in <em>Derr v. Mutual Life Ins.

How can it now be reasonably asserted that the insured through inadvertence forgot or innocently overlooked his frequent examinations, consultations and treatments by physicians within a relatively short period of time before making and executing the application for insurance? How could he have innocently overlooked, or considered of such little significance that it should not be disclosed, his hospitalization, the taking of numerous x-rays and electrocardiograms? To ask these questions is to answer them. Even if it be conceded that the insured had no indica<a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>tion of any serious illness, he was hound to know and to remember substantially all of the medical treatment, hospitalization, x-rays and electrocardiogram. <em>Anastasio v.

Since the leading case of <em>Evans v.

See, e.g., <em>Allstate Insurance Co. v. Stinger, </em><a href="/pa/400/0533-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="400 Pa. 533" data-case-ids="1292518" data-case-paths="/pa/400/0533-01">400 Pa. 533</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=163%20A.2d%2074" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="163 A.2d 74">163 A. 2d 74</a> (1960). In addition, it is required that there also be an intent to deceive on the part of the insured, i.e., an attempt through false answers to secure insurance which would not otherwise be obtainable at the same rates, or at all. In <em>Evans </em>itself, we upheld the denial of a motion for judgment n.o.v. although it was admitted that the insured knowingly concealed that he was suffering from a dislocated vertebra, a condition which eventually caused his death. We stated that the jury could reasonably conclude that the condition was too trivial to report. In <em>Adams v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/322/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="322 Pa. 564" data-case-ids="1167924" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0564-01">322 Pa. 564</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=186%20A.%20144" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="186 A. 144">186 Atl. 144</a> (1936), we upheld the denial of a motion for judgment n.o.v. although the insured knowingly failed to reveal that she had consulted a doctor fifteen times within three months prior to the application.
