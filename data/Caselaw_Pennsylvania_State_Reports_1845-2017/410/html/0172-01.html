Coal Company, a partnership of Peary Farester and Lucille E. Farester, his wife. It appeared to DiEmidio that the Faresters were stripping beyond the area for which they had secured a permit from the Sanitary Water Board. After DiEmidio and Yobbagy discussed the possible violation with Peary Farester at the scene of the mining operation, they went to the company’s office to examine the permit and the blueprints and maps of the area. Because it was late in the afternoon when they arrived at the office, they agreed to meet there the following morning to discuss the matter further. The next morning [DiEmidio and Yobbagy] and the Faresters met at breakfast and then went to the company’s office. Mr. Farester walked up the steps to the office with DiEmidio and Mrs. Farester and Yobbagy followed them. Mrs. Farester said to Yobbagy that she was worried because they would lose everything if they were forced to close their operation for two or three months. Yobbagy said he did not think she needed to worry, and then suggested that she walk down the hall with him.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

What did [Yobbagy] say, to the best of your recollection, to you? A. The best of my recollection was that this thing could be taken care of. And at first, I had a hard time getting it through my head exactly what he meant, and finally I said to him, ‘Do you mean that this would be a payoff.’ And I don’t recall his exact words, but he gave me to believe — By the Court: No, what he said as near as you can. A. As near as I can recall [Yobbagy], said, yes, that Mr. DiEmidio could be talked to, that he was the eyes and the ears of the Sanitary Water Board, and only what he saw — . . . .

Farester said that the company was not able to stand too much, but maybe he could scrape up a couple hundred dollars a piece. A check was then made out for $400 and taken to the bank and cashed by a stenographer who gave the cash to DiEmidio. He put it into his pocket, joined Yobbagy in the other room and the two of them left the company’s office together.

The <em>sole </em>testimony upon which the Commonwealth relies to incriminate Yobbagy is that of Mrs. Farester and all that she testified to was that Yobbagy suggested to her “that Mr. DiEmidio could be talked to, that he was the eyes and the ears of the Sanitary Water Board, and only what he saw Avas reported to the Ebensburg office.” From that suggestion of Yobbagy — “that Mr. DiEmidio could be talked to” — the Commonwealth seeks to justify Yobbagy’s conviction of conspiracy. The Commonwealth seeks from that suggestion to draw two inferences,— and they can only be inferences — , an inference that Yobbagy meant that DiEmidio, <em>for a price, </em>would withhold a report of the violation and a further inference that Yobbagy made the suggestion as the result of an agreement with DiEmidio to extort money from the Faresters.

There is not a scintilla of evidence of any such understanding or agreement between Yobbagy and DiEmidio and, absent proof of such understanding, the charge of conspiracy must fall. An inference upon an inference or suspicion and conjecture do not take the place of proof. The standards of proof necessary to sustain a charge of conspiracy are not satisfied merely by a suggestion on the part of one alleged conspirator that his alleged fellow conspirator “can be talked to”.</p>
