        "text": "Opinion bt\nMe. Justice Robeets,\nThe Hatfield Packing Company, a processer and packer of meat products, was found guilty (before an alderman) of violating Section 7 of the Pennsylvania Commodity Act, which provides: \u201cNo person shall distribute or sell or have in his possession with intent to distribute or sell any commodity in package form, unless the net quantity of the contents shall be plainly and conspicuously marked on the outside of the package in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count: Provided, however, That reasonable variations shall be permitted; and tolerances may be established by rules and regulations made by the department [of Internal Affairs]. Before any tolerances are granted, producers and manufacturers of commodities must make written application for a tolerance to the department, and must furnish proof that the use value of the commodity will not be affected by the granting of the tolerance. ...\u201d\nSection 2(2) of the Act directs that \u201cAll meat and meat products . . . shall be sold by weight; . . .\u201d\nHatfield had prepared for distribution and sale meat products in cellophane or polyethylene wrappings which were not marked as to the weight of the contents thereof. Appellant\u2019s petition for appeal to the Court of Quarter Sessions of Lehigh County was denied. Appeal to this Court followed.\nAppellant contends that the purposes of wrapping are to identify the product, to preserve its sanitation, and to assist the storekeeper in merchandising. At the plant, the products are placed in a cardboard box, which box is then weighed and marked. At the retail establishment, the products selected by the merchant are delivered to him and weighed in the aggregate. They are neither weighed separately nor marked individually by the packer\u2019s salesman. The court below correctly concluded that the products involved were \u201ccommodities\u201d and \u201cpackages\u201d within Section 1 of the Act.\nNeither the validity nor the constitutionality of the Act is challenged. Appellant\u2019s basic justification for not marking tlie weight on the wrappers is its assertion that between the time of wrapping and sale to the ultimate consumer, natural shrinkage occurs and reduces the weight of the product. It is further argued that compliance with the statutory language would likely result in conflict between the weight recorded at the plant and the actual weight at the time of sale to the ultimate consumer. Overlooked, however, is the fact that the Legislature, in Section 7, has provided at least one practical method for avoiding such a possible result.\nThe fundamental weakness in appellant\u2019s position is that appellant prefers to utilize its packaging and weight-marking procedure in lieu of that set forth in the Commodity Act. As the lower court properly pointed out: \u201cWhile it is not difficult to appreciate that these meat products shrink in varying amounts we must observe that the testimony does not indicate that reasonable variations, permissible under Section 7, were applied for. In short, there is a remedy which the appellant could seek under the legislation. . .\u201d\nThe appeal was correctly denied by the court below, and that order is affirmed.\nMr. Justice Cohen dissents.\nAct of July 24, 1913, P. L. 965, as amended, 76 P.S. \u00a7247.\nAdded May 18, 1945, P. L. 788, \u00a71, 76 P.S. \u00a7242(2).\n76 P.S. \u00a7241. \u201cThe word \u2018commodity\u2019 . . . shall mean anything, goods, wares, merchandise, compound, mixture or preparation, products of manufacture of any tangible personal property, which may be lawfully kept, sold, or offered for sale.\u201d\n\u201cThe word \u2018package\u2019 . . . shall mean everything containing one or more than one unit of any commodity, tied or bound together, or put up in box, bag, pack, bundle, container, bottle, jar, can or any other form of receptacle or vessel, not considered as an approved measure, except cases, cartons, crates, bundles or bales used for bulk shipping or storage; Provided, That enclosed packages are marked as to weight, measure or numerical count.\u201d\nIt should be noted that appellant complies with the Act in its weight-marking of frankfurters and bacon.",
