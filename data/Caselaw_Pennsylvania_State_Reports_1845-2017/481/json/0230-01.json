        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nEAGEN, Chief Justice.\nIn this action in assumpsit filed in the Commonwealth Court by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Public Welfare, the Commonwealth sought recovery from Adams County and its Commissioners for fifty per cent of the costs of administering the Federal Food Stamp Program in that county during the period July 1, 1974, to March 31, 1976. The court below sustained defendants\u2019 preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. This appeal followed.\nThe background of the case is as follows: In August, 1964, Congress enacted the Food Stamp Program which provided for optional participation by states and their political subdivisions. In December, 1965, the Pennsylvania General Assembly responded by enacting three statutes which, taken together, provided for statewide implementation of the program on a voluntary basis. Each of these laws permitted adoption of the Food Stamp Program by resolution, and established the percentage of administrative costs to be assumed by participating counties and paid to the administering state agency, the Commonwealth\u2019s Department of Public Welfare (Department). In November, 1967, acting pursuant to Section 1991 of the Pennsylvania County Code permitting participation by third through eighth class counties, the Commissioners of Adams County, a county of the sixth class, adopted the program by resolution. By subsequent resolution in February, 1968, Adams County withdrew its participation in the program before implementation was begun.\nIn June, 1967, the General Assembly enacted Section 471 of the Pennsylvania Public Welfare Code. Section 471 re-enacted Section 1991\u2019s method of computing the share of administrative costs owed to the Department by \u201ceach county or city of the first class.\u201d [Emphasis added.] Although Section 471 made no reference to voluntary adoption of the program by political subdivisions, as was provided by Section 1991, neither did it explicitly repeal Section 1991.\nImplementation of the Food Stamp Program in Adams County began on March 1, 1972. At that time responsibility for the county\u2019s share of administrative costs was voluntarily assumed by the Adams County Council of Community Affairs. On August 10, 1973, the Federal Food Stamp Act was amended, effective June 30, 1974, to require each \u201cState agency\u201d to submit \u201ca plan of operation specifying the manner in which such State agency intends to conduct the program in every political subdivision in the State . . .\u201d On July 1, 1974, the Adams County Council of Community Affairs terminated its funding of the county\u2019s share of administrative costs. Nevertheless, the Department continued distributing food stamps in Adams County and billed the county for fifty per cent of the administrative expenses for each quarter in the period from July 1, 1974, to March 31, 1976, when the liability for participating counties was terminated. By this action, the Department seeks to recover half of the costs of administering the Food Stamp Program during that period, or approximately $13,300.\nThe Department claims recovery on two bases: (1) Adams County\u2019s statutory liability under 62 P.S. \u00a7 471, and (2) its liability in quasi-contract on a theory of unjust enrichment. Commonwealth Court sustained a preliminary objection to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint on both grounds. We have concluded that a cause of action was stated under 62 P.S. \u00a7 471, and the Commonwealth Court erred in dismissing the Department\u2019s complaint.\nThe Federal Food Stamp Act of 1964 provided for optional participation by States and their political subdivisions in the Federal Food Stamp Program. The 1964 Act contained the following language:\n\u201c(e) The State agency of each State desiring to participate in the food stamp program shall submit for approval a plan of operation specifying the manner in which such program will be conducted within the State, the political subdivisions within the State in which the State desires to conduct the program, and the effective dates of participation by each such political subdivision.\u201d [Emphasis added.] 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2019(e)\nIn 1965, the Pennsylvania General Assembly enacted three separate statutes which permitted counties of the first through eighth classes to adopt the Food Stamp Program by resolution. The statute applicable to Adams County as a county of the sixth class was Section 1991 of the Pennsylvania County Code which states as follows:\n\u201cThe board of commissioners of any county to which this act applies may by resolution adopt the food stamp program. Upon adoption of the program the county shall appropriate money and shall pay, quarterly from county funds, the amounts certified to the county as being the obligations to the Department of Public Welfare for thirty per cent of the amount expended by the department for administration of the food stamp program for the county during the fiscal year 1965-66, for forty per cent of the amount expended during the fiscal year 1966-67 and for fifty per cent of the amount expended during the fiscal year 1967-68 and thereafter.\u201d [Emphasis added.] 16 P.S. \u00a7 1991\nIn 1967, the General Assembly enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme of public assistance known as the Public Welfare Code and entitled \u201cAn Act to consolidate, editorially revise, and codify the public welfare laws of the Commonwealth.\u201d Section 471 of the Act provides:\n\u201cTo compute for each quarter the amount of Commonwealth funds expended by the department for the administration of the food stamp program for each county or city of the first class. For the fiscal year 1965-66, thirty per cent; for the fiscal year 1966-67, forty per cent; and, for the fiscal year 1967-68, and thereafter, fifty per cent of the amount so expended for each county or city of the first class shall be certified to it, and shall become its obligation to be paid to the department.\u201d [Emphasis added.] 62 P.S. \u00a7 471\nThe Commonwealth asserts that Section 471 superseded Section 1991, and that Section 471 provides the basis for Adams County\u2019s statutory liability. It argues, while Section 1991 requires payment of a share of administrative costs by counties which have voluntarily adopted the program, Section 471 contains no language indicating that county participation is optional and, on its face, requires participation and reimbursement of administrative costs by every county in the Commonwealth. In sustaining the preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer, the Commonwealth Court held that Section 471 did not impliedly repeal Section 1991 and that, \u201con its face, Section 471, as originally enacted, was limited to counties and cities of the first class; a local government .classification to which Adams County does not belong.\u201d [Emphasis added.] Thus, the court concluded, the county\u2019s obligation for administrative expenses of the Food Stamp Program during the period July 1, 1974, to March 31, 1976, was still governed by Section 1991 of the County Code, and, since Adams County had withdrawn from the program by resolution, it was not obligated under Section 1991 to reimburse the Department. We are compelled to disagree with Commonwealth Court\u2019s interpretation of Section 1991 and Section 471.\nThe Commonwealth Court determined the phrase contained in Section 471 \u2014 viz., \u201ceach county or city of the first class\u201d is \u201cclear and free from all ambiguity\u201d and, thus, the words of the statute are not to be disregarded in ascertaining legislative intent. We cannot agree that the phrase \u201ceach county or city of the first class\u201d unambiguously refers only to counties and cities of the first class. The phrase can also be read to mean \u201ceach county regardless of its class and each city of the first class.\u201d Since the words of the statute are not \u201cclear and free from all ambiguity,\u201d the intention of the General Assembly must be ascertained by considering other factors, including the consequences of a particular interpretation.\nIf the troublesome phrase \u201ceach county or city of the first class\u201d is construed, as it was by the Commonwealth Court, to mean only counties of the first class and cities of the first class, then Section 471 refers exclusively to Philadelphia, which is the only county of the first class as well as the only city of the first class in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the General Assembly intended Section 471 to replace only 62 P.S. \u00a7 2544, and not 16 P.S. \u00a7 1991 and 16 P.S. \u00a7 5198.1.\nFinally, in determining whether the General Assembly intended Section 471 to be applicable to every county in the Commonwealth or only to counties of the first class, we note that Section 471 was amended in 1976 to terminate the liability of \u201cevery county, and . . . each city of the first class\u201d for their statutory share of the administrative costs of the Food Stamp Program. It is clear that the 1976 law applies to every county regardless of class and sought to clarify the prior ambiguous language of Section 471. The General Assembly, in terminating the liability of every county by amending Section 471, must have considered that every county was liable under Section 471 prior to the 1976 amendment. Furthermore, the new language in Section 471 clearly reiterates the intent of the prior Section 471 to impose liability for the period in question on every county. Thus, we conclude that Section 471 was applicable to every county which participated in the Food Stamp Program.\nWe conclude further that Section 471, as originally enacted, mandated participation in the Food Stamp Program by every county and thus superseded Section 1991 to the extent that Section 1991 provided for voluntary participation by counties.\nSection 1991 and Section 471 may be considered in pari materia inasmuch as they relate to the same subject matter \u2014 viz., the obligation of certain counties receiving federal food stamps for a share of administrative costs. As such, they should be construed together, if possible, as one statute. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1932(a) and (b). However, where, as in this case, provisions of statutes enacted by different General Assemblies are irreconcilable, the statute latest in date shall prevail. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1936. Furthermore, where a general provision of a statute is in conflict with a special provision of another statute and the two provisions are irreconcilable, the general provision shall prevail if it was enacted later and the General Assembly intended that such general provision shall prevail. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1933. Here, Section 471, enacted two years after Section 1991, is essentially a re-enactment of Section 1991 except that Section 1991 pertains only to counties of the third through eighth classes and is contingent upon voluntary adoption by those counties. The more general provisions of Section 471 contain no contingencies and are applicable to \u201ceach county.\u201d\nFinally, we are guided by the following rule of statutory construction:\n\u201c\u00a7 1971. Implied repeal by later statute\n(a) Whenever a statute purports to be a revision of all statutes upon a particular subject, or sets up a general or exclusive system covering the entire subject matter of a former statute and is intended as a substitute for such former statute, such statute shall be construed to supply and therefore to repeal all former statutes upon the same subject.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1971(a).\nThe Pennsylvania Welfare Code, of which Section 471 is a part, was enacted for the purpose of consolidating the Commonwealth\u2019s public welfare laws. Prior to its passage, three separate laws provided for the optional participation of political subdivisions in the Food Stamp Program. Section 471, as part of the codification of the public welfare laws, replaces the three separate laws with one section that covers the entire subject matter of participation by political subdivisions in the Food Stamp Program. Thus, under 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1971, Section 471 has impliedly repealed Section 1991, and participation in the Federal Food Stamp Program and a concomitant obligation for a share of administrative costs are mandated by state law for each county, as well as each city of the first class, since the obligation which Section 471 imposes is not contingent upon voluntary adoption of the program.\nIn fact, a program of food stamp distribution was not begun in Adams County until March 1, 1972, and between that date and July 1,1974, the county\u2019s share of administrative costs was assumed by a private agency. Whatever doubts existed during that period regarding Adams County\u2019s legal obligation under Section 471 to participate in the program and share in its costs should have been dispelled when Congress enacted the 1973 amendments to the Food Stamp Act mandating operation of the program in every political subdivision of each state after June 30, 1974.\nAs originally enacted Section 2019(e) of the Food Stamp Act provided for optional participation by States and their political subdivisions. In 1973 that section was amended to read in pertinent part as follows:\n\u201cThe State agency is required to submit, prior to January 1, 1974, for approval, a plan of operation specifying the manner in which such State agency intends to conduct the program in every political subdivision in the State, unless such State agency can demonstrate that for any political subdivision it is impossible or impracticable to extend the program to such subdivision. The Secretary shall make a determination of approval or disapproval of a plan of operation submitted by a State agency in sufficient time to permit institution of such plan by no later than June 30, 1974.\u201d [Emphasis added.] Act of August 10, 1973, Public Law 93-86, \u00a7 3, 87 Stat. 247, 7 U.S.C.A. 2019(e).\nAs a result of the 1973 amendments, after June 30, 1974, participation in the Food Stamp Program by every political subdivision of each State was mandated, thus rendering meaningless the voluntary adoption provision of Section 1991. In light of the federal mandate and Section 471\u2019s requirement that participating counties share in the program\u2019s costs, we conclude that the Department has stated a cause of action against Adams County on the basis of its statutory liability.\nCommonwealth Court also dismissed the complaint as not stating a cause of action in quasi-contract on the basis that \u201c . . . the County was under no obligation to participate in the program or to assume a share of administrative costs absent voluntary participation.\u201d Since our interpretation of Section 471 shows the county indeed had an obligation to participate and to assume a share of the costs, that basis for dismissing the complaint was without foundation.\nOrder of Commonwealth Court granting Adams County\u2019s preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which POMEROY, J., joined.\n.

In order to arrive at this conclusion the majority interprets the phrase \u201cfor each county or city of the first class\u201d as ambiguous and therefore looks to legislative intent and finds the legislature must have intended to mean every county regardless of its class and cities of the first class. I must dissent.\nThe majority is attempting to reach a desired result when it finds the phrase ambiguous.
