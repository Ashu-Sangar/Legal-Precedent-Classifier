        "text": "OPINION\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nWe are asked in five companion cases to decide the constitutionality of Pennsylvania\u2019s Sunday Trading Laws, popularly referred to as the \u201cBlue Laws\u201d, which prescribe criminal sanctions for all labor, business, and commercial activities on Sunday, with noted exceptions. The Superior Court held that appellants\u2019 constitutional claims were foreclosed by earlier decisions of this Court and of the United States Supreme Court, 243 Pa.Super. 479, 366 A.2d 254 (1976). However, the court was divided on the question of whether appellees, certain municipalities in Allegheny County, discriminated in the enforcement of the laws in violation of the principle outlined by the United States Supreme Court in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886). We granted appellants\u2019 petitions for allowance of appeal, and, on November 20,1976, continued the Superior Court\u2019s earlier order staying prosecutions under the Sunday Trading Laws until further order of this Court. We now reverse for the reasons contained herein.\nIn 1974, appellants, Kroger Company and Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company were cited by appellees for violations of the Sunday Trading Laws. Both McCandless and O\u2019Hara Townships initiated formal prosecutions, but Ross Township warned of the possibility for prosecution should appellants remain open on Sunday.\nKroger Company and Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company then filed a petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County to enjoin appellees from prosecuting under the Sunday Trading Laws. Appellants also sought a stay of any further prosecutions pending adjudication of this case. After a review of the depositions, stipulations, and sundry evidentiary materials, the Court of Common Pleas granted appellants\u2019 stay but denied appellants\u2019 relief on the merits. The Kroger Co. v. O\u2019Hara Township, 123 P.L.J. 275 (C.P.Allegh.Co.1975). Appellant, Jamesway Corporation, based on the belief that our stay order entered in the Kroger Company case was of statewide application, opened its store in Conewango Township, Warren County, on Sunday, November 26, 1976. That same day, Jamesway\u2019s store manager was charged with ten separate violations of one section of the Sunday Trading Laws. Jamesway filed a complaint in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Warren County, seeking to enjoin the defendant township from enforcing the Sunday Trading Laws. Appellant, Jamesway, like appellants Kroger and Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea, challenged the constitutionality of the Sunday Trading Laws and also contended that (1) the court order of November 20th was of statewide application, and (2) if not, it was unjust for Jamesway to be prosecuted for violations of the Sunday Trading Laws in one county when this Court stayed similar prosecutions in another county.\nThe Court of Common Pleas of Warren County denied the injunctive relief and also denied Jamesway\u2019s request to stay prosecutions pending appeal. The Superior Court denied similar requests. Jamesway then applied to this Court for similar relief, and on December 17, 1976, this Court granted the relief sought, enjoining the further proceedings and staying those already commenced against appellant\u2019s store manager. Appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal was subsequently granted.\nAppellants, Fishers Big Wheel, Inc. and Treasure Island Department Stores, Inc., like appellant Jamesway opened for Sunday business after this Court\u2019s order of November 20, 1976 which stayed prosecutions in the Kroger Co., case. After being cited for sales of merchandise in violation of the Sunday Trading Laws, injunctive and interim relief was requested but denied by the Court of Common Pleas of Lawrence County and later denied by the Superior Court. On December 11, 1976, we granted the relief sought by Fishers and Treasure Island, and later granted their petition for allowance of appeal.\nAppellants, Fishers and Treasure Island, do not raise any issues other than those raised by appellants Kroger Co., Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., and Jamesway Corporation.\nThe four sections of the Sunday Trading Laws, 18 Pa.C. S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 7361-7364 (1973) herein challenged provide as follows:\n\u201c\u00a7 7361.

Selling certain personal property\n(a) Offense defined. \u2014 A person is guilty of a summary offense if he engages on Sunday in the business of selling, or sells or offers for sale, on such day, at retail, clothing and wearing apparel, clothing accessories, furniture, housewares, home, business or office furnishings, household, business or office appliances, hardware, tools, paints, building and lumber supply materials, jewelry, silverware, watches, clocks, luggage, musical instruments and recordings, or toys.\n(b) Separate offenses. \u2014 Each separate sale or offer to sell shall constitute a separate offense.\n(c) Exceptions.\u2014\n(1) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to novelties, souvenirs and antiques.\n(2) No individual who by reason of his religious conviction observes a day other than Sunday as his day of rest and actually refrains from labor or secular business \u2022 on that day shall be prohibited from selling on Sunday in a business establishment which is closed on such other day the articles specified in subsection (a) of this section.\n(d) Limitation of action. \u2014 Information charging violations of this section shall be brought within 72 hours after the commission of the alleged offense and not thereafter.\n(e) Repeated offense penalty. \u2014 A person who commits a second or any subsequent offense within one year after conviction for the first offense shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not exceeding $200.\n(f) Definitions. \u2014 As used in this section the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection:\n\u2018A day other than Sunday.\u2019 Any consecutive 24 hour period.\n\u2018Antique.\u2019 An item over 100 years old, or ethnographic objects made in traditional aboriginal styles and made at least 50 years prior to their sale.\n\u201c\u00a7 7364.

Kennedy, 459 Pa. 313, 329 A.2d 224 (1974). Also by the Act of October 25, 1973, P.L. 314, No. 99, \u00a7 1, certain provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 7361, 7362, 7363, 7364 were suspended, unless otherwise determined by local option. The suspending act now permits after the hour of 1 o\u2019clock P.M. \u201cthe conducting, staging, managing, operating or engaging in sport, musical, theatrical and dramatic performances, exhibitions, contests and similar activities.\u201d 4 P.S. \u00a7 40.1 (Supp.1978-79)).\nThe question of the constitutionality of state Sunday trading laws has arisen in various states. In twelve of those states those laws or some portion of those laws have been held to be unconstitutional. Henderson v. Antonacci, 62 So.2d 5 (Fla.1952); Rutledge v. Gaylord\u2019s Inc., 233 Ga. 694, 213 S.E.2d 626 (1975); Pacesetter Homes, Inc. v. Village of South Holland, 18 Ill.2d 247, 163 N.E.2d 464 (1958); Boyer v. Ferguson, 192 Kan. 607, 389 P.2d 775 (1964); City of Ashland v. Heck\u2019s Inc., 407 S.W.2d 421 (Ky.1966); State v. Target Stores, Inc., 279 Minn. 447, 156 N.W.2d 908 (1968); Skag-Way Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc. v. City of Omaha, 179 Neb. 707, 140 N.W.2d 28 (1966); People v. Abrahams, 40 N.Y.2d 277, 386 N.Y.S.2d 661, 353 N.E.2d 574 (1976); Spartan\u2019s Industries, Inc. v. Oklahoma City, 498 P.2d 399 (Okl.1972); Skaggs Drug Centers, Inc. v. Ashley, 26 Utah 2d 38, 484 P.2d 723 (1971); County of Spokane v. Valu-Mart, Inc., 69 Wash.2d 712, 419 P.2d 993 (1966); Nation v. Giant Drug Co., 396 P.2d 431 (Wyo.1964). In seven other states which have examined their Sunday trading laws, the laws have been upheld as constitutional. See, e. g., Caiola v. City of Birmingham, 288 Ala. 486, 262 So.2d 602 (1972); State v. Fantastic Fair, 158 Me. 450, 186 A.2d 352, (1962); Zayre Corp. v. Fenton, Civil No. S-875 (Mass., April 21, 1977); Genesco, Inc. v. J. C. Penney Co., Inc., 313 So.2d 20 (Miss.1975); Vornado, Inc. v. Hyland, 77 N.J. 347, 390 A.2d 606 (1978); State v. Giant of St. Albans, Inc., 128 Vt. 539, 268 A.2d 739 (1970); Mandell v. Haddon, 202 Va. 979, 121 S.E.2d 516 (1961).\nSince the laws of each state obviously vary, decisions in other jurisdictions may be instructive but of course are not controlling in exercising our obligation to protect the constitutional rights of our citizens under the Pennsylvania Constitution.\nCourts have used several different rationales to arrive at their decisions. See Henderson v. Antonacci, supra (because no rational basis supports the legislation); Pacesetter Homes, Inc. v. Village of South Holland, supra, (as unrelated to the maintenance of quiet and order); Boyer v. Ferguson, supra, (not uniformly applied throughout the state); People v. Abrahams, supra, (numerous exceptions to Sunday laws have destroyed reasonable relation between laws and their alleged purpose); Spartan\u2019s Indus., Inc. v. Oklahoma City, supra, (differentiating between dealers of the same product is discriminatory. In litigation arising under the Kansas Sunday Trading Law, Boyer v. Ferguson, supra, the Supreme Court of Kansas considered Article 2, Section 17 of the Kansas Constitution a provision similar to Art. Ill, \u00a7 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The Kansas Constitution provides:\n\u201cAll laws of a general nature shall have a uniform operation throughout the state; and in all cases where a general law can be made applicable, no special law shall be enacted; and whether or not a law enacted is repugnant to this provision of the constitution shall be construed and determined by the court of the state.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Court then concluded that the laws violated Article 2,\nSection 17 of the Kansas Constitution.\nRecently, the New Jersey Supreme Court rejected a constitutional challenge to the New Jersey Sunday trading laws provision. The dissenters however were convinced that the equal protection clause of New Jersey\u2019s state constitution was violated. Vornado v. Hyland, supra.\nThey pointed out that:\n\u201cIt is fundamental that all police power legislation must conform to the State constitutional requirement of equal protection of the laws. This basic guarantee, secured by NJ.Const. (1947), Art. I, par. 1, is independent from that of the federal constitution.\u201d (citations omitted).\nThe Supreme Court of Oklahoma examined the Sunday Trading ordinance of Oklahoma City which was drafted in conformity with their state\u2019s Sunday Closing Laws. Spartan\u2019s Industries, supra. This ordinance sets forth a general prohibition against Sabbath breaking activities and then exempts over twenty-six different types of businesses including \u201crecreational facilities, amusement centers, fairs and trade shows.\u201d Id. at 400. In addition, the city ordinance contained a purpose clause which stated that a common day of rest by means of general cessation of work would create an atmosphere in which individuals could relax, and friends and relatives could gather for social occasions. The court found that the \u201cmere recital\u201d of reasons which may have given rise to the ordinance was not controlling on the court. The court then added that the question of arbitrariness was to be resolved by the judiciary:\n\u201c . . . The city, in the exercise of its police powers, may subject all occupations within its limits to reasonable regulations, for the protection of the public interests or for the public welfare; but this power is not an arbitrary one, for the avocations which may be controlled by police regulations is a judicial question.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at 402.\nWhen the statutory classifications were no longer deemed rationally related to the original state objective, the New York Court of Appeals declared that state\u2019s Sunday trading laws unconstitutional. The New York statute, like the Pennsylvania statute, contained individual exceptions which rendered the entire scheme unconstitutional. The court noted:\n\u201cWhile that history demonstrates that no impermissible taint of establishment of religion clings to the statute, it also proves that the statute is not the product of a single, conceptually cohesive legislative plan, but, instead, the consequence of years of patching and filling by the Legislature as it attempted to keep up with rapidly changing societal patterns and needs. Under such circumstances, it was almost inevitable that a time would come when the patchwork no longer made any sense. . . . \u201d\nId. 386 N.Y.S.2d at 669, 353 N.E.2d at 581.\nOur own Pennsylvania Sunday Trading Laws have been modified in similar patchwork fashion which leave us with a wide variety of statutory prohibitions, permissions, and restrictions on Sunday activity.\nPennsylvania\u2019s first Sunday closing law was enacted in 1682. Citizens were to \u201cabstain from their usual and common toil and labour\u201d on the first day of the week, in order to protect against, among other things, \u201clooseness,\u201d \u201coppression,\u201d \u201cinsolence\u201d and \u201clicentiousness.\u201d See Charter and Laws of the Province of Pennsylvania 1682-1700, at 107-08. After various revisions throughout the colonial period, the final colonial enactment, the Act of April 22, 1794, was re-enacted almost verbatim into the Act of June 24, 1939. Entitled \u201cWorldly Employment or Business on Sunday, the Act provides in full:\n\u201cWhoever does or performs any worldly employment or business whatsoever on the Lord\u2019s day, commonly called Sunday (works of necessity and charity only excepted), or uses or practices any game, hunting, shooting, sport or diversion whatsoever on the same day not authorized by law, shall, upon conviction thereof in a summary proceeding, be sentenced to pay a fine of four dollars ($4), for the use of the Commonwealth, or, in default of the payment thereof, shall suffer six (6) days\u2019 imprisonment.\nNothing herein contained shall be construed to prohibit the dressing of victuals in private families, bakehouses, lodging-houses, inns and other houses of entertainment for the use of sojourners, travellers or strangers, or to hinder watermen from landing their passengers, or ferrymen from carrying over the water travellers, or persons removing with their families on the Lord\u2019s day, commonly called Sunday, nor to the delivery of milk or the necessaries of life, before nine of the clock in the forenoon, nor after five of the clock in the afternoon of the same day.\u201d Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, \u00a7 699.4. See Chadwick v. Stokes, 162 F.2d 132, 133 (3d Cir. 1947) (reprinting text of 1939 Act); Bertera\u2019s H. Foodland, Inc. v. Masters, 428 Pa. 20, 26, 236 A.2d 197, 200 (1967) (reprinting text of 1794 Act.)\nThis \u201cparent\u201d Act of 1939, however, was not to be the only legislative enactment which impacted on those activities which the citizens of this Commonwealth could engage in on Sunday. For example, in 1935 the showing of motion pictures on Sunday was restricted. See 4 P.S. \u00a7 60 (1963). The Sunday playing of pool was regulated in 1939, see 18 Pa.C. S.A. \u00a7 7105 (1973) (formerly 18 P.S. \u00a7 4651): the playing of polo in 1935. See 4 P.S. \u00a7 152 (1963). That same year (1935) beauty culture work was prohibited on Sunday although 16 years later such work could be conducted if for educational purposes. See 63 P.S. \u00a7 519 (1968). The 1935 law prohibiting beauty culture work put that occupation on an equal footing with barbering, outlawed four years earlier. See 63 P.S. \u00a7 559 (Supp.1978- 79). In 1933, those who earned their living by conducting musical performances could work on Sunday. See 4 P.S. \u00a7 121 (1963).\nThe two decades following the parent Act\u2019s enactment in 1939 saw the passage of further Sunday closing laws. In 1949, extension education was prohibited on Sunday. See 24 P.S. \u00a7 19-1903 (1962). Boxing and wrestling exhibitions on Sunday were prohibited in 1955. Act of August 31, 1955, P.L. 531, art. II, \u00a7 202. Sunday harness racing was outlawed four years later. Act of December 22, 1959, P.L.1978, \u00a7 7. In 1959, the law allowing Sunday fishing only during the open season was clarified and reenacted. See 30 P.S. \u00a7 265 (Supp.1978-79). In 1957, the sale or purchase of motor vehicles and trailers on Sunday was prohibited. See 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7362 (1973). Six years later, forms of entertainment incidental to the showing of motion pictures was prohibited. See 4 P.S. \u00a7 65 (1963).\nThe end of this twenty year period did not signal a decrease in the Legislature\u2019s interest in enacting Sunday laws. Rather, the enactment of such laws continued apace. The years 1959 and 1961 are particularly noteworthy, for the Legislature\u2019s sessions in those two years were marked by major attempts to accommodate the general prohibition against Sunday employment and activity to the needs of the citizens of Pennsylvania; the parent act itself underwent significant change. Newspapers could be sold on Sunday, Act of August 28, 1959, P.L. 777, \u00a7 1; work connected with public utility service could be performed, Act of November 19,1959, P.L. 1530, \u00a7 1; drama and civic light opera could be produced and performed for an admission charge but only by certain persons at certain times and in cities of the second class, Act of July 6,1961, P.L. 514, \u00a7 1; basketball, ice shows and ice hockey could be performed and admission charged, but only in cities of the first and second class and only at certain hours, Act of July 10, 1961, P.L. 560, \u00a7 1; although the sale of fresh meats and other groceries were prohibited, establishments that were small, family-managed, or prepared food on the premises could open on Sunday, Act of September 27, 1961, P.L. 1695, \u00a7 1 (now codified at 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7364). The parent statute, which was captioned in terms of worldly employment and business but also prohibited various sports and recreational activities, was amended to permit \u201cwholesome recreation\u201d such as golf, bowling, and target shooting. Act of December 16, 1959, P.L. 1874, \u00a7 2. And although the parent act\u2019s general prohibition against worldly employment or business was maintained, a new provision was added to the Commonwealth\u2019s penal laws, specifying a large number of specific items \u2014 novelties and souvenirs excepted \u2014 the sale of which was prohibited and carried fines of up to $200 and prison sentences of up to thirty days. Act of August 10, 1959, P.L. 660, \u00a7 1.\nThe years since 1961 have brought even further modifications of Pennsylvania\u2019s Sunday closing laws. In 1967, persons who for religious convictions closed their business on a day other than Sunday were permitted to open on Sunday. Act of July 19, 1967, P.L. 180, \u00a7 1. In 1968, antiques were grouped with novelties and souvenirs as items which could legally be sold on Sunday. Act of May 3, 1968, P.L. 104, \u00a7 1. In 1973, all acts or parts of acts were suspended, unless determined otherwise by local option, which prohibited the conducting, staging, managing, operating or engaging in sport, musical, theatrical and dramatic performances, exhibitions, contests and similar activities. Act of October 25, 1973, P.L. 314, No. 99, \u00a7 1, 4 P.S. \u00a7 40.1 (Supp.1978-79). In spite of the 1973 amendment, the legislature thought it necessary to explicitly allow Sunday harness racing, and boxing and wrestling exhibitions. In 1974, the former prohibition of Sunday harness racing was removed; Sunday racing is now permitted after 1:00 p. m. See 15 P.S. \u00a7 2607(c) (Supp.1978-79). Boxing and wrestling exhibitions, once expressly prohibited on Sunday, are now permitted at anytime. See 4 P.S. \u00a7 30.202 (Supp.1978-79).\nEach of the appellants contends that the Pennsylvania Sunday Trading Laws violate the Pennsylvania Constitution. We agree that the Sunday Trading Laws deny appellants the equal protection guaranteed by our Pennsylvania Constitution and thus today hold the Sunday Trading Laws, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 7361-7364 (1973) to be unconstitutional.\nIt is one thing to legislate exceptions in order to achieve a coherent statute which furthers the end of a uniform day of rest and recreation for all. However, when a law which prohibits business activity is riddled with exception after exception, a time comes when the general scheme is so diluted that it violates the equal protection of the laws. That time is today.\nThe equal protection portion of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Art. Ill, \u00a7 32, contains the following language:\n\u201cSec. 32. Certain local and special laws\nThe General Assembly shall pass no local or special law in any case which has been or can be provided for by general law and specifically the General Assembly shall not pass any local or special law:\n1. Regulating the affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards, boroughs or school districts:\n2. Vacating roads, town plats, streets or alleys:\n3. Locating or changing county seats, erecting new counties or changing county lines:\n4. Erecting new townships or boroughs, changing township lines, borough limits or school districts:\n5. Remitting fines, penalties and forfeitures, or refunding moneys legally paid into the treasury:\n6. Exempting property from taxation:\n7. Regulating labor, trade, mining or manufacturing:\n8. Creating corporations, or amending, renewing or extending the charters thereof:\nNor shall the General Assembly indirectly enact any special or local law by the partial repeal of a general law; but laws repealing local or special acts may be passed.\u201d (Amended and renumbered May 16,1967 from Art. 3, \u00a7 7). (It should be noted that appellants, Kroger and A & P, rely upon Act 3, \u00a7 7 which was the predecessor to Art. 3, \u00a732.)\nIn the past we have stated that the content of this provision is not significantly different from the Equal Protection Clause of the federal Constitution which provides \u201cnor [shall any State] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Baltimore & O. R. Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Labor and Industry, 461 Pa. 68, 334 A.2d 636 (1975), Bargain City U. S. A. v. Dilworth, 407 Pa. 129, 179 A.2d 439 (1962). While there may be a correspondence in meaning and purpose between the two, the language of the Pennsylvania Constitution is substantially different from the federal constitution. We are not free to treat that language as though it was not there. Because the Framers of the Pennsylvania Constitution employed these words, the specific language in our constitution cannot be readily dismissed as superfluous.\nIn San Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973) the United States Supreme Court concluded that when a right is explicitly or even implicitly guaranteed by the federal Constitution, the Court has a duty to strictly scrutinize any state statute interfering with such a right before declaring such a statute constitutional and the state must show a compelling interest. San Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez, supra; Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972); Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972). It is the constitutional mandate which requires this more stringent standard, not the social importance of the subject covered by the state legislation. Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 92 S.Ct. 862, 31 L.Ed.2d 36 (1972).\n\u201c. . . the answer lies in assessing whether there is a right . . . explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the Constitution.\u201d\nSan Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. at 33, 93 S.Ct. at 1297, 36 L.Ed.2d at 43.\nAlthough the view of the United States Supreme Court concerning proper guidelines for its interpretation of the federal constitution is not binding upon us in interpreting the Pennsylvania Constitution, we agree that we should be guided by the same principles in interpreting our Constitution. To do otherwise would be to place this Court\u2019s subjective value judgment as to what interests of the people are most important above the value judgment contained in our state Constitution. This we refuse to do.\nIn Article III, Section 32, of the Pennsylvania Constitution we find eight areas explicitly mentioned as areas which are not to be encumbered by special laws treating certain citizens differently than others. Specifically, the General Assembly is prohibited from passing any special law \u201cregulating labor, trade, mining or manufacturing.\u201d We therefore find that it is our judicial duty to carefully examine any law regulating trade.\nThe justification for the Sunday Trading Laws is to provide Pennsylvanians with a uniform day of rest and recreation. This objective is not here challenged. We therefore assume the constitutional propriety of this objective. In an attempt to achieve the objective there is no doubt that the legislature has regulated trade. Section 7361 outlaws all Sunday employment or business whatsoever and then various exceptions are listed. Section 7362 outlaws buying, selling, trading or dealing in motor vehicles and trailers on Sunday. Section 7363 prohibits the business of selling certain property, again with certain exceptions noted. Finally, Section 7364 forbids the business of retail selling of fresh meats, produce and groceries on Sunday with certain exceptions. Certainly, these four sections \u201cregulate trade.\u201d Accordingly, we must carefully scrutinize the validity of these special laws.\nWhile the United States Supreme Court has articulated a \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d and a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d test for examining state statutes which touch upon explicit or implicit constitutional rights, we need not decide whether that test is the proper one to be applied in determining the constitutionality of the Sunday Trading Laws under the Pennsylvania Constitution. Even applying the test of \u201cfair and substantial relationship,\u201d we conclude that the Sunday Trading Laws violate the Pennsylvania Constitution. Concerning the \u201cfair and substantial\u201d test we have said:\n\u201cThe Equal Protection Clause of both constitutions does not deny the State the power to treat different classes of persons in different ways, but does deny the right to legislate that different treatment be accorded to persons placed by a statute into different classes on the basis of criteria wholly unrelated to the objective of the particular statute. The classification must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.\u2019\u2019 (Emphasis added.)\nMoyer v. Phillips, 462 Pa. 395, 400, 341 A.2d 441, 443 (1973).\n(slander and libel exceptions providing these causes of action to survive death of party held unconstitutional.)\nThe \u201cfair and substantial\u201d test was also articulated in In re Estate of Cavill, 459 Pa. 411, 329 A.2d 503 (1974). (Pa. mortmain statute violative of equal protection) and although this case was based upon the United States Fourteenth Amendment we also stated that \u201c[o]ur holding is likewise mandated by the prohibition of special laws in the Pennsylvania Constitution, Pa.Const. art. Ill, \u00a7 32.\u201d 459 Pa. at 414, n.7, 329 A.2d at 505, n.7.\n\u201cFair and substantial\u201d means that the classification must be reasonable and not arbitrary, and the classification must rest upon some ground of difference which has a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly situated shall be treated alike. In re Estate of Cavill, supra; Moyer v. Phillips, supra.\nThe Sunday Trading Laws as a whole must fail when examined in this light. There is no fair and substantial relationship between the objective of providing a uniform day of rest and recreation and in permitting the sale of novelties but not Bibles and bathing suits; in permitting the sale of fresh meat patties but not frozen meat patties; or in permitting the installation of an electric meter but not a T.V. antenna. If the Legislature had said that all stores which employ tall people may open on Sunday, but not stores employing short people, we would surely conclude that such classifications had no fair and substantial relationship to the objective of providing a uniform day of rest and recreation even though such a law would reduce the total amount of Sunday business activity. Likewise, we cannot find a fair and substantial relationship to the objective in permitting the sale of oriental rugs more than fifty years old while prohibiting the sale of newer rugs; in permitting a table manufactured in 1877 to be sold but not one made in 1879; or in permitting the sale of newspapers but not magazines and books.\nThe objective of providing a uniform day of rest and recreation for all citizens of Pennsylvania is also undermined by the exception which gives to some a right to open their business and sell prohibited merchandise on a Sunday if they close their business on some other day. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7363(c)(2). If all citizens do not have the same day off, a uniform day of rest and recreation is not provided for all. The exception irrationally assumes that citizens who pray together should stay together for rest and recreation \u2014 an invidious suggestion. Moreover, such persons are permitted to sell certain personal property items mentioned in section 7363 but are not permitted to sell other merchandise such as automobiles, fresh meat, produce, or groceries. Additionally, why for instance can a merchant who sells an automobile, a typewriter, a gallon of paint, a hammer or a host of other miscellaneous items be immune from prosecution if no information is filed within seventy-two hours of the sale while another merchant selling an automobile accessory, a boat, dog food, a trip to Europe or a host of other miscellaneous items be subject to prosecution whenever the information is filed?\nWhen reviewing the constitutionality of a statute, it cannot be left to a particular judge\u2019s imagination as to whether he can conjure any relationship between a uniform day of rest and recreation and a hodgepodge of classifications. It may be that a computer analyzing the traits peculiar to each of the possible exception classifications allowed under the Trading Laws could ultimately discover some thread of rationality which might relate to providing a uniform day of rest and recreation. The explicit provisions in the Pennsylvania Constitution, however, prohibiting special laws regulating trade cannot depend upon the speculative results of a . possible computer program.\nWe conclude that the classifications in the Sunday Trading Laws do not bear a fair and substantial relationship to providing a uniform day of rest and recreation to the citizens of Pennsylvania. The Laws therefore are in violation of the Constitutional provision specifically prohibiting any special laws regulating trade contained in Article III, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\nAside from the fact that we agree with the United States Supreme Court that the interests of citizens explicitly or implicitly protected in a constitution are important interests imposing upon us a constitutional obligation to carefully review legislation interfering with those interests, we note that in recent years there is evidence that the United States Supreme Court is more exacting in examining whether state statutory classifications, treating citizens differently, deny those affected rights guaranteed by the federal constitution. Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 92 S.Ct. 251, 30 L.Ed.2d 225 (1971); Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U.S. 441, 93 S.Ct. 2230, 37 L.Ed.2d 63 (1973); Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762, 97 S.Ct. 1459, 52 L.Ed.2d 31 (1977).\nOne constitutional scholar has noted:\n\u201c[The Burger Court has] sporadically articulated some what more demanding criteria [than the Warren Court], in two respects: first, they have suggested that the means, the classification, must substantially further the statutory objective; second, there has been the suggestion that the Court will no longer regularly hypothesize conceivable state purposes against which to test the rationality of the means \u2014 the hypothesizing so familiar in the economic due process area and a concomitant of the Warren Court\u2019s old equal protection approach as well.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) (Footnotes omitted.)\nGunther, Constitutional Law: Cases and Materials. (9th Edition) 1975.\nIn view of the explicit provision in the Pennsylvania Constitution concerning the regulation of trade, we would not be discharging our obligation to protect the constitutional guarantees were we not to require the statutory classifications to substantially further the statutory objective.\nThe issue presented in this appeal concerning the constitutionality of the entire Sunday Trading Laws under the Pennsylvania Constitution has not been decided previously by this Court. The United States Supreme Court has reviewed Sunday closing laws in Two Guys From Harrison-Allentown, Inc. v. McGinley, 366 U.S. 582, 81 S.Ct. 1135, 6 L.Ed.2d 551 (1961), and McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961). In those two cases, the Court upheld, against an equal protection challenge based solely on federal grounds, the constitutionality of specific Sunday closing laws classifications which the Court concluded were reasonably related to the legislative purpose of providing a day of work stoppage and rest. Two Guys involved a challenge to the Pennsylvania closing laws, but unlike the present case which attacks the entire body of Sunday closing laws under the Pennsylvania Constitution, the federal equal protection challenge in Two Guys was directed only against the present 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7363, the \u201cGrocery Act.\u201d In a case subsequent to Two Guys, we held that an equal protection challenge to the same section of the Blue Laws was foreclosed by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in that case. Bargain City U. S. A. Inc. v. Dilworth, 407 Pa. 129, 130, 179 A.2d 439, 441 (1962). Since the present appeal is not limited to testing the constitutionality of \u00a7 7363, and in view of the fact that the present appeal is also grounded upon the Pennsylvania Constitution, Two Guys is not controlling precedent in this appeal. We also disagree with any intimation in the Superior Court\u2019s opinion that appellant\u2019s equal protection claim is foreclosed by Bertera\u2019s Hopewell Foodland, Inc. v. Masters, 428 Pa. 20, 236 A.2d 197 (1967). Bertera\u2019s dealt not with whether the Blue Laws as an entity could be reconciled with constitutional concepts of equal protection, but rather with the three exceptions to what is now 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7364, which prohibits the Sunday sale of meats or other groceries.\nAppellants also contend (1) that the Sunday Trading Laws violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the federal constitution; (2) that they violate the due process provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution; and (3) that they are being discriminatorily enforced within various counties. Since we find the Sunday Trading Laws to be violative of the equal protection guarantees of the Pennsylvania Constitution we find it unnecessary to address these other issues.\nConvictions under the Sunday Trading Laws cannot stand and further prosecutions under those laws cannot be initiated in view of the unconstitutionality of those laws.\nJudgments of sentence are reversed; and the orders of the Superior Court and of the trial courts denying injunctive relief are vacated and any pending prosecutions or future prosecutions under the Sunday Trading Laws are enjoined.\nNIX and LARSEN, JJ., filed concurring opinions.\nEAGEN, C.

These laws, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7361-64 (1973), are so riddled with exceptions as to violate the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by our state Constitution.\nI write to emphasize that the instant holding does not question the power of the legislature to hereafter enact Sunday Trading laws which may be compatible with constitutional mandates. The United States Supreme Court as well as this Court have upheld Sunday Trading laws in the past. See McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961); Two Guys From Harrison \u2014 Al lentown, Inc. v.

The result in the cases presently (before us) differs only because these laws, as they have developed over the years, lack \u201ca fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.\u201d Moyer v.

To be productive of the required advantage, these periods must recur at stated intervals, so that the mass of which the community is composed, may enjoy a respite from labour at the same time. They may be established by common consent, or, as is conceded, the legislative power of the state may, without impropriety, interfere to fix the time of their stated return and enforce obedience to the direction.\u201d\nSpecht v.

        "text": "EAGEN, Chief Justice,\ndissenting.\nA majority of this Court today concludes that the classification scheme established by Pennsylvania\u2019s Sunday Trading Law (\u201cBlue Laws\u201d) is so arbitrary and confusing that it bears no fair and substantial relationship to the statute\u2019s purpose of providing a uniform day of rest and recreation, and, thus, violates the Commonwealth\u2019s guarantee of equal protection of the laws contained in Article III, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\nThis is not the first time Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201cBlue Laws\u201d have been challenged on equal protection grounds. In Two Guys from Harrison-Allentown, Inc. v. McGinley, 366 U.S. 582, 81 S.Ct. 1135, 6 L.Ed.2d 551 (1961), the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of those sections of the \u201cBlue Laws\u201d regulating the sale of personal property, presently Sections 7361 and 7363, in response to an equal protection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court concluded a state legislature has the power to prohibit all business activity for the purpose of providing a uniform day of rest and then to make exceptions for certain activities it deems necessary and desirable. Further, the Court determined a legislature has the power to impose heavier penalties on the Sunday sale of selected items sold in quantity by large retail establishments in order to deter those stores from violating the closing laws.\nThe claim rejected in Two Guys is before the Court again today \u2014 viz., since statutory exceptions permitting certain businesses to operate on Sunday are not rationally related to the statute\u2019s purpose, the statute is rendered arbitrary and capricious and thus violates the equal protection guarantee. In Two Guys, the Court evaluated appellant\u2019s equal protection claim using the standard enunciated in McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 425-26, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1105, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961):\n\u201cThe standards under which this proposition is to be evaluated have been set forth many times by this Court. Although no precise formula has been developed, the Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment permits the States a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than others. The constitutional safeguard is offended only if the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State\u2019s objective. State legislatures are presumed to have acted within their constitutional power despite the fact that, in practice, their laws result in some inequality. A statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it. [Citations omitted.]\u201d\nOne year later this Court, in Bargain City U. S. A., Inc. v. Dilworth, 407 Pa. 129, 179 A.2d 439 (1962), rejected another equal protection challenge to the statute\u2019s retail sales provision, holding that a challenge under the Fourteenth Amendment was foreclosed by the decision in Two Guys and further, holding the \u201cBlue Laws\u201d constitutional under Article III, Section 7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which prohibits special laws regulating labor or trade.\nNext, in Bertera\u2019s Hopewell Foodland, Inc. v. Masters, 428 Pa. 20, 236 A.2d 197 (1967), this Court considered and rejected the claim that exceptions to the \u201cGrocery Act\u201d provision of the statute, presently Section 7364, violated both federal and state equal protection clauses. Finally, in Goodman v. Kennedy, 459 Pa. 313, 329 A.2d 224 (1974), we again upheld the constitutionality of one of the exceptions to the \u201cGrocery Act,\u201d presently Section 7364(c)(1), under both the Fourteenth Amendment and the Pennsylvania Constitution.\nIn each of the earlier constitutional challenges the United States and Pennsylvania Supreme Courts applied the same standard in evaluating the statute\u2019s prohibitions and exceptions made thereto \u2014 viz., the \u201crational basis\u201d test, which requires only that statutory distinctions be reasonably related to the achievement of a legitimate state objective.\nThe difference in result on the occasion of this most recent challenge to the \u201cBlue Laws\u201d may be attributed to the majority\u2019s use of a different standard of review. While it is unclear which of three separate tests discussed by the majority was actually applied in evaluating appellants\u2019 equal protection claims, it is clear the majority substituted a standard more demanding than \u201creasonable relationship to a legitimate state objective.\u201d\nFirst, it is suggested that a \u201cstrict judicial scrutiny\u201d test is the appropriate standard to apply where the state law under review impinges upon a \u201cfundamental right\u201d \u2014 that is, a right explicitly or even implicitly guaranteed by either federal or state constitution. However, the majority fails to identify which substantive \u201cfundamental right\u201d is adversely affected by the \u201cBlue Laws.\u201d Instead, it assumes that Pennsylvania\u2019s equal protection clause, Article III, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, itself amounts to a \u201cfundamental right\u201d and thus, triggers use of the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d test. It is clear, however, that an equal protection clause cannot be regarded as \u201cfundamental\u201d for purposes of an equal protection analysis since it is not the source of any substantive rights or liberties. The function of such a clause is simply to measure the validity of classifications created by state laws. See San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 59, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring). Thus, \u201cstrict judicial scrutiny\u201d of Pennsylvania\u2019s Sunday Trading Law is neither required nor appropriate in this case, since the challenged statute has not interfered with free exercise of a \u201cfundamental right.\u201d\nNext, the majority suggests a standard of review less stringent than \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d but more demanding than \u201crational basis.\u201d This intermediate test is used to examine legislative classifications not \u201cinherently suspect\u201d but nevertheless requiring greater scrutiny \u2014 for example, those based on sex, illegitimacy and age. Since no such \u201csuspect\u201d distinctions are created by the \u201cBlue Laws,\u201d this standard is of questionable relevance in the instant case.\nClearly, the proper standard of review in this case is the \u201crational basis\u201d test used by the United States Supreme Court in Two Guys and restated most recently in New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976). In Dukes, the Court rejected an equal protection attack on a city ordinance which prohibited the sale of food by pushcart vendors in the French Quarter, but exempted those vendors who had operated in that area for eight years or more. The Court refused to apply a more stringent standard in reviewing the ordinance and stated:\n\u201cUnless a classification trammels fundamental personal rights or is drawn upon inherently suspect distinctions such as race, religion, or alienage, our decisions presume the constitutionality of statutory discriminations . . . States are accorded wide latitude in the regulation of their local economies under their police powers, and rational distinctions may be made with substantially less than mathematical exactitude.\u201d 427 U.S. at 303, 96 S.Ct. at 2516.\nThis Court has adopted and consistently applied the federal \u201crational basis\u201d test in reviewing federal and state equal protection claims which do not involve \u201cfundamental interests\u201d or \u201csuspect classifications.\u201d See Tosto v. Pennsylvania Nursing Home Loan Agency, 460 Pa. 1, 331 A.2d 198 (1975); Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Labor & Industry, 461 Pa. 68, 334 A.2d 636 (1975); In Re Estate of Cavill, 459 Pa. 411, 329 A.2d 503 (1974); Stottlemyer v. Stottlemyer, 458 Pa. 503, 329 A.2d 892 (1974).\nThe majority implies that this Court in Moyer v. Phillips, 462 Pa. 395, 341 A.2d 441 (1975), approved a more demanding test \u2014 viz., that the classification must have a \u201cfair and substantial\u201d relationship to the statutory objective. Since Moyer cited both state and federal cases as authority for its standard of review, see In Re Estate of Cavill, supra; Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972); Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 92 S.Ct. 251, 30 L.Ed.2d 225 (1971); Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 40 S.Ct. 560, 64 L.Ed. 989 (1920), such an inference is unwarranted. See G. Gunther, \u201cIn Search of Evolving Doctrine on a Changing Court: A Model for a Newer Equal Protection\u201d 86 Harv.L.Rev. 1 (1972).\nCourts applying the \u201crational basis\u201d test may not sit as super legislatures which judge the wisdom of statutes or invalidate them because they might have been drafted differently. As stated by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, concurring in McGowan, 366 U.S. at 535, 81 S.Ct. at 1194:\n\u201c[Ejxcept in the case of a statute whose discriminations are so patently without reason that no conceivable situation of fact could be found to justify them, the claimant bears the burden of affirmative demonstration that in the actual state of facts which surround its operation, its classifications lack rationality.\u201d\nThe Sunday trading laws are neither arbitrary nor irrational. The Court in McGowan and Two Guys pointed out that the roots of the Pennsylvania statutes go back for centuries; the current exemptions from the ban on Sunday trading but reflect our legislature's recognition of the development of a complex, pluralistic society. As noted in McGowan, supra, relative to special Sunday legislation in general:\n\u201c[Ejxceptions, giving the laws resiliency in the course of cultural change, proliferated.\nThis Court has consistently adhered to the rule that an Act of Assembly should not be declared unconstitutional \u201cunless it clearly, palpably and plainly violates the Constitution.\u201d Singer v. Sheppard, 464 Pa. 387, 393, 346 A.2d 897, 900 (1975); Tosto v. Pa. Nursing Home Loan Agency, 460 Pa. 1, 16, 331 A.2d 198, 205 (1975); Daly v. Hemphill, 411 Pa. 263, 271, 191 A.2d 835, 840 (1963).\nIn point of fact, the statutes abrogated by the majority today are little changed from those upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 1961 and (in part) by this Court in 1962. See text of the majority opinion at 115.\nAlthough the various exemptions may be made to appear arbitrary as they have been juxtaposed out of their statutory context in the majority opinion, they are rationally related to a legislatively perceived pattern of preservation of the desired ambiance of Sundays; they are neither arbitrary nor capricious, nor do they sink to the level of invidious discrimination. Since they were passed by the General Assembly as a reasonable exercise of its powers and in good faith, the Sunday trading laws must pass constitutional muster. Bargain City U.S.A., Inc. v. Dilworth, supra.\nPOMEROY, J., joins in this opinion.\n. Pa.Const. art. Ill, \u00a7 7 is now Pa.Const. art. Ill, \u00a7 32, as amended and renumbered (1967).\n. Under a \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d standard of review a state must show a compelling interest in order to justify a statutory scheme creating distinctions. This standard is also and most often used where a state creates classifications which are \u201cinherently suspect,\u201d such as race or religion. See, e. g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967).\n. See Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762, 97 S.Ct. 1459, 52 L.Ed.2d 31 (1977) (illegitimacy); Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 92 S.Ct. 251, 30 L.Ed.2d 225 (1971) (sex). See also, G. Gunther, Individual Rights in Constitutional Law (2d Ed., 1976), 280-285.\nOne may trace in these exceptions the evolving habits of life of the people. Compare State v. Hogreiver, 152 Ind. 652, 53 N.E. 921, 45 LRA 504 (1899), sustaining a statute specifically prohibiting Sunday baseball, with Carr v. State, 175 Ind. 241, 93 N.E. 1071, 32 LRA NS 1190 (1911), sustaining a statute excepting baseball from the general Sunday prohibition.\u201d 366 U.S. at 529, 81 S.Ct. at 1191 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).",
