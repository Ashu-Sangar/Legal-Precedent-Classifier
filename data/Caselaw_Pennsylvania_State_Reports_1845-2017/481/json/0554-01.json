        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellees, the Wicks, Bauer, Sheriff, and Lello families, brought suit against several construction companies, a real estate firm and its agents, three Supervisors of Monroe Township and appellant, Monroe Township, for damages sustained when inadequate drainage systems and excessive runoff of water and mud from a hill above their properties made appellees\u2019 homes nearly uninhabitable. The runoff problems were allegedly caused in part by the construction of houses on the hillside. Appellees also allege that construction on the hillside continued even after the builders and Township Supervisors became aware of the drainage problem and that no precautions to minimize or prevent the problem were taken.\nAppellees sued Monroe Township\u2019s Supervisors on the theory that the Supervisors, once they learned of the runoff and drainage problem, should have revoked the permits which allowed the builders to continue construction on the hillside. Appellees sued Monroe Township on the theory of respondeat superior.\nThe Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County held that the Supervisors were \u201chigh public officials,\u201d absolutely immune from civil liability arising from actions taken within the course of their duties and within the scope of their authority, and that they could not be sued by appellees. It also held that Monroe Township could not be sued on a theory of respondeat superior when its servants were all immune from liability for the acts alleged.\nAppellees appealed to the Commonwealth Court from that part of the order dismissing the complaint against Monroe Township. The Commonwealth Court reversed, and reinstated the complaint against Monroe Township. We granted Monroe Township's petition for allocatur and now affirm.\nWhether a complaint states a cause of action against public officials cannot be determined \u201csolely on the basis of their status as employees of the Commonwealth.\u201d DuBree v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 481 Pa. 540, 543, 393 A.2d 293, 294 (1978). Therefore, the Commonwealth Court properly reinstated the complaint.\nOrder of the Commonwealth Court affirmed and case remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nEAGEN, C. J., and NIX, J., concur in the result.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 204, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204 (Supp.1978).\n. See also Rest. 2d Agency \u00a7 217 & comments (principal may not raise immunity of agent as defense to claim based on respondeat superior); cf. Koontz v. Messer, 320 Pa. 487, 181 A. 792 (1935) (principal may not raise agent-husband\u2019s immunity from suit as defense to wife\u2019s action based on respondeat superior); Schubert v.
