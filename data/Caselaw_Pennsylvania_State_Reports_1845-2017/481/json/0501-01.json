The possession, conspiracy, and robbery convictions were appealed to the Superior Court, which subsequently certified those appeals to this Court.\nAppellant raises the following contentions:\n(1) That certain remarks made by the prosecutor during closing argument were so inflammatory as to warrant the grant of a new trial.\n(2) That the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial following an objection to a leading question posed by the prosecutor on re-direct examination of a prosecution witness;\n(3) That appellant\u2019s belated discovery of a prior inconsistent written statement by a prosecution witness was prejudicial and resulted in an unfair trial;\n(4) That appellant's confession should have been suppressed;\n(5) That the trial court erred in allowing appellant\u2019s confession containing references to police photographs of co-defendants to be read into the record.\nWe have considered these contentions and find them to be without merit.\nJudgments of sentence affirmed.\nThis Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the murder conviction is based upon section 202(1) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970. 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp. 1978-79).",
