        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM.\nThis is an appeal from appellant\u2019s conviction, by a jury, on two counts of third degree murder. Appellant has raised the following contentions:\n(1) The trial court erred in excluding certain testimony of witnesses for appellant;\n(2) The trial court erred in limiting appellant\u2019s testimony;\n(3) The trial court erred in granting the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to strike the testimony of a pharmacologist who testified on behalf of appellant;\n(4) The element of \u201cserious provocation,\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2503(a) (1973), renders the voluntary manslaughter statute unconstitutionally vague;\n(5) The trial court erred in allowing the Commonwealth to elicit from appellant testimony concerning prior misconduct;\n(6) The trial court erred in allowing the Commonwealth on rebuttal to present other evidence of appellant\u2019s prior misconduct;\n(7) The trial court erred in refusing to give certain of appellant\u2019s requested points for charge on voluntary manslaughter;\n(8) The trial court erred in admitting into evidence two photographs of the crime scene.\nAs to the substance of appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error, although waived, Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974), we find it also to be without merit. We have also considered appellant\u2019s other arguments and conclude that they, too, are without merit.\nJudgments of sentence affirmed.\nThis Court\u2019s jurisdiction is based upon section 202(1) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970. 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp. 1978-79).",
