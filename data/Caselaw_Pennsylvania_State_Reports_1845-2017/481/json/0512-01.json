        "text": "OPINION\nEAGEN, Chief Justice.\nIn the last will and testament of Nellie M. Karahuta, deceased, she devised certain realty to a son, Russell Ronald Karahuta, but directed that unless certain conditions \u201care met by him\u201d, the property is to be inherited by Mrs. Bernadine L. Menchowsky. The conditions were that the son be a widower or \u201cdivorced from his present wife\u201d at the time of the testatrix\u2019s death.\nAt testatrix\u2019s death, the conditions were not \u201cmet\u201d; the son was not a widower nor was he divorced from his \u201cpresent wife.\u201d When the executors filed an accounting of the estate, no mention or distribution was made of the subject realty. The son, Russell Ronald Karahuta, filed exceptions to the account, and ultimately the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, entered a final decree awarding the realty to the son, and ruled that the conditions imposed on the devisee were invalid and of no effect as being contrary to public policy. The executors of decedent\u2019s estate filed this appeal in their capacity as executors.\nThe executor-appellants are not \u201cparties aggrieved\u201d by the challenged decree, and hence, have no standing to appeal.\n\u201cUnless an executor has been surcharged or has been ordered to distribute more than the admitted balance in the estate, the executor is not a \u2018party aggrieved\u2019 by the final order or decree of the orphans\u2019 court. The executor is merely a holder of the estate\u2019s assets for the purposes of administration and distribution and is not adversely affected by a decision of the orphans\u2019 court directing the distribution of those assets. Musser\u2019s Estate, 341 Pa. 1, 17 A.2d 411 (1941); Kennedy\u2019s Estate, 328 Pa. 193, 194 A. 901 (1937); Reese's Estate, 317 Pa. 473, 177 A. 792 (1935); Hand\u2019s Estate, 288 Pa. 569, 136 A. 864 (1927).\u201d\nIn Re Estate of Hain, 464 Pa. 349, 353, 346 A.2d 774, 776 (1975). See Girt\u2019s Estate, 452 Pa. 156, 164 n. 7, 305 A.2d 372, n. 7 (1973).\nAppeal quashed. Costs on the estate.\nROBERTS and MANDERINO, JJ., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. The right to appeal a decree of the orphans\u2019 court is conferred by the Decedents, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 792 (1975), which provides in pertinent part:\n\u201cAny party in interest who is aggrieved by a final order or decree of the orphans\u2019 court division, or a fiduciary whose estate or trust is so aggrieved, may appeal therefrom to the proper appellate court.\u201d\nWhile the executors were also children of the testatrix and among those entitled to share in the residue of the estate under the terms of the will, neither of these children was adversely affected by the trial court\u2019s decree. The only individual adversely affected was \u201cMrs. Bernadine L. Menchowsky,\u201d and she has not appealed.",
