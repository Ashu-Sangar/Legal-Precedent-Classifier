A hearing was scheduled for October 29, 1974. Since appellant had refused to accept a letter sent to him by certified mail notifying him of the hearing, the court directed that appellant be personally served with notice of the hearing by the sheriff of Franklin County. Appellant was served the following day. Further, since appellant was a juvenile at the time the court ordered that his mother be appointed guardian ad litem.</p>

Appellant testified that he did not wish to voluntarily relinquish his parental rights. The hearing was then continued to allow the Agency to file a petition for the involuntary termination of appellant’s parental rights. The petition was filed and a hearing was held on December 16,1974. Because of the death of one of the court reporters, the record of the proceedings was not transcribed until early 1976. A final hearing on the matter was held on April 15, 1976.</p>
