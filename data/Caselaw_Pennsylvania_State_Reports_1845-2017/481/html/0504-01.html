On appeal, we ruled that in view of an agreement entered into by the plaintiffs and Authority, and relevant provisions of the Eminent Domain Code, the Act of June 22, 1964, Special Session, P.L. 84, Art. VI, §§ 1-101 <em>et seq., </em>26 P.S. §§ 1-101, <em>et seq., </em>then extant, the plaintiffs’ recovery may not exceed $25,000.00.

Even though the judgment did not so conform, it may not be attacked collaterally because: 1) the basis for challenge did not involve subject matter jurisdiction, nor did it assert the judgment was otherwise void (for example, lack of notice); 2) the judgment was in conformity with the court's decree of February 21, 1975; and, 3) the decree of February 21, 1975, was not challenged through exceptions to the decree or through a direct appeal.

It argues the final decree of February 21, 1975, was entered through the “inadvertence, mistake or accident” of the Court of Common Pleas because it directed entry of a judgment in an amount which did not conform with the prior directive of this Court and exceeded the statutorily allowed amount the plaintiffs could recover. We fail to see how the entry of a final decree directing judgment in a certain amount, even though the amount did not conform with this Court’s directive and the statutorily allowed amount, constitutes a “breakdown in the judicial machin<a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>ery.” To the contrary, such an action would merely constitute an error of law in interpreting our prior opinion and the applicable statutory provision which could have been corrected by the filing of exceptions or an appeal from the decree. Had the judgment not conformed with the decree, the situation would be altogether different, but such is not the case. Finally, assuming Authority did not receive notice of the decree of February 21, 1975,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> we still conclude the motion to strike was improperly granted.
