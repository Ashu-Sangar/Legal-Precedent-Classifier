The primary purpose of civil service, of course, was to ensure that selection and retention of employees was based on merit, and to protect both prospective and present employees from the ravages of the spoils system. See, e. g., <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>
      <em>Geis’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/341/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="341 Pa. 413" data-case-ids="1204495" data-case-paths="/pa/341/0413-01">341 Pa. 413</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20A.2d%20368" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="19 A.2d 368">19 A.2d 368</a> (1941). Thus the Civil Service Act contains elaborate provisions to guard against abuse in the hiring and firing of classified employees subject to the Act. Section 20 of the Act, 53 P.S. § 23453 provides that no employee subject to the Act “shall be removed, discharged or reduced in pay or position except for just cause . . . .” It is further provided that no civil service employee shall be discharged until he has been furnished a written statement of the reasons for such action and given the opportunity to make a written answer and furnish it to the removing officer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a>

Given the language of Section 703, which anticipates that a provision may find its way into a collective bargaining agreement, the implementation of which might violate or be in conflict or inconsistent with a statute other than PERA, it is difficult to see how the City can be held culpable for allowing such a provision in the agreement. At all events, the City cannot be said to have waived its right to argue in this Court that the dismissal in question was not subject to arbitration. It expressly reserved, in the management rights clause of the agreement (Section 3), the right to discipline and discharge employees. It stipulated, however, that any such action would be only “for just cause, as defined in the Civil Service Law” (Record at 9a). Without deciding whether this provision is dispositive of the merits of the arbitrability dispute, it at least does not preclude the City’s right so to argue.</p>
