Appellant was identified as being a member of this group. The activities of the group included beer drinking, throwing beer cans, blocking traffic on the street bordering the park, yelling obscenities<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and urinating in the alleys and streets surrounding the park. Between the start of the above gathering and 10:45 p. m. the police received numerous complaints from residents living near the park. The police warned the group on several occasions, but the above behavior continued. At approximately 10:45 p. m., the police arrested Kenneth Kramer for urinating on the street, and George Howard for attempting to interfere with Kramer’s arrest. After transporting Kramer and Howard to the police station, the police returned to the park. The group continued the above-described conduct. The police ordered <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>the crowd to disperse. Upon failure to comply with the order, Joseph Frank and John Howard were arrested. While the above arrests were being completed, appellant approached the police car in which Joseph Frank and John Howard were seated. Police Officer Joseph Lapinski told appellant to leave, but appellant informed the officer that he wanted to speak to one of the occupants of the car. Lapinski replied that all talking must take place at the police station. The police then took Joseph Frank and John Howard to the police station at approximately 11:00 p. m.</p>

The testimony reveals that in addition to obscenities, appellant called the police officers “pigs.” The police exited the station and arrested Leonard. The officers ordered appellant and the members of the accompanying group to disperse. The group, save appellant, dispersed, removing themselves to either the street or the park. Appellant, however, continued his verbal abuse of the police officers as he slowly backed away. The police officers continued to admonish appellant to cease the verbal harangues and also continued to order him to disperse. After a few warnings and dispersal orders, appellant was arrested and charged with violating § 5502 of the Crimes Code. Officer Lapinski testified that during the above confrontation, the six arrested individuals continued to be disorderly in the police station itself.</p>

    <p id="b644-5" data-blocks='[["BL_644.5",644,[224,331,1148,945]]]'>The testimony reveals that all of the above recited events took place within a forty to forty-five minute period. The factfinder may have chosen to consider all of the events leading up to appellant’s arrest from 10:45 until 11:30 as evidence sufficient to satisfy the three or more person requirement of § 5502. This evidence is in the record and it is not the function of an appellate court to retry or substitute its judgment for that of a petit jury. The record also reveals that while appellant was yelling obscenities and Leonard was banging on the door of the police station, the six previously arrested individuals continued a course of conduct described as disorderly. Again, the record reveals sufficient evidence, if believed by the jury, for a finding that three or more persons were engaging in a course of disorderly conduct at the time of the dispersal order. We believe the evidence, when reviewed under the <em>Rose </em>standard, is sufficient to meet the requirement of three or more persons under § 5502 of the Crimes Code.</p>

    <p id="b644-7" data-blocks='[["BL_644.7",644,[223,1520,1149,730]]]'>Appellant’s argument borders on the frivolous. Appellant bases his argument on the fact that because the six or seven individuals who accompanied him and Leonard to the police station dispersed upon the police’s initial order, that he being the only person to defy such order, subsequently could not be ordered to disperse. We do not agree. If the initial dispersal order was valid, see discussion, <em>supra, </em>appellant’s noncompliance cannot be justified or excused by his companions’ compliance. The police were initially warranted in ordering the crowd’s dispersal. Appellant did not disperse, but his supporting group did leave the area. The police continued to order appellant to leave the area, and he continued to refuse. His refusal was violative of § 5502 and the record is sufficient to sustain his conviction.</p>

But the plain import of our cases is, at the very least, that facial overbreadth adjudication is an exception to our traditional rules of practice and that its function, a limited one at the outset, attenuates as the otherwise unprotected behavior that it forbids the State to sanction moves from ‘pure speech’ toward conduct and that conduct — even if expressive — falls within the scope of otherwise valid criminal laws that reflect legitimate state interests in maintaining comprehensive controls over harmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct. Although such laws, if too broadly worded, may deter protected speech to some unknown extent, there comes a point where that effect — at best a prediction — cannot, with confidence, justify invalidating a statute on its face and so prohibiting a State from enforcing the statute against conduct that is admittedly within its power to proscribe.

The majority interprets section 5502 more broadly than its terms permit, relies on facts not of record and erroneously upholds an unconstitutionally vague statute.

Certain members of this group were observed in the early evening drinking beer, throwing beer cans, blocking traffic, shouting “obscenities” and urinating in public. Appellant’s exact language is not quoted in the record. Further, there is no evidence that appellant himself engaged in any of these activities. In response to complaints from nearby residents, police ordered the group to disperse several times, but to no avail. At 10:45 p. m. one member of the group was arrested for allegedly urinating in the street and another for allegedly attempting to interfere with his arrest.</p>

When Frank and Howard were in the police car, ready to be taken away, appellant approached the car stating that he wanted to speak to them. It is undisputed that police told appellant he would have to see Frank and Howard at the police station.</p>

Although the onlookers dispersed and the appellant remained alone, he was again ordered to disperse. The appellant backed slowly away and was arrested about 110 feet from the station.</p>

If there is no gathering of three or more, the danger to which the statute is addressed simply is not present. Under the statute, police authority to disperse groups is contingent upon disorderly conduct in the same area of three or more individuals. It is clear that where less than three individuals are disorderly, the Legislature considered any apparent danger insufficient to justify a grant of police authority to issue a dispersal order.</p>
    <p id="b657-7" data-blocks='[["BL_657.7",657,[252,1307,1149,689]]]'>The majority concludes that the “three or more persons” requirement of section 5502 could be fulfilled by appellant’s presence among the group congregated at the park after 10:45 p. m. (There is no evidence that appellant refused an order to disperse while at the park.) But section 5502 simply does not make one’s earlier presence in a group in which three or more persons may have been disorderly a justification for arrest at a later time at a different place and when less than three persons are disorderly. The statute applies only to groups which pose an existing threat. By permitting consideration of the circumstances at the park to support appellant’s conviction for refusing to disperse later and elsewhere, the majority transcends the statute.</p>

In reaching this conclusion, it disregards the standards established by the Legislature and, in effect, permits a general order to disperse whenever there is one <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>disorderly person in the vicinity of a group not claimed to be disorderly.</p>

Neither the Commonwealth in its brief nor the trial court in its opinion makes any mention of these circumstances. Moreover, it is unreasonable to assume that those who are in a police station in police custody can be included for purposes of the dispersal statute here at issue.</p>
    <p id="b658-6" data-blocks='[["BL_658.6",658,[249,892,1147,312]]]'>Finally, the statute plainly does not authorize an arrest for disobeying an order to disperse when, at the time of the arrest, there is no group of people in the vicinity.

Construed in this fashion, the subsection is not vague. But the majority, here, has not adopted the <em>Cohen </em>construction. Therefore, the public can only guess what the term “obscene” includes. In the present case the trial judge, in his charge (quoted in the majority opinion), permitted the jury to base its finding of disorderly conduct on the use of “bad language.” Appellant, then, was accused and convicted of nothing more than “bad language” and refusing to disperse. The majority’s approval of this “bad language” charge is wholly unwarranted, particularly where the record does not reveal what language is claimed to be obscene.</p>

      <blockquote id="ALB" data-blocks='[["BL_660.3",660,[302,1667,1081,625]]]'>“[T]he vice of the ordinance lies not alone in its violation of the due process standard of vagueness. The ordinance also violates the constitutional right of free assembly and association. Our decisions establish that mere public intolerance or animosity cannot be the basis for abridgment of these constitutional freedoms. . The First and Fourteenth Amendments do not permit a State to make criminal the exercise of the right of assembly simply because its exercise may be ‘annoying’ to some people. If this were not the rule, the right of the people to gather in public places for social or political purposes would be continually subject to summary suspension through the good-faith enforcement of a prohibition against annoying conduct. And such a prohibition, in addition, contains an obvious invitation to discriminatory enforcement against those whose association together is ‘annoying’ because their ideas, their lifestyle, or their physical appearance is resented by the majority of their fellow citizens.”</blockquote>
