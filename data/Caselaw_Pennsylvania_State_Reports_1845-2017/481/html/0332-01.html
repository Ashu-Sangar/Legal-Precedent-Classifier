The relevant factual background, in no way disputed, is as follows.</p>
    <p id="b374-10" data-blocks='[["BL_374.11",374,[228,1410,1149,795]]]'>Some time before December 27, 1976, the Secretary of Banking sought the legal opinion of the Attorney General of Pennsylvania as to whether savings banks operating under the Banking Code of 1965, <em>as amended, </em>7 P.S. §§ 101-2202 (1967 &amp; Supp.1978-79), could offer these notice of withdrawal (NOW) accounts to their depositors. Under the terms of a typical NOW account, money may be withdrawn by means of a negotiable order of withdrawal which requires the bank to pay the specified sum to a named third party. These sight drafts are “payable through” drafts, naming a commercial bank at which the draft can be presented for payment. The drafts then clear through the banking system much the same as other drafts. The similarity of a NOW draft to the traditional check, at least from a functional viewpoint, is self-apparent.</p>

The Attorney General did add the caveat that because of § 503(a) of the Code, any such regulation must require each NOW account draft to contain language which indicates that the bank may require 14 days notice before making payment.</p>

The Department invited interested parties to submit comments, in response to which comments were received both in favor of, and in opposition to, a regulation permitting savings banks to offer NOW accounts. The Pennsylvania Bankers Association, one of the appellants in this case, submitted comments in opposition to such a regulation. On March 12, the Department of Banking adopted regulations allowing savings Banks to offer NOW accounts, provided each draft bore the legend reserving to the bank the right to require 14 days notice before paying NOW drafts. <em>See </em>7 Pa.Bulletin 699 (March 12, 1977).</p>

Neither do the parties dispute that NOW accounts are but one method of withdrawing deposits from a savings account. And all agree that the Banking Code places few restrictions on savings banks insofar as the withdrawal of deposits is concerned, leaving it to the individual savings banks to provide for the terms of withdrawal in their articles or by-laws “except that deposits may not be accepted which are legally subject to withdrawal within a period of less than fourteen days.” 7 P.S. § 503(a). (Section 503(b) provides that absent such an article or by-law, savings banks can require 60 days notice before permitting withdrawals). Finally, there is no dispute, as indeed there could not be, that the area of savings bank withdrawals is one presumptively within the ambit of the Department’s “rule-making power and administrative discretion” expressly delegated it by the Banking Code. 7 P.S. § 103(a)(viii).</p>

Appellants argue that savings banks have a defined role under the Banking Code, namely to hold savings deposits; that the authority to hold savings deposits does not include the authority to offer NOW accounts which, according to appellants, “are checking accounts or the equivalent of checking accounts;” and that to permit savings banks to offer this service would distort the Banking Code’s purpose of creating savings banks to function solely as savings institutions. Appellants thus glean from the Banking Code a legislative intent to deny savings banks the power to offer NOW accounts, and from that conclusion <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>argue that there is no basis for the exercise of administrative rule-making on the subject.</p>

    <p id="b377-8" data-blocks='[["BL_377.9",377,[222,1622,1148,684]],["BL_378.1",378,[238,256,1147,562]]]'>First, we are satisfied that NOW accounts contravene no section of the Banking Code. As previously noted, only § 503 of the Code speaks to withdrawals of funds from savings banks, and nothing in that section prohibits withdrawals by means of a negotiable sight draft presented by a third party, provided that payment cannot be demanded on less than 14 days notice. Appellants argue, however, that NOW drafts are checks, both functionally and legally, and that savings banks cannot offer checking services under the Code’s provision. We agree with the Commonwealth Court that the legend on NOW drafts giving savings banks the option to require 14 days notice before making payment significantly and sufficiently distinguishes NOW drafts from <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>the traditional check. There is no requirement that savings banks actually exercise this right to take 14 days to pay a draft, and whether or not they ordinarily do so, such an instrument is obviously not “payable on demand” and hence not a check within the Uniform Commercial Code definition. <em>See </em>12A P.S. § 3-104(2)(b) (1970). Appellants claim, however, that savings banks such as appellee PSFS have advertised that NOW drafts “work just like checks.” Legally these instruments are not checks, and savings banks’ advertising campaigns are not relevant to appellant’s challenge under the Banking and Uniform Commercial Codes.</p>

It is an effort to provide customers with a convenient, efficient means of satisfying financial obligations by means of a savings account, while foregoing the need to personally go to the bank and present a passbook in order to withdraw funds. Appellants have never claimed that NOW accounts will not constitute a true convenience to savings bank customers. The Department’s express mandate under the Code is to promulgate rules with an eye to providing “[t]he opportunity for institutions subject to [the Banking Code] to serve effectively the convenience and needs of their depositors;” to give a savings bank “the leeway to adapt itself to changing and expanding requirements of the community;” and, to leave room “for the management of institutions to exercise their business judgment ... in conducting the affairs of their institutions.”</p>

This service is but one of many which both commercial and savings banks have instituted in recent years in an effort to better serve their customers. Such innovations as telephone banking, withdrawal by mail, and computerized, 24-hour banking are just a few. Like NOW accounts, these services are a departure from traditional banking practices in Pennsylvania. Indeed, it is manifest from § 103 that such departures were not only foreseen but encouraged by the Banking Code and by the legislator’s desire to create a “progressive rather than restrictive atmosphere” in the banking industry. Permitting NOW accounts can only further that statutory goal.</p>

The arguments now made before this Court were raised before the Department when it invited comments on the proposed regulations to allow NOW accounts. An appellate court should defer to the administrative agency to determine such things as the effect differing banking practices will have on competition between commercial and savings banks; whether a particular service would constitute a competitive advantage and, if so, whether such an advantage is warranted or desirable; whether a shift in deposits would indeed occur and, if so, whether such a shift would have deleterious effects on banking in general; the impact of NOW accounts in light of other banking regulations which give some banks advantages over others; and similar complex questions regarding the banking industry.
