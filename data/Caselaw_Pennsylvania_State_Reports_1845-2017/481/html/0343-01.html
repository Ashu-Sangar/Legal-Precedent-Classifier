This appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> It requires us to consider whether a court en banc, in passing upon post-verdict motions challenging the admissibility of certain evidence following a retrial of a criminal defendant, is bound by the post-trial ruling of a previous court en banc sitting after the first trial to the effect that the evidence in question was admissible.

Based on information obtained at the scene of the crime, Charles Oakes was arrested at 10:45 A.M. the same morning. He remained in police custody until the time of his arraignment on murder charges some thirty-six hours later. During this period Oakes made three incriminating statements which, prior to his first trial in April of 1973, he moved to suppress on the ground that they were illegally obtained. The motion was denied and all three statements were introduced into evidence during the course of that trial, which resulted in a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree. Oakes then filed post-trial motions alleging that the suppression court had erred in refusing to suppress the three statements. The court en <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>banc agreed with respect to the third statement and awarded a new trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Because the order of the first court en banc granted a new trial, its determination that the first two inculpatory statements given by Oakes were admissible was interlocutory in nature and not then appealable by the defendant. <em>Commonwealth v. Cole, </em><a href="/pa/437/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="437 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="1927833" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0288-01">437 Pa. 288</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20339" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="263 A.2d 339">263 A.2d 339</a> (1970); <em>Commonwealth v. Haushalter, </em><a href="/pa/423/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="423 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1903196" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0351-01">423 Pa. 351</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=223%20A.2d%20726" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="223 A.2d 726">223 A.2d 726</a> (1966); <em>Commonwealth v. Pollick, </em><a href="/pa/420/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="420 Pa. 61" data-case-ids="1898585" data-case-paths="/pa/420/0061-01">420 Pa. 61</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=215%20A.2d%20904" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="215 A.2d 904">215 A.2d 904</a> (1966). But cf. Pa.R.A.P. 311(b). Moreover, the basis of the decision of the first court en banc may well not be of record (as it was not here) since Pa.R.A.P. 1925 requires that an opinion or a memorandum in support of a decision be filed only in cases in which an appeal is actually lodged. Because the second court en banc refused to consider the admissibility of the two challenged statements, the appellate court is left with no insight whatever as to the reasoning of the trial court in the matter.</p>
