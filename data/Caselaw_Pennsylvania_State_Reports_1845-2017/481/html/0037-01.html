A house search led to the seizure of seven measuring spoons and two brown boxes with a large amount of glassine bags. They were indicted for possession of and dealing in heroin and cocaine.</p>

While this conclusion is etymologically correct, it misses the thrust of the legal questions raised in this appeal. As pointed out by Judge Hoffman in his dissent, the penalty section does not use the term “trafficking in.” 35 P.S. § 780-20 (1964). Section 20(a) is an all inclusive provision which classifies the conduct prohibited in the act as a misdemeanor unless expressly provided otherwise under section (c) or (d) of the section.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

To state the question is to answer it. The rules of statutory construction force us to conclude that conduct which might fall within the perimeters of “trafficking in” but not constituting selling, dispensing or giving away was not intended to be included within the provisions of section 20(d).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Since the legislature obviously recognized the distinction between the terms (see section 4(q)) it must be assumed that they would have used “trafficking” in section 20(d) if it was their intention to embrace the broader scope of activities under that subsection. We therefore conclude that conduct which might be embraced within the term “trafficking” but not constituting <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>selling, dispensing or giving away is not punishable under section 20(d) and is therefore included within section 20(a). Accordingly, we hold that the evidence was insufficient to establish a violation under section 20(d)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> and therefore direct that the verdict of guilt under that count of the indictment be set aside.</p>
    <p id="b83-5" data-blocks='[["BL_83.5",83,[223,617,1147,717]]]'>We are also of the view that justice requires a remand for resentencing. The indictment in the instant case contained two counts; one was laid under section 20(d) and the other under section 20(c). The trial judge imposed the sentence of one to five years imprisonment without reference to the counts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Since the maximum did not exceed five (5) years, the present sentence can be supported under the count charging a violation of section 20(c), which has not been disturbed in this appeal. However, since the trial judge imposed the sentence under the erroneous belief that the Commonwealth had proved the more serious violation of section 20(d) as well as a violation of section 20(c), the appellants are entitled to be resentenced.</p>
