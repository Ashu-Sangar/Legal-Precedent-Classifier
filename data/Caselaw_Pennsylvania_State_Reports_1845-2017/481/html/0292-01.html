The caller described the person as a Negro male, named “Perry” about 5'10" with a large “bush” hair style and wearing a dark coat. As a result of receiving the above information, two police officers went to the Capri Bar, entering by the rear door. Upon entrance they observed the appellant, Gregory Anderson and decided that he fitted the above description.</p>

The object was retrieved from the pocket of appellant and found to be a loaded and operable .22 calibre revolver.

This person advised the officer that an individual was seated in a nearby car carrying narcotics and that the person had a gun concealed at his waist. The officer approached the vehicle to investigate the report. The officer tapped at the car window and asked the occupant, Robert Williams, to open the door. Williams rolled down the window instead and the officer reached into the car and removed a fully loaded revolver from Williams’ waistband. The gun was not visible to the officer from the outside of the car, but was in precisely the place indicated by the informant. The United States Supreme Court found that the officer had sufficient information to justify his approaching Williams and in view of the late hour and the information he possessed, the court determined that the officer had reason to fear for his safety and that the limited intrusion caused by the removal of the weapon from the person of Williams was reasonable.</p>
