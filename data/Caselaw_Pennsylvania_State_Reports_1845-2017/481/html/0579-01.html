Strickler, however, invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to testify.

The judge observed that no such petition was then pending before the court. The district attorney then asserted that <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>“the Commonwealth grants the witness immunity from prosecution with regards to any other matter, transaction arising out of facts involved in the case for which he was previously sentenced.” The judge again advised Strickler that he could not be subjected to further prosecution based upon the facts about which he was to testify and that he therefore had no basis to assert his privilege against self-incrimination with regard to this testimony; he ordered Strickler to testify and warned him that if he persisted in his refusal to do so he could be found in contempt of court. When Strickler still refused to testify, the judge summarily found him in direct criminal contempt and sentenced him to imprisonment for six months “to begin and date from the time [he] is released from his present confinement.” The judge nevertheless offered him an opportunity to purge his contempt by testifying, but he again refused to do so. As a result of this refusal, the Commonwealth moved that a nolle prosequi be entered in the case against Shirk; the judge granted the motion, and Shirk was discharged. Strickler appealed his criminal contempt conviction to the Superior Court, but on October 20, 1976, the appeal was properly transferred to this Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Section 110(l)(iii)(A) makes another exception where “the offense of <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>which the defendant was formerly convicted or acquitted and the offense for which he is subsequently prosecuted each requires proof of a fact not required by the other <em>and </em>the law defining each of such offenses is intended to present a <em>substantially </em>different harm or evil” (emphasis added). Strickler argues that as a result of his testimony he might have been charged as a principal in the armed robbery, with receiving stolen goods, or with aggravated assault and battery, but he does not argue, and we are not otherwise persuaded, that the offense for which he was previously convicted, hindering apprehension or prosecution with respect to an armed robbery,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> was a substantially different crime or evil so as to subject him to additional prosecution on these charges.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> We thus conclude that the trial judge did not err in overruling Strickler’s claim of privilege on this ground.</p>

Clearly, if a guilty plea may subsequently be found invalid, it cannot in itself inevitably be said to constitute a valid waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination; nor can it be inevitably concluded as a matter of law that one who has pleaded guilty to a charge can thereafter have no reasonable basis to fear self-incrimination on that charge.</p>
