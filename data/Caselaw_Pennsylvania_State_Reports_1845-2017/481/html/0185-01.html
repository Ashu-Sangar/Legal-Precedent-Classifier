Since January 17, 1975, appellant has been in the custody of Pennsylvania authorities on charges of burglary and four counts of robbery, aggravated assault and false imprisonment, all of which occurred in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. On March 6, 1975, appellant was adjudicated a delinquent by the Dauphin County Juvenile Court and was committed to the Youth Development Center.</p>

The statute, above quoted, is explicit in providing that a juvenile “ . . . shall be returned . . . ” Appellant must be returned to New Jersey — the only question is when. In the ordinary case, the answer is immediately. However, where the requested juvenile has violated a criminal law in Pennsylvania, then Pennsylvania might have an interest which must be served before the return of the juvenile to the requesting state. That interest would include the prosecution, sentence, and treatment of the juvenile. Routine probation, etc. would indicate the Pennsylvania’s interest in the juvenile had ceased. A juvenile court would also compare the seriousness of the crimes committed in Pennsylvania and the requesting state and if the Pennsylvania crime is rather minor compared to the other crime, the court could fairly conclude that Pennsylvania had at that time no present interest in the juvenile so as to postpone the immediate return of the juvenile to the requesting state.</p>

Kallinger is sought on charges of delinquency for his alleged participation in a murder and two armed robberies occurring in New Jersey more than <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>three years ago. At present Kallinger is in the custody of the Commonwealth at the Youth Development Center at Warrendale, Pennsylvania, following an adjudication of his delinquency arising from his commission of criminal acts in Pennsylvania. Both the Director of the Youth Center and the Pennsylvania Deputy Administrator of the Interstate Compact on Juveniles oppose extradition on the ground that it conflicts with Kallinger’s best rehabilitative interests. New Jersey has offered no assurance that the extradition is in any way consistent with Kallinger’s best interests, but rather has chosen to rely on what it asserts to be the unconditionally mandatory language of Article XVII of the Interstate Compact on Juveniles.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> 62 P.S. § 731, as amended (Supp. 1978-79).</p>
    <p id="b229-5" data-blocks='[["BL_229.5",229,[209,1025,1147,569]]]'>The issue before this Court is whether section 731 requires extradition of a juvenile under supervision as a delinquent in Pennsylvania upon the request of another compact state seeking to adjudicate the juvenile’s delinquency, for criminal acts in that state in the absence of Pennsylvania’s consent and without consideration of the prospects for the juvenile’s rehabilitation. Because it is my view that Article XVII requires consent of the Commonwealth in these circumstances as a prerequisite to rendition and because no such consent appears, I would reverse the order of the Superior Court and the Juvenile Court.</p>

Accordingly, under Article XVII Pennsylvania must first consent to extradition so long as the requisitioned juvenile is institutionalized in or under the supervision of this state as a delinquent. It also follows that the consent <em>vel non </em>must be guided by the reformative considerations expressed in Article I.

See <em>State v. </em>Ford, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20Tenn.%20582" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="218 Tenn. 582">218 Tenn. 582</a>, 588, <a href="/tenn/213/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="376 S.W.2d 486" data-case-ids="8528977" data-case-paths="/tenn/213/0582-01">376 S.W.2d 486</a>, 489 (1964) (dictum). In the present case the Deputy Administrator of the Compact and the Director of the Youth Development Center oppose rendition as being against the juvenile’s interests. The Juvenile Court below was of the opinion that it was not even permitted to consider the juvenile’s best interests. Indeed, it is only the Dauphin County District Attorney who, on behalf of the State of New Jersey, presses for extradition. This is plainly insufficient under the Compact. Although the Compact does not specifically set forth the manner in which a state consents, logically it appears that the authority falls to the Governor who is responsible under 62 P.S. § 732<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> for the appointment of an Administrator of the Compact and who holds ultimate executive authority over the Department of Public Welfare, the agency having direct administrative responsibility for the welfare of the juvenile. This is closely analogous to the power of the <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>Governor under section 191.19<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, 19 P.S. § 191.1 et seq., to refuse in his discretion the release of an adult prisoner in Pennsylvania for prosecution in a demanding state until such time as the prisoner has been discharged by this state. If the Governor consents to the rendition of a delinquent juvenile under Commonwealth supervision, a Juvenile Court should still have the power to consider, in determining under Article V the propriety of a requisition, whether the consent disregarded the juvenile’s welfare in violation of the principles of Article I. In the circumstances of this case where no consent was given, rendition should have been denied.</p>

Although both cases involved juveniles who had escaped from custody in the asylum state, neither involved a juvenile institutionalized for delinquency in the asylum state and neither involved the requirement that the asylum state consent. Nevertheless, in different ways, both cases establish the need for some consideration of the juvenile’s welfare in applying the Compact. It must also be pointed out, although this factor is not necessary to my conclusion, that the New Jersey court’s requisition does not reveal any determination of the juvenile’s interests and I reiterate that appellees on behalf of the State of New Jersey refuse to assert that Kallinger’s interests in rehabilitation would be served by rendition.</p>
