Police investigation determined that there had been no forced entry. This led them to suspect that someone who was known to the victim was the killer, and also to suspect that it might have been someone residing in the apartment <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>house. The police, therefore, questioned the residents of the building. On March 16, 1975, appellant, a 15 year-old boy who lived in the building, was questioned by Detectives Freeman and Gorny when he arrived home after having spent several days at The Meadows, a harness racing track in Washington County. Appellant’s mother and brother were present during this questioning. Appellant made no incriminating statements, but acknowledged that he knew the victim and that he had run errands for her in the past. The detectives observed at this time that appellant had scratches on his nose, bruises on his arm and an injury to his thumb.</p>
    <p id="b287-5" data-blocks='[["BL_287.5",287,[230,920,1147,1279]]]'>Shortly thereafter, it was learned that appellant had been seen speaking to Miss Bellman on the night prior to her body being found and it was also learned that appellant had not attended school on the day of the killing. As a result of this information Detective Freeman and another detective returned to the Lowenberg apartment. Appellant was there alone and upon entry into the apartment the officers explained to him that he was suspected of killing Nevada Bellman. He was then advised of his Constitutional Rights, informed that he could have any adult present that he wished while he was being questioned, and then asked if he understood the nature of the offense which was the subject of the investigation. Appellant replied in the affirmative and said he would rather talk to them alone. He then related that he and the deceased had a dispute about an $82.00 check and she called him a thief and threatened to call his mother and the police. When she went to the telephone he struck her with his fist, and she fell to the floor groaning. Appellant then stated that he dragged her into the bathroom, placed her in the tub and struck her about twenty times with a pipe. He said that the pipe was laying in the bathroom and he picked it up. After making this statement, appellant was taken to the Public Safety Building and turned over to Detectives McKay and Stotlemeyer.</p>

At that time, appellant began talking about what had occurred on the day of the murder and related essentially the same version he had given to Detective Freeman earlier.

Both of these arguments must fail for the same reason. These principles were designed to protect the rights of an accused during police interrogation. In this case, the trial court found, and the record adequately supports the conclusion, that the March 24th statement was not the product of interrogation, but was, instead, a volunteered remark. <em>Miranda v.

The evidence supports a finding that the police were engaged in social conversation when appellant raised the topic of the crime with which he was charged. When he broached that subject he was immediately reminded that his attorney had advised him not to discuss the matter. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v.

In both <em>Cunningham </em>and <em>Cockfield </em>statements were taken from the defendants as a result of interrogation, but in the presence of counsel, and we held that the presence of counsel dissipated any taint of the unlawful conduct. In the present case, the statement was not made in the presence of counsel, but it was made six days after the arrest and initial interrogation, and was not the result of interrogation. There had been an arraignment and a coroner’s inquest. In addition, appellant had met with his mother and with counsel. Counsel had explained his rights to him and had advised him not to speak with the police about the crime. When appellant began to discuss the subject he was cautioned to remember the advice his counsel had given him. In this circumstance it seems clear that any taint of the original illegality was dissipated and that appellant’s conduct was not the product of unlawful police conduct, but was, instead, the product of appellant’s free will and desire to talk about a crime which he had committed.</p>
