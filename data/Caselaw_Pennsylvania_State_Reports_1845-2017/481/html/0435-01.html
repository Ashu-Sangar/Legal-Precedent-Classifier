The pedigree exception, one of the oldest and most widely accepted of the hearsay exceptions, developed because a “[s]pecial need for this type of evidence is found in the general difficulty of obtaining other evidence of family matters.” McCormick on Evidence, § 322 (West 1972); Wig-more on Evidence (Chadbourne Revision 1974). This special need has contributed to a lenient attitude by the court in allowing hearsay to prove pedigree, resulting in a trend toward liberal application of the exception. <em>See </em>McCormick, <em>supra </em>at §§ 322, 326.</p>
    <p id="b480-5" data-blocks='[["BL_480.5",480,[256,1235,1147,676]]]'>However, the necessity of the exception does not obviate the desire to ensure that the testimony be reasonably trustworthy; hence the reason for the third requirement of the pedigree exception. By demanding a demonstration that the declarant is related to the family or person whose pedigree is in issue, the trustworthiness of the declaration is enhanced. This is for the simple reason that (a) one is more likely to know the history of and relations in his own family than some other family’s pedigree, and (b) one is less likely to perpetrate untruths (either intentionally or unintentionally) regarding one’s own family than some other’s family. This reasoning has been effectively expressed by Wigmore as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b480-6" data-blocks='[["BL_480.6",480,[298,1933,1105,150]],["BL_481.1",481,[262,275,1105,205]]]'>“[t]he circumstantial indication of trust worthiness . has been found in the probability that the ‘natural effusions’ (to use Lord Eldon’s often-quoted phrase<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>) of those <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>who talk over family affairs when no special reason for bias or passion exists are fairly trustworthy, and should be given weight by judges and juries, as they are in the ordinary affairs of life.” Wigmore, <em>supra </em>at § 1482.</blockquote>
    <p id="b481-5" data-blocks='[["BL_481.6",481,[219,507,1147,1286]]]'>It should be obvious, given the purpose of the third condition of the exception, that when the declarant <em>is </em>the person whose pedigree is being litigated, there is no necessity to apply the condition. In issues involving a person’s pedigree, that person and his family relationships are at the core of the controversy. Where the declarant is the decedent whose pedigree is at issue, we <em>know </em>that the declarant is necessarily within that core; it is only when the declarant is not the person whose lineage is in question i. e., brother, nephew, etc., that the need arises for independent evidence to establish that the declarant is within the core. The declarant is certainly a member of his own family — what need then to require independent evidence of that fact when it is the declarant’s pedigree which is to be determined? Should we require independent evidence to prove that a decedent is related to himself? Such a requirement would clearly be absurd and we decline to impose it in this situation. Therefore, we hold that, when the out-of-court declarant is the very person whose pedigree is in issue, the declarations are admissible under the pedigree exception to hearsay upon a showing that (1) the declarant is dead, and (2) the declarations were made before the controversy arose. Accordingly, the trial court should have permitted Mrs. Lewis to testify to the family relationship of decedent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

First, the exception removed the incompetency of witnesses in issues <em>devisavit vel non </em>and only in such issues as affect <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>the beneficiary under an alleged will.

Again, however, it should be noted that this exception does not apply where one of the adverse parties claims by descent while there are other named claimants who take under a Will. In order for the exceptions to apply, the Courts of Pennsylvania have said that the claims must be of the same class. In <em>Munson v.

Indeed, the exception seems merely to recognize that, in cases where parties claim decedent’s property by reason of his death, the interests of the parties, while certainly adverse to each other, are not really adverse to the interests of decedent’s estate.

Where, as here, that intent is the very thing which is at issue, we would be needlessly blindfolding the eyes of the law were we to close the mouths of those who are in the best position to shed light on the issue. For the foregoing reasons, we find the trial judge’s ruling on the testimony of Mrs. Baird to be erroneous. Moreover, to clarify the law, we hereby expressly overrule <em>Munson v. Crookston, supra </em>and <em>Bowman’s Estate, supra. </em>Because of the erroneous evidentiary rulings, appellants were denied a fair opportunity to establish their claim of relationship to decedent.

Actually, the instrument is ambiguous in that it bequeaths McClain’s entire estate to Sweeney, but then rather cryptically directs Sweeney to “hand over or pay over the remaining assets of the estate to the charitable institution ... as may be designated or chosen by him . . ” after final distribution of his estate. The <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>court below did not reach the issue of the construction of the will, and it is unnecessary for us to attempt to reconcile this apparent inconsistency.</p>

Black’s Law Dictionary defines “devolution” as “the transfer or transition from one person to another of a right, liability, title, estate, or office.” Black’s Law Dictionary 539 (Rev’d 4th ed. 1968). “Devolve” is defined thusly: “[t]o pass or be transferred from one person to another; to fall on, or accrue to, one person as the successor of another; as a title, right, office, liability. The term is said to be peculiarly appropriate to the passing of an estate from a person dying to a person living.” <em>Id. </em>at 540.</p>

The remaining issues raised by appellants also involved evidentiary rulings by the trial court which ruled certain evidence inadmissible to show pedigree because a proper foundation had not been laid for its admission. We assume, without deciding, that these rulings based on insufficient foundation were proper. However, because of our decision today regarding the testimony of Mrs. Florence Lewis and Mrs. Hazel Baird, appellants should have little difficulty in establishing the proper foundation for the introduction of this evidence of remand.</p>
