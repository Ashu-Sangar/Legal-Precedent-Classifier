Following his arrest pursuant to a warrant, Berman filed a petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus with the Criminal Motions Court of the Court of Common Pleas to which Judge Mirarchi was then assigned. On October 5, 1977, before preliminary arraignment on the charges, Judge Mirarchi scheduled a hearing on the habeas corpus petition at which time the district attorney requested permission to amend the complaint by adding a charge of tampering with records. Judge Mirarchi denied the request to amend, granted Berman’s habeas corpus petition, dismissed the complaint, and discharged Berman on the basis that the complaint contained a substantive defect which could not be remedied by amending it.

At that time Judge Mirarchi scheduled a preliminary hearing in the matter before himself for October 13,1977. The district attorney objected to conducting a preliminary hearing in the case, claiming that Berman is not entitled to a hearing on charges triable in the first instance in the Municipal Court and that the Court of Common Pleas has no authority to order a preliminary hearing in a Municipal Court case. On the date set for the hearing, Judge Mirarchi heard argument on the question and ruled that Rule 500(H) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia required him to conduct a preliminary hearing in the Municipal Court cases where there is a re-arrest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Pursuant to a petition by the Commonwealth for a Writ of Supersedeas, this Court entered a stay of proceedings below, pending disposition of <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>the Commonwealth’s petition for Writ of Prohibition.

The omission of an offense from a complaint amounts to a “substantive defect” which cannot be remedied by amending the complaint. Thus, in this case the court was required to discharge the defendant as directed by Rule 150. However, Rule 150 further states that nothing in the rule shall prevent the filing of a new complaint against a defendant who is so discharged and the issuance of process in which the defect is corrected.
