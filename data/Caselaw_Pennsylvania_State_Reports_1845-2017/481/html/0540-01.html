Where the nature of the servant’s decision or action in question is such that it may not be measured against a predictable standard of care, the possibility of litigation may tend to discourage the making of clear choices. It is in the public interest to avoid such a chilling effect upon the servant’s performance of his duties. Where, on the other hand, a standard of care may be defined and applied with relative ease, the public servant is not similarly deterred and the public interest in the protection of the official weakens. Also relevant to the strength of the public interest is the potential impact of the challenged decision or action upon the public as a whole or upon a large segment of it.

    <p id="b591-8" data-blocks='[["BL_591.9",591,[244,787,1153,1227]]]'>At the outset it is important to focus upon the purpose sought to be achieved by immunizing public servants from exposure to personal liability for their alleged torts. The doctrine of immunity was not fashioned to protect the indolent, malicious or careless servant from responsibility for the harm caused by his tortious behavior occurring in the course of the performance of his duties. To the contrary, it was designed to free the dedicated and innocent public servant from the spectre of unending vexious litigation. Most of the criticism of a concept of official immunity is premised upon an assumption of official malice, wrongdoing, unreasonableness or illegality. <em>See </em>James, <em>Tort Liability of Governmental Units, </em><a href="/citations/?q=22%20U.%20Chi.%20L.%20Rev.%20610" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="22 U. Chi. L. Rev. 610">22 U.Chi.L.Rev. 610</a>, 647 (1965). Proceeding from this perspective, a condemnation of such a doctrine would be justified. However, when we view the doctrine in light of the true purpose it seeks to achieve, i. e., to prevent impeding the decision-making and policy-determination required in the operation of government, the validity of the objective of the concept cannot be disputed. Thus, any fair and useful appraisal of the doctrine must begin with a recognition of the societal need it seeks to fulfill. Judge Learned Hand explained the raison d’etre of official immunity as follows:</p>

The justification for doing so is that it is impossible to know whether the claim is well founded until the case has been tried, and that to submit all officials, the innocent as well as the guilty, to the burden of a trial and to the inevitable danger of its outcome, would dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible, in the unflinching discharge of their duties.</blockquote>

I am not persuaded that there is a need to abandon the long-standing principles that have governed <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>this area. In view of our recent decisions that have eliminated sovereign immunity, <em>Mayle v. Pa. Dept. of Highways, </em><a href="/pa/479/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="479 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="1742235" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0384-01">479 Pa. 384</a>, <a href="/pa/479/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="479 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="1742235" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0384-01">388 A.2d 709</a> (1978), and local government immunity, <em>Ayala v. Phila. Board of Education, </em><a href="/pa/453/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="453 Pa. 584" data-case-ids="577621" data-case-paths="/pa/453/0584-01">453 Pa. 584</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%20877" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="305 A.2d 877">305 A.2d 877</a> (1973), we are not presented with the concern that the injured victim will be left without redress.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> As a practical matter the governmental unit would be the target defendant even if we were to accept the invitation to discard official immunity and expose the public servant to personal liability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> Thus a continuation of the application of the traditional doctrine of official immunity is not subject to the criticism that it will produce inequitable results. The majority expresses concern that the immunity is based upon their status as employees of the Commonwealth. I am not trou<a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>bled by this fact when there is an unquestioned societal need to provide such protection to one in that status. Government cannot be expected to function effectively when its agents are “terrified with the apprehension of personal responsibility, if their acts should result in harm” to another. <em>Yealey v. Fink, </em><a href="/pa/43/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="43 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="483173" data-case-paths="/pa/43/0212-01">43 Pa. 212</a>, 218 (1862).</p>
    <p id="b594-5" data-blocks='[["BL_594.5",594,[222,611,1148,507]]]'>The majority suggests that we examine the need for the immunity on a case-by-case basis. Such an approach defeats the underlying purpose of immunizing conduct. Unquestionably, there is wisdom in a case-by-case approach when the law enters a new area with which we have no familiarity. <em>See, e. g., Penna. Labor Relations Board v. State College Area School Dist., </em><a href="/pa/461/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="461 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="483897" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0494-01">461 Pa. 494</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="461 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="483897" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0494-01">337 A.2d 262</a> (1975). However, to create uncertainty in a formerly settled area produces anxiety here that the use of immunity was designed to eliminate.</p>

The mere fact that a servant is immune from personal liability does not negate the vicarious liability of the principal when the liability is based on the doctrine of respondeat superior. In <em>Koontz v. Messer, </em><a href="/pa/320/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="320 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="1163686" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0487-01">320 Pa. 487</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=181%20A.%20792" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="181 A. 792">181 A. 792</a> (1935), it was held that a principal may not raisé an agent-husband’s immunity from suit as a defense to a wife’s action based on respondeat superior. This holding in <em>Koontz </em>was reaffirmed in <em>Daly v. Buterbaugh, </em><a href="/pa/416/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="416 Pa. 523" data-case-ids="1893000" data-case-paths="/pa/416/0523-01">416 Pa. 523</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=207%20A.2d%20412" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="207 A.2d 412">207 A.2d 412</a> (1964).</p>

      <blockquote id="b593-6" data-blocks='[["BL_593.7",593,[318,1418,1083,465]]]'>Immunities, unlike privileges, are not delegable and are available as a defense only to persons who have them. Thus, although a child may not have a civil action against his father for an excessive beating, he has one against a servant who administers such a beating at the command of the father. ... On the other hand, where the principal directs an agent to act, or the agent acts in the scope of employment, the fact that the agent has an immunity from liability does not bar a civil action against the principal. Thus, where a servant in the scope of employment negligently runs over his wife, an action against the master by the injured wife is not barred. This result is in accordance with the rule stated in this Section and is the rule adopted in most of the states.</blockquote>

Accordingly, abrogation of governmental and sovereign immunities has undercut the emotional appeal of arguments stressing the unfairness occasioned by the bar official immunity presents to suits by private parties against public servants.</p>

If the immunity was removed it is to be expected that the governmental unit would provide the insurance for the payment of claims against its employes.

There is not, nor has there ever been, any reason for employees of the Commonwealth to be immune from lawsuits for their negligent behavior, while at the same time, all other employees (employees of private employers) have been, and are, subject to lawsuits for their negligent behavior. All citizens should be treated equally.</p>
