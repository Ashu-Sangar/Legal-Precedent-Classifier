We believe that such causation may be founded upon expert opinion testimony to the effect that defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in performing an undertaking to render services to a patient which the defendant should recognize as necessary for the other’s protection, that this failure increased the risk of physical harm to the patient, and that such harm did in fact result. Because the jury was not properly charged as to this standard, a new trial will be required.</p>

Hamil telephoned defendant, Bashline Hospital Association, Ltd. (Bashline),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and told the night supervisor that her husband was suffering from severe chest pains. Mrs. Hamil was advised by the supervisor to bring Mr. Hamil to the hospital. Upon the Hamils’ arrival, the Bash-line doctor assigned to the emergency unit could not be located but another physician, Dr. J. F. Johnston, was present and ordered an electrocardiogram (EKG) to be taken. Due to a faulty electrical outlet, the EKG machine failed to function. Dr. Johnston then directed that another machine be used, and thereafter left the hospital. A second EKG machine could not be found and, upon receiving no further aid or treatment, Mrs. Hamil transported her hus<a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>band to the private office of a Dr. Saloom.

    <p id="b303-5" data-blocks='[["BL_303.5",303,[207,362,1149,1138]]]'>In 1969, Martha Hamil, in her capacity as administratrix of the estate of her husband, instituted this action in trespass under the Wrongful Death and Survival Acts. The basis of the complaint was that Bashline failed to employ recognized and available methods of treating decedent’s malady, a myocardial infarction. In support of that theory, plaintiff called as its expert medical witness Dr. Cyril Wecht, who outlined the use of beds, oxygen and pain relieving drugs in the treatment of chest pains. Dr. Wecht then expressed his professional opinion that if Bashline had employed the methods and treatment which he had described, Mr. Hamil would have had a 75% chance of surviving the attack he was experiencing when admitted to the hospital. Dr. Wecht also gave it as his opinion that this substantial chance of recovery was terminated by defendant’s failure to provide prompt treatment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Defendant’s expert witness, Dr. John B. Treadway, opined that death was imminent at the time of Hamil’s arrival at the hospital and that the patient would have died regardless of any treatment Bashline might have provided. It was Dr. Treadway’s opinion, accordingly, that any. negligence of the hospital in the circumstances was immaterial.</p>
    <p id="b303-6" data-blocks='[["BL_303.6",303,[208,1526,1149,621]]]'>Following the introduction of all the evidence, the trial court determined that Dr. Wecht’s testimony had failed to establish, with the required degree of medical certainty, that the alleged negligence of the defendant was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s harm. The court therefore directed a verdict in favor of the defendant. Upon appeal the Superior Court, relying largely on the Restatement (Second) of Torts (hereafter the “Restatement”) § 323(a) (1965) concluded that plaintiff had in fact presented a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence and accordingly reversed the trial court and granted a new trial.

Following deliberation, the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendant and, by answers to special interrogatories, expressed its belief that although Bashline had acted in a negligent manner, plaintiff had failed to establish this negligence as a proximate cause of the decedent’s death. A new appeal was taken to the Superior Court in which appellant asserted that the trial court’s charge to the jury had failed to comply with the holding of <em>Bashline I. </em>Without resolving that issue, a divided Superior Court affirmed the entry of judgment for the defendant on the ground that it was mistaken in ordering the new trial at the time of the first appeal.

Defendant Bashline, on the other hand, notes that while Dr. Wecht’s testimony may have established that an increased risk of harm to the decedent came about as a result of Bashline’s negligent conduct, plaintiff nevertheless failed to introduce any testimony that the negligent acts or omissions did, with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, cause decedent’s death; therefore, argues defendant, no <em>prima facie </em>case was established, and the case was properly taken from the júry at the first trial.

He is not required to eliminate entirely all possibility that the defendant’s conduct was not a cause. It is enough that he introduces evidence from which reasonable men may conclude that it is more probable that the event was caused by the defendant than that it was not. The fact of causation is incapable of mathematical proof, since no man can say with absolute certainty what would have occurred if the defendant had acted otherwise. If, as a matter of ordinary experience, a particular act or omission might be expected to produce a particular result, and if that result has in fact followed, the conclusion may be justified that the causal relation exists. In drawing that conclusion, the triers of fact are permitted to draw upon ordinary human experience as to the probabilities of the case. Thus when a child is drowned in a swimming pool, no one can say with absolute certainty that a lifeguard would have saved him; but the common experience of the community permits the conclusion that the guard would more probably than not have done so, and hence that the absence of the guard has played a substantial part in bringing about the death of the child. Such questions are normally for the jury, and the court may seldom rule on them as matters of law.”</blockquote>
