The complaint averred that the trust corpus had increased in value from approximately $100,000.00 when the trust was created to more than $160,-000. 00 as of December 13, 1967, because it was producing income in excess of the annual payments of $3,600.00. Lewistown Trust and additional respondents, potential beneficiaries of settlor’s estate, admitted these averments.

Thus, settlor contemplated that the beneficiaries might receive not only all the income of the trust, but also all the corpus. Another provision, Item XXI, directed that “should any beneficiary . . . become mentally or physically incapacitated, my Executor and Trustee are authorized to use and expend such portion of the estate and trust to which such beneficiary may be entitled, either corpus or income . . . .”</p>

Accord, Restatement of Property § 440 (1944); 5 Powell, Real Property ¶ 830 (1949). In <em>McKeown, </em>the settlor created an inter vivos trust by which she was to receive $150.00 per month during her life or until the trust corpus was exhausted. The settlor authorized the trustee to draw upon the corpus to meet unusual expenses and designated a remainderman for “the remaining corpus.” We held that the settlor did not intend that trust income in <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>excess of that necessary for the monthly payments should accumulate with the corpus. The Court emphasized that the settlor, when she created the trust, apparently contemplated that the corpus would produce only about enough income to equal the monthly payments and that she had authorized the trustee, if necessary, to invade the corpus for her benefit. We found it “wholly unreasonable to infer that she intended to preclude herself for all time from enjoying the income from her own property in excess of a relatively modest amount.” Id., <a href="/pa/384/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="384 Pa. 79" data-case-ids="1263081" data-case-paths="/pa/384/0079-01">384 Pa. at 83</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20A.2d%2076" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="119 A.2d 76">119 A.2d at 78</a>. “Why, in such circumstances, should it be inferred that she intended to build up the corpus of the trust by accumulations of income for the primary benefit of prospective issue who might never come into being?” <a href="/citations/?q=119%20A.2d%2076" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="119 A.2d 76">Id.</a></p>

Moreover, in <em>McKeown, </em>trust benefits available to a named remainderman were diminished to whatever extent the income beneficiary received accumulated income.
