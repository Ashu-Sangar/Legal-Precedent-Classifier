He observed that the Santiago automobile was still smoldering from a fire neighbors were attempting to extinguish with a garden hose. The fire had centered on the front passenger seat where Smith discovered a partially melted one gallon plastic milk carton containing a small amount of gasoline. The front passenger window had been broken and on the ground next to the front passenger door he found the broken head of a claw hammer.

The Commonwealth demonstrated that appellee intentionally started a fire in an automobile parked only five to six feet from row homes with highly flammable wooden front porches. From this the inference can be reasonably drawn that in igniting the gasoline soaked Santiago vehicle appellee consciously disregarded a substantial risk that the automobile would explode, spreading the fire to the nearby occupied dwellings. See 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 302(b)(3) (defining “recklessly”). Had the fire not been discovered and extinguished by neighbors, it could have spread rapidly, leaving death and destruction in its path.</p>
    <p id="b439-8" data-blocks='[["BL_439.9",439,[238,1669,1148,629]]]'>Appellee would limit the scope of § 3301(a) and (b)(2) to instances where an actor sets a fire or causes an explosion on real property. This interpretation of the section’s language is clearly erroneous. The comment to § 220.1 of the Model Penal Code, upon which the Pennsylvania Crimes Code is based, indicates that the primary concern addressed by § 3301 is the tremendous risk of harm arising from fire and explosion. See Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft No. 11 at 34-42 (1960). See also, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 105. The comment to the Model Penal Code notes that § 220.1(2), the prototype for § 3301(a) and (b)(2), includes three traditional situations:</p>
    <blockquote id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.4",440,[273,273,1108,408]]]'>
      <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>“(a) burning one’s own property in circumstances where there is a high risk that the fire will spread to property of others . (b) burning of lesser forms of property in proximity to the specifically valued categories . .; and (c) other recklessness in relation to special categories of highly regarded property, e. g., setting fire to a haystack or a pile of trash near a dwelling, where no burning of the dwelling itself occurs.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b440-7" data-blocks='[["BL_440.5",440,[231,700,1148,773]]]'>This case constitutes a modern, urban example of the third type of situation. Fire was intentionally set to a highly flammable object near a dwelling. Although fortunately the row houses did not burn, the risk of danger to the buildings and their inhabitants was very high. Thus, as long as there is a substantial and unjustifiable risk that an intentionally set fire or explosion will destroy an occupied structure or endanger a person, the harm against which § 3301 seeks to protect is present. It would be illogical to conclude that the creation of this risk is any less culpable when the fire is started on personalty rather than on other realty. The Model Penal Code comments, the terms of the statute, and the record convince me that the Commonwealth presented more than sufficient evidence to sustain the arson charges.</p>

Here too, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth is sufficient to convict. The same facts on which appellee may be found guilty of arson support this charge. The trier of fact could conclude that in setting fire to the automobile, appellee consciously and unjustifiably created a risk of widespread damage to the home and of injury to the residents of the 4400 block of North 4th Street.</p>
