Orthopedic is a professional association of four doctors located in Lawrence County. The employment agreement provided for Dr. Burns’ employment for one year beginning January 1, 1976, at an annual compensation of $60,000. It contained the following covenant not to compete:</p>

A new contract was negotiated and executed on December 30, 1976, providing for a five month period of further employment beginning January 1, 1977, at a monthly salary of $7,500, or $2,500 more than Dr. Burns’ previous monthly salary.

He thereafter opened his own office in Lawrence County and began to practice medicine and orthopedic surgery on his own behalf. Orthopedic brought this action in equity against Dr. Burns seeking specific enforcement of the covenant and sought a preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction was granted on May 13, 1977, following a hearing at which both parties were present and represented by counsel. The Superior Court affirmed <em>per curiam </em>without opinion with one Judge noting a dissent. We granted review and now reverse the grant of the preliminary injunction.</p>
