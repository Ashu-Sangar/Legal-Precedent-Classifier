It argues, while Section 1991 requires payment of a share of administrative costs by counties which have voluntarily adopted the program, Section 471 contains no language indicating that county participation is optional and, on its face, requires participation and reimbursement of administrative costs by every county in the Commonwealth. In sustaining the preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer, the Commonwealth Court held that Section 471 did not impliedly repeal Section 1991 and that, “on its face, <em>Section </em>471, as originally enacted, <em>was limited to counties and cities of the first class; </em>a local government .classification to which Adams County does not belong.” [Emphasis added.] Thus, the court concluded, the county’s obligation for administrative expenses of the Food Stamp Program during the period July 1, 1974, to March 31, 1976, was still governed by Section 1991 of the County Code, and, since Adams County had withdrawn from the program by resolution, it was not obligated under Section 1991 to reimburse the Department.

The General Assembly, in terminating the liability of every county by amending Section 471, must have considered that every county was liable under Section 471 prior to the 1976 amendment. Furthermore, the new language in Section 471 clearly reiterates the intent of the prior Section 471 to impose liability for the period in question on every county.

However, where, as in this case, provisions of statutes enacted by different General Assemblies are irreconcilable, the statute latest in date shall prevail. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1936. Furthermore, where a general provision of a statute is in conflict with a special provision of another statute and the two provisions are irreconcilable, the general provision shall prevail if it was enacted later and the General Assembly intended that such general provision shall prevail. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1933.

However, ‘[wjhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.’ Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b).</blockquote>
