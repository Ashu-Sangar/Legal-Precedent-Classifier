We believe, however, that the acquittal in Federal Court does bar the state prosecution when both prosecutions are based on substantially the same evidence. We are thus compelled to reverse the Superior Court and reinstate the order of the Bedford County Court of Common Pleas. The facts are as follows.</p>

At the time of the fire, the hotel was owned by the wife of appellant Eldon G. Studebaker, the mayor of Bedford. Appellant was not a principal in the ownership of the New Hoffman Hotel Corporation; however, over the years, he had lent money to the corpora<a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>tion. At the time of the fire, Studebaker was personally obligated to pay $7,000 on an outstanding note in connection with the purchase of hotel equipment.</p>

Studebaker agreed to aid the corporation in finding a buyer for the hotel. He talked to George Karsnack, who, along with appellant Frank E. Grazier, operated the Bedford Airport. In February, 1969, the principals of the corporation signed an agreement giving K &amp; E Leasing (Karsnack and Grazier) an option to purchase the hotel. On March 5, 1969, four days after the fire, Karsnack agreed to exercise his option and purchase the hotel.</p>

The investigation led to federal indictments against the appellants, Luick and Merril Klein, the arsonist. The indictments charged twenty-two counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud. Subsequently, a grand jury in Bedford County returned Commonwealth indictments against appellants and Klein charging arson.</p>
