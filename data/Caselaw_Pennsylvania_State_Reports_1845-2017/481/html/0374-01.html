However, the unification of the Pennsylvania judicial system in 1969 has caused an ambiguity in the will that was not earlier present. While the twelfth clause gives the power to appoint successor trustees to “the President Judge of the Orphans’ Court of Schuylkill County,” as of January 1, 1969, the Orphans’ Court was abolished and became the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas. See Pa.Const.Schedule to art. 5, § 4 (1969). Additionally, the president judge of the Orphans’ Court became the president judge of the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas for the remainder of his term. <em><a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.2d%20681" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="50 A.2d 681">Id.,</a> </em>§ 5.</p>

The title given this person is unimportant as long as he exercises the powers of the president judge of the Orphans’ Court. Thus, the presiding judge or the judge chosen to sit in the Orphans’ Court Division of the Schuylkill County Court of Common Pleas i. e. Judge Bowe, is the successor to the power to appoint trustees granted in the past to the president judge of the Orphans’ Court by the twelfth clause of testator’s will. Our analysis of testator’s intent also leads us to conclude that the participation of Common Pleas Court President Judge Curran in these proceedings was superfluous.</p>

However, this rule does not apply when the trust agreement contains contrary provisions, such as those in clause twelve of the will before us. <em>Zerbey I, supra; Stolzenbach’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/346/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="346 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="1216455" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0074-01">346 Pa. 74</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.2d%206" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="29 A.2d 6">29 A.2d 6</a> (1943). In these cases, the exercise of the court’s sound discretion is the criterion for the exercise of its appointive power.

    <p id="b418-6" data-blocks='[["BL_418.6",418,[229,1816,1147,462]]]'>Appellants contend that past decisions of this Court and a settlement agreement approved by the Orphans’ Court on March 18,1968, compelled Judge Bowe to appoint as successor trustees members of the Zerbey family or employees of the newspaper. Thus they contend that Judge Bowe’s refusal to appoint one of the grandchildren of testator and an employee of <em>The Republican </em>was error. The basic premise upon which appellants have built this argument is without support.</p>

      <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>First, the twelfth clause does not contain even a hint that such was the intent of the testator. Second, in <em>Zerbey I, supra, </em>it was stated that the testator did not require the court to “appoint the persons nominated by the trustees; the final decision as to who is to be appointed lies with the President Judge of the Orphans’ Court.” <em>Zerbey I, supra, </em><a href="/pa/356/0002-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="356 Pa. 2" data-case-ids="470737" data-case-paths="/pa/356/0002-01">356 Pa. at 7</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.2d%20681" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="50 A.2d 681">50 A.2d at 683</a>. Nor does the 1968 settlement agreement aid appellants’ argument. Paragraph 5(a) of that agreement states that “the parties acknowledge the final responsibility of the Orphans’ Court of Schuylkill County, in the event of a vacancy in the position of trustee, to appoint a successor trustee.” Since the testator failed to place limits upon the class of persons who could be appointed trustee, Judge Bowe did not err in appointing two independent trustees.</p>

Additionally, Uzal H. Martz, Jr. is a director and president of the newspaper corporation, Johanne Zerbey Martz is assistant counsel for the corporation, and Margaretta Lazarus Paduch is a director and resides in New Jersey. It was not unreasonable for Judge Bowe to conclude that these nominees could not give the actions of the board of directors the objective scrutiny required as a trustee. Judge Bowe did not abuse his discretion by failing to appoint one of these three nominees.</p>

The testimony shows that Judge Bowe and Mr. Parnell serve on two bank advisory boards together, that Judge Bowe was a director at the Tamaqua National Bank while Mr. Parnell was in the employ of that bank prior to 1964, that Judge Bowe as an attorney at that time was one of the many attorneys engaged from time to time regarding trust estates administered by the Tamaqua Bank, that Judge Bowe and Mr. Parnell live in Hometown, Pa., and reside a few hundred feet from each other, and that though they are friends and have played golf together, they are not otherwise involved socially and do not move in the same social circles. These facts do not add up to a showing of favoritism or improper conduct on the part of Judge Bowe. The nature of the relationship between Judge Bowe and Mr. Parnell does not detract from the fact that Mr. Parnell is well qualified to handle trust duties.</p>

Parnell and Elliott as trustees, dismissing appellants’ exceptions to those appointments, and dismissing the petition for a change of venue.

Mr. Elliott, as part of his duties at the bank, approved a loan to President Judge Curran’s son and nephew for the purchase of a local radio station that competes with the <em>Pottsville Republican </em>for news and advertising. This leads appellants to conclude that Mr. Elliott will be forced by his employers — President Judge Curran, his son, and nephew — to use his position as trustee to undermine the <em>Republican </em>to the advantage of the competing radio station owned by President Judge Curran’s son and nephew.

First, the record is wholly devoid of any indication that the improper interference appellants fear will occur or that Mr. Elliott could reasonably be expected to be responsive to such pressure. Second, Mr. Elliott’s impressive background in trust affairs weighs heavily against any presumption of future impropriety. Mr. Elliott was employed as a bank examiner in the United States Comptroller’s Office in 1937. He has functioned as a commercial examiner, a trust examiner, a foreign department examiner and then from 1959 until 1970, he was employed by the United States Treasury Department, Comptroller of Currency, as a representative in trusts with the duty of examining National Banks exercising trust power in the Third National Bank Region. While he was employed with the United States Treasury Department, Mr. Elliott “examined the trust departments of practically every National Bank in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that were exercising trust powers, including our local banks, surrounding area banks and the major banks in the State of Pennsylvania.” Mr. Elliott received the Albert Gallatin Award for outstanding service while employed by the Comptroller of the Currency. In 1970, he was employed by the Minersville Safe Deposit Bank <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>where he functions as a cashier, trust officer and a director. Mr. Elliott is a member of the executive committee of Group Two of the Pennsylvania Bankers’ Association, and is a first vice president of the Schuylkill County Bankers Association. On occasion he has been a lecturer at the Pennsylvania Trust School conducted at Bucknell University.</p>

    <p id="b424-6" data-blocks='[["BL_424.6",424,[278,798,1148,691]]]'>Fourth, appellants’ allegations do not connect Mr. Elliott with President Judge Curran other than as an employee of a bank of which President Judge Curran is chairman of the board. The record indicates that neither Mr. Elliott nor President Judge Curran have financial interests of any sort in the corporation owning the competing radio station. The record further indicates that Mr. Elliott does not have any business connections with President Judge Curran, his son, or his nephew, other than through the Minersville Bank as part of his normal duties.

He placed no express restrictions upon the class of potential trustees the President Judge could select. In view of testator’s express, unrestricted delegation of authority, the Orphans’ Court did not abuse its discretion in appointing trustees other than those nominated by the surviving trustees. I therefore agree with the majority that the decree of the orphans’ court should be affirmed.</p>
