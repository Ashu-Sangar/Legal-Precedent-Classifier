On January 28, 1933, Israel DeRoy died and in March of that year the trustees filed their first account. An audit hearing on the account was then held at which a principal question was whether the trustees should distribute the trust principal to Jean Lois DeRoy as “children” under paragraph NINTH(f) of the will, <em>supra, </em>or retain the funds in trust and distribute the income to Helen Goldman DeRoy as dictated by the will (should Israel DeRoy die without leaving children or issue of children surviving). The orphans’ court appointed a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of Jean Lois DeRoy, who was then a minor 16 years of age. Following submission to the court of the guardian’s “Report and Opinion”, the auditing judge entered a decree nisi dated May 24, 1933, ordering that the trustees distribute the trust income to Helen Goldman DeRoy for “purposes specified in will.” No exceptions were filed to the decree nisi, which therefore became the final decree of the orphans’ court upon the expiration of ten days. No appeal was taken from the final decree.</p>

After two hearings the auditing judge ordered that the trust principal be distributed to the intestate heirs of Joseph DeRoy.

Jean Lois DeRoy is, therefore, clearly <em>not </em>a child ‘adopted before the date of the will.’ My conclusion from the wording of the above mentioned section of the Wills Act [Section 16(b) of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P.L. 403] is, therefore, that the Will of Joseph DeRoy, must be so construed in accordance with this statutory canon of construction to exclude the gift over to any adopted child of Israel DeRoy.</blockquote>

Hence, the ordinary rules of construction govern the interpretation of Joseph DeRoy’s Will. These ordinary rules of construction to arrive at the testator’s intention as set forth in the decision above quoted give the words ‘child or children or issue’ their natural meaning, thus excluding any adopted children. Since Joseph DeRoy wrote his Will and died before Jean Lois DeRoy was adopted, he could not have intended that this adopted child of his son should share in his estate. The conclusion is, therefore, inescapable that Jean Lois DeRoy can not take under the will of Joseph DeRoy, deceased.”</blockquote>

Each parcel was given, either outright or in trust, to one of testator’s eight surviving children. In those cases where the one-eighth share was put in trust for testator’s child, a gift of the remainder of that one-eighth share was made to their “children” or “issue” should testator’s children predecease him. In those cases where the one-eighth share was given absolutely, the gifts were made to the beneficiary “. . . and his heirs.” Clearly, therefore, testator intended to bestow upon each of his eight children an equal portion of the residue of his estate. The manner in which each was to receive that one-eighth share varied to the extent that four of his sons were to receive their shares absolutely while his remaining son, and each of his three daughters received their shares in the form of a trust. The income of each one-eighth share was payable to each of them for life and upon their respective deaths, the principle of each one-eighth share was to be divided equally among their respective children per stirpes. Only in those cases where testator’s children died without leaving “children” or “issue” surviving did testator provide that the one-eighth share given to such child should either go to that child’s husband or wife as the case might be, or revert to testator’s estate. This distribution scheme clearly indicates testator’s intent to bestow the principle of these trust funds upon the children of his one son and three daughters for whom trust incomes for life were established by the will. <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>Applying the rule of law as stated by the orphans' court in its adjudication in 1933 to appellant now would thwart that distribution scheme. Applying that law would cause the child of one of testator’s eight children (appellant) to receive nothing under the will while the children of the other children of the testator for whom trust funds were established would receive their respective shares of their parents’ trusts. The injustice of such an application of the prior law is obvious, and is certainly not a result expressly compelled by testator’s will.</p>

On an orphans’ court accounting in 1933 on the occasion of the death of Israel DeRoy, life tenant under the testamentary trust of his father, Joseph DeRoy, the question was presented whether Jean DeRoy, an adopted minor child of Israel, was entitled to take the corpus of the trust on Israel’s death. A guardian ad litem was appointed to represent the minor’s interest, and the question was decided adversely to Jean. This was for the reason that, under the Wills Act of 1917, Act of June 7, 1917, P.L. 403, § 16(b), 20 P.S. Chap. 2, App. § 228, and the case law thereunder, an adoptive child was not deemed to be embraced within the meaning of the word “children” or “issue”. <em>Yates Estate, </em><a href="/pa/281/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="281 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="1087058" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0178-01">281 Pa. 178</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.%20254" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="126 A. 254">126 A. 254</a> (1924); <em>Puterbaugh’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/261/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="261 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="1042266" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0235-01">261 Pa. 235</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20A.%20601" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="104 A. 601">104 A. 601</a> (1918).

If there were no children of Israel but his wife Helen survived him, the trust continued for the life of Helen as income beneficiary, and on her death was to be distributed to the heirs of Joseph under the intestacy laws.

When that is done, the following appears: First, the issue upon the audits of both the 1933 account and the 1974 account of the one-eighth share of Joseph DeRoy’s residuary estate was identical, <em>viz., </em>whether a child adopted by the testator’s son, Israel, in 1921 is entitled to take under the provisions of a will made in 1918 by the adopting parent’s father and which specifies “children” of testator’s son as beneficiaries upon the death of the <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>son.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Second, the decree <em>nisi </em>entered May 24, 1933, by its terms, became final ten days following its entry when no exceptions were filed thereto.

See Restatement of Judgments, § 93(b) (1942). Nevertheless, the appellees herein (the intestate heirs) who assert the plea of collateral estoppel were in fact parties to the 1933 decree through privity with <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>the trustees (see Section 85 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments, <em>supra </em>) and obtained at the least a right of expectancy, if not technically a vested interest, see n.l, <em>supra, </em>when the trustees were instructed to retain the funds for the purposes expressed in the will, i. e., payment of the income to the life tenant and upon her death, to distribute the trust property to the intestate heirs.</p>

It is important to note that under the schedule of distribution filed by the trustee and upheld by the court below, Jean Lois DeRoy is to be considered an heir-at-law of Joseph DeRoy and will, according to the laws of intestacy, receive a 12.5% share of the trust corpus. See the Act of June 30, 1972, P.L. 508, No. 164, § 2, 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 2108 which reenacts prior law (Intestate Act of June 7, 1917, P.L. 429, § 16, 20 P.S. § 102). Thus, contrary to the assertion of the majority opinion, the result reached below is fair and equitable to all parties involved.</p>
