Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder conviction, with a concurrent five to ten year sentence for the arson conviction.

During the incident, appellant and his seven cohorts shot and killed one employee, shot and wounded another, doused yet a third with gasoline and set him on fire. All employees were stripped of their personal belongings.</p>

    <p id="b318-5" data-blocks='[["BL_318.31",318,[250,405,1148,469]]]'>At the time of the criminal episode, Louis Gruby was employed at Dubrow’s as a “greeter.” Gruby would ask prospective customers what they were looking for and then direct them to the proper area and salesmen. Gruby and another employee, Audrey Dimeo, were the only employees able to identify any of the participants in the crime. In fact, three days after the robbery, Gruby aided a police artist in making a composite sketch. Appellant was nonetheless able to elude capture until September 20, 1974.</p>

Mr. Gruby testified that during the incident, he had an ample opportunity to see appellant. He further testified he had seventeen years of army intelligence training involving the observation and description of persons. Gruby stated that he was “absolutely” certain of his identification. However, when asked to identify appellant, Gruby identified another individual as the person participating in the robbery. At the time of the identification, no one informed Gruby that the man he identified was not appellant.</p>

The judge occupies an exalted and dignified position; he is the one person to whom the jury, with rare exceptions, looks for guidance, and from whom the litigants expect absolute impartiality.

In such cases an appellate court is in a position to resolve claims of ineffectiveness on the basis of the trial record as augmented by the post-conviction hearing record. This is normally not the situation where ineffectiveness is raised for the first time on direct appeal, although a record on such a claim can and sometimes should be made at a hearing ancillary to post-trial motions before they are decided by the trial court.
