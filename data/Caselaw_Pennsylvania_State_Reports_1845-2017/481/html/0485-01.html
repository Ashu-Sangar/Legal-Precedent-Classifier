    <p id="b527-6" data-blocks='[["BL_527.6",527,[251,374,1147,780]]]'>Appellee, Anthony Prado, was arrested on charges of criminal homicide, murder, possessing an instrument of crime and possessing a prohibited offensive weapon. Following a preliminary hearing before the Municipal Court of Philadelphia, appellee was discharged for lack of a prima facie case. One month later, the Administrative Judge of the Court of Common Pleas issued a rearrest warrant. Appellee was again discharged when, after a second preliminary hearing, a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas also found no prima facie case. Subsequently, the prosecution filed yet another Petition to Rearrest. No additional evidence was presented, and that petition was denied. The prosecution now appeals the orders entered by the Court of Common Pleas discharging appellee and denying the prosecution’s latest Petition to Rearrest.</p>
    <p id="b527-7" data-blocks='[["BL_527.7",527,[248,1185,1149,723]]]'>Ordinarily, orders such as the ones before us are not appealable since the individual is subject to rearrest. We have long held that the conclusion by a committing magistrate that the prosecution has failed to establish a prima facie case is not a final determination of guilt such as an acquittal. The prosecution may bring the matter again before any other officer empowered to hold a preliminary hearing. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellee did emerge from an alley after the shooting, but no witnesses to the shooting were presented and no evidence of the murder weapon was presented.

The prosecution introduced remarks made by appellee to a sporting goods salesman that “you didn’t sell any bullets to me.” (R-46) and, to a detective that “you ain’t never going to find my rifle, Turkey,” (R-55) and asks us to <em>infer </em>that appellee was “conscious of his guilt”.</p>
