    <p class="author" id="A7e" data-blocks='[["BL_576.6",576,[294,520,345,42]]]'>O’BRIEN, Justice.</p>
    <p id="b576-6" data-blocks='[["BL_576.7",576,[251,583,1146,206]]]'>This appeal arises from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County denying appellant, John Lowers, post-conviction relief. The facts surrounding this appeal are as follows.</p>
    <p id="b576-7" data-blocks='[["BL_576.8",576,[250,809,1147,519]]]'>On May 7, 1974, while represented by the Public Defender’s Office of Washington County, appellant pled guilty to a charge of murder generally. The homicide charges arose out of the February 20, 1974, shooting of Shirley Bongiomi and Carolyn Wagner in Washington, Pennsylvania. Appellant was adjudged guilty on two counts of murder of the first degree and on May 23, 1974, the court below sentenced appellant to concurrent terms of life imprisonment for both murder convictions. No direct appeal was taken to this court.</p>
    <p id="b576-8" data-blocks='[["BL_576.9",576,[249,1357,1148,205]]]'>In September, 1976, appellant, represented by counsel other than trial counsel, filed a Post-Conviction Hearing Act Petition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> He alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>in his petition and again on this appeal:</p>
    <blockquote id="b576-9" data-blocks='[["BL_576.10",576,[291,1578,1104,357]]]'>“. . . (1) a statement he made without counsel present was used against him at the time of the hearing; (2) that his privilege against self-incrimination was violated; (3) that he did not have competent counsel; (4) that his plea of guilty was unlawfully induced; (5) that he was not furnished the right to appeal; and (6) that his plea was unconstitutional.”</blockquote>

On September 7,1977, a hearing was held on appellant’s petition for reconsideration of the denial of his post-conviction petition and on October 25, <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>1977, the court below denied that petition. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b577-4" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[235,354,1145,306]]]'>Our initial inquiry is whether appellant was denied his right to a direct appeal. While listing the above issue, appellant’s brief points to no specific testimony either at the guilty plea hearing of May 7, 1974, or the post-conviction hearing of September 23,1976, to support his allegation of a denial of appellate rights.</p>
    <p id="b577-5" data-blocks='[["BL_577.6",577,[234,679,1146,359]]]'>The record of the May 7,1974, guilty plea does reflect that the court below explicitly told appellant that he had thirty days, after the imposition of judgments of sentence, to appeal. Moreover, Salvatore F. Panepinto, Esquire, one of the public defenders who represented appellant at the guilty plea specifically testified as follows concerning the fact that no direct appeal was filed:</p>
    <blockquote id="b577-6" data-blocks='[["BL_577.7",577,[277,1052,1102,141]]]'>“Q. Mr. Panepinto, according to the record, no appeal was ever filed in this instance, in this case. Is that correct?</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b577-9" data-blocks='[["BL_577.10",577,[276,1329,1104,308]]]'>“A. We discussed, after the plea was taken, discussed this matter with Mr. Lowers in the jail prior to their taking him to Western Penitentiary and at that time, the matter was discussed and he evidenced to us that no appeal should be taken, that he would acquiesce to the sentence as it was laid against him.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b577-10" data-blocks='[["BL_577.11",577,[276,1650,1104,349]]]'>“Q. So apparently, from your testimony, all of these statements he made to you relative to his plea of guilty, relative to his decision not to go to trial, relative to his decision not to take an appeal, were in your opinion based on a competent understanding of the facts and circumstances that surrounded him at the time?</blockquote>
