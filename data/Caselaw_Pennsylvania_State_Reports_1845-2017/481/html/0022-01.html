A rule to show cause why a contempt citation should not issue was granted, and hearings on the rule were held. During the hearings, defense counsel requested that the court inform appellants whether the proceeding was one for criminal contempt or civil contempt. The court refused to classify the proceeding, and at the conclusion of the hearings, found that appellants had knowingly violated its May 13th order by continuing to provide sexual services to customers of Burgandy U. in exchange for monetary fees, and that such willful violation of the order rendered appellants in contempt of court. On November 26, 1976, the trial court entered a contempt decree imposing two fines against appellants. According to the trial court, the first fine of $153,000.00 “represents the established minimum amount of profits made by [appellants] <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>as a result of their contemptuous conduct.” The second fine of $150,000.00, labeled a “punitive fine” by the court, was to be returned after appellants had assured the court that they had purged themselves of their contemptuous conduct by ceasing the enjoined activities at Burgandy U. This direct appeal from the adjudication of contempt followed. <em>See </em>The Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, 17 P.S. § 211.202(5) (Supp.1978-79).</p>

Regardless of whether or not the money was returnable to appellants, however, the fact remains that it was a fine imposed for a past act. It is one thing to hold one in civil contempt in an effort to prospectively coerce that person to do some act which the person has refused to do, and it is quite another thing to fine one for an affirmative, past act that is in violation of a court decree. The trial court in this case simply made the fine conditional, upon the happening of some future event, the happening of which would result in forfeiture of the fine. In reality, therefore, the fine would have been imposed for contemptuous conduct committed prior to the fine’s collection.

While approving the unjust enrichment measure for arriving at the amount of the civil contempt fine, the court nevertheless reversed the contempt order because, on the record before them, there was insufficient evidence to justify even a <em>prima facie </em>showing of the <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>amount of profit made by the defendant. <em><a href="/pa/464/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="464 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1710345" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0066-01">Id.</a> See also National Merchandising Corp. v.
