On September 15, 1975, Walls entered pleas of guilty to burglary, criminal trespass, theft <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>by deception and receiving stolen goods. As a result of these last convictions, the probation imposed on December 3, 1973, was revoked on October 6, 1975, after a counselled evidentiary hearing.</p>

Separate sentences were also imposed on each of the 1975 convictions. These last mentioned sentences aggregating two to five years imprisonment were directed to be served concurrently with each other, but consecutively to the sentence imposed on the 1973 conviction.</p>

We cannot make them run at the same time — concurrently. That’s the law. We couldn’t make it otherwise if we wanted to, do you understand that?”</blockquote>

    <p id="b43-10" data-blocks='[["BL_43.10",43,[213,1820,1148,459]]]'>The Act of June 19, 1911, P.L. 1055, § 10, 61 P.S. § 305, as amended, has been interpreted to mandate that, where a person released on <em>parole </em>is convicted of a crime, the remainder of the sentence imposed for the original crime must be served before the commencement of any sentence imposed on the second crime. See <em>Commonwealth v. Terry, </em><a href="/pa-super/229/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="229 Pa. Super. 443" data-case-ids="813254" data-case-paths="/pa-super/229/0443-01">229 Pa.Super. 443</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=323%20A.2d%2082" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="323 A.2d 82">323 A.2d 82</a> (1974).

      <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>All members of the Superior Court recognized the foregoing, and a majority concluded that, since a consecutive sentence is not mandated in violation of probation cases, it is a matter within the discretion of the trial court to determine if a concurrent or consecutive sentence should be imposed in such instances. Cf. Pa.R.Crim.P. 1406; 18 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 1321(a) and 1371(b). But, the majority then ruled that, since the sentences challenged here were not unlawful <em>per se, </em>the issue of the consecutive sentencing had been waived because Walls failed to object in the trial court or to otherwise bring the issue to that court’s attention.</p>
    <p id="b44-6" data-blocks='[["BL_44.5",44,[259,868,1148,689]]]'>The dissenters in the Superior Court urged there is no established procedure for appellate review of a sentence imposed subsequent to a guilty plea unless the challenge is to the legality of the sentence. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Ward, </em><a href="/pa/442/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="442 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1935336" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0351-01">442 Pa. 351</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=275%20A.2d%2092" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="275 A.2d 92">275 A.2d 92</a> (1970). As a result, Walls’ only recourse, they argued, would be to request permission to withdraw the guilty plea and to proceed to trial, which he may not have wanted to do. Because of this limited undesirable option, they urged that Walls should not be denied a review of the sentence on direct appeal, even though it was lawful. Thus, the dissenters would have ruled no waiver occurred and would have remanded the record for resentencing.</p>

Moreover, even after sentencing, Walls was not limited to requesting permission to withdraw the guilty pleas, but could have filed a petition for reconsideration of the sentences. See Act of June 1,1959, P.L. 342, No. 70, § 1, 12 P.S. § 1032 (Supp. 1978-79). Since he did neither, we agree with the ruling in the Superior Court that the issue has been waived.</p>
