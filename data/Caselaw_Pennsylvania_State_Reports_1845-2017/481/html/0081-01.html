Similarly, the specifications fell short of alleging a section 1201(a)(5) unfair prac<a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>tice. The gist of this section is the failure to bargain collectively in good faith over a mandatory item of bargaining, including the failure to discuss grievances. The specifications simply do not allege the necessary elements of this unfair practice. In the absence of factual assertions which clearly allege a <em>prima facie </em>case of unfair practices, the Labor Board did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the charges.</p>
    <p id="b130-5" data-blocks='[["BL_130.5",130,[243,721,1151,1210]]]'>The Union also argues that the Labor Board’s dismissal of their charges was arbitrary and capricious because, in similar cases, they found section 1201(a)(5) (failure to bargain in good faith) violations where an employer unilaterally altered fringe benefits. The argument ignores a crucial distinction between those cases and this. In the present case, a collective bargaining agreement was <em>already </em>in effect and was not due to expire until June 30, 1977. In the cases cited as similar by the Union, the issue involved alteration of benefits at the expiration of an agreement or during the hiatus between agreements, i. e., during contract negotiations. Hence, the unilateral alteration of benefits which were in the process of being negotiated was a failure to bargain in good faith. <em>Laurel School Dist, </em>6 P.P.E.R. 351 (1975); <em>Curwensville Area School Dist., </em>6 P.P.E.R. 327 (1975); <em>New Brighton Area School Dist., </em>6 P.P.E.R. 296 (1975); <em>Duquesne City School Dist., </em>6 P.P.E.R. 203 (1975). Thus, since no contract negotiations were involved in the instant case, these Labor Board decisions are readily distinguishable. The Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board did not act arbitrarily in failing to find a section 1201(a)(5) unfair practice alleged in the Pennsylvania Social Services Union’s charges.</p>
