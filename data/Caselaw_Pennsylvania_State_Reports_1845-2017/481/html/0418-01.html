    <p id="b460-5" data-blocks='[["BL_460.6",460,[255,409,1148,584]]]'>On February 28, 1977, the trial of appellant Charles Whelan and his co-defendant, Harry S. Anderson, commenced. Appellant and his co-defendant were charged with criminal homicide. On March 7, 1977, after the Commonwealth placed its case in chief into evidence and after appellant and his co-defendant placed their cases into evidence, appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of being an accessory to murder. After conducting a colloquy with appellant to ascertain whether the guilty plea was made knowingly and voluntarily, the trial judge accepted appellant’s guilty plea. Appellant was represented by counsel at all the proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b460-6" data-blocks='[["BL_460.7",460,[246,1028,1154,474]]]'>The trial of appellant’s co-defendant continued and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty as to him. On April .1, 1977, appellant filed a motion requesting permission to withdraw his guilty plea; appellant claimed that he was “less implicated” by the evidence than was his co-defendant (who was acquitted) and, therefore, “in the name of fairness”, he should be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea. After holding a hearing, the trial court denied the motion and on May 2, 1977, appellant was sentenced.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

This argument is without merit. Before the trial judge accepted appellant’s guilty plea, the trial judge conducted a colloquy<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> with appellant in which <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>the trial judge explained: 1) the elements of the crime which appellant pleaded guilty to; 2) the punishment which appellant could be subjected to as a result of the guilty plea; 3) the terms of the plea — namely, that as a result of pleading guilty to being an accessory to the crime of the murder, the Commonwealth would not prosecute appellant as a principal in the crime of murder; and 4) that if appellant did not plead guilty, he would be presumed innocent until proven guilty and that he would be entitled to a trial by jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Appellant stated that he understood the trial judge’s explanations. Additionally, appellant stated that his plea was voluntary and that he was not subjected to threats, force or coercion. Upon a review of the record, we find that the record supports the trial judge’s finding that appellant’s plea of guilty was tendered in a voluntary and understanding manner.</p>

Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 320 provides that “at any time before sentence, the court may, in its discretion, permit or direct a plea of guilty to be withdrawn and a plea of not guilty substituted.” This Court held in <em>Commonwealth v. McLaughlin, </em><a href="/pa/469/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="469 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="1722091" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0407-01">469 Pa. 407</a>, <a href="/pa/469/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="469 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="1722091" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0407-01">366 A.2d 238</a> (1976) that “the crucial factor in determining whether to allow a presentence withdrawal of a guilty plea . . .

Appellant would obtain an unfair advantage by being allowed, together with his counsel, a full preview of the Commonwealth’s evidence before deciding upon their trial strategy. Similarly, appellant’s actions, if allowed to succeed might be a means of obtaining an entirely new jury for a defendant anytime he feels that the jury originally selected is not favorably disposed to his cause, even though there were no grounds for a mistrial.”</p>

I believe it necessary, how<a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>ever, to comment upon one other aspect of the opinion of Mr. Justice Larsen. The opinion purports to create a new standard by which pre-sentence motions to withdraw guilty pleas will be adjudicated. The opinion of Mr. Justice Larsen states that where the plea was entered after the Commonwealth commenced its case at trial, pre-sentence withdrawal is permitted “only when compelling reasons exist.” Such a test shifts the burden of proof on a motion to withdraw from the Commonwealth to the defendant. Moreover, it unduly circumscribes the broad discretion we have heretofore granted trial courts in these matters.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
