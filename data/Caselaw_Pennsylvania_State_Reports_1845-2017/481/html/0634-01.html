Unable to obtain special permits authorizing operation of its business, Douglas has not relocated in the immediate area. It has also found the cost of property outside the immediate area too expensive for its type of business. Douglas therefore has remained on the condemned premises as the Redevelopment Authority’s tenant.</p>

Though we agree with the Commonwealth Court’s determination that Douglas is not entitled to dislocation damages while in possession of the premises, we believe that the court of common pleas properly exercised its discretion in submitting the question of dislocation damages to the jury. We hold that, upon surrendering the condemned premises, Douglas is entitled to receive payment of the jury’s award of $10,000 for dislocation damages. We therefore vacate the order of the Commonwealth Court and remand the case to the court of common pleas with directions to modify the judgment accordingly.</p>

The jury resolved these issues together with the amount of general damages caused by the Redevelopment Authority’s taking. Thus, consistent with the objectives of the Eminent Domain Code, the trial court’s submission to the jury of all issues properly avoided repetitive and prolonged eminent <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>domain proceedings and unnecessary additional burdens on the judicial process.

We concluded that a landlord owning, but not occupying, a residential apartment building did not fall within the class of “displaced persons” for whom the Legislature wished to provide these special, additional benefits. The landlord did not “move or move personal property” in the common, everyday sense of those terms and therefore was not a “displaced person” entitled to dislocation damages. <em>Stepanik </em>therefore refutes appellant’s contention that Section 201(8) of the Code is to be read so as not to require a “condemnee,” like the one in <em>Stepanik </em>or here, to “move or move personal property” to become a “displaced person.”</p>

Section 604-A(2) authorizes the Attorney General to promulgate regulations to assure “[tjhat a displaced person who makes proper application for a payment authorized for such person by this article [on dislocation damages] shall be paid promptly after a move or, in hardship <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>cases, be paid in advance.” Though we agree that advance payments may be permissible under this Section, we cannot agree that advance payment is appropriate in this case.
