Would we <em>sua sponte </em>find a non-constitutional issue requiring reversal in order to avoid the constitutional question raised? “Emphatically not!” We have said in case' after case in which defendant has failed to raise that non-constitutional issue in the trial court. If a defendant fails to raise an issue in the trial court, we have said it is not preserved for appellate review. Period. If we are now going to “find” an issue so that we may <em>affirm </em>a lower court’s order favoring a defendant, we should also “find” an issue when warranted to reverse a lower court’s decision inimicable to a defendant. But that we will not do.</p>

In this case, the issue decided by the majority was raised in the trial court by appellees. I therefore join in the result reached by the majority here.</p>
