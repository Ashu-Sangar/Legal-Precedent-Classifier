Hopkins, </em><a href="/us/118/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="118 U.S. 356" data-case-ids="3519298" data-case-paths="/us/118/0356-01">118 U.S. 356</a>, <a href="/us/118/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 S.

Appellants also sought a stay of any further prosecutions pending adjudication of this case. After a review of the depositions, stipulations, and sundry evidentiary materials, the Court of Common Pleas granted appellants’ stay but denied appellants’ relief on the merits. The <em>Kroger Co. v. O’Hara Township, </em>123 P.L.J. 275 (C.P.Allegh.Co.1975). Appellant, Jamesway Corporation, based on the belief that our stay order entered in the <em>Kroger Company </em>case was of statewide application, opened its store in Conewango Township, Warren County, on Sunday, November 26, 1976. That same day, Jamesway’s store manager was charged with ten separate violations of one section of the Sunday Trading Laws. Jamesway filed a complaint in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Warren County, seeking to enjoin the defendant township from enforcing the Sunday Trading Laws. Appellant, Jamesway, like appellants Kroger and Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea, challenged the constitutionality of the Sunday Trading Laws and also contended that (1) the court order of November 20th was of statewide application, and (2) if not, it was unjust for Jamesway to be prosecuted for violations of the Sunday Trading Laws in one county when this Court stayed similar prosecutions in another county.</p>

In spite of the 1973 amendment, the legislature thought it necessary to explicitly allow Sunday harness racing, and boxing and wrestling exhibitions. In 1974, the former prohibition of Sunday harness racing was removed; Sunday racing is now permitted after 1:00 p. m. <em>See </em>15 P.S. § 2607(c) (Supp.1978-79). Boxing and wrestling exhibitions, once expressly prohibited on Sunday, are now permitted at anytime. <em>See </em>4 P.S. § 30.202 (Supp.1978-79).</p>

It is clear, however, that an equal protection clause cannot be regarded as “fundamental” for purposes of an equal protection analysis since it is not the source of any substantive rights or liberties. The function of such a clause is simply to measure the validity of classifications created by state laws. <em>See San Antonio School District v.
