The scope of this ordinance is so limited that it does not attempt to proscribe any of the “classic” or traditional means of exercising first amendment rights. The township continues to permit door-to-door, face-to-face solicitation and distribution, mail distribution, leafletting in public places and even doorstep distribution. Ordinance No. 662 serves only to condition this last form of first amendment exercise on the consent of the resident in advance of distribution.

On the contrary, the use of such a standard would be inimical to the determination that while commercial speech is protected by the first and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution, the protection afforded is “a limited measure of protection, commensurate with [commercial speech’s] position in the scale of First Amendment values, [allowing] modes of regulation that might be impermissible in the realm of non-commercial expression.” <em>Ohralik v.

The Council has sought to restrict the free flow of this data because it fears that otherwise, homeowners will make decisions inimical to what the Council views as the homeowners’ self-interest and the corporate interest of the township: they will choose to leave town. The Council’s concern, then, was not with any commercial aspect of ‘For Sale’ signs — with offerors communicating offers to offerees — but with the substance of the information communicated to Willingboro citizens.”</blockquote>

A single phone call or post card can stop these “unsightly” materials from finding their way to the resident’s doorstep or mailbox and will vindicate any privacy interest purportedly violated by a plastic bag quietly placed on the doorstep or attached to the mailbox. As to the third proffered justification — preventing a buildup of such materials so as not to signal to potential burglars or vandals that a resident may be away from home for an extended period of time — we realize that in the limited situation where a resident had never received such advertising materials, left home for a prolonged period of time, and then had the materials delivered to the residence <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>for the first time while he or she were away, the evil sought to be remedied by the ordinance might exist.

A resident will have already received at least one plastic bag, and just as the resident calls to have the newspaper discontinued during an extended absence from home, he or she can easily call to ensure that materials such as “Shopper’s Savers Sacks” are likewise discontinued. We therefore cannot say that this ordinance, requiring Sterlace and others similarly situated to obtain the affirmative consent of every resident to whom they want to distribute advertising material, is “necessary,” in a First Amendment context of that word, to achieve those objectives. <em>See Linmark Associates, Inc. v.

The effectiveness of Sterlace’s method of communication is that the information is brought to the individual attention of each resident.

There is thus no question the Ordinance abridges protected expression, and arguably does so in a way that makes it economically and practically unfeasible for Sterlace to exercise that expression which the First Amendment was designed to protect. The First Amendment does not tolerate the burden on protected speech which results from Ordinance 662 because “[t]he right of free speech is guaranteed every citizen that he may reach the minds of willing listeners and to do so there must be opportunity to win their attention.” <em>Kovacs v.

    <p id="b59-4" data-blocks='[["BL_59.5",59,[216,994,1147,1141]]]'>The Commonwealth contends that the McCandless ordinance is valid because it “especially [attempts] to protect the privacy of its residents’ homes,” and relies on <em>Breard v. Alexandria, </em><a href="/us/341/0622-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="341 U.S. 622" data-case-ids="1148157" data-case-paths="/us/341/0622-01">341 U.S. 622</a>, <a href="/us/341/0622-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="341 U.S. 622" data-case-ids="1148157" data-case-paths="/us/341/0622-01">71 S.Ct. 920</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=95%20L.%20Ed.%201233" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="95 L. Ed. 1233">95 L.Ed. 1233</a> (1951), which upheld an ordinance requiring solicitors of magazine subscriptions to obtain a resident’s prior consent before knocking on that resident’s door. The intrusion on personal privacy sought to be curbed by the Alexandria ordinance was much different than is present in this case, however. That ordinance found obnoxious solicitors who knocked on doors and went “in and upon private residences.” <a href="/us/341/0622-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="341 U.S. 622" data-case-ids="1148157" data-case-paths="/us/341/0622-01">341 U.S. at 624</a>, <a href="/us/341/0622-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="341 U.S. 622" data-case-ids="1148157" data-case-paths="/us/341/0622-01">71 S.Ct. at 923</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=95%20L.%20Ed.%201233" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="95 L.

The residents there “did not desire any uninvited intrusion into the privacy of their home[s].” <em>Id. </em>at 625, <a href="/us/341/0622-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="341 U.S. 622" data-case-ids="1148157" data-case-paths="/us/341/0622-01">71 S.Ct. at 923</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=95%20L.%20Ed.%201233" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="95 L. Ed. 1233">95 L.Ed. at 1239</a>. In contrast, any intrusion on privacy occasioned by Sterlace’s depositing a plastic bag at a residence is slight. He does not knock on doors, and it is likely that more frequently than not a resident will not know that Sterlace was even at his or her home until the time the plastic bag is discovered. Thus the adjustment made in <em>Breard </em>between the right of privacy and the right of expression is necessarily different from the adjustment that must be made in this case.</p>

That notion has now been firmly laid to rest, and recent cases holding that commercial speech is constitutionally protected cast considerable doubt on the vitality of <em>Breard’s </em>First Amendment analysis. Considering this recent development along with the weightier privacy interest involved there, the majority errs when it upholds the constitutionality of Ordinance 662. I therefore dissent.</p>
