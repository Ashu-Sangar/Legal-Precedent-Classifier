We affirm its action on the pertinent portions of its opinion which appear in the Eeporter\u2019s notes.\nWe have not been convinced that there was anything in the allotment which the trustee made of the $50,000.00 which was paid on account of the Somers, Fitter & Todd mortgage to other participants therein which would warrant a surcharge. We considered the same situation and approved it in Harton\u2019s Est., 331 Pa. 507, 1 A. (2d) 292.\nWe see nothing in the record before us which would warrant the court below or us in refusing the allowance made to the accountants for counsel fees.\nDecree affirmed.
