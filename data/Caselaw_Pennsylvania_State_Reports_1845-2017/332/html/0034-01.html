The defendant admits the right of the plaintiff to control the production of the milk. The plaintiff concedes that it has no right to control the milk after it has started its journey to New York, so that the sole question before us is whether the act of purchasing milk in Pennsylvania under the circumstances of this case can be so separated from the transportation of the milk to New York as to constitute a separate transaction, purely intrastate in its nature.</p>

The defendant purchased all of its milk in Vermont with the intention of shipping it into Massachusetts. The milk produced in Vermont was delivered to the Company’s receiving station in Vermont and was then dumped, tested, weighed and cooled. The milk was then placed in cans and shipped into Massachusetts within forty-eight hours after its receipt by the Company. The Court said: ‘It is settled law that the purchase of a commodity in one state for the purpose oí transporting it to another state is a transaction in interstate commerce within the Commerce Clause of the Constitution and not subject to burdens imposed by state regulations. . . . The purchase is none the less a part of the interstate commerce because of the method of receiving deliveries adopted by the defendants.

This, however, does not permit a state to regulate or to place a burden upon interstate commerce, and the Court clearly indicated that the state statute there under consideration did not impose such burden. The Court said (page 847) : ‘We find no ground for concluding that the state requirements lay any actual burden upon interstate or foreign commerce. The Georgia Act does not attempt to fix the prices at auction sales or to regulate the activities of the purchasers. The fixing of reasonable maximum charges for the services of the ware-housemen in aid of the tobacco giwvers does not militate against any interest of those who buy. They pay the bid price, as accepted, and the warehouseman pays the seller, deducting from the purchase price the warehouse charges.’</p>

Here, if the defendant is subject to the control of the plaintiff, it would be required to pay the milk producers not the agreed price, .but the price fixed by the plaintiff. It would also be required to post a bond to secure payment to the producers of the prices fixed by the plaintiff and Avould be required to pay license fees. The cost of the milk to it <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>would be increased by tbe premium on tbe bond, by tbe license fee, and by the increase in price ordered by the plaintiff.

It also required a state supervisor to investigate and supervise the marketing of grain for the purpose of preventing various things which were deemed unjust and fraudulent, and authorized him to make rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of the Act. The Court said (page 915) : ‘We think it plain that, in subjecting the buying for interstate shipment to the conditions and measure of control just shown, the act directly interferes with and burdens interstate commerce, and is an attempt by the state to prescribe rules under which an important part of such commerce shall be conducted. This no state can do consistently with the commerce clause.’</p>

The effect of price fixing upon the price structure of producers in other states, however, is not the criterion. The test is whether the regulation and the price fixing amounts to a regulation of interstate commerce and places a burden upon it. If it does, it is beyond the power of the state and cannot be sustained. The effect of a state statute fixing prices as applied to a sale in interstate commerce is tersely stated by Justice Cardozo in <em>Highland Farms Dairy, Inc., v.

Payment for the tobacco is made to the warehouseman who deducts his charges and remits the balance to the sellers. The act had no relation whatever to the buying and selling of tobacco and was distinguished by the Supreme Court from the Farmers Grain Company cases by showing that the “Georgia Act lays no constraint upon purchases in interstate commerce, does not attempt to fix the prices or conditions of purchases, or the profit of the purchasers. It simply seeks to protect the tobacco growers from unreasonable charges of the warehousemen for their services to the growers in handling and selling the tobacco for their account.

In the latter cases the statutes sought to regulate the act of purchasing articles which were to be shipped in interstate commerce, and to prohibit such purchases unless made upon terms prescribed by the statute or by administrative agencies. It is not the milk-receiving plant operated by the defendant that the plaintiff seeks to regulate, but the business conducted by the defendant of buying and shipping milk.

Bonding is therefore related to this legitimate purpose, which is a proper exercise of the police power. Moreover, this Court has held' that the legislature may constitutionally require bonds in other industries affected with a public interest to secure payment to subcontractors, mechanics, laborers and materialmen, because of the very elements of fraud prevention, and the inability, otherwise, of those to be benefited to procure payment or credit.
