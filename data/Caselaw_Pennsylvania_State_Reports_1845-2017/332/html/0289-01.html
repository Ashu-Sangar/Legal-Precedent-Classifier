The pe<a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>tition presented to the Court of Quarter Sessions, which was the basis of its action, will be found in the Reporter’s Notes. The District Attorney did not personally, or through his office, make any investigation of the campaign charges, nor does he aver in his petition that he knew any of the charges to have a basis in fact. Whereupon the Governor of the Commonwealth and the Attorney General presented a petition to this Court in which it was averred that the effect of ordering the grand jury to investigate these combined charges would be to seriously interfere with and hamper the executive branch in its conduct of government, and that the charges were so vague and indefinite that an investigation predicated on them would enable the Grand Jury to pass upon not merely criminal violations, but the efficiency and regularity of the management of the entire executive department. It was also asserted that the Attorney General was the only official who could investigate these charges and that, under the Constitution and the law, a grand jury is not competent to investigate criminal charges aimed at the executive authority. Accordingly, a writ of prohibition was asked. On this petition we issued a rule to show cause and stayed proceedings until the further order of the Court.</p>
    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[275,1688,1154,755]]]'>The questions involved may be briefly stated to be: May the grand jury investigate the conduct of the executive branch of the State government? Are uninvestigated campaign charges (that is, uninvestigated by the District Attorney) a sufficient basis for convening a grand jury? May a grand jury be convened on a petition which does not charge the commission of any specific offenses, and does not allege the commission of any crime within the jurisdiction of the Dauphin County courts? Has the Attorney General exclusive authority to investigate the conduct of the executive branch of the government? Is the petition for a writ of prohibition premature because made prior to the charge of the court to the grand jury defining the scope of its investigation?</p>

They also assert that all charges will be speedily and fully investigated by them, and it was stated at the argument that the Attorney General has already taken up the investigation of the charges made and “to that end he has the full and unrestricted approval and consent of your petitioner, the Governor of the Commonwealth.”</p>

We also recognize the effect of <em>Hartranft’s Ap</em>peal, <a href="/pa/85/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="85 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="440472" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0433-01">85 Pa. 433</a>, that the official conduct of the executive branch of the government is not to be subjected to investigation by the judiciary. The mere fact a crime is charged in connection with, or as a result of, acts performed by the executive branch of government in its official capacity, is not sufficient to warrant the judiciary in undertaking to inquire broadly into the functioning of that branch. And, we may add, it is basic and fundamental in our system of government that the powers of the three coordinated branches of government are and should be separate and kept clear, the one from the other. The judicial branch cannot assume overlordship of the executive or legislative, or vice versa. In <em>Commonwealth v. Widovich, </em><a href="/pa/295/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="295 Pa. 311" data-case-ids="1115109" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0311-01">295 Pa. 311</a>, at 322, it was stated: “The judiciary is a constituent or coordinate part of government; it is not subordinate to other powers, nor does it depend for existence on the legislative will. Its powers come directly from the people, without intervening agency. From the very nature of its time-honored powers, it should be kept a separate, distinct and independent entity in government to perform those duties which have been immemorially under the common law imposed on it. The domain of the judiciary is in the field of the administration of justice under the law; it interprets, construes and applies the law. Its powers <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>were possibly tbe first to be exercised by civilization. Within the compass of its duties it may ascertain and punish crimes against the State, and may, at times, in designated instances, operate as a check on other departments of government; but its strength and security come from a complete and absolute separation from political, administrative or ministerial functions. While in essence it may restrain attempts on the life of the State, and therefore under the common law may protect the State, the judiciary does not assume, nor should it be burdened with, those functions of government which are political, administrative or ministerial, nor does it inter-meddle with the execution of these functions by the proper branches of government unless specifically required to do so by the Constitution. The legislative and executive branches should be, as they are, in a position actively to protect their delegated functions by the passage of an act like the one in question.”</p>

But we do not understand from the petition presented by the Governor that he claims immunity from arrest, prosecution and punishment if he violates the criminal statutes. We do not understand that the Attorney General or counsel for petitioners, in presenting this petition, make any such claim. Everyone knows, or should know, that no citizen of our State or public officer is above the law. All may be punished for criminal violations. As to public officials, this is the plain mandate of our Constitution. Section 3 of Article VI, in dealing with impeachment, states: “The Governor and all other civil officers shall be liable to impeachment for any misdemeanor in office . . .; the person accused, whether convicted or acquitted, shall nevertheless <em>be liable to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment according to laid” </em>If we were to hold that <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>tlie Governor and Ms official family were immune from criminal prosecution for any crime wMle in office, it would be possible for a corrupt government to bankrupt the State, and, when apprehended for trial, plead immunity. This never was the intention of the framers of our Constitution and we do not understand the Governor makes any such claim.</p>
    <p id="b431-3" data-blocks='[["BL_431.4",431,[183,778,1152,1076]]]'>We agree with the contention, however, that the wholesale investigation of the vague and indefinite charges contained in the District Attorney’s petition, in the form in which it is presented, would seriously obstruct the operation of the executive branch of the government. Here there are eight separate, distinct and unrelated charges involving different governmental agencies, all of which it is proposed to submit to unbounded investigation. This would lead to serious practical results. We do not hold that charges properly instituted, having as their purpose the development and exposure of a system of crime in office, cannot and should not be investigated by the grand jury under proper supervision. The immunity given the executive as to his official acts in <em>Hartranft’s Appeal </em>would not protect those subordinate officials against whom accusations of indictable offenses are made by the District Attorney from such an investigation, any more than that case would protect the Governor himself from indictment for violations of the criminal law.</p>

The Superior Court, in an opinion by President Judge Keelee, has held that production of records and documents in the hands of the executive cannot be compelled where the executive officer in the exercise of <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>Ms discretion determines that such disclosure would be injurious to the public service, or opposed to the best interests of the State <em>(Marks’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa-super/121/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="121 Pa.

    <p id="b432-4" data-blocks='[["BL_432.4",432,[269,593,1151,1409]]]'>Though the Attorney General is given wide powers by the Administrative Code of April 9, 1929, P. L. 177, sections 904 and 908, to investigate any violation of the law within the executive branch, such powers do not exclude an investigation by the grand jury on charges properly presented. <em>An investigation which properly concerns itself with violations of the criminal laws </em>in matters incidental to the conduct of government, and does not merely inquire into the official acts of the governing power, as in the <em>Hartranft </em>case, is within the power of the grand jury. But the Attorney General, with his vast powers, recognized by this Court in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. v. Margiotti, </em><a href="/pa/325/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="325 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1172312" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0017-01">325 Pa. 17</a>, may supplement and supervise the grand jury in any investigation; he may, — and it is his duty to do so if he believes the government is to be hindered in the lawful conduct of its affairs to the detriment of the security, peace and good order of the State, — supersede the District Attorney in the conduct of the entire investigation; or he may, if he believes better results will be obtained, act in conjunction with the District Attorney. We therefore conclude that the Attorney General’s investigatorial powers may be supplementary to or merged with those of the grand jury, and may, if advisable, be coordinated in one investigation before the grand jury under his supervision.</p>

Before reflection is cast upon the integrity of public officials a preliminary investigation by the forces of law charged with the discovery of crime should be made to determine whether there is any real foundation. Such jury investigations involve great expense to the public, subject the citizen to inconvenience and frequently interfere with the normal functioning of public officials and bodies brought before it. They throw a cloud of suspicion upon the parties subject to attack and undermine public confidence in them. There must be a sound, solid basis on which to proceed.” See also <em>Commonwealth v.

It is urged that this Court cannot pass upon the lawfulness of the investigation until the court below has given it in charge to the grand jury, because the <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>charge may limit and restrict the scope to matters less extensive than those outlined in the petition. It is sufficient answer to this contention to say that this proceeding was begun on the written suggestion of the District Attorney, and that the grand jury was called upon the information presented in his petition. If the petition does not present matters sufficient to justify the investigation, or disclose matters within the jurisdiction of the court, the call could not lawfully have been made. That is the only question before the Court. Furthermore, the court below convened the grand jury “to investigate and inquire into all matters set forth in the said petition, and any other matters which may properly come before it, <em>including the investigation of any other unlawful conduct on the part of any public official or person within the jurisdiction of this Court, </em>...” The call, in itself, is for an investigation more sweeping and unrestricted than the petition seeks.</p>

Generally speaking, and this observation applies to each and every one of the eight charges made in the petition, they are vague, uncertain and indefinite, and, as we stated above, an investigation based thereon, if permitted to be carried through as intended, would hinder the State government and possibly cripple its functioning. But charges properly instituted, in accordance with the essential requisites we have outlined and will discuss more fully, would safeguard the State’s interests, and should cause no such hindrance. All of the charges in the petition are subject to fatal defects, now to be mentioned, and no indictment predicated on the petition could stand. There is not a single allegation in any of the eight charges of the time when, and the place where, the alleged violations of the law were committed. There is no suggestion that any one was committed within the jurisdiction of the Court of Quar<a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>ter Sessions of Dauphin County. While petitions of this character need not set forth in detail the evidence on which they rely, we stated in <em>McNair’s Petition, </em>and we wish to reiterate it here, there must be at least one specific crime charged as part of a system of related crimes for the discovery of which it is necessary to have the grand jury’s assistance. Each of these eight independent charges, covering as they do unrelated offenses, should be treated by separate investigations, though made by one grand jury, and each should set forth definitely one or more cognate crimes, with the parties thereto, forming part of a system of crime, on which to buttress the particular investigation. A grand jury should not be called to investigate one crime alone; that is for the police and magistrates. But, if the crime set forth is part of a system of crime, all may be investigated. As far as every one of these charges is concerned, it is admitted that, beyond the conference with the former Attorney General, the District Attorney has made no independent investigation whatsoever as to their truth.</p>

The charge omits the essential designation of the time and place of the transactions to bring it within the jurisdiction of the Dauphin County court. The omission of the time at which they occurred is very important because, from the arguments presented, if there was a crime it would be barred by the statute of limitations. See <em>Commonwealth v. Bartilson, </em><a href="/pa/85/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="85 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="440528" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0482-01">85 Pa. 482</a>; <em>Commonwealth v.

Furthermore, the acts here alleged did not constitute criminal offenses under any statute of the Commonwealth or at the common law. It is not <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>stated that the cabinet officers bribed, or improperly and unlawfully solicited or attempted to solicit, any members of the General Assembly, at Harrisburg or elsewhere, and we cannot infer that they did. No specific legislator is named to whom they talked or attempted to influence. There is no accusation that these persons in exercising their influence did so improperly or for corrupt purposes. None of the officers charged with these acts are members of the State Legislature. In other words, this accusation is broad enough to apply to any person, lawyer or another, who is paid a fee to address a legislative committee to influence it properly in passing certain legislation. The District Attorney states in his brief that it may not have been an indictable offense for representatives of brewery associations to pay money to these persons in return for their influence, but then attempts by inference to adduce certain criminal conduct which does not appear anywhere in the proceedings in this case. The charge as it stands does not set up an indictable offense.</p>
    <p id="b436-4" data-blocks='[["BL_436.4",436,[304,1466,1151,974]],["BL_437.1",437,[197,384,1154,1513]]]'>Charge (b) concerns irregularities in the purchase of asphalt, trucks for highway use, and Kentucky rock, as appears in the appended petition. Again the charge does not specify the time or place where any of these alleged irregularities occurred. No specific criminal offense is charged. The District Attorney attempts to bring the transactions within the general conspiracy provision of Section 128 of the Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 382. As the Administrative Code provides that all State purchases must be made through the Department of Property and Supplies, to make the conspiracy complete some individual connected with that department and who controlled these purchases should be implicated. No such official is named as being a party to these alleged transactions. No vendor is designated, nor information given of a single transaction in which anybody paid any money to the parties named. Moreover, such official purchases must be made according to <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>plans and standard specifications, with tlie consent of the Commissioners of Public Grounds and Buildings; bids must be taken and contracts awarded to the lowest bidders, yet there is not a specific allegation here that there was a violation of any one of these requirements. Not a single irregularity is mentioned. The law requires contracts to go to the lowest and best bidder. It should appear how or what sort of influence was to be asserted to corruptly solicit the officer and cheat the Commonwealth. The charge itself fails to allege a conspiracy, and it lacks the elements of the crime. See <em>Commomoealth v. Routley, </em><a href="/pa/318/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="318 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1159653" data-case-paths="/pa/318/0465-01">318 Pa. 465</a>. However that may be, if there is a specific accusation leveled at some officer of the government and some vendor of these materials and supplies, and persons are named to whom money passed for the purpose of corrupt solicitation to cheat and defraud the government, the door is open to investigate the charges arising therefrom. If one such specific offense within the jurisdiction of the court is set forth, with the essential allegations of fraud and corruption, and this is alleged as part of a system of crime committed or in the process of commission, such a foothold obtained would warrant a general investigation into the conduct of this department of the government in its purchases. But there should and must be a specific charge or charges, with all the elements stated above, to ground a grand jury investigation as decided in <em>McNair’s Petition.</em>

The General State Authority operates throughout the State and there should have been a specific offense charged within the court’s jurisdiction of some conspiracy by the contractor and the General State Authority to cheat and defraud the Commonwealth. Furthermore, before a grand jury could investigate this single crime it should be further averred, that it was part of a system of other criminal violations of the law to cheat and to defraud the State in Dauphin County, as relates to the contracts there being performed, and that the aid of the grand jury is necessary to expose these other related criminal acts. But, of a more important nature, here there is no allegation that the unlawful irregularities or relationships were criminal. Acts or work done under a contract may be contrary to the plans and specifications; it may be defective, irregular work, still such acts need not be criminal. The charge is fatally defective.</p>

It is conceded that it is not unlawful for a public officer to borrow money from an individual, unless the loan when made definitely relates to and is proven to be connected with an unlawful solicitation to defraud the State. There is not the slightest allegation that anything like this occurred.

No investigation could lawfully be predicated on such hearsay suspicion.</p>

The charges leave completely unanswered the question of where, in the length and breadth of the State, these acts occurred, and yet the answer to this question is determinative of the jurisdiction of the Dauphin County court. The petition as to these charges is fatally defective because under the law as it now exists no crime is charged. The charges were drawn with reference to the Acts of June 13, 1883, P. L. 96, and July 15, 1897, P. L. 275. These Acts definitely relate to elections and to campaign contributions, and are specifically and absolutely repealed by the Act of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1333, Section 1901, at P. L. 1508 and 1513. These Acts were highly important as a means of preventing forcible contributions from State employees for election purposes by political parties. Laws which regulate matters pertaining to, or incidental to, the conduct of elections, are election laws. See <em>In re Moskowitz, </em>26 D. &amp; C. 567. The title of the Act of 1937 is unquestionably broad enough to cover the repeal of these and any other Acts “relating to elections.” Their repeal was deliberate and intended, and there is nothing in the new Election Code which provides a substitute for them, nor are there any offenses thereby created which approximate the charges in this <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>petition.

The course of such investigations must be clearly marked within the proper limits of the jurisdiction of the court. The crimes to be investigated must have been committed in the county where the investigation is held. The grand jury of course may indict any public officer or other person for any crime he is charged with having committed. To ground the inquiry there must not be the mere charge of crime by an individual, but there must be, in the opinion of the District Attorney and the court, evidence on hand of actual crime sufficient to <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>promise the assurance of one conviction for each of the particular offenses charged.

These charges were made by a man who until April 27th last had been for forty months Attorney General of this State. This request the three judges of that court, after due consideration, unanimously assented to, declaring in an official return to this court that the charges “amount to malfeasance in office, bribery and conspiracy to cheat and defraud the Commonwealth.” These judges further averred that to stop this investigation “would be serious to the best interests of the state.” In the face of this return, this court <em>has </em>stopped this investigation. It is true that the order filed says that “leave is granted to amend or supplement it [the district attorney’s petition] within twenty days . . . and unless so amended the writ of prohibition Avill be directed to issue.” Whether the petition can be amended so as to satisfy the requirements of the majority opinion, remains to be seen. The fact is that the proposed investigation is <em>stopped now </em>and a Avrit of prohibition <em>may </em>issue in twenty days. The order made by this court is, under <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>the facts stated, unprecedented, and any attempt to find warrant for it in either authority or reason is, in my judgment, a fruitless quest.</p>
    <p id="b443-3" data-blocks='[["BL_443.4",443,[150,542,1154,1307]]]'>I consider the question raised by the Governor’s petition, to prohibit the proposed grand jury investigation, one of the most important ever presented to this court in its 216 years of history. Since I am convinced that the decision of the majority is erroneous, my duty to dissent is clear. In 1923, the late Alexander Simpson, then and for many years thereafter a member of this court, writing on “Dissenting Opinions” for the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, Vol. 71, page 205, at page 217, said: “If a judge is fully convinced, after a careful review of the matter, that the decision of the majority will wrongfully affect the citizens generally, or establish a precedent which will deprive other litigants of any of their constitutional, statutory or common law rights, he is not justified, even though he stands alone, in silently submitting to the opinion of his colleagues, however great they may be; for not infrequently by such insidious approaches great rights are minimized and finally destroyed.” My view is that if the majority opinion is henceforth to be the law of this State, the immemorial rights of the people to have charges of wrong done to the body-politic by public officials and others, investigated by a grand jury, will in practical effect be minimized almost to the point of destruction.</p>

My answer to the question thus posed by the majority is that the district attorney and the judges of Dauphin County <em>nowhere asserted </em>any intention to have investigated <em>the executive branch of the State government. </em>On the contrary, they proposed to have the <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>grand jury investigate, as they declared, <em>“unlawful </em>and <em>improper conduct </em>on the part of public officials and of others affecting the interests of the Commonwealth.” An official’s <em>unlawful </em>conduct cannot be his <em>official </em>conduct; when any official’s conduct is unlawful <em>it ceases to be official. </em>If a chief executive of this State or Nation should, for example, commit a crime, that crime is his <em>private, </em>not his <em>official </em>act, and he is as much amenable to the criminal law for that crime as is the most obscure citizen of the land. In 1921 the then Governor of Illinois was tried in the criminal courts of his state on a charge of criminal conspiracy. The charge against him resulted from a grand jury investigation ordered by a local, or district court. See <em>People v. Small, </em><a href="/ill/319/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="319 Ill. 437" data-case-ids="5155364" data-case-paths="/ill/319/0437-01">319 Ill. 437</a>. (In fairness it should be stated that no charges of criminal wrongdoing have been made against the Governor of <em>this </em>State. The charges of criminal wrongdoing are made against others.) Furthermore, some of the persons whose allegedly unlawful acts the District Attorney and Judges of Dauphin County proposed to have the grand jury investigate were not even in public office, but were private citizens who, it is claimed, had unlawful dealings with certain members of the governor’s cabinet.</p>

My answer to that question is that <em>it is the right </em>of a district attorney, if the district court consents, as it did here, to have a grand jury assist him in the investigation of allegations of criminal acts affecting the public and committed in whole or in part in his county. He is under no duty of <em>preliminarily </em>investigating these allegations, and, in fact, he has no <em>adequate </em>means of mating such an investigation other than with a grand jury.</p>

The very purpose of a grand jury investigation is to determine <em>whether or not </em>criminal offenses have been committed. If a district attorney Avas already in possession of facts justifying <em>the charge </em>by him of criminal offenses, a grand jury investigation would be merely an expensive superfluity. The district attorney’s petition <em>does </em>aver that “grave and serious charges have been made by Charles J. Margiotti [former Attorney General] and others concerning the conduct of certain public officials and others.” Some of these charges he enumerates. The Court of Quarter Sessions of Dauphin County characterizes the acts publicly charged as, “if true, malfeasance in office, bribery and conspiracy to cheat and defraud the Commonwealth.” What the three judges of Dauphin County think as to the substantiality of these charges is shown (1) by what they say in their official return to this court and (2) by the fact that they unanimously summoned the grand jury to investigate these charges.</p>

The details of the charges as given to us clearly show a number of instances of violations of law within Dauphin County.”</p>

If they were barred by the Statute of Limitations, the Court of Quarter Sessions would, of course, instruct the grand jury when their presentment was made that indictments should not be returned for offenses barred by the Statute of Limitations. I think if the crimes charged were committed, the grand jury of Dauphin County should <em>acquaint the people of this State with the facts, </em>whether convictions for the crimes were barred by the Statute of Limitations or not.</p>
    <p id="b446-4" data-blocks='[["BL_446.4",446,[283,1096,1157,1136]]]'>I also entirely disagree with the following statement contained in the majority opinion: “The wholesale investigation of the vague and indefinite charges contained in the District Attorney’s petition, in the form in which it is presented would seriously obstruct the operation of the executive branch of the government.” I do not, and the Judges of Dauphin County do not, regard the charges as “vague and indefinite,” and the assertion, or at least implication, that an investigation of-the serious charges presented by this record “would seriously obstruct the operation of the executive branch of the government is in itself a most damning indictment of the branch of government referred to. Before any government can in <em>any </em>of its branches be seriously obstructed by an investigation of wrong-doing in respect to that branch, the wrong-doing must have permeated that branch so thoroughly that to excise it or even to investigate it, would constitute a critical, if not fatal, major operation. If that is the situation in any branch of our State government, it is time that the citizens of this Commonwealth should become apprised of the fact.</p>

The writ of prohibition was not issued until <em>after </em>the judge had charged the jury, and the <em>non-criminal nature of the subject matter of the inquiry was thereby made manifest. </em>In that case the district attorney admitted in this court, as recorded on page 63 of this court’s opinion in that case, that “he expected to uncover <em>no </em>evidence of corruption.” We held that “it was not the function of Judge Smith ... to supervise or criticize” the disposition by magistrates of certain minor cases. “The use of the grand jury as an inquisitorial body is to be limited,” this court said, “to the investigation of criminal conduct and is not to be extended to the review of judicial discretion.” This court also declared: “As it <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>was admitted there was no bad faith and the mistake was an error of judgment, neither the district attorney nor the grand jury under such conditions could impose criminal liability.” The charges in the instant case which the Dauphin County Court judges ordered investigated cannot be designated as mere “errors of judgment.” We have before us the petition of the District Attorney charging acts which, if true (as already noted) “amount [as the court below said] to malfeasance in office, bribery and conspiracy to cheat and defraud the Commonwealth.”</p>

No such requirement has ever hitherto been laid down by any court in this Commonwealth. This basic error in the majority opinion becomes manifest when excerpts from that opinion are compared with the language of jurists whose opinions have been respected and followed for over a century. For example, the majority opinion says: “Its [the court’s] sole concern is with the legal sufficiency of the petition to warrant a grand jury investigation of the executive branch of the government. . . . To ground the inquiry there must not be the mere charge of crime by an individual, but there must be, in the opinion of the District Attorney and the court, sufficient evidence on hand of actual crime upon which to find at least one conviction.” Not a single case is cited for the novel proposition thus put forward in the majority opinion and I assert with confidence that no precedent for it can be found in the annals of any American or British court of justice. On the contrary, our courts have time and time again enunciated a doctrine exactly to the contrary.</p>

Every department of government in this country is administered by individaals about whom no “divinity hedges,” as divinity was once supposed to “hedge a king.” When any of these individaals who administer' any part of oar government are charged with personal wrong-doing they are as mach amenable to the criminal courts as are the humblest citizens of the land.

That case has no relevancy whatever to the issue here. In that case the Supreme Court refused to permit the Court of Quarter Sessions of Allegheny County to issue an attachment for contempt against the Governor and his Adjutant-General because they refused to appear before the grand jury of that county to testify in respect to riots which had taken place in Pittsburgh in July, 1877, and in the suppression of which by the National Guard under the command of the Governor, a number of soldiers and other persons were killed and wounded. The Governor and his Adjutant-General refused to appear to testify on the ground that they had no knowledge of the riots except what they had learned in their official capacities and they declared that “an examination into their acts in connection with said riots would be detrimental to the public service,” that they were then “in constant correspondence with the army in the field in the riotous regions of the state, and in daily expectation of being required at the front, and to be called to a distant county would endanger the interests of the public service.” This court held, <em>and this is all it held in that case, </em>(1) that the propriety of the governor’s withholding the information (which obviously was <em>official </em>information) required by the grand jury was for the governor himself to determine, and (2) whether his duties at the seat of government at Harrisburg were such that at the time he was subpoenaed to appear in a distant part of the state, he could not without endanger<a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>ing the interest of the public service so appear and testify, was a matter for himself alone to determine. This court said: “Is obedience to a subpoena one of his [the governor’s] duties, and if so, shall he discharge that duty in preference to that which rests upon him' as commander-in-chief?” It decided that the governor himself must choose which of two mutually (at the time) interfering duties he should discharge. There is not in the opinion in that case even the slightest intimation that the executive department of the government could not be subjected to a grand jury investigation. <em>On the contrary, </em>this court said in its opinion in that case: “Neither is there any doubt about the power of the court to direct that body to make inquiry concerning affairs which directly affect the public peace and society.” If in the <em>Hartranft Case, </em>the governor had tried, as here, to prohibit a grand jury investigation of alleged crimes committed by public officials and by others, because he, the governor, preferred to have the alleged crimes investigated by his subordinate, the Attorney General, we would have a state of facts exactly like the state of facts here, but <em>no such thing </em>occurred in the <em>Hartranft Case, </em>as any lawyer or layman can quickly determine by simply reading the report of that case. I again repeat: the stopping of this grand jury investigation is without precedent in the history of Pennsylvania. No other governor and no other person ever asked for any such thing and no other court ever granted any such thing. Many judges of state and nation have been investigated by a coordinate branch of the government, to wit, the legislature, and these investigations have sometimes resulted in the impeachment and removal of judges. No court ever granted a writ of prohibition to attempt to stop such an investigation.</p>

The absurdity of this proposition is so palpably obvious that no argumentative refutation is called for. No one ever attempted before to give any such interpretation to the above cited Act of 1806. That act simply means that where a statutory enactment <em>completely covers </em>a field formerly occupied by the common law, the common law procedure is ousted from that field. Section 904 of the Administrative Code of 1929 does not even purport to <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>cover tlie investigating field occupied for ages by grand juries. The Attorney General by the Act of 1929 is given a power to investigate alleged crimes, very much as policemen and detectives are given power to investigate alleged crimes. In furtherance of his investigation, he can also issue subpoenas, requiring the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and papers for examination. A fire marshal and each of his assistants in their investigation of fires have exactly the same power under section 8 of the Act of June 8, 1911, P. L. 705 (53 PS 3598), to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and papers for examination, but no fire marshal or his assistant has as yet claimed that the investigating power conferred upon him ipso facto takes away all power of grand juries to investigate fires of suspicious origin. The fire marshal and his assistants cannot find presentments or return indictments. Neither can the Attorney General. Grand juries can. The field occupied by grand juries is no more invaded by the Administrative Code than it is by the fire marshal statute cited.</p>

If the legislature attempted to take away such power from grand juries, it would find the Constitution standing immovably in its pathway. Section 1 of Article V of the Constitution vests the judicial power of the Commonwealth in the courts therein enumerated, among these courts enumerated are “courts of quarter sessions.” An indispensable instrumentality of a court of quarter sessions is a grand jury, and our state legislature is powerless to take away or interfere with immemorial functions of a grand jury.

Thus far, the power is implied, and is as legitimate as if expressly given.” James Wilson, already referred to in this opinion, said of grand juries (Wilson’s Works, Vol. 2, p. 214) : “All the operations of government, and of its ministers and officers, are within the compass of their view and research.” I will not be a party to obstructing their view or prohibiting their research.</p>

If a price is being paid for the enactment of legislation at the State Capitol, citizens of the Commonwealth ought to know it and the obviously appropriate way to find out is through a grand jury investigation in the county where the seat of government is located, under the supervision of the Court of Quarter Sessions of that county, consisting of three judges known throughout the Commonwealth for their integrity, ability and impartiality.</p>

If it occurred anywhere else, the grand jury can find out where it did occur and the matter can then be referred to the criminal court of the proper county. The judges of the courts of Dauphin County aver in their return: “The details of the charges as given to us clearly show a number of instances of violation of law within Dauphin County.” The petitioners also say that “the charge, as made, is absurd on its face.” This is not a very convincing statement. If the charge made is false, those charged ought to be eager to have its falsity proclaimed by a grand jury. As to the other charges, it is sufficient to say that the three judges and the District Attorney of Dauphin County all declared that they “amount to malfeasance in office, bribery and conspiracy to cheat and defraud the Commonwealth.”</p>

All investigations are “fishing expeditions,” and often the yield of “fish,” big and small, is large enough to show that the expedition was fully justified. Neither in the piscatorial precepts of Izaak Walton nor in the fishing rules of this Commonwealth is there to be found any requirement that before citizens may lawfully fish in any waters they must furnish advance proof of the existence of fish in those particular waters and identify at least some of them. Any such foolish requirement would fatally cripple a time-honored and entirely legitimate industry. In a case decided five years ago <em>In Re Grand Jury </em>Proceedings, 4 Fed.

What the majority now prescribe as <em>conditions precedent </em>to a grand jury investigation have been for ages the <em>fruits </em>of grand jury investigations. In <em>Hendricks v. United States, </em><a href="/us/223/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="223 U.S. 178" data-case-ids="3662868" data-case-paths="/us/223/0178-01">223 U. S. 178</a>, 184, the Supreme Court of the United States said that the identity of the offender, and the precise nature of the offense, if there be one, normally are developed at the conclusion of the grand jury’s labors, not at the beginning. The dictum which appears in a footnote on page 61 of the opinion in <em>McNair’s Petition </em>(supra), that “in all cases where investigations have been ordered or refused, written formal charges have been made with a definite crime in evidence” and that “all concerned the criminal conduct of public officers,” is simply <em>not the fact. </em>The writer of this opinion knows from his experience both as district attorney and as judge in a populous county and from his knowledge of the practice in other counties that grand jury investigations are usually ordered by the courts without any written formal charges being first made, and the alleged criminal misconduct <em>both </em>of <em>public </em>officers and <em>private </em>citizens is <em>equally </em>subject to investigation. The object of such investigations is generally the uncovering of crimes <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>which <em>primarily injure the public at large. </em>Such is manifestly the object of the investigation the judges of Dauphin County ordered in the instant case. Whether the information which moved the judges of the court below to act came from “trustworthy sources,” those judges were in better position than we are to determine. The very fact that the judges considered the information sufficiently trustworthy to justify a grand jury investigation, <em>should be </em>conclusive, as hitherto it always has been, on the question of the propriety of their act. This court said two years ago in <em>McNair’s Petition </em>(supra) : “Criminal acts which seriously affect or injure the public generally . . . require immediate attention so that these evils may be suppressed.”</p>

To attempt to prevent an investigation of such charges as have been made in this case is as futile as an attempt to put a lid on a volcano. Innocent men have no reason to fear a grand jury investigation and when wrongfully accused they should demand it, as army officers, when wrongfully accused, demand a court of inquiry. The lid should be lifted and the light turned on. A great Pennsylvania judge in a memorable charge <em>(Addison Appeal, </em>page 47), said: “Grand juries are watchmen, stationed by the laws, to survey the conduct of their fellow citizens, and inquire where and by whom public authority has been violated, or our constitution or laws infringed.” I would let the Dauphin County “watchmen” go to work <em>at once.</em>

    <p id="b473-6" data-blocks='[["BL_473.7",473,[176,927,1152,526]]]'>The judges of Dauphin County have been justly proud of the fine record of the Court which they inherited and which they have most zealously striven to maintain. We think it hardly necessary to deny to the Supreme Court the unethical and untruthful statements made as above quoted as to the political-mindedness of the judges of the Dauphin County Court, because we think the Supreme Court is familiar with the fact that no politics has ever entered into the determination of any question in our Court.</p>
    <p id="b473-7" data-blocks='[["BL_473.8",473,[176,1474,1153,363]]]'>As to the statement that the first and second petitions of the District Attorney were accepted by us “at once and without study,” our return filed in your Court to the Rule granted on the first petition shows that we made careful inquiry and gave it due consideration; and as to the second, we emphatically deny the Governor’s statement.</p>

Under the Act of March 18, 1875, P. L. 28, if we had summoned the Grand Jury of the March Term then existing, that jury could have sat only one week into the June Term which began May 31, 1938, and in all probability no sufficient investigation could have been properly conducted within that time. Therefore, after careful consideration, we concluded that the June Grand Jury should, as provided by law, be summoned before the beginning of the term. As above quoted, the Governor has attempted to impute to us political considera<a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>tions by analyzing tbe political affiliations of tbe two grand juries. A Grand Jury and every jury is drawn, in tliis county, as every informed person knows, by the Sheriff and the Democratic and Republican Jury Commissioners acting together, in which the Court takes no part. It is hardly necessary to say that we did not know, and do not now know, anything about the political affiliations of these grand jurors; that we never knew anything about the political affiliations of any grand jury or any other jury and we, happily, are able to think that no other judge in this Commonwealth ever made an investigation to ascertain such a fact.</p>
    <p id="b474-4" data-blocks='[["BL_474.4",474,[292,1038,1150,917]]]'>Through our years of service there have been a feAV instances where we learned that some humble litigant imagined that he might not get an impartial trial before one of us and uniformly, when such matter was made known to us, without weighing the vagaries of such imagination, we have seen to it that another judge was assigned in such a case. It now appears that the Governor of this Commonwealth thinks that any trials which might be the outcome of the Grand Jury Investigation could not be fairly conducted by any of the judges of Dauphin County, and therefore, umvarranted and unfounded as the suspicion is, we earnestly request that the Supreme Court at once assign another judge to take entire control of the Avhole matter, including the consideration of any preliminary questions; the charge of the Grand Jury if convened, and conduct the trials, if any, that may be necessary.</p>
