Margiotti and Edward Friedman from testifying before the legislative committee, and also impounds documentary evidence, must be and it is hereby vacated and set aside, because of lack of power in the court to make it. The information given to the District Attorney and others named in this order is not privileged in the sense that the witnesses may not be required to divulge it on the ground of privileged communications as argued; nor may the documentary evidence be impounded beyond the reach of the legislative committee.</p>

The importance of this question before us cannot be overestimated, as it involves an examination <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>of the fundamentals of our form of government and the entire doctrine of the separation of powers lodged in the three coordinate divisions thereof, judicial, legislative and executive, each of which must be supreme within its allotted field if our form of government is to endure; the boundaries necessarily to be determined by the Supreme Court.</p>

    <p id="b479-4" data-blocks='[["BL_479.5",479,[184,871,1152,1135]]]'>The constitution provides in Article VI, section 1, that “The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment.” This plain language makes the power plenary within constitutional limits, that is to say, “for any misdemeanor in office,” which is a criminal act in the course of the conduct of the office, to which impeachments are limited. For crimes not misdemeanors in office, impeachment cannot be brought. This is the clear wording of section 3 of Article VI, which reads, “The Governor and all other civil officers shall be liable to impeachment for any misdemeanor in office.” Therefore, the courts have no jurisdiction in impeachment proceedings, and no control over their conduct, so long as actions taken are within constitutional lines. It follows from this, that the courts cannot prohibit a witness from testifying before a legislative committee, which is conducting an investigation under Act 2, not here in question, to determine whether civil officers shall be proceeded against by impeachment. The courts cannot stay the legislature and the witnesses named are subject to call by the legislative committee at any time.</p>

This power is plenary in the courts. The legislature can only remove from office and disqualify from holding <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>office because tbe section named also provides “judgment in such cases [of impeachment] shall not extend further than to removal from office and disqualification to hold any office of trust or profit under this Commonwealth.”</p>

May the legislature stay the judicial hand until the legislature has completed its investigation, or may the two coordinate branches of government, legislative and judicial, concurrently proceed, each free from trammel or interference by the other? The solution of this problem is of the utmost gravity and should be arrived at, only after the most thorough investigation, study and consideration, to the end that there shall be no unseemly conflict between the two branches of government, the legislative and judicial, and a breakdown in its orderly administration./ The further question whether the Attorney General'may supersede the District Attorney will be passed upon when we decide the main question. Upon these reserved questions, the Court will, after further necessary deliberation, hand down its opinion as soon as a decision can be reached.</p>

The district attorney answers the contention by saying that the court of quarter sessions also derives its power from the constitution (Article V, section 1) ; that the power of the grand jury to find true bills of indictment is preserved by the Declaration of Rights (Article I of the constitution) and that the power to impeach, conferred by Article VI, not having been expressly declared to be superior to the powers conferred in Article I, cannot, by implication, be held to limit the power of the quarter sessions to direct a grand jury investigation or to halt the pending proceeding in that court.</p>

The right of the people to be protected against crime and their opportunity of ascertaining and punishing the criminal, as well as the criminal’s right (except where by leave of court he may be proceeded against for oppression or misdemeanor in office) is therefore not only as fully recognized in the constitution as the power to impeach civil officers is recognized, but, as it appears in the Declaration of Rights, may furnish some ground for argument that it has precedence over the impeachment power, a point not now necessary to be determined.</p>

The delegation to the House of Representatives of the sole power of impeachment did not have the effect of depriving the court of its power to continue the investigation in the existing proceeding of crimes constituting misdemeanor in office. This is emphasized by the provision in section 3 of the sixth article that “the person accused [in impeachment proceedings], whether convicted or acquitted, shall nevertheless be liable to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment according to law.” The two proceedings are independent of- each other and, as the Declaration of Rights shows, were intended to be kept independent proceedings. The <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>provision that the accused shall be liable to indictment “whether convicted or acquitted” does not require halting criminal proceedings until after the impeachment. The provision was probably inserted so that there might be no doubt that the result of a trial in either proceeding should not be a bar to the trial in the other.. Petitioner refers to the corresponding provision of the federal constitution and quotes from number LXV of The Federalist, to support the argument that the impeachment trial should precede the'criminal proceeding. But the federal constitution deals only with conviction, not with conviction or acquittal: “But the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment according to law.” Our constitution subjects the accused to prosecution regardless of whether “convicted or acquitted” in the impeachment trial, thereby indicating that, as the result of the impeachment trial should be immaterial in its effect on the criminal trial, there would be no reason for delaying the criminal proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b489-3" data-blocks='[["BL_489.4",489,[180,1487,1154,262]]]'>We are also impressed with the point that the framers of the constitution cannot have intended that the power of indictment should be suspended until after the conclusion of the impeachment trial because, during the resulting delay, the period of limitation would be running.</p>

It was said in argu-' ment that if the investigations were carried on at the same time they might seriously conflict with each other. We are reluctant to accept that statement and may perhaps venture to predict that responsible persons to whom these investigations are intrusted by the law, will conduct themselves with that restraint required, and to be expected, of persons engaged in the administration of <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>public duties of great importance and that they will exercise such comity as will enable their respective duties to be performed without unnecessary friction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

In such circumstances it is the duty of this Court, recognized for more than a hundred years, to determine which of the two constitutional contentions is sound. This duty must of course be performed with due regard to the right of the legislature to exercise the powers delegated to it by the constitution. The applicable principles have frequently been applied and cannot now be disputed. They were stated by Gibson, C. J., in <em>De Chastellux v. </em>Fairchild, <a href="/pa/15/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="15 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="408770" data-case-paths="/pa/15/0018-01">15 Pa. 18</a>, 20 (1850), a case in which the legislature had directed that a new trial should be granted! in a particular case, the grant of a new' trial being, of! course, only one of many ways of attempting to exercise' a judicial power vested solely in the courts. He said: “If anything is self-evident in the structure of our government, it is, that the legislature has no power to order a new trial, or to direct the court to order it, either before or after judgment. The power to order new trials is judicial; but the power of the legislature is not judicial. It is limited to the making of laws; not to the exposition or execution of them. The functions of the several parts of the government are thoroughly separated, and distinctly assigned to the principal branches <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>of it, the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary, which, within their respective departments, are equal and coordinate. . . . It is idle to say the authority of each branch is defined and limited in the constitution, if there be not an independent power able and willing to enforce the limitations.”</p>
    <p id="AhX" data-blocks='[["BL_491.4",491,[180,697,1153,1687]]]'>We are of course mindful of the rule that a statute may not be declared unconstitutional unless there is no doubt of it. But the Act is not a mere exercise of a legislative power to deal with jurisdiction or procedure (compare <em>Com. v. Ramsey, </em><a href="/pa-super/42/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="42 Pa. Super. 25" data-case-ids="412540" data-case-paths="/pa-super/42/0025-01">42 Pa. Superior Ct. 25</a>, 37, 38) but is a deprivation of the exercise of a judicial power vested in the court by the constitution; the legislature cannot abolish the grand jury. There can be no doubt that the delegation to the House of Representatives of the sole power of impeachment of civil officers does not in express words, and cannot be said to have been intended to, confer authority on the legislature to take from the quarter sessions its immemorially exercised power to use the grand jury in the respect challenged.
