A large portion of the funds invested in these properties was raised by the sale of bonds; in the case of the water system the amount so raised was $44,-985,000 and in the case of the sewer system the amount was $40,409,838. A large part of the cost of the sewer system was also raised by assessments against adjacent property owners. The City at present does not make any charge for the use of the sewer system. However, it does make a charge for water supply. For the years 1930 to 1937, inclusive, the average annual gross revenue from the water supply system was $6,715,124.91, the average annual operating expenses were $2,506,332.70, the average annual earnings in excess of operating expenses were $4,208,792.21. The average payment of interest and Sinking Fund charges on the water debt was $1,538,934, leaving an average annual net revenue of $2,669,858.21. For 1937 the net revenue was approximately $3,500,000.</p>

The grants applied for are for 45% of the total amount, i. e., $27,000,000. The balance of $33,000,000 is to be supplied by the Authority and to be secured by it by a loan evidenced by the bonds of the Authority.</p>

L. 739, provides: “When any Authority shall have finally paid and discharged all bonds which, together with the interest due thereon, shall have been secured by a pledge of any of the revenues or receipts of a project, it may (subject to any agreements concerning the operation or disposition of such project) convey such project to the municipality.” This section also provides that when the Authority shall have paid all its debts “it may convey all its property to the municipality and terminate its existence,” and that when the Authority files a certificate of termination, if the certificate is approved by the municipality creating the Authority, the same shall be recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds of the county and “thereupon the property of the Authority shall pass to the municipality . . . and the Authority shall cease to exist.” Amended section 18 of the Act provides: “If a project shall have been established under this act by a board appointed by a municipality or municipalities, which project is of a character which the municipality or municipalities have power to establish, maintain, or operate, and such municipality or municipalities desire to acquire the same, it or they may by appropriate resolution or ordinance, adopted by the proper Authorities, signify its or their desire to do so, and thereupon the Authorities shall convey by appropriate instrument said project to such municipality, or municipalities, upon the assumption by the latter of all the obligations incurred by the Authorities with respect to that project.” This section makes it clear that the City of Philadelphia may secure the reconveyance to itself of the projects now under review upon its desire so to do, followed by appropriate action and the assumption of the projects’ obligations.</p>

The City intends to impose a charge on the users of its sewer facilities. The proposed agreement between the Authority and the City provides, inter alia, as follows: “The City shall charge and collect water rentals from the consumers of water and may also charge and collect sewer rentals or charges from the users of the sewers. The total of the rentals . . . for water and for sewers . . . will be sufficient to pay the operating and maintenance costs of the water supply works and system and the sewers . . . [each year] and 133% per cent of the rental payable under the terms of the lease in that year.” It is understood that the City <em>will </em>impose an adequate charge for sewerage service. This charge, together with the charge for water, will make the project self-liquidating. Since it is self-liquidating, it will add nothing to the City’s indebtedness.</p>

L. 1773, as amended by the Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1010, requiring that where the City sells a capital asset, the funds received from such sale shall be deposited in the sinking funds for the redemption of any bonds that were sold and the proceeds of which were used to pay for said property, and which remain unpaid at the time of the sale of said property.”</p>

Section 1 of the former contains a statement of the inherent rights of man as to the acquisition of property, etc. Section 9 is a prohibition against deprivation of a man’s “life, liberty or property, unless by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.” Section 1 of the 14th Amendment of the Federal Constitution is the well-known “due process” clause. The argument of plaintiff is that the water supply system is owned by the City in its proprietary capacity and that supplying water is not a governmental function, that “the State has no special power over the property held by the City in its proprietary capacity” and that therefore any attempted alienation of this property by the municipal authorities is a taking of the people’s property without due process of law.

And the right is not taken away by the Act of 1885 [the Bullitt Bill] which, as already said, merely regulates the mode of exercise of executive, and incidentally of legislative, functions without changing the rights which appertain to those functions.” The state can authorize its creature, the City, to transfer its sewer system to the Authority created by the state. This Authority was created for the improvement of property which ministers to the public welfare. It exercises its functions through a Board selected by the legislative body of the city. Sections 14 and 18 of the Authorities Act limit the title of the Authority in the property to be conveyed to it and section 6 of the Act protects the property conveyed to the Authority against sale, assignment, mortgage or other disposition by any receiver who may be appointed after default in the payment of principal or interest on any of the Authority bonds and who may, pursuant to order of court, take possession of the facilities of the Authority, or any part or parts thereof, the revenues or receipts from which are or may be applicable to the payment of the bonds so in default, and operate and maintain the same and collect and receive all rentals and other revenues thereafter arising therefrom in the same manner as the Authority or the board might do.</p>

Plaintiff says in his paper book: “It is true that there <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>is no specific lien provided for in tlie bonds sold to plaintiff on either the properties or revenues. There is, however, a specific representation that a portion of the proceeds are to be used in the construction and improvement of the two systems involved. It was on this basis plaintiff, or his predecessor in title, loaned his money. The proposed transfer of the properties and pledge of the revenues to the Authority deprive plaintiff of a very substantial asset which he had a right to assume would be retained for the protection of his investment. For this additional reason, we submit that the proposed plan is invalid.”</p>
    <p id="b412-5" data-blocks='[["BL_412.4",412,[296,1033,1148,1235]]]'>Plaintiff also calls attention to the Act of May 16, 1929, P. L. 1778, as amended by the Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1010, (53 PS 1992) which provides that when a municipality has been duly authorized, pursuant to the Act of April 20, 1871, P. L. 65, and the amendments thereto, “to increase its indebtedness to an amount exceeding two (2) per centum of the last preceding assessed valuation of the taxable property therein, with the assent of the electors thereof, and the corporate authorities, having acquired by fee simple any property by use of said funds, and the corporate authorities shall deem it for public interest to abandon the use of said property for the purpose as purchased, either in whole or in part, and, by either ordinance or resolution, shall so provide, then the said corporate authorities shall be and are hereby authorized to dispose of said property so acquired; and the funds so received from said properties shall be deposited in the funds of said public corporation, for the redemption of any bonds that were sold and used to pay for said property, remaining unpaid at the time of the sale of said property, <em>or of any outstanding bonds issued and used to refund bonds so sold and used.”</em>

A holder of bonds such as those held by the plaintiff has as his security the city’s credit and solvency and these rest on the valuation of the properties which are subject to taxation in the city and on the power the law gives a bondholder to compel the city to levy and collect taxes to discharge the city’s contractual obligations as expressed in its bonds. Article IX, section 8, of the Constitution requires any municipality incurring any indebtedness to provide for the collection of an annual tax sufficient to pay the interest and also the principal thereof within thirty years. The City ordinances have complied with these requirements. The revenues to be derived from the city’s water system and to be derived from the sewer system (for the City Solicitor states in his brief: “Sewer charges will be imposed at rates and in amounts in excess of the requirements for the rental from the City to the Authority on that property” ), will not be diverted to any private or improper use but will be used to defray the cost of constructing and maintaining at a high degree of efficiency improved water and sewer systems, which systems are most vital to the health and well-being of the 2,000,000 inhabitants of Philadelphia. The expenditures to be made are not for municipal luxuries but for municipal necessities. The State Sanitary Water Board has heretofore made formal demand on the City of Philadelphia to provide for a complete system of sewage treatment and disposal and has ordered it to desist from discharging any untreated sewage into the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers and has threatened to take legal action to force the accomplishment of these ends under the provisions of the Act of June 22, 1937, P. L. 1987. In the brief filed in this court by the Interstate Commission on the Delaware River Basin, appears this statement: “We have too long neglected caring for the wastes which arise as the result of a dense population and a great industrial develop<a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>ment. Now that ways and means of overcoming the financial difficulties have been found, there should no longer be delay in prosecuting these public works which mean so much to the future prosperity of the people inhabiting the Delaware Biver Basin.” Through the instrumentality of the City Authority, the taxpayers, instead of being compelled to pay 100% of the financial burden entailed, are relieved of 45% of it through a contribution of $27,000,000 from the Federal treasury, or in whatever amount the grant may be made. The assumption of a <em>55% </em>burden thus gives rise to a 100% benefit. A city without an adequate water system and an efficient sanitary sewer system suffers in civic prestige and places the lives and health of its citizens in jeopardy. All of a city’s inhabitants are its taxpayers, either directly or indirectly. Whatever benefits the former, benefits the latter. When taxpayers are benefited, bondholders have cause for rejoicing rather than for complaint.</p>
