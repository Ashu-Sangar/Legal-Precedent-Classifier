Floyd, to recover damages for injuries alleged to have been caused to the minor plaintiff on October 10, 1930, by the negligence of defendant. On September 7, 1931, defendant died, and her executors were substituted in her stead. When the case came on for trial, on September 13, 1933, Mrs. Dellacasse offered herself as a witness to testify to facts in connection with the accident. Upon objection by defendants, the court ruled her incompetent because of the original defendant’s death. Plaintiffs stating they had no other witness, the court, on motion of counsel for defendants, entered a compulsory nonsuit.</p>

The petition set forth that her parents had released their claims against Sarah I. Floyd and the executors, and had thereby become competent witnesses; also that other witnesses to the accident had been found since the nonsuit was entered. The court, on October 5, 1934, granted the motion to take off the non-<a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>suit and ordered a new trial. When the second trial began, on March 22,1937, plaintiffs were allowed to amend the caption of the case by withdrawing the names of the parents as parties; leaving as sole plaintiff Clara Dellacasse, a minor, by her mother and next friend Lena Dellacasse (the father having meanwhile died). At this trial Mrs. Dellacasse and other witnesses testified on behalf of plaintiff, and a verdict for the latter was rendered.</p>

They also question the right of Mrs. Dellacasse to qualify herself as a witness by executing a release of her personal claim against defendants, contending that, in order to have such effect under section 6 of the Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, such release of interest must be made in good faith; there is no merit in this contention, because a validly executed and effective release given to the adverse party, as distinguished from a possibly colorable assignment of the interest to a third person, could scarcely be other than in good faith, the question of motive being immaterial: <em>Walls v. Walls, </em><a href="/pa/182/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="182 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="893386" data-case-paths="/pa/182/0226-01">182 Pa. 226</a>, 230; <em>Darragh v.

Since a defendant has a right to binding instructions if a plaintiff fails to make out a case, he does not suffer from the refusal to grant a nonsuit. It is, no doubt, for this reason that the Act of March 11, 1875, P. L. 6, allows an appeal by a plaintiff in case the court in banc refuses to remove a nonsuit, but not by a defendant if the court refuses to enter it, or, having entered it, sets it aside: <em>Becker v.

Not being bound, therefore, to grant a non-suit, taking it off is a matter within the court’s discretion : <em>Fitzpatrick v.

Defendants invoke the familiar principle that the common-law power of a court to open or amend its judgments, adversely obtained, ceases with the expiration of the term in which they were rendered: <em>Mathers’ Executor v.

It has been applied only to adverse judgments, that is, those obtained after a hearing or trial, — not to judgments by confession or, in our State, by default: <em>King v. Brooks, </em><a href="/pa/72/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="72 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="434695" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0363-01">72 Pa. 363</a>; <em>Pennsylvania Stave Company’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/225/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="225 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="965257" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0178-01">225 Pa. 178</a>; <em>Rome Sales &amp; Service Station v.

Of more present importance is the fact that it has never been extended to judgments, orders or decrees which were not final in their effect upon the controversies in which they were rendered. In Pennsylvania a nonsuit, even if entered adversely, does not have the attribute of finality. It is not a bar to another proceeding for the same cause: <em>Bournonville v. Goodall, </em><a href="/pa/10/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="10 Pa. 133" data-case-ids="962666" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0133-01">10 Pa. 133</a>; <em>Fitzpatrick v.

Superior Ct. 173</a>. In the last-named case it was said (pp. 176-7) : “While it is true that a compulsory nonsuit after the presentation of the plaintiff’s case has the effect of a judgment for the defendant on a demurrer to the evidence to the extent that it puts the plaintiff out of court, its legal effect is entirely different. No judgment is entered on the merits of the ease. It is not contended that the court in such procedure could enter judgment for the defendant or against the plaintiff. No appeal is allowed, under the statute, from the action of the court in granting such nonsuit. The right of appeal arises when the court refuses to take off the nonsuit and it is the judgment of the court on the latter question which the plaintiff may have reviewed. If the defendant desires to test the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s case on the merits he should demur to the evidence and thereby raise an issue on which the judgment of the court could be taken, hut, if he seeks to avoid the risk of such a course and only asks for a nonsuit, when that order is granted, he is not left in a situation to object to a second action on the same cause.” It is only if a plaintiff’s motion to set aside a nonsuit is refused that the order or judgment, unappealed from, operates conclusively to terminate the right of action: <em>Fine v. Soifer, </em><a href="/pa/288/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="288 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="1100848" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0164-01">288 Pa. 164</a>. Since, therefore, a nonsuit does not effect a final disposition of the case, it is not comprehended within the letter, the spirit, or the raison d’etre of the rule which ordinarily prevents a court from acting upon a judgment after the expiration of the term in which it was entered.</p>

      <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>The Act of March 11, 1875, P. L. 6, fixes no limit of time within which a motion to set aside a compulsory nonsuit must be made. Where a rule of court provides a limit, a plaintiff is bound thereby: <em>Edelman v. Moser, </em><a href="/pa-super/60/0637-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="60 Pa. Super. 637" data-case-ids="451717" data-case-paths="/pa-super/60/0637-01">60 Pa.

Superior Ct. 148</a>. In the present case it appears that in Allegheny County there is a four-day rule governing motions for new trials and judgments n. o. v., but the court below held that it does not include motions to take off non-suits. The interpretation of rules of court is for the court which enunciates them; when it construes the meaning of its own rule, and there is no abuse of power, its conclusion is final: <em>Haverford Township School District v. Herzog, </em><a href="/pa/314/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="314 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="1154730" data-case-paths="/pa/314/0161-01">314 Pa. 161</a>; <em>Richter v.

Defendants urge that it is unfair to allow a plaintiff to have a compulsory nonsuit removed so long (in this case nine months) after its original entry, but this criticism would apply equally to the opening of judgments by default or confession after the expiration of a similar lapse of time; of course, the court in every such case, should, in exercising its discretion, take into consideration not only the delay in making the application, but any and all circumstances which, in the particular case, would impose unjust hardship upon the other party.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

In order to disqualify a witness under the Act of 1887 because of adverse interest, the interest must be in the outcome of the particular case and not in its remote results; the test is whether the witness will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment; the interest must be one that the judgment in the case will operate upon: <em>Wolf v.
