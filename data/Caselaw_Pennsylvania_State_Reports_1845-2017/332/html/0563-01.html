The effective date of annexation was fixed by the court as January 6,1930. During these six intervening months between the election and the annexation, the borough council entered into contracts for twenty-four street improvement projects. Sixteen of these contracts were awarded to the legal plaintiff, the Pittsburgh Paving Company. As construction under the contracts proceeded, certificates of indebtedness, representing payments on account of work actually completed, were issued to the contractor.</p>

In <em>O’Malley v.

In the viewers’ proceedings held after the sewer was completed a part of the cost was assessed against the borough, which already had a debt in excess of the constitutional limit. An injunction was granted forbidding the borough officials from making further payments to the contractors. We said, at page 533, “To their [the contractors’] allegation that they had no way of ascertaining the indebtedness of the borough, the answer is that it was their duty to ascertain it in some way, or to refuse to enter into the contract until the borough officials had satisfied them that the proposed additional indebtedness would be with<a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>in the constitutional limit.

It asserts that after annexation the city approved and ratified the contracts, and assumed liability upon the certificates issued thereunder by carrying forward the viewers’ proceedings already begun, by instituting additional viewers’ proceedings upon the other completed projects, by collecting the benefits which were assessed, and by making payment out of the sums collected upon certain of the certificates of indebtedness issued by the borough to the contractors. While these facts are very persuasive, and indicate that perhaps the city did not at first take the position that the contracts were void, they cannot be held to bar the city from now raising a defense otherwise valid. The work and materials for which the certificates were given had all been furnished prior to annexation. The resulting street improvements could not be returned, and the city had no option but to accept the benefit thereof. It is certainly not to be held against the city that it carried on viewers’ proceedings, instituted new ones, and applied the benefits received upon the viewers’ awards to the payment of the certificates issued to the contractors. These steps inured solely to the benefit of the plaintiff and other certificate holders, and cannot be construed as recognition of the validity of the contracts, so as to prejudice the city’s rights in this action.</p>

It relies upon the Act of April 11, 1929, P. L. 520, which provides that, before beginning a public improvement, municipal officials “shall have power to cause to be prepared preliminary estimates of <em>the amount of benefits </em>which may be assessed against the owners of such property and for <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>which liens may he legally filed under existing laws; and, in any proceedings for the incurring or increasing of indebtedness for the borrowing of moneys for the payment of the cost of such improvement, <em>such estimates of assessable </em>benefits, when signed and verified by the affidavit of the engineer that they are in his opinion fair estimates of the amounts of benefits which may be lawfully assessed, <em>shall be considered deductible assets” </em>in computing the municipal indebtedness. Plaintiff argues that here such estimates were supplied to the borough council before the contracts in question were entered into, and therefore the amounts of such estimated benefits should be deducted in computing the debt created by the improvements. According to plaintiff’s calculations, the projects increased the councilmanic debt to the extent of $29,400 only, which plaintiff maintains was well within its capacity.</p>

They contain only the engineer’s calculations of the net expense to the borough of each of the improvements, without disclosing his estimates of the amount of the assessable benefits. This is the fundamental requirement of the statute, if advantage is to be taken by the borough of its provisions. As the result of the failure of the engineer to comply with the act, his estimates are without value for the purpose for which they were intended.</p>

Not until <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>viewers’ proceedings had been held could the real amount of the debt arising from the improvements be determined: <em>O’Malley v.

However, as the projects were completed, such proceedings were immediately instituted. Even before annexation to the city, the borough officials by petition to the court caused viewers to be appointed for twelve of the projects, and within five months after annexation the defendant city obtained the appointment of viewers for the remaining six completed projects. The viewers, with the finished improvements before them, were able accurately to determine the amount by which properties affected had been benefited or damaged. The benefits fixed in the viewers’ proceedings constituted a determination of the amount of the tax which was levied and for which liens could be filed against abutting properties by reason of the ordinances authorizing the improvements.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> With the confirmation by the court of the viewers’ reports the benefits therein assessed became available as assets deductible for the purpose of computing the councilmanic debt: <em>Schuldice v.

The recovery to which plaintiff is entitled depends upon the amount of the councilmanic borrowing capacity at the time the contracts were made, which remains for determination. In 1929 the assessed valuation of property in Overbrook was $4,190,600, providing a 2% constitutional debt limit of $83,812. The court in banc found that on July 11, 1929, before any of the contracts were made, the borough council had an unused borrowing capacity of $75,476. Our examination of the record, and study of the schedules appended to the briefs, convince us that this finding is sustained by the evidence, save in one particular. The court erred in treating certain outstanding bonds of the borough as a part of the councilmanic debt, when properly they should have been considered electoral debt.</p>

One of the objects of this issue was the payment of $15,750 of current expense loans then outstanding. The court below held that this sum, although now represented by bonds issued by popular vote, was council-manic debt, and that its nature was not changed by the refunding with the approval of the electorate. However the loans so refunded, being for current expenses and to be repaid out of current revenues, did not constitute debt in a constitutional sense: <em>Athens National Bank v.

These certificates were issued between April 14th and December 31,1928, in the aggregate amount of $23,900, and the proceeds of the loans thereby represented were used to pay current expenses of the Borough incurred during the year 1928. We approved, in the opinion filed in this case, the action of the court below in excluding this item in determining the amount of the councilmanic debt in 1929. The issue involved in the case was whether certain paving contracts entered into by the Borough prior to its annexation to the City of Pittsburgh, caused its councilmanic borrowing power to be exceeded.</p>
