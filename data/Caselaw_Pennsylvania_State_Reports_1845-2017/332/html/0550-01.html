He initially taught history, civics and physical education, which included coaching in athletics. Under his present contract he was instructor in physical education under which he coached football and basketball. When relieved of his duties as football coach he refused to continue coaching basketball. <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>Because lie refused to perform regularly assigned duties under tlie School Code, after notice and hearing he was not reelected to the teaching staff. The action of the board was sustained by the court of common pleas on appeal.</p>
    <p id="b686-5" data-blocks='[["BL_686.4",686,[286,662,1151,362]]]'>Appellant here contends that under the proper construction of the word “teach” as used in his contract, appellee was without authority under the school laws to refuse him reelection solely for the nonperformance of <em>coaching </em>duties. The sole question therefore is whether the word “teach” can be construed to include coaching duties.</p>
    <p id="b686-6" data-blocks='[["BL_686.5",686,[284,1045,1151,526]]]'>Appellant’s contract of employment is in the standard form prescribed by the School Code of 1911, section 1205, as amended, prior to the Act of April 6, 1937, P. L. 213. It provides that appellant shall teach “under the authority of the said board . . . and subject to the supervision and authority of the properly authorized superintendent of schools. . . ,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Although the record does not include appellant’s certificate, it does disclose that he was qualified to instruct in history, civics and physical education.</p>

The statutory form of contract does not define teaching duties or those to which a teacher may be assigned. “Teach” as thus used has a comprehensive as well as a restricted meaning. The School Code restricts its meaning to instruction within the qualifications expressed in the teacher’s <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>certificate ;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> but in a broad sense, it refers to general instruction within the fields certified, including all incidents and subdivisions thereof. Within these qualifications, the discretion of the school authorities is absolute, under the contract, to assign the teacher regardless of* prior understandings before his contract was entered into. Neither the teacher nor the board, nor both combined, can circumvent by contract, or otherwise, the statutory right of the board to assign teachers or to administer the school under their control. The Code thus reserves to the board the power to assign the teacher to any duties for which he is properly qualified under his teacher’s certificate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b687-5" data-blocks='[["BL_687.4",687,[157,1104,1153,485]]]'>There can be no doubt that a comprehensive definition of “teaching” physical education embraces all fields of athletics, including coaching football and basketball. The Code does not permit the certification of teachers in specific fields of athletic instruction, nor is there any provision in the law for the employment of a “coach” Avho has no teaching certificate. Such an employee would not be a “professional employe” within the meaning of section 1 of the Teachers’ Tenure Act of 1937.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

It is not the spirit of our public school system that only children with financial means to purchase their own supplies should have the opportunity of participating in school games and athletic sports.” The School Code, in section 405, recognizes the inclusion of organized sports in the school program by entrusting to the board the management and control of exercises, athletics and games played by the pupils.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

It was a proper assignment, within the power of the school authorities.
