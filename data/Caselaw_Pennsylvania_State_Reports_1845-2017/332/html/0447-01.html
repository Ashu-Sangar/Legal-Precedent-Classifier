He admitted that he knew at the time of the execution of the application there were judgments encumbering the premises, some of them in substantial amounts. A witness for plaintiff who was present at the interview said the agent asked no question about encumbrances. On the other hand, the agent testified that he did make this inquiry of plaintiff and the latter answered in the negative. On cross-examination he was asked whether he had taken an application from one Charles Miller and in that instance likewise had failed to ask the applicant as to encumbrances but had nevertheless inserted the word “None.” Defendant’s objection to this question was overruled. The agent replied that in Miller’s case also he had inquired concerning encumbrances. In plaintiff’s rebuttal, Miller, over defendant’s objection, was allowed to deny this, and to testify that the agent, in taking an application from him, had of his own accord written the word “None” in answer to this question. (Miller admitted, however, that there were in fact no incumbrances upon his property.) Since the purpose of this examination was to show that on another occasion the company’s agent had filled in the blank without obtaining the information from the applicant, just as he was charged with having done in the present instance, it is clear that such evidence was improperly admitted. It must have been extremely harmful to defendant to allow the jury to be told that the agent had acted with Miller in the same way as allegedly with plaintiff. That a person has done an act on one occasion is not probative of the contention that he did a similar act upon another occasion: 1 "Wigmore on Evidence 230, section 192; <em>Baker v.

Even accepting as true plaintiff’s version of his interview with the agent, can he recover on this policy? Ordinarily, where representations in the application are warranted by the insured to be correct, the company may resist liability if the warranty is breached. Can the insured avoid this result by proof that the answers as recorded were not his, but were inserted, either fraudulently or negligently, by the company’s agent? There is a marked difference of opinion regarding this question in the courts of various jurisdictions, and in our own State it may perhaps be said that the authorities do not permit of a categorical answer.</p>

The action of the trial judge in overruling the offer was sustained on appeal, on the ground that the applicant was neither blind, deaf, nor unable to read, and, therefore, when she signed the paper without reading it, she was bound by what it contained. The court quoted the well-known pronouncement of Chief Justice Gibson in <em>Greenfield’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/14/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="14 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="405959" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0489-01">14 Pa. 489</a>, 496, that if a party who can read “will not read a deed put before him for execution; or if, being unable to read, will not demand to have it read or explained to him, he is guilty of supine negligence, which, I take it, is not the subject of protection, either in equity or at law.”</p>

The plaintiff there contended that the case was not governed by the <em>Rinker </em>and the <em>Koppleman </em>cases, because the printed application did not, as in those cases, contain a limitation of the agent’s authority. The court said (p. 224) : “The general rule is that one who signs an application for insurance without reading it, when he might have done so, will be held to have read it,” and pointed out that this doctrine was not only applied in the <em>Rinker </em>and the <em>Koppleman </em>cases but is the law in the federal courts and in England. The court extended the application of the <em>Koppleman </em>case by saying (pp. 224, 225) : “Koppelman might have but did not read the application signed by him, and, in consequence, contended that he was ignorant of a limitation of the agent’s power ex<a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>pressed in tlie application, and was, therefore, not bound by what he had signed; we held that he must be treated as knowing what he would have learned by reading the application.

It is unnecessary to pursue this subject further, however, because, in our opinion, plaintiff cannot find support for his position in the present case in <em>any </em>of the decisions cited. In none of them, even those preceding the <em>Applebaum </em>case, was it held that an applicant who <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>could have read the application but failed to do so was absolved from obligation in regard to the statements, representations and covenants contained in the application <em>other than the answers actually made by him to the company’s agent and by the latter falsely recorded. </em>On the contrary, in the <em>BinJcer </em>and <em>Koppleman </em>cases it was expressly decided that whatever protection the applicant might be entitled to with respect to answers orally supplied by him to the agent, he was bound by the other portions of the application. The reason for such a distinction is obvious. Where the insured gives answers or makes statements to the agent to be inserted in the application there may be justification for his contention that as to such answers and statements he has the right to take for granted they will be correctly written, and that he need not, therefore, assure himself concerning them by actual inspection of the paper. But as to all other statements, answers or provisions in the application, whether originally printed therein or inserted in writing by the agent prior to the signing by the applicant, without the question or subject being called to the attention of the applicant at all, the latter has no right to assume anything whatever as to the contents of the paper in regard to such matters, and as to them is under the same obligation to read the application before signing as is everyone else who affixes his signature to a document involving legal obligations.</p>

Plaintiff, therefore, had no reason to assume that there was or was not contained in the application a representation or statement in regard to encumbrances, or, if any, what that statement or representation was. Nor does plaintiff, an educated, competent businessman, pretend he was unable to read the application, or that he was induced not to read it by the agent, or that his failure to inspect it was caused by any fraud, trick or artifice upon the part <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>of the agent; on the contrary, he frankly admits that he had every opportunity to read before signing but forbore to do so only because he was in a hurry at the time.</p>
