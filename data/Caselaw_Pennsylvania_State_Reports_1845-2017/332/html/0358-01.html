    <p id="A3p9" data-blocks='[["BL_495.6",495,[160,437,1157,1686]]]'>On June 22, 1938, the Attorney General of the Commonwealth presented a petition to the Court of Quarter Sessions of Dauphin County setting forth that by virtue of his office he had, on the previous day, superseded the district attorney of that county in the conduct of the then contemplated investigation by the Grand Jury of charges made against certain public officials and private citizens, and praying for an order requiring the district attorney to turn over to him all documents and evidence bearing upon the ease. A rule was granted which, on June 27, 1938, was discharged by the court below. Thereafter, on July 30, 1938, an act was passed by the General Assembly, being Act No. 3 of the special session, which provides: “Section 1. In any investigation or proceeding whatsoever pending before any court of oyer and terminer and general jail delivery, or before any court of quarter sessions in any county of this Commonwealth, the Attorney General of the Commonwealth may, at any stage of the investigation or proceeding, in his absolute discretion, supersede and set aside the district attorney of the county. Section 2. If in any such investigation or proceeding, the court before which it is pending shall find, after hearing, that the Attorney General has failed or is unable to perform his duties impartially, such court may order the Attorney General to stand aside, and in such event shall appoint an attorney at law resident in another county of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to supersede and act in lieu of the Attorney General. ...” The act provides that it “shall apply to all investigations or proceedings now pending, as well as to all future investigations or proceedings.”</p>

On the same <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>day he filed a petition in the court below setting forth this action on his part, and praying for an order of the court directing the district attorney to deliver to him all documents in his possession, and further praying that he, the Attorney General, should thereafter be recognized as the officer in sole charge of the proceedings on the part of the Commonwealth. On August 8, 1938, the court dismissed the petition and refused its prayer. From that order we have the present appeal by the Attorney General.</p>

The general power to supersede the district attorney was reasserted in these very proceedings, in the opinion by Mr. Chief Justice Kephart, <a href="/pa/332/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="332 Pa. 289" data-case-ids="1186565" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0289-01">332 Pa. 289</a>.</p>

And, while it is true that district attorneys are constitutional officers (Constitution, Article XIV, section 1), it is well <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>established that since the Constitution does not prescribe the duties of the district attorney the legislature may regulate the performance of such duties and provide for cases in which it would be improper for the elected officer to act: <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="AZ50" data-blocks='[["BL_497.4",497,[146,816,1155,1306]]]'>The court below was of opinion that Act No. 3 could not validly apply to the pending proceedings because, by the order of June 27, 1938, the Attorney. General’s right to supersede the district attorney had been, at least inferentially, denied, and, no appeal having been taken from that order, the legislature could not compel the judicial reversal of a decision previously made by the court. While the principle thus asserted is not only sound but even vital to our constitutional system of the division and independence of executive, legislative and judicial powers, it has, in our opinion, no application to the present situation. Act No. 3 is general in its terms. It does not affect any rights of litigants or any final judgment or decree. While retroactive in the sense that it was made applicable to then pending proceedings, it did not purport to set aside the order previously made therein by the court, nor did the Attorney General seek to have that original order reversed by virtue of the authority of the act. What the Attorney General did was to give to the district attorney a new notice of supersession, thus starting a fresh proceeding under the provisions of the statute; from this he would not automatically be precluded merely because another application, made prior to the statutory enactment, had failed.</p>

      <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>We are thus brought to the real question in the case,— is there any restriction whatever upon the power of the Attorney General to supersede the district attorney of a county? Is the extent of the discretion possessed by him at common law and now fortified by act of assembly so illimitable as to be beyond the pale of judicial review? We have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that, from the legal standpoint, such discretion may be abused, and, if so, its exercise cannot be sustained. Just as a district attorney is a quasi-judicial officer <em>(Commonwealth v. Nicely, </em><a href="/pa/130/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="130 Pa. 261" data-case-ids="568958" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0261-01">130 Pa. 261</a>, 270; <em>Snyder’s Case, </em><a href="/pa/301/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="301 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1126384" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0276-01">301 Pa. 276</a>, 288), so, likewise, is the Attorney General when acting officially in proceedings in the criminal courts. To him, therefore, is peculiarly applicable the familiar doctrine that courts and all judicial and quasi-judicial officers must exercise discretionary powers upon the foundation of reason, as opposed to prejudice, personal motivations, caprice or arbitrary action. From early sources of English law we learn (as quoted in 1 Tomlin’s Law Diet. 561) that “When any thing is left to any person to be done according to his discretion, the law intends it must be done with sound discretion, and according to law; and the Court of B. R. [King’s Bench] hath a power to redress things that are otherwise done, notwithstanding they are left to the discretion of those that do them”: 1 Lil. Abr. 477; and that “Discretion is to discern between right and wrong; and therefore whoever hath power to act at discretion is bound by the rule of reason and law. 2 Inst. 56, 298.” In our own state it was said as long ago as <em>Paschall v. Passmore, </em><a href="/pa/15/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="15 Pa. 295" data-case-ids="408679" data-case-paths="/pa/15/0295-01">15 Pa. 295</a>, 304: “The very term [discretion] itself, standing alone and unsupported by circumstances, imports the exercise of judgment, wisdom, and skill, as contradistinguished from unthinking folly, heady violence, and rash injustice. When technically employed in legal instruments, its proper acceptation is inseparable from the idea of dispassionate conclusion, having due regard to the rights and interests of others.” There is to be found <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>in our law books not merely a current, but a torrent, of authorities to the same effect, among which may be cited <em>Schlaudecker v. Marshall, </em><a href="/pa/72/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="72 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="434608" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0200-01">72 Pa. 200</a>, 206; <em>Camp v. Corn Exchange National Bank, </em><a href="/pa/285/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="285 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="1095063" data-case-paths="/pa/285/0337-01">285 Pa. 337</a>, 348, and <em>Campbell v. Bellevue Borough School District, </em><a href="/pa/328/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="328 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="1179714" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0197-01">328 Pa. 197</a>, 202. No implication can be drawn from the former opinions of this court that the power of the Attorney General to displace the district attorney is not limited to the proper legal exercise of a sound discretion. Nor does Act No. 3 effect — even if it constitutionally <em>could </em>effect —a change in this respect. It is true that the statute uses the phrase <em>“absolute </em>discretion,” but, while the adjective supplies emphasis, it cannot be judicially interpreted to connote other than a discretion consistent with those immutable principles which govern the administration of justice, that is, a discretion reasonably based upon the attendant pertinent circumstances from which its exercise arises, and which is the only range of discretion permissible to a judicial or quasi-judicial officer. In construing an act of the legislature it is incumbent upon the court to give it an interpretation, if possible, which will prevent its conflict with the Constitution. Indeed, this principle has been embodied in the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, section 52 of which provides: “In ascertaining the intention of the Legislature in the enactment of a law, the courts may be guided by the following presumptions among others: (1) That the Legislature does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable; (2) That the Legislature intends the entire statute to be effective and certain; (3) That the Legislature does not intend to violate the Constitution of the United States or of this Commonwealth.”</p>

The learned judge of the court below points out clearly in his opinion that the Attorney General cannot with propriety conduct the proposed Grand Jury investigation. It is true that the statute provides that the court shall determine this question “after hearing,” but in this case no taking of testimony was necessary since the facts disqualifying the Attorney General appeared upon the face of the record. By the phrase “unable to perform his duties impartially,” the act obviously refers to a situation where such inability arises from obligations and loyalties so conflict<a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>ing as virtually to render impossible the satisfactory performance of duty. The Attorney General is an appointee of the Governor and subject to dismissal by him. Under such circumstances ordinary sentiments and impulses would necessarily tend to interfere with the Attorney General’s freedom of action, even though he might not in fact succumb to the temptations which would confront him. To permit him to conduct the investigation in such a case would be contrary to all standards of professional ethics, as the Attorney General himself commendably recognizes, for, in the brief presented by him to this court, he disclaims any intention of handling the proceedings personally. In the event, therefore, that the court below shall decide that the district attorney has been properly superseded, it will thereupon appoint an attorney at law resident in another county to perform his functions.</p>

For us to give to the phrase, “in his absolute discretion,” any other meaning than the one the legislature obviously intended it to have is, in my judgment, legislating. No draftsman could devise a more ««ambiguous or emphatic phrase than “absolute discretion,” with which to clothe the Attorney General with the <em>unqualified </em>and <em>unconditional </em>right, independent of any other official’s wish, will or consent, to supersede or set aside the district attorney.</p>

The office of district attorney is an office provided for in the Constitution and its tenure fixed by the Constitution: Article XIV, sections 1 and 2. If the legislature can pass a valid law authorizing the attorney general to supersede a district attorney in any county of the state, it can pass a law authorizing an attorney general to supersede the sheriff, <em>recorder of deeds, county commissioners, treasurer </em>and <em>controller </em>and five other constitutional county officers in any county of the state, all of which are created <em>hy the same section of the Constitution which creates the office of district attorney. </em>There is no constitutional warrant that I can find for the exercise of any such legislative power. It is to me incredible that any official, and particularly an <em>ap</em>
      <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>
      <em>pointed </em>one, can be empowered by the legislature to supersede any duly elected incumbent of any office created by the Constitution. The legislature has no more power to authorize the attorney general to supersede a district attorney than it has to authorize him to supersede a judge. The fact that the Constitution of 1874 makes the attorney general a member of the Board of Pardons is a clear indication that the attorney general’s constitutional creators did not look upon him as a super-district attorney. As such he would have the role of <em>prosecutor; </em>as a member of the Board of Pardons, he has a <em>judicial </em>role. These roles are inconsistent. By the Act of May 3, 1850, P. L. 654, sec. 1, the district attorney was empowered to “conduct in court all criminal and other prosecutions.” When the Constitution of 1874 made the office a constitutional one, it perpetuated the powers of the office as then existing, and the legislature cannot diminish those powers any more than it can diminish “judicial power,” which likewise was recognized and perpetuated by the Constitution.</p>

We there held that a justice of the peace as a constitutional judicial officer elected by the people, can be removed from his office only by the governor for reasonable cause after due notice and full hearing on the address of two-thirds of the senate.

It confers on the attorney general “the right in his absolute discretion” to supersede the district attorney and then the courts are directed by the Construction Act (supra), passed fourteen months earlier, <em>not </em>to disregard the words of a law when they are “clear and free from ambiguity.” The supersession of a district attorney in a case <em>for cause shown </em>would not be contrary to the Constitution, for when the Constitution creates any office there is an implication that no incumbent of that office will discharge its duties in any case when, according to the instinctive canons of right, he ought not to do so. For example, if a judge attempted to sit in judgment in a case in which he was a party, the higher courts would, in the exercise of their common-law powers, forbid him to do so.

This act as drafted in clear and unambiguous language, provides for the supersession of a district attorney <em>in any case, </em>not merely where there is a temporary vacancy arising from disqualification or refusal to act, qnd therefore it does something it has no express or implied constitutional warrant for doing.

To permit him to conduct the investigation in such a case would be contrary to all standards of professional ethics, as the attorney general himself commendably recognizes for in the brief presented by him to this court, he disclaims any intention of handling the proceedings personally.” If he is ethically disqualified from handling these proceedings personally, he is disqualified from supervising the handling of them and he is equally disqualified from entering the proceedings long enough to attempt to have the lawfully elected, duly qualified and properly acting district attorney superseded so that “an attomey-at-law resident in another county” (i. e., a county <em>other than Dauphin) </em>can be appointed to conduct the investigation. For example, if an attorney general were under indictment in any county in the State, would it be contended that he could officially enter the case long enough to secure the supersession of the qualified district attorney who had signed the indictment and who was prepared to prosecute the case? Any official, be he an attorney general or a district attorney, who appears in any court to represent the Commonwealth at any stage of a criminal case, is at the same time an. <em>officer of the court </em>and if the court regards him, for sufficient reasons, as <em>disqualified </em>to represent the principal he assumes to represent, the court can order him out of that particular case in order to protect and to promote the due administration of justice. The maintenance of a proper administration of justice is essentially a judicial function. For example, would any one contend that the legislature could compel a court to readmit to its bar a lawyer who had been disbarred or suspended? This very question was ruled on in Wisconsin. The legislature of that state passed an act restoring the “license” to practice law of a man who had been judicially suspended from the bar for a certain period of time. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin in <em>State v. Cannon, </em><a href="/citations/?q=240%20N.W.%20441" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="240 N.W. 441">240 N.

He is disqualified from entering the proceedings even for the purpose of ousting the district attorney of Dauphin County and having a lawyer from another county appointed in his place. If the act in question is unconstitutional, as I am completely convinced it is, the attorney general has no standing whatsoever in these proceedings. If it is constitutional, the attorney general is disqualified by an interest or loyalty adverse to the Commonwealth’s from appearing at <em>any stage of the proceedings. </em>In any situation where an attorney represents conflicting interests, he cannot, without violating legal ethics, even begin legal proceedings in behalf of one interested party against the other. For example, if a lawyer accepted a retainer from a client, he could not with propriety cause to be issued in behalf of another client a summons in trespass against the client from whom he had accepted the retainer. If a district attorney was in office when a crime was committed in his county, he would not be permitted, after his retirement from that office, to accept a retainer from the alleged criminal to defend him in the trial of that criminal’s case, or if he were in private practice and accepted a retainer from one accused of crime, he would not, upon his <em>subsequent </em>election to the office of district attorney, be permitted to conduct the prosecution of that client or even to select the attorney to do so in his stead. It would be his duty to have nothing to do with the case. If, in the instant case, any attack is to be made upon the disinterestedness of the District Attorney of Dauphin County, it should <em>not </em>be made by the attorney general <em>in his official </em>capacity, because <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>for Mm to do so naturally gives rise to tlie belief that he may be using the powers and prestige of the office which he holds as a <em>public trust, </em>to secure the removal from these proceedings of the very district attorney by whom the conduct of this proposed investigation the public interest may imperatively require. Presumably, it is greatly to the interest of the Commonwealth that this investigation be conducted by the district attorney who has made himself familiar with all its facts and phases by studying it since the matter was first brought to his attention more than six months ago. It does not well lie in the mouth of the <em>attorney general </em>— a subordinate of one of the officials to be investigated — to attempt to secure that district attorney’s removal from this case. The attorney general’s attempt to eliminate from this investigation the duly elected district attorney of Dauphin County, naturally gives rise to a suspicion that his (i. e., the attorney general’s) action is not in the <em>public </em>interest, which is the <em>only </em>interest to which <em>as attorney general </em>he owes fidelity. Since the attorney general is admittedly <em>not </em>disinterested as between the Commonwealth, whose servant he is, and the Governor, whose appointee he is and by whom he can be removed, he should not be permitted to appear officially and challenge the district attorney’s qualifications to proceed with this investigation. For him to do this is as completely improper as it would be for him to do so were he himself under investigation or under indictment. The obvious conflict between his fidelity to the Commonwealth and his loyalty to his chief makes his official participation <em>in any stage </em>of this case offensive to the canons of professional ethics and of good taste.</p>
