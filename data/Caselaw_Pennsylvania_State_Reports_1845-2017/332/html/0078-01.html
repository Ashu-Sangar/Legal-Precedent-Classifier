In that case' the decision was filed more than sixty days after the end of the trial because of the illness of the presiding judge. The court said at page 338: “Irrespective of what may be the proper construction of this section, we believe that this provision is directory only. Otherwise all the time consumed in the trial of the case would be for naught by reason of a failure to file the decision within sixty days from the termination of the trial, irrespective of the cause for delay.

In the case before us, the proceedings were instituted within the five days, but because of the pressure of judicial business the time for hearing was fixed later than ten days from the last day for filing petitions. The decision in the case was necessarily postponed by taking testimony and the consequent delay was not unreasonable but fully warranted by the circumstances. In the circumstances the court below did not err in concluding that it was within its discretion in holding the hearing when it did. Appellants are not harmed, if they were successful on the merits they would receive the decision of this court in ample time to place their names on the ballot in the ensuing election.</p>

In all of the cases it is held that the act was not intended to be applied where trial of the prisoner was impossible during the two terms. In the last case it was said at p. 135: “The statute was made to restrain malice and oppression of prosecutors, and to relieve <em>wrongful </em>imprisonment; not to embarrass the administration of the criminal law.” It is well settled that a statute imposing a time limit upon the performance of an act by a public officer or body, is to be construed as intended merely to secure prompt and orderly action and to be directory rather than mandatory: Endlich on the Interpretation of Statutes (1888), sections 436, 437.</p>
