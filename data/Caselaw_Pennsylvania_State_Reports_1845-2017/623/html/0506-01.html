At some point during those early morning hours, Mims, Brewer, and Kristen Holmes decided to buy more cocaine, and therefore sought to contact someone at 110 Chain Street in Norristown, Montgomery County, which was a known drug house. A woman, known as Jennifer Gray and by her real name, Jennifer Pennington, answered the phone, and told the trio that she would attempt to procure more crack cocaine for them.</p>
    <p id="b551-5" data-blocks='[["BL_551.5",551,[183,948,1151,464]]]'>Immediately afterward, Mims, Brewer, and Holmes drove to 110 Chain Street, and Holmes went inside to speak with Pennington. Pennington had been unable to obtain any crack cocaine, and Holmes returned to the car. The three left the house, but then parked a few houses away in anticipation of Pennington calling with information regarding the drugs. Several minutes later, Pennington came outside, directed them to drive to the residence of Jackie Clemens, and went with them.</p>
    <p id="b551-6" data-blocks='[["BL_551.6",551,[180,1453,1153,902]]]'>When they arrived at Clemens’ house, the two women remained in the car while Brewer and Mims went inside, where they found Appellant and Ernest Morris. Brewer and Mims proceeded to rob Appellant and Morris at gunpoint, stealing money, drugs, and cell phones. After completing the robbery, the four who had driven together to Clemens’ house went to a Motel 6 in King of Prussia, where they smoked crack cocaine, drank tequila, and had sex with each other. Brewer, Mims, and Pennington later left Holmes at the Motel 6, and went to a nearby Best Western hotel, where they continued to ingest more narcotics. While at the Best Western, Pennington began using the cell phones Brewer and Mims had stolen from Appellant and Morris. Brewer would later testify that, during one of Pennington’s conversations on one of the stolen phones, she said “Oh, my God, they’re going to kill me. They’re going to kill me.” Notes of Testimony (N.T.), Apr. 15, 2009 at 153.</p>

Apparently, during the robbery, Appellant had recognized Mims, and had come to believe that Pennington was also involved. At approximately 11:30 p.m. on January 30, the three men broke into the home of Mims’ girlfriend, Malaika Bolen, armed with guns: Appellant with an AK-47 rifle; Morris with a .357 revolver; and Jones with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun. They demanded to know Morris’ whereabouts, and, when they were unsuccessful, they forced Bolen and three children into a basement and barricaded the door shut.</p>
    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.4",552,[272,983,1152,580]]]'>Eventually, and after inquiring to several acquaintances concerning the whereabouts of Mims and Pennington, Appellant and his cohorts learned that Pennington was at a Wawa convenience store in King of Prussia. Between 2:00 and 2:30 a.m. (now January 31, 2005), they arrived at the store, saw Pennington inside, and forced her into their vehicle. Surveillance video from inside of the store revealed Pennington present during that time, and clearly pregnant. From Pennington, the men learned that Mims was located in Room 123 of the aforementioned Best Western hotel, and they all went to the hotel and parked outside of Room 123.</p>
    <p id="b552-5" data-blocks='[["BL_552.5",552,[272,1594,1150,471]]]'>Appellant and Morris decided to go into the room, while Jones stayed in the car to guard Pennington. At 3:20 a.m., using an electronic keycard forcibly taken by Appellant from Pennington, Appellant and Morris entered the room, each shot a naked and unarmed Mims once in the back with the AK-47 and .357 revolver, respectively, and fled the scene with Pennington still in the car. Mims died in the hotel room, the bullets having caused catastrophic damage to several major organs.</p>

They forced Pennington from the car and Morris shot her twice in the face with the .357 revolver. Pennington died from her wounds, and her unborn baby did not survive. Appellant and his conspirators then returned to the <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>Best Western to search for their stolen items, and eventually fled to Appellant’s apartment in Philadelphia.</p>

By 4:30 a.m., the police had arrived at Fairmount Park and detectives discovered the body of Jennifer Pennington. A search of her body revealed a receipt for the Best Western hotel, Room 123, in the name of Shawne Mims. Philadelphia homicide detectives and Montgomery County District Attorney detectives went to the hotel, entered the room with a key given to them by the hotel manager, and discovered Mims’ body.</p>

On May 27, 2005, Philadelphia and Montgomery County authorities learned that Appellant was residing in an apartment in Philadelphia. The task force entered the building and arrested Appellant who, immediately upon being taken into custody, stated to the arresting officers, “I’m tired of running.

According to Sadler, who would eventually testify before an investigating grand jury, Appellant indicated that, following being robbed, he felt belittled and disrespected, and thus began the hunt for those whom he felt responsible for the robbery: Mims and Pennington. He related to Sadler how, during the twenty-four hours following the robbery, he invaded the Bolen residence, inquired from <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>other acquaintances if they knew the whereabouts of Mims and Pennington, and eventually discovered Pennington at the King of Prussia Wawa store during the early morning hours of January 31.

In the course thereof, on September 13, 2005, Attorney Daniel-Paul Alva entered his appearance on Appellant’s behalf. Prior to the beginning of trial, Attorney Alva indicated to the trial court that, for personal reasons, he had no inclination to continue to satisfy the educational requirements of Pa. R.Crim.P. 801, regarding the qualification of capital trial counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The context and exact content of the dialogue between <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>the trial court and Attorney Alva are not of record, but unquestionably led to the trial court removing Attorney Alva as lead counsel and appointing new counsel for Appellant.</p>

Appellant and his co-defendants attempted to bar re-trial on double jeopardy grounds and, interestingly, Attorney Alva took the lead in representing Appellant in that process. Subsequently, the trial court denied the motion, the Superior Court affirmed in January of 2008, and this Court denied discretionary review in September of 2008.</p>

The trial court accordingly held a pretrial, evidentiary hearing on March 3, 2009, in order to determine Attorney Alva’s compliance with Rule 801 and his concomitant eligibility to represent Appellant as lead guilt phase counsel. At the hearing, the court first noted that Attorney Alva’s entry of appearance on September 13, 2005, remained valid, and supported his status as continuing counsel in the case. Accordingly, in the view of the trial court, at the time of his appearance Attorney Alva needed only six hours of CLE capital qualification credits in order to be eligible to represent Appellant. With that, the court directed Attorney Alva to testify regarding his compliance (or lack thereof) with Rule 801.</p>

      <em>Id. </em>at 29-30. The court then ended the hearing by indicating its belief that Appellant could not waive the Rule 801 requirements in order to retain Attorney Alva as lead guilt phase counsel, even if Appellant wanted only Attorney Alva to represent him.</p>
    <p id="b557-9" data-blocks='[["BL_557.8",557,[169,1494,1153,636]]]'>When proceedings reconvened on March 30 for several pretrial matters, the trial court began by ruling from the bench regarding Attorney Alva’s eligibility to serve as guilt phase counsel. In the court’s view, “and following in depth research, and exhaustive research and consultation with our criminal administrative judge here,” N.T., Mar. 30, 2009 at 4, Attorney Alva was qualified to serve as guilt phase counsel under the phase-in provisions of Rule 801 because, at least three years prior to having entered his appearance, Attorney Alva possessed six capital case CLE credits. The court then conducted a colloquy of Appellant, who re-affirmed his adamant position that he desired Attorney Alva to represent him.</p>

Brewer testified that, following the robbery of Appellant and Morris, the four of them went to the Motel 6 in King of Prussia. Brewer stated that, during their time at the Motel 6, Pennington began using the mobile phones that he and Mims had stolen from Appellant and Morris during the robbery. At one point, someone “called the cell phone and Jen answered and they told her not to come back to Norris-town. And she started spazzing out, ‘Oh, my God, they’re going to kill me. They’re going to kill me.’ ” N.T., Apr. 15, 2009 at 153. Attorney Alva objected at sidebar that the statement was impermissible hearsay, but the trial court overruled on the grounds that it constituted an excited utterance.</p>
    <p id="b558-5" data-blocks='[["BL_558.4",558,[281,1054,1149,699]]]'>The Commonwealth further elicited the testimony of various crime scene experts, who testified that Mims was shot with bullets consistent with both an AK-47 assault rifle and a .357 revolver; and Pennington was killed with a .357 revolver. To support this testimony, the Commonwealth sought to introduce three photographs of the deceased Jennifer Pennington, specifically the location of entrance and exit wounds in her face and head, to depict for the jury evidence of the specific intent to kill her. Over Appellant’s objection, the court permitted the publication of these photographs to the jury, but for less than thirty seconds each, as relevant evidence depicting Appellant’s specific intent to kill. <em>See </em>N.T., Apr. 17, 2009 at 61-68.</p>

Thus, so long as Attorney Alva met the requirements of Rule 801 on September 13, 2002, three years prior to the entry of appearance, he was qualified to represent Appellant in this case. Citing to the above-quoted examination of Attorney Alva, the Commonwealth contends that the only “equivocation” regarding his qualifications at the time of entry was to whether he had eighteen hours of capital case CLE credits, not the required six. Indeed, the Commonwealth notes, during that examination the Court affirmatively stated that Attorney Alva possessed at least six death penalty education credits at the time of his entry of appearance. In response, Attorney Alva <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>stated that he could not “aver as an officer of the Court that I had the full 18,” N.T., Mar. 3, 2009 at 30, but never equivocated regarding the required six credits.</p>

A difficulty presents itself at the outset because two different manners of waiver are actually implicated here: (1) traditional, issue preservation waiver as contemplated by Pa. R.A.P. 302(a) (“Issues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.”); and (2) the prohibition contained within the comment to Pa. R.Crim.P. 801 that “the educational and experience requirements of the rule may not be waived by the trial or appellate court.” Put differently, Rule 801 proscribes courts from “setting aside” the educational mandates in favor of permitting unqualified counsel to participate in the trial. The confluence of these two notions of waiver in the instant appeal demonstrate the Hob-son’s choice with which defendants in Appellant’s position are faced, because advocating for one’s choice of counsel and objecting to a court’s appointment of that choice of counsel are mutually exclusive. Thus, we expect that the majority of defendants will not preserve an objection on an issue in which <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>they received a favorable ruling, permitting representation by the defendant’s choice of counsel.</p>

The Commonwealth, as Appellee, makes the obvious “issue preservation waiver” argument due to Appellant’s failure to lodge an objection in the trial court, while Appellant responds in his reply brief that waiver cannot exist merely because the trial court held a full merits hearing concerning Attorney Alva’s qualifications under Rule 801. While this Court generally is loath to decide the merits of issues before examining questions of waiver, we find both sides’ positions facially meritorious but substantially underdeveloped. Because of the lack of advocacy on this important issue, we believe the better course is to decide the relatively straightforward merits question, given that the arguments thereon are fully developed.</p>

As the Commonwealth points out, Attorney Alva only “equivocated” concerning whether he had eighteen hours of capital case CLE credits in the three years leading up to his entry of appearance. This “equivocation” seems to be the result of the contention during the March 3 hearing over whether Attorney Alva needed the credit hours required at the time of the hearing being conducted (eighteen), or at the time he entered his appearance in 2005 (six). As noted, the parties now agree that he only needed six credits.</p>

The Commonwealth argues that the aggravating and mitigating circumstances for each of the three murders were different, and the court gave and instructed the jury concerning three separate verdict slips. Importantly, in the Commonwealth’s view, neither the instructions nor the verdict slip regarding Jennifer Pennington’s murder were in error. To that end, the Commonwealth notes that notwithstanding the erroneous submission of the unborn child’s murder to the jury for death penalty consideration, the jury would still have been able to consider the unborn child’s death as an aggravating circumstance related to Pennington’s murder. Thus, the Commonwealth notes that the impermissible submission did not alter or enhance its case in any way; the jury would still have heard all the evidence relevant to the death of the unborn child during the penalty phase and properly considered that evidence as an aggravator in assessing life or death for Pennington’s murder.</p>

Only one of those prospective jurors questioned during the second day was accepted onto the panel (Juror # 10), and our review of the record indicates that the other principal and alternate jurors were not questioned in this regard.

Indeed, given the standard, I do not even view the question as close. I come to this conclusion for many of the same reasons postulated by the Majority. My central difference is that I would squarely place the ground for decision upon the absence of harmless error, which is the usual manner by which we measure prejudice on direct appeal when an error is found or conceded. For the <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>same reason, I see no need to resort to the Court’s statutory review for passion, prejudice and arbitrariness under 42 Pa. C.S. § 9711(h)(3)(i).</p>

I write separately merely to reiterate that stating that capital cases are “subjected to the closest scrutiny,” Majority Op., at 549, 83 A.3d at 163, should not be construed as affording a more complete level of scrutiny to capital cases. As I have previously expressed, relaxing requirements of proof for capital defendants or affording these cases greater scrutiny than is given others does not afford those others the equal protection of the laws. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The right to counsel inures to the capital defendant, the felon, and the misdemeanant alike.”). Defendants not convicted of capital murder do not get scrutiny that is less close, nor do they deserve “less exacting review” than capital defendants.</p>
