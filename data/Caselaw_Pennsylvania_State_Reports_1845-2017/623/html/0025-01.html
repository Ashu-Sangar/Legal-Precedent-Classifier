The court gave several reasons for this determination, namely, that (1) the employer could not be held accountable based on a claimant’s possibly untimely application for the listed jobs; (2) such “open and available” jobs showed that <em>similar </em>positions existed or would likely open; and (3) the Act places a burden on the claimant to actively look for work once cleared for such activity, without regard to receipt of the employer’s labor market survey.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

      <em>Amicus curiae, </em>the Pennsylvania Association for Justice (the “Association”), filed a brief in support of Appellant’s appeal. The Association argues that it is illogical to interpret Section 306(b)(2) in any manner other than that its concept of jobs that “exist” must mean gainful employment that is open and available to a claimant; otherwise, the statute’s reference to “job listings” would be mere surplusage. Further, the Association contends that Appellant’s evidence in this case that there was no offer of employment following her application for the jobs listed in the labor market surveys is simply a relevant and effective way to test the credibility of Employer’s earning power assessment. Such evidence goes to the heart of the issue of whether jobs are open and available to a claimant, and a WCJ is capable of making the appropriate credibility determinations when presented with such evidence, as the WCJ did in the instant case.</p>

This is the position taken by Employer in the instant case. Here, Employer contends that, because the WCJ accepted Employer’s relevant proof over Appellant’s conflicting evidence indicating that she was not physically capable of performing the jobs listed in Employer’s labor market surveys, this circumstance effectively ends the matter, and accordingly, Employer prevails under Section 306(b), rendering irrelevant Appellant’s testimony concerning her lack of success in her good faith efforts to obtain one of these jobs.</p>

Further, I agree with Employer that the majority’s construction of Section 306(b)(2) circles back to the <em>Kachinski </em>regime, undermining the General Assembly’s effort — via the Act 57 amendments to the workers’ compensation scheme — to prospectively redirect modification inquiries away from the previously prevailing concern with claimants’ follow-through experience with job referrals.</p>

However, the enactment of Act 57 was precipitated primarily by concerns with the rising cost of workers’ compensation insurance and the concomitant loss of business to other states. <em>See, e.g., </em>S. Legis. J., 1996 Reg. Sess. 2034 (June 5, 1996) (statement of Sen. Loeper) (“[I]f you talk to people and ask, what is your number one concern in Pennsylvania in conducting business and keeping business and keep<a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>ing jobs, I think the answer you will hear is the rates of workers’ compensation insurance premium costs.”). Indeed, Act 57 was introduced as a method of balancing the interests of injured workers with employers’ financial concerns. <em>See, e.g., </em>H. Legis. J., 1996 Reg. Sess. 1602 (June 19, 1996) (statement of Rep. Perzel) (“This legislation is reasonable — it reflects a blending of concern for Pennsylvania’s economic position and our historic commitment to workers who are injured on the job.”). Notably, several legislators also mentioned that Act 57 would discourage fraud and malingering while at the same time encourage the recipients of workers’ compensation benefits to make efforts to return to the workforce and obtain gainful employment such that they can contribute to their own earnings. <em>See, e.g., </em>S. Legis. J., 1996 Reg. Sess. 2159 (June 19, 1996) (statement of Sen. Loeper) (“[0]ne of the main, key components that we want to look at in the legislation before us today is to provide the payment of benefits only to legitimate claimants.”); <em>id. </em>at 2169 (“The primary goal is to get people back to work, back to work on their job or another job instead of staying on workers’ compensation.”). Similarly, Act 57 was viewed as a means of staunching the exponential growth of litigation and related costs following <em>Kachinski. See, e.g., </em>S. Legis. J., 1996 Reg. Sess. 2160 (June 19,1996) (statement of Sen. Loeper) (“I think the goal also ... is to try to reduce costs associated with litigation and the administration of workers’ compensation claims.”); <em>see generally </em>David B.

Barbieri, and Selected Precedents, </em>20 Widener L.J. 87, 132 (2010) (stating that Kachinski “gave rise to significant litigation, and in most cases ... the litigation would be protracted as well” (footnote omitted)).</p>

It is far more consistent with the overall purport of Act 57 and the language of Section 306(b)(2) to interpret the passage alluding to employment which “exists” as addressing the claimant’s vocational and physical capabilities in correlation with the types of jobs found by a workers’ compensation judge to exist in the marketplace through an assessment of the required expert opinion evidence. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 512(2) (“Disability partial in character shall apply if the employe <em>is able </em>to perform his previous work or <em>can ... </em>engage in any other kind of substantial gainful employment which exists in the usual employment area ...” (emphasis added)).</p>

According to the essential purport of the majority opinion, however, such framework effectively binds only employers, not claimants. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 48, 81 A.3d at 844 (sanctioning the admission into evidence of the “claimant’s actual experience with the employers identified in the employer’s labor market surveys”). Thus, the majority posits, claimants may treat the labor-market evidence as, essentially, a series of Kachinski-like job referrals. <em>See id. </em>at 48, 81 A.3d at 844 (stating that the employer’s expert evidence serves “as a mechanism for providing the claimant with notice of the existence of these jobs, which thus provides a serious opportunity to secure employment”). The majority believes these then may tested, as under the <em>Kachinski </em>regime, by claimants undertaking job interviews and adducing evidence of the actual unavailability of jobs to them. Via <em>reductio ad absurdum </em>logic, the majority posits, the alternative is to accept that an employer could identify a single open job to establish the earnings power of a multitude of claimants, although only one claimant could actually obtain this employment. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 49, 81 A.3d at 845.</p>

Given that Section 306(b)(2) redirects the focus of the salient aspect of the earnings power assessment to the job market, evidence of the unavailability of particular jobs to a particular claimant (based on whatever myriad range of considerations which individual, discrete employers may deem pertinent to their hiring decisions) is simply no longer relevant under the statutory scheme.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

The WCJ credited the testimony of Employer’s medical and vocational experts and discredited the contrary testimony of Claimant’s experts. <em>See Shoap v.

Indeed, the WCJ specifically concluded that Employer established that the jobs listed in the labor market survey “were compatible with Claimant’s residual functional capacity for work and voc ationally suitable for Claimant.” <em>Id. </em>at 4, ¶ 2, A-6.
