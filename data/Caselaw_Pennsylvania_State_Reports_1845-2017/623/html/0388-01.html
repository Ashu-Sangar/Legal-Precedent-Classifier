There, the officer purchased several packets of crack cocaine from Appellant, who then entered the locked residence using a key.</p>
    <p id="b430-7" data-blocks='[["BL_430.6",430,[284,1221,1151,839]]]'>The following day, officers observed Appellant repeatedly entering the Creighton Street house with the key. During surveillance, no one other than Appellant was seen entering or exiting the premises. Police then executed a search warrant at the property and arrested Appellant on the first floor. On his person, Appellant had some cash and the key he used for entry. A search of the second floor uncovered: (1) from the front bedroom, a cellular telephone, a small electronic scale, and various drug-related paraphernalia; (2) from the middle bedroom, a clear plastic baggie containing fourteen packets of crack cocaine; (3) from the only bathroom in the house, a clear plastic baggie containing PCP; and (4) from the rear bedroom, a handgun loaded with seven live rounds. <em>See </em>N.T., July 29, 2008, at 8-12. No drugs or paraphernalia were discovered in the rear bedroom which contained the firearm. <em>See id. </em>at 48.</p>

At a pre-trial conference, Appellant argued that the charge of possession of <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>an instrument of crime should be quashed, “given [the] lack of nexus between [Appellant] and that weapon and someone else’s room.” N.T., Jan. 22, 2008, at 2. Over opposition by the Commonwealth, a common pleas judge quashed the charge, without explaining the reasoning underlying such ruling. <em>See id. </em>at 3.</p>

Of material significance to the common pleas court’s treatment of the mandatory-minimum issue, the Commonwealth asserted that such plea subsumed an admission to possession of all of the drugs, including those located on the second floor of the Creighton Street residence. <em>See </em>N.T., July 29, 2008, at 50.

During the course of the proceeding, Appellant indicated that he did not own the Creighton Street property, but he had been given the key by the owner’s son, a person who Appellant said he knew only as “K.” <em>See </em>N.T., July 29, 2008, at 23, 26-27. Appellant also stated that, to the best of his knowledge, no other person had a key to the house, <em>see id., </em>and he was the only person selling drugs from that location, <em>see id. </em>at 45. According to Appellant, he was unaware of the firearm’s presence in the house, <em>see id. </em>at 60-61, and he never ventured onto the second floor, <em>see id. </em>at 32.</p>

While it is possible to exercise a substantial degree of “control” without knowledge (as, for example, a weapon might surreptitiously be slipped into a bag carried by the defendant), the longstanding understanding of constructive possession and/or constructive control incorporates a scienter requirement. <em>See, e.g., Macolino, </em><a href="/pa/503/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="503 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1785926" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0201-01">503 Pa. at 206</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="503 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1785926" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0201-01">469 A.2d at 134</a>.

Contrary to the Commonwealth’s perspective, however, we do not regard proof of the identified sets of circumstances as necessarily sufficient to establish “physical possession or control,” independent of the requirements for the latter. In this regard, the statute’s transition to the examples is too casual and ambiguous, and the examples themselves are too tersely stated, to establish a self-sufficient role.

It is not just possession of a firearm that triggers the added penalty, however — the crime after all is a drug crime, not a firearm crime. It is undoubtedly proof of a connection, beyond possession or control, between the possessed firearm and the drug crime that makes the statute applicable, a connection established by one of the enumerated circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b451-11" data-blocks='[["BL_451.11",451,[193,1976,1149,149]],["BL_452.1",452,[268,313,1153,351]]]'>The applicable circumstance here is “close proximity,” a redundant and tautologically imprecise measurement. If the legislature recognized that the connection between firearms <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>and drugs is not established by specific linear measure, such imprecision is understandable. The legislature could easily have- said “ten feet” or “20 yards,” but it did not — ten feet might show a disconnect in one situation, while 20 yards might be quite proximate in another. The proof required is enough to allow a reasonable fact-finder to say this firearm was in close proximity to these drugs.</p>
    <p id="b452-5" data-blocks='[["BL_452.4",452,[269,683,1154,655]]]'>As the facts of each case affect that determination, I would not attempt to further define the phrase as does the majority, and I respectfully cannot agree with reading “close proximity” to necessarily mean “very near.” <em>See </em>Majority Op., at 411, 82 A.3d at 1038. Neither do I agree with the attendant disapproval of <em>Commonwealth v. Sanes, </em><a href="/a2d/955/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="955 A.2d 369" data-case-ids="8209085" data-case-paths="/a2d/955/0369-01">955 A.2d 369</a>, 377 (Pa.Super.2008), and its progeny. <em>See </em>Majority Op., at 411-13, 82 A.3d at 1038-39. I would instead attach a general, totality of the circumstances analysis to the “close proximity” inquiry, which would allow trial courts to consider all factors made relevant by the circumstances, rather than deeming some unspecified but insufficient linear distance to preclude further consideration.</p>
    <p id="b452-6" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[270,1366,1155,821]]]'>Actual distance is of course relevant, but it should not be preclusive of other factors that maybe more relevant in a given case. In cosmic terms, we may say the earth is very near the moon. In a large warehouse processing mass quantities of drugs, an arsenal of firearms used by the dealers but stored in a locker one hundred yards away may be closely proximate, while a matter of a few yards in a house with many occupants might disconnect a firearm from the drugs under the circumstances. If a person from out-of-town phoned appellant from half a mile away to confirm he was on the way to make a buy, could he say he was very near? If he asked if appellant had a firearm, appellant could honestly answer that he did, and it was very near. The concept of nearness depends on the situation, and I find the words in the statute reflect the need for such flexibility. For analytical purposes, the issue is not determined by physical distance alone.</p>
    <p id="b452-7" data-blocks='[["BL_452.6",452,[272,2207,1151,146]],["BL_453.1",453,[179,314,1153,366]]]'>In the present case, I find the evidence of record regarding the specifics of the residence and location of the drugs and firearm, coupled -with other evidence of appellant’s exclusive <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>use of the residence to sell drugs and admission to possessing all the drugs located therein, sufficient to find control and close proximity. Thus, I would affirm and not remand; however, understanding that remand has been ordered, I believe the directed inquiry should be whether the drugs and the firearm were in “close proximity,” not whether “[a]ppellant was in constructive control of the firearm[.]” <em>Id., </em>at 1040.</p>
    <p id="b453-4" data-blocks='[["BL_453.4",453,[224,709,825,42]]]'>For the above reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>
