The jury concluded, with respect to the circumstances of the murder of Mendez Thomas, that the aggravating factors did not outweigh the mitigating factors, and thus imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. With <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>respect to the murder of Lisa Diaz, the jury concluded that the aggravating factors, which included that the killing occurred during perpetration of a felony burglary and that Appellant had murdered Mendez Thomas only seconds before, outweighed the mitigating circumstances. Thus, the jury imposed a sentence of death for that offense. The main issue presented in the present appeal is whether the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s verdicts of guilty with respect to burglary and conspiracy to commit burglary. Appellant argues that because there was insufficient evidence to prove that the killings had been committed during the perpetration of a felony, the jury considered a non-existing aggravating circumstance when it imposed the sentence of death. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.4",302,[287,1064,1150,942]]]'>The facts, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict-winner, are that on October 16, 2007, Appellant and two co-conspirators, Alex Martinez (“Martinez”) and Steven Miranda (“Miranda”) (collectively “the trio”), spent the evening hours smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol at various locations in Philadelphia and Bucks County. At some point during the night, the trio decided that they would go to the Bucks County apartment of Mendez Thomas (“Thomas”) to assault him. Miranda arranged by phone to meet Thomas under the ruse of wanting to procure marijuana. Appellant drove the trio to Thomas’s apartment in a tan Ford Explorer. When they arrived near midnight, Thomas and his paramour, Jessica Carmona (“Carmona”), who shared the apartment with Thomas and their two young children, were not home. Instead, Lisa Diaz (“Diaz”), the sister of Carmona and the girlfriend of Miranda, was in the apartment with the two children. She opened the door to Miranda and the trio entered.</p>

Thomas began to retreat down a hallway toward a bedroom. Appellant advanced into the hallway and shot Thomas in the head from a distance of six to ten inches, <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>killing him instantly. Appellant emerged from the hallway, turned, and fired two shots at Diaz, one of which struck her in the shoulder, and she fell to the floor. Appellant then advanced to where she lay and shot her in the head. Prior to fleeing the apartment, Appellant fired a shot at Carmona, who was in a protective fetal position on the floor, shielding her two-year-old son beneath her. The bullet passed completely through Carmona’s leg, and she was able to get up and call 911. She informed the dispatcher that numerous persons had been shot, identified “Alfonso” as the shooter, and stated that the shooting had been “a set-up.” Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”) Trial, 9/22/08, at 176.</p>

Both men were charged with multiple counts of criminal homicide and related offenses including burglary and conspiracy to commit burglary for their roles in the events of the previous night. Appellant, meanwhile, had fled to Altoona, but soon returned to Horsham, Montgomery County, to the home of a boyhood friend. He was apprehended there on October 25, 2007, while attempting to conceal himself in an upper floor bathroom of that residence. Three days later, the police recovered the Ford Explorer that Appellant had been driving on the night of the killings. The vehicle was registered in the name of Appellant’s mother, and a 9 mm. handgun, later determined to be the murder weapon, was retrieved from the rear passenger-side floor of the vehicle. Appellant was charged with multiple counts of criminal homicide and related offenses, including burglary and conspiracy to commit burglary.</p>

It was continued first until December 7, 2007, at the request of Appellant’s counsel, Jack McMahon, and then twice more, both times at Mr. McMahon’s request, until February 8, 2008. On that date, counsel for Appellant’s co-<a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>defendants were present, but Mr. McMahon failed to appear; the Magisterial District Justice conducted the preliminary hearing despite Mr. McMahon’s absence, and all charges against all defendants were held for court.</p>

On that date, the court received a letter by facsimile indicating that Mr. McMahon was out of the country on a pre-paid vacation until March 15, 2008; the court dismissed the remand motion. Ultimately, despite the court’s dismissal of the motion, the Commonwealth agreed to re-conduct Appellant’s preliminary hearing. On May 22, 2008, a second preliminary hearing just for Appellant took place with counsel present, and the charges against Appellant, including burglary and conspiracy to commit burglary, were once again held for court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The Commonwealth further theorized that once inside, during the assault on Thomas, Appellant, who had brought a handgun, shot three people, killing two of them. The defense theory of the case was that Appellant had only intended to obtain marijuana from Thomas, had no knowledge of any weapon, and was simply present at the scene when Miranda went on a homicidal rampage.</p>

He testified that he had recovered bullets and/or fragments from within the wall in the hallway next to where Thomas’s body had been found; from within a closet door in the living room; from "within linens and sheets in that closet; and also from the concrete in the floor beneath the living room carpet.

He also testified that on October 28, 2007, he recovered a 9 mm. Hi-Point Luger from the rear passenger-side floor of a tan Ford Explorer registered to Darlene Sanchez, Appellant’s mother. Montgomery County Detective John Finor, a firearms and ballistics expert, testified that, by using tool-mark identification procedures, he had determined that the bullets, fragments and casings recovered from the crime scene had been fired from the 9 mm.

Photos of the newspaper clippings were marked as trial exhibits and entered into evidence. Defense counsel did not object to their admissibility, conceding that they were relevant to show consciousness of guilt. However, counsel did object to publishing a photo of one of the clippings to the jury. Below the main headline, the challenged clipping contained a smaller headline that read: “DA: Two were killed over drug debt.” Counsel maintained that there had not been any evidence presented by that point in the trial to substantiate any motive for the shootings. The court agreed, and the photo of that clipping was not published to the jury. A photo of the remaining clipping with a headline that read “Authorities Vow to Find Shooter,” that showed a photo of Appellant, named him, identified him as wanted and warned that he should be considered armed and dangerous, was published to the jury. The court gave the jury a cautionary instruction that the photo was introduced only for the limited purpose to show that the newspaper had been in Appellant’s possession at the time he was apprehended.</p>

She testified' that Thomas had sold marijuana occasionally, and had sold marijuana to Miranda in the past. At approximately 10:30 p.m. on the night in question, she and Thomas had gone to visit a neighbor in an apartment across the hall from theirs. Carmona’s sister, Lisa Diaz, remained in the apartment, baby-sitting for the children. While in the neighbor’s apartment, Thomas consumed several beers and smoked some marijuana.

The call was from Miranda, Diaz’s boyfriend, who inquired about procuring some marijuana from Thomas. Thomas told Miranda that he would call Miranda later to finalize the details of an exchange. During that conversation, Carmona also heard another voice broadcast, pretending to be Miranda; she believed the voice had been that of Appellant, whom Carmona had known from the neighborhood but had not seen for years. Carmona took the phone from Thomas and asked, “Who is this?” to which the caller replied “Steven [Miranda],” to which Carmona retorted, “This is not Steven.” N.T. Trial, 9/22/08, at 149-151.</p>

At that point, Diaz placed herself between Thomas and Appellant, and said, “No. This is not going to happen.” <em>Id. </em>at 163. Carmona testified that she then told Appellant and the others, “You have to get out of my house.” <em>Id. </em>She further testified that Miranda then handed a CD player and headphones to Martinez. At that point, Thomas began walking from the living room toward a hallway leading to a bedroom. Carmona testified she then saw Appellant walk toward the hallway, draw a gun from his waist and raise it. Carmona then screamed out to Thomas “get the gun,” referring to a .45 caliber handgun she kept in a closet in the bedroom. <em>Id. </em>at 226. Carmona testified that she saw Appellant point the gun he had drawn from his waist at Thomas and pull the trigger, and heard the shot but did not see Thomas fall because her view was obstructed by the hallway wall.

Carmona testified that she grabbed her son at that point and “I covered him. I fell to the floor, and covered him, because I knew I was going to be next.” <em>Id. </em>at 172. She testified that she assumed a fetal position on the floor, covering her son with her entire body.

Moreover, Carmona testified that during the time she “was on the phone with 9-1-1,” she had been searching for her handgun but could not find it, so she told the dispatcher that she thought her gun had been taken by Appellant. <em>Id. </em>She then testified that after the police arrived, they “went to go look for it [her gun], they found it.” <em>Id. </em>She concluded her direct-examination testimony by stating that she had no doubt in her mind that Appellant had been the person who had shot her and who had killed Thomas and Diaz. <em>Id. </em>at 180.</p>

Appellant first drove the trio to a liquor store, where Appellant purchased a bottle of vodka, and then to the home of a friend of Appellant in Hatboro, Bucks County. At the Hatboro residence, the trio and Appellant’s friend drank vodka and smoked marijuana and Appellant’s friend smoked “crack” while Appellant repeatedly played a song on his friend’s sound system entitled “Somebody’s Gonna Die Tonight” by a rap artist named “50 Cent.” N.T.

With respect to any possible license to enter, the jury heard uncontroverted testimony that Appellant had never been inside the victims’ apartment before the night in question. Moreover, Carmona testified that, in her opinion, the shootings had been a “set up,” because only Miranda had known where she and Thomas resided, and Miranda had not disclosed that Appellant would be coming with him. From this evidence, the jury could have reasonably inferred that had <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>Carmona, Thomas or Diaz known that Appellant was with Miranda, they would have denied the trio entry. Moreover, even if the victims had been aware that Appellant was with Miranda and knowingly permitted Appellant and Miranda entry to conduct a marijuana transaction, Martinez testified that obtaining marijuana had been a ruse. With additional regard to deception, during Miranda’s call to Thomas, ostensibly to arrange a meeting to procure marijuana, Appellant took the phone and attempted to disguise his voice. With regard to intent to commit a crime, Appellant urged Miranda that, once they were inside the apartment, Miranda should prove himself to Appellant and should not simply “bullshit,” but should vigorously “fight.” Moreover, Martinez was to be Miranda’s “backup” and would provide assistance in the “fight” if necessary.</p>

Diaz opened the door to her boyfriend Miranda, and greeted him and Martinez in a friendly fashion, but became immediately frightened when Appellant entered. When Thomas and Carmona arrived, Appellant gave Carmona a threatening look and asked “do you remember me?” Within two minutes of the arrival of Thomas and Carmona, a physical and verbal confrontation took place between Appellant and Thomas, during which Appellant pushed Thomas toward Miranda.

At trial, the jury learned that in exchange for the Commonwealth’s agreement to withdraw the remaining charges against Martinez, he had pled guilty to burglary and conspiracy to commit burglary, was awaiting sentencing on those charges, and had agreed to testify for the Commonwealth. Martinez affirmatively testified that the crime the trio had intended to commit inside Thomas’s and Carmona’s apartment was an assault. Although the court gave the jury a “corrupt and polluted source” instruction with respect to his testimony, the jury nonetheless could have properly and reasonably concluded that the conspiratorial agreement, so far as Martinez knew and expected to be involved in with his co-conspirators, was limited in scope to a burglary for the purpose of committing an assault.</p>

Trial, 9/24/08, at 110. Given the events that transpired before and after that private meeting, as reflected by the evidence at trial, the jury could have reasonably concluded that in addition to forming a limited agreement with Martinez (to aid Appellant’s deceptive entry into the premises), Appellant had formed a separate and additional conspiracy with Miranda to take a gun into the apartment and to Are the weapon at Thomas in the presence of the other occupants of the apartment.</p>

There was also evidence that it was Miranda who, the day after the killing, had expressed concern that a bullet may have been left at the location where he had parked Appellant’s vehicle. We determine that the circumstantial evidence was sufficient for the jury to convict Appellant of conspiracy to commit criminal homicide, conspiracy to commit aggravated assault, and conspiracy to possess an instrument of crime on the basis that those crimes arose from discrete conspiratorial agreements between Appellant and Miranda, separate from the one in which Martinez was Appellant’s criminal partner and co-conspirator.</p>

Indeed, counsel expressly argued to the jury that a particular portion of Carmona’s testimony had been “total fabrication,” that some of the facts to which she testified had “never happened,” and that Martinez had given police a “famous lie statement, where he lied, lied, lied.” N.T. Trial, 9/29/08, at 49-55. Then, with an almost theatrical flair as evidenced by the phraseology and rhetorical technique employed, defense counsel addressed the prosecutor by name and beseeched “Mr. Gambardella” to explain why Miranda would tell Martinez to lie to the police. In practically the next breath, counsel followed up on that theme by arguing to the jury, “[W]ho comes in and tells that same lie? Jessica Carmona. Hmmm, what a coincidence. Why is she telling the same lie? The same lie.” <em><a href="/us/483/0756-01" class="citation" data-index="123" data-cite="483 U.S. 756" data-case-ids="28110" data-case-paths="/us/483/0756-01">Id.</a> </em>Conversely, when counsel commented to the jury about Appellant’s testimony, he repeatedly characterized it as “the truth.” <em>Id. </em>at 87-88.</p>

Credibility was a fundamental aspect of this case given the conflicting versions of events presented by the witnesses. In recognition of this important aspect of the case, a large portion of defense counsel’s closing argument was understandably directed at the credibility of the Commonwealth’s witnesses. It is clear that the prosecutor’s attack upon Appellant’s credibility was in response to, and was commensurate with, the preceding defense attacks upon the credibility of Carmona and Martinez.

The trial court explained, in its supplemental Rule 1925(a) opinion, that a curative instruction was not necessary because the comment was not so inflammatory that its unavoidable effect would have been to render the jury incapable of returning a fair verdict. Additionally, the court explained that it had purposely declined to give a curative instruction in order to avoid unnecessarily exaggerating the significance of the remark.

Appellant raises a point in support of relaxed waiver that may not have been squarely posed in the prior cases. He argues that restricting statutory review to preserved claims and declining to review defaulted claims under the aegis of statutory PPA review “render[s] this Court’s Section 9711(h)(3) statutory duty a nullity.” According to appellant, because he could obtain “substantive review of any claim that has been preserved below on its own merit, review for the influence of passion and prejudice would only duplicate what has already be [sic] done.” Appellant’s Reply Brief at 7. In my view, this argument is mistaken for multiple reasons. First, although the statutory standard is vague, nothing in the statute purports to excuse issue preservation, particularly with respect to the sort of garden variety issues posed here.

The General Assembly in the 1970s evidently was intent upon reinstituting the prospect of capital punishment in Pennsylvania, adopting three separate review schemes in the wake of <em>Furman </em>and its progeny. In that volatile era, it made sense to track a statute that withstood an Eighth Amendment challenge in the High Court; why bait the bear? But in the 37 years since <em>Gregg </em>was decided, the High Court’s decisional <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>pronouncements have channeled and narrowed the instances in which death may be pursued, how penalty-relevant evidence may be considered by a factfinder, and procedurally how the death sentence may be imposed at trial and survive appellate scrutiny. PPA review was designed to reduce the risk of an arbitrary or “freakish” sentence of death; <em>pre-Furman </em>juries with unbridled discretion had been free to indulge their passions and prejudices, including racial prejudice. The jurisprudence beginning with <em>Gregg </em>has done with specifics what PPA review sought to accomplish with a vague command; those cases have established rules and procedures that severely restrict the potentiality for a sentence of death to conform with Eighth Amendment requirements, and yet still pose a circumstance where the sentence was a result of “passion, prejudice or arbitrariness,” requiring correction in advance of post-conviction review. To be sure, I still support the exception to direct appeal waiver left open in <em>Freeman, </em>respecting defaulted claims of primary constitutional magnitude. But, PPA review is not required to reach those claims, and it should not be employed to reinvigorate defaulted claims that bear no resemblance to the primary constitutional infirmities that led to <em>Furman. </em>In short, statutory PPA review is not a nullity, as appellant says; the intervening decisional law has made it a redundancy. The extensive statutory and decisional restrictions governing the penalty phase of trial, and the ensuing appeal, ensure a robust PPA review just by reaching preserved claims. The PCRA then acts as a second and separate PPA safeguard. The General Assembly may want to revisit PPA review and eliminate the redundancy, as it did when it eliminated proportionality review. Pending legislative reconsideration, the proper way to engage PPA review is per the approach in Boczkowski<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_8" id="ref_footnote_2_8">5</a>

The common denominator in these cases affecting the practical administration of criminal justice within the States is that the U.S. Supreme Court has frequently laid down a broad new constitutional rule, a new refinement, or a new directive, whose consequences in practical implementation <em>(e.g., Atkins) </em>or effect upon state processes <em>(e.g., Martinez </em>and <em>Trevino), </em>in application to new factual scenarios <em>(e.g., Crawford), </em>or in retroactive application <em>{e.g., Miller), </em>is not at all clear. Courts and legislatures should be mindful of the peril in prediction, and should be sensitive to the distinct issues of state law arising in the wake of volatile innovations in federal constitutional law. <em>See, generally, Cunningham, </em><a href="/pa/622/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="310" data-cite="622 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="4281018" data-case-paths="/pa/622/0543-01">622 Pa. 543</a>, <a href="/pa/622/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="311" data-cite="81 A.3d 1" data-case-ids="4281018,7301191" data-case-paths="/pa/622/0543-01,/a3d/81/0001-01">81 A.3d 1</a> (Castille, C.J., concurring).</p>
