    <p id="b515-9" data-blocks='[["BL_515.8",515,[182,1149,1153,636]]]'>This is a direct appeal from an order of the Bucks County Common Pleas Court, imposing two death sentences after Appellant Robert Diamond pled guilty to the first degree murders of Angel Guadalupe and Reginald Woodson. Appellant raises claims of trial court error relating only to the penalty phase of trial, including challenges to the finding of statutory aggravating circumstances and the failure to find mitigating circumstances, challenges to the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and a claim that his sentence of death was based on arbitrary factors. As we conclude that Appellant’s issues lack merit, we affirm his conviction and judgment of sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In 2002, Appellant began working as a forklift operator at the Simon &amp; Schuster book warehouse in Bristol Borough, Bucks County. Appellant, who is Caucasian, had engaged in several arguments with fellow employee Kalif Crump, who is African American, and believed that management had unfairly sided <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>with Crump. Appellant had also engaged in verbal confrontations with Crump’s mother, Debra Vorters, who likewise worked at Simon &amp; Schuster. Shop Steward Reginald Wood-son, who was friendly with Crump and Vorters, would intervene in some of the altercations, and separate the parties.</p>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[266,584,1150,574]]]'>In April of 2008, management terminated Appellant’s employment after he failed to report to work for several days without explanation. Nearly four months later, on the afternoon of August 1, 2008, Appellant made an audio tape of what he referred to as his “last will and testament” as he drove to Simon &amp; Schuster to seek revenge for the purported harassment he had suffered during his employment. In the recording, Appellant stated that he had no place in the world, that the last six years he spent at Simon <em>&amp; </em>Schuster had been a “living hell,” and that time was running out because he lacked money to pay his rent.</p>
    <p id="b516-6" data-blocks='[["BL_516.5",516,[269,1181,1150,785]]]'>Appellant further stated that Crump was “the main perpetrator of all this shit but people gave him the intelligence and the -will and the support to £__k with the good white man cause it’d be good for black power, that’s Debra [Vorters] and Reggie [Woodson], and I don’t think I can wait any longer than today.” Commonwealth Exhibit 30. As he drove into the Simon <em>&amp; </em>Schuster parking lot, Appellant stated “[t]hat little black boy’s car is not there, so unless he’s got a ride, I’ll have to hope that there’s higher justice for him.” <em>Id. </em>Appellant ended his oral diatribe by facetiously thanking his mother and sisters for not helping him obtain his inheritance from his aunt. He stated, “if I had one little bit of that money, five, ten, I could get this little kick out of my system, you know, and provide for myself until I either die of natural causes or clean my act up.” <em>Id.</em>

Appellant was well aware that when the shift ended, employees waited in a line at the door to “clock out” and exit the warehouse onto the loading dock platform, which was adjacent to the parking lot. Appellant parked his car in the lot next to the van of Sonia Santiago, <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>who was seated in the vehicle with her three children, waiting to pick up her husband, Miguel Santiago, after his shift. At that time, employee Vanessa Gonzalez observed fellow employee Angel Guadalupe exit the building onto the loading dock, climb down the stairs to the parking lot, and walk towards Guadalupe’s white sports utility vehicle (“SUV”), a vehicle similar to that driven by Crump.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b517-5" data-blocks='[["BL_517.4",517,[169,696,1152,517]]]'>While brandishing a Smith and Wesson .40 caliber handgun, Appellant walked in front of Sonia Santiago’s van towards Angel Guadalupe’s SUV, said “shh” to Santiago, and gestured for her to remain quiet. As Guadalupe backed his SUV out of the parking space, Appellant ran over and began firing shots into the vehicle. Guadalupe attempted to exit the SUV, but Appellant continued firing until at least six rounds had been discharged, and Guadalupe had fallen from the vehicle onto the road. It was eventually determined that two bullets resulted in fatal injuries.</p>
    <p id="b517-6" data-blocks='[["BL_517.5",517,[165,1237,1155,520]]]'>Several individuals observed Appellant shoot Guadalupe, including: Gonzalez, who was standing on the loading dock; Santiago, who quickly drove her van away from the scene after she observed the shooting; the driver of a SEPTA bus carrying seven passengers, which was located fifteen to twenty yards away from Guadalupe’s SUV; a resident in a retirement community located approximately twenty to twenty-five feet behind Guadalupe’s vehicle who called 9-1-1 when the shots were fired; a security guard in a nearby guard shack; and individuals smoking cigarettes on the loading dock.</p>

Appellant thereafter encountered others in the parking lot, but did not fire his weapon. Moments later, Woodson left the warehouse to investigate, walked toward Appellant, and asked him what he was doing. Woodson then abruptly turned away from Appellant, and ran up the stairs to <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>the loading dock in an effort to get back inside the warehouse. When Woodson reached the top step, Appellant, who was then approximately twenty-nine yards away, fatally shot Woodson in the back. Gonzalez, along with other employees, was standing behind Woodson in the doorway of the loading dock when Woodson was shot, and Gonzalez observed Appellant fire his weapon. Maria Brown, a motorist driving by the warehouse at the time, also witnessed Appellant fire shots at Woodson.</p>
    <p id="b518-5" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[276,794,1153,410]]]'>Police officers arrived promptly and observed Guadalupe’s body lying on the road. Upon seeing the officers, Appellant, who was still holding his weapon, raised the gun to his own head. The officers drew their weapons, and Appellant responded by stating, “I’m not shooting anymore.” Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”), Mar. 6, 2009, at 33. When the officers instructed Appellant to lay down his weapon and get on the ground, he complied, acting in a calm manner.</p>
    <p id="b518-6" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[279,1227,1150,623]]]'>At approximately 3:45 p.m., additional police officers responded to the scene.

      <em> </em>warnings and transported him from the scene. After again being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Appellant admitted to police that he shot Guadalupe. He indicated that he did not personally know Guadalupe, who was of Hispanic descent, “but chose to shoot him anyway” ... because Appellant “just lumped them all together.” N.T., Apr. 14, 2009, at 30, 32-33; N.T., Mar. 6, 2009, at 78.

Appellant stated, “Reggie [Woodson] came towards me ... Reggie thought that he was going to talk me down, but saw that wasn’t going to happen and began trucking and ducking away ... and then I shot him too.” N.T., Apr. 14, 2009, at 31-32; N.T., Mar. 6, 2009, at 79. Appellant told the officers that prior to the shooting he pondered whether he <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>should “let them get away with what they did,” and decided to just “go there and do it.” N.T., Apr. 14, 2009, at 29-30; N.T., Mar. 6, 2009, at 80. Appellant further expressed disappointment that he was not able to confront Crump, and hoped Crump would face a “higher justice.” N.T., Apr. 14, 2009, at 134. Appellant remained calm and attentive during questioning, did not appear agitated, spoke in a normal tone of voice, showed appropriate emotion, made eye contact with the officers, and was articulate.</p>

Further, police officers seized several items, including the book <em>Black Power the Politics of Liberation </em>from the passenger side of Appellant’s vehicle. Officers also seized a three-page hand-written document from Appellant’s home that Appellant had drafted on the day of the murder, which purported to explain the behavior that he planned to execute later that day. The document stated in part, as follows:</p>

Appellant thereafter filed a pretrial motion to suppress his statements to police, which the trial court denied, following a hearing on March 6, 2009. On April 13, 2009, Appellant entered an open guilty plea to two counts of first degree murder, possession of an instrument of crime, recklessly endangering another per<a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>son, and firearms not to be carried without a license.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> As a factual basis for the plea, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Detective Randy Morris, Detective David Michael Kemmerer, and Corporal Kurt Tempinski, an expert in ballistics and firearms. The officers relayed in detail what occurred at the crime scene, as described <em>supra, </em>and reiterated the statements Appellant gave to police immediately after the murders in which he confessed to shooting both victims. The Commonwealth further admitted into evidence, <em>inter alia, </em>the murder weapon and ammunition, the victims’ autopsy reports, the audio recording and written note made by Appellant explaining his conduct on the day of the murders, and the Simon &amp; Schuster surveillance video. Because the Commonwealth was seeking the death penalty, the matter proceeded to a penalty hearing. Appellant waived his right to a jury trial in the penalty phase, and a three-day bench trial was conducted before the trial court judge.</p>

The court additionally found three mitigating circumstances: that the defendant “has no significant history of prior criminal convictions,” <em>id., </em>§ 9711(e)(1); that the defendant “was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance,” <em>id., </em>§ 9711(e)(2); and the mitigating circumstance relating to “[a]ny other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.” <em>Id., </em>§ 9711(e)(8) (“catchall mitigating circumstance”). As evidence of the catchall mitigating circumstance, the trial court cited Appellant’s guilty plea to all charges and his waiver of the defenses of diminished capacity and insanity.

The court concluded that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>circumstances, and sentenced Appellant to death for the murder of Guadalupe.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Appellant accepted responsibility for the two murders and repeatedly acknowledged that he fatally shot Guadalupe and Woodson. At the guilty plea proceeding, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Detective Randy Morris, Detective David Michael Kemmerer, and Corporal Kurt Tempinski, who relayed in thorough detail the circumstances of the shootings, and referenced the several eyewitnesses who observed Appellant murder Guadalupe and Woodson, as well as the statements Appellant gave to police. The Commonwealth further admitted into evidence the murder weapon and ammunition, the victims’ autopsy reports, the audio recording and written note made by Appellant explaining his conduct on the day of the murders, and the Simon &amp; Schuster surveillance video.

As noted, this aggravating circumstance applies where the defendant “knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7). The trial court relied on the following facts in support of the grave risk aggravator: that Appellant shot Woodson as he ran onto the loading dock where other employees were standing, particularly Vanessa Gonzalez; that the gun and ammunition that Appellant used during the shootings had the capacity to kill individuals who were one hundred yards away; that the ballistics evidence demonstrated that a bullet hitting Wood-son’s soft tissue could have passed through him and caused serious injury or death to others in the vicinity; and, that Appellant was aware of the presence of individuals on the loading dock at that time.</p>

To the contrary, he submits that Gonzales was standing in the door frame leading to the loading dock, and that the bullet fired did not have the capacity to harm individuals other than Woodson. Finally, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in relying upon his knowledge of warehouse employee shifts, and by concluding that he “knowingly” created a grave risk of death to others, considering that the trial court likewise found that Appellant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the shooting.</p>

He argues that he proved this mitigating circumstance through the testimony of expert forensic psychiatrists, Dr. Kenneth J. Weiss and Dr. Frank M. Dattilio, who both opined that Appellant’s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct and his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of law were substantially impaired.</p>

Dr. Dattilio explained how Appellant’s drug usage in early adulthood aggravated his tendency for mental illness, and described Appellant as delusional and psychotic with a history of failed relationships, sporadic employment, and difficulty with finances and family. Dr. Dattilio also believed that Appellant did not appreciate the severity of his actions until he saw blood on the ground and realized what he had done. Appellant emphasizes <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>that while the Commonwealth cross-examined his mental health experts, it did not present an expert of its own to refute his claim of lack of capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct.</p>

He contends, however, that the trial court listed only Appellant’s guilty plea and waiver of defenses in support of the Section 9711(e)(8) mitigator, N.T., Apr. 17, 2009, at 5, and failed to give proper weight to the aforementioned life-history mitigation evidence.</p>

To do so, the Commonwealth asserts, would permit Appellant to invade the fact finder’s exclusive province of evaluating the evidence. Here, the Commonwealth contends, the trial court considered Appellant’s evidence of lack of capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct, as well as the evidence of his troubled life history, and exercised its discretion to conclude that such evidence did not mitigate Appellant’s fatal shooting of two innocent Simon <em>&amp; </em>Schuster employees.</p>

The <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>Commonwealth asserts that it thoroughly cross-examined the mental health experts’ opinions that Appellant did not have the ability to understand the criminality of his conduct by: outlining the steps that Appellant took to complete the crime, including his written and oral will and testament, which disclosed his desire to seek vengeance against the Simon &amp; Schuster employees who, he believed, mistreated him in the past; highlighting Appellant’s ability to distinguish between individuals and take the lives of only those employees that he believed may have wronged him; and pointing out that Appellant acted in a calm manner, and conformed himself to the requisites of the law when it benefited him to do so. Finally, the Commonwealth maintains that the trial court also acted within its discretion as fact finder by concluding that the evidence of Appellant’s troubled life history did not serve to mitigate the murders, as there was no connection between Appellant’s upbringing and his criminal acts on the day of the fatal shootings.

Three members of the Court dissented in <em>Padilla, </em>and opined that they would have addressed the defaulted penalty phase claim because it involved an indisputably flawed aggravating circumstance that had been injected into the jury's weighing determination, which undergirded the death verdict. <em>See </em>80 A.3d at 1290 (Saylor, J., concurring and dissenting). Unlike in <em>Padilla, </em>the defaulted penalty phase issues Appellant seeks to have this Court address pursuant to our Section 971 l(h)(3)(i) statutory review do not involve an indisputably flawed aggravating circumstance.</p>

    <p id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[171,565,1153,689]]]'>Notably, in cases involving the imposition of the penalty of death, the General Assembly has invested this Court with the special responsibility of assuring that a capital sentence is not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3). While I agree with the admonitions offered by various Justices in previous cases cautioning that arbitrariness review should not be accorded so broadly as to obviate requirements maintained to assure a developed record and orderly and appropriate decision-making, I also do not believe it should be administered so narrowly as to preclude a deferential, weight-based assessment as to whether the sentencing jury acted within the range of its specified authority.</p>
    <p id="b541-6" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[168,1299,1155,583]]]'>I acknowledge that it would be a rare instance in which a weight-based claim would prevail under such a regime. Nevertheless, it is my considered position that the statutory review for arbitrariness serves as an essential safeguard against unwarranted imposition of the severest of punishments and that it should not be circumscribed by the sort of blanket proscription which is enforced here. I also maintain the concern -with the underpinnings of the <em>per se </em>rule, in that I believe it is derived from an understatement of the competency of appellate courts to weigh evidence adduced in a capital sentencing proceeding.</p>
