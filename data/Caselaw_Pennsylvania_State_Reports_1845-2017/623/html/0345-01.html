The first rape and murder occurred in early August of <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>1992, with the dead and battered body of victim Joan Burghardt, who had been dead for some time, found in her apartment in Allentown on August 9. Appellant was seventeen at the time he raped and bludgeoned Ms. Burghardt to death. The second rape and murder occurred in Allentown on June 9, 1993, the victim being fifteen-year old Charlotte Schmoyer, who apparently was abducted while delivering newspapers. Appellant had viciously stabbed the young girl twenty-two times, including at least two wounds up to the hilt of the four-inch knife he used; he then dumped the child’s body in a heavily wooded area.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> A month later, on July 14, 1993, the dead body of Jessica Jean Fortney was found in the bedroom of her home in Allentown.

The rape and assault on Ms. Sam-Cali thus took place less than three weeks after the murder of Ms. Schmoyer, and two weeks before the murder of Ms. Fortney.

Dr. Sadoff testified that, <em>inter alia, </em>appellant had an “anti-social personality disorder.” Appellant did not take the stand and testify on his own behalf. Following the presentation of evidence at the penalty phase, the jury found the following aggravating circumstances as to each murder: (1) the killing was committed during the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6); (2) appellant had a significant felony history involving the use or threat of violence, <em><a href="/citations/?q=163%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20470" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="163 L.

The jury further concluded that the multiple aggravating circumstances outweighed a single mitigating circumstance it found respecting each ease, <em>i.e., </em>the catch-all mitigator under Section 9711(e)(8). The mitigating factors enumerated by the jury to support the catchall circumstance included “family background and environment,” “use of alcohol and drugs,” and “school history.” The jury thus returned verdicts of death for all three murders. The trial court formally imposed the sentences of death on November 29, 1994, and imposed lesser sentences for the non-murder convictions. Appellant was represented by James Burke, Esquire, at the penalty phase.</p>

The trial court determined that the jury had impermissibly considered the murders of Ms. Schmoyer and Ms. Fortney when finding the (d)(ll) aggravating circumstance for the murder of Ms. Burghardt and had impermissibly considered the murder of Ms. Fortney in passing upon the penalty for the murder of Ms. Schmoyer.

Appellant also presented the testimony of his trial counsel, his appellate counsel, Dr. Sadoff, and the brief testimony of John Lesko, another convicted capital murderer who resided on death row in the same prison as appellant for a time.

The primary information that was allegedly not obtained by trial counsel (or obtained but not provided to Dr. Sadoff) related to school records. Appellant’s theory of collateral attack was that the school records would have demonstrated that in 1981, when appellant was 6, he tested to a full scale IQ of 126, which was in the superior range, but in 1989, when he was 14 and a resident at Harbor Creek (a juvenile placement facility), he tested to a full scale IQ of 100, which is in the average range. Appellant’s PCRA experts opined that the difference in the two test results was significant and would have warranted further neuropsychological testing because it suggested possible frontal lobe brain damage. According to appellant’s experts, the theory of possible frontal lobe brain damage was further supported by the PET scan and MRI of appellant’s brain secured by the FCDO’s <em>ex parte </em>motion.</p>
    <p id="b390-5" data-blocks='[["BL_390.4",390,[283,1374,1151,834]]]'>The PCRA court reasoned that the issue was without merit because appellant did not credibly prove its necessary factual predicate, <em>i.e., </em>that trial counsel failed to obtain and provide appellant’s school records to Dr. Sadoff. The PCRA court explained that resolution of the issue ultimately came down to a credibility determination between trial counsel’s testimony that he had obtained the school records and provided them to Dr. Sadoff and Dr. Sadoff s testimony that it was his practice to record every document he reviewed in preparing his report. Dr. Sadoff further testified that he was “confident” that he did not receive the records because the school records were not listed in his report. As will be addressed more fully below, the PCRA court credited the testimony of trial counsel over that of Dr. Sadoff, thereby determining that appellant did not establish that trial counsel failed to provide the school records to Dr. Sadoff.</p>
    <p id="b390-6" data-blocks='[["BL_390.5",390,[284,2241,1149,94]],["BL_391.1",391,[185,300,1153,1061]]]'>Alternatively, the PCRA court reasoned that even if trial counsel had failed to provide the records to Dr. Sadoff, <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>appellant could not establish prejudice. The court based its finding on the competing testimony of the experts, who testified as to when neuropsychological testing became available and generally accepted for diagnosing brain damage. Much of the relevant testimony centered on the use of PET scans and MRIs for diagnosing brain damage. The PCRA court concluded that, at the time of appellant’s trial in 1994, the issues of who should be tested for brain damage, what that testing would actually entail, and understanding the consequences of such results were only in the incipient stage. Furthermore, the PCRA court explained there was some dispute among the proffered experts as to whether the drop in IQ reflected in the two test scores was indicative of possible brain damage, or whether the decrease was attributable to external factors other than brain damage. In any event, the PCRA court was ultimately persuaded that appellant could not establish that the outcome of the penalty proceeding would have been altered given the magnitude of his crimes. The PCRA court summarized its rejection of this ineffectiveness issue as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b391-5" data-blocks='[["BL_391.4",391,[224,1387,1112,961]],["BL_392.1",392,[314,307,1112,472]]]'>In sum, [appellant's claim for relief hinges on the drop in his IQ scores between 1981, when he was six years old, and 1989, when he was fourteen years old. Although all experts agree to some extent that this diminution is “significant,” the “low” score of 100 may have been caused by external factors, such as a poor education, during the intervening period as opposed to some cognitive impairment of [appellant’s brain. In any event, even the score of 100 indicates a “normal” brain. Under those circumstances, it cannot be said that Dr. Sadoff, an experienced clinical psychiatrist, should have referred [appellant] for additional testing, much less that trial counsel was somehow ineffective for relying on Dr. Sadoff. Nor has it been established that the brain imaging studies subsequently used by [appellant’s expert] in his evaluation of [appellant], would have been available to test and diagnose [appellant] in 1994 even if a consensus regarding a diagnosis does exist under present day standards. More to the point, in view of the overwhelming <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>weight of the aggravating circumstances in this case, in the form of brutal serial rape and murder, and in light of the credible expert witness testimony presented by the Commonwealth regarding [appellant]^ manifest ability to utilize executive brain function to carefully plan and execute these crimes, there is no probability that the calculus of any reasonable juror would have been altered by the claims of front lobe impairment upon which [appellant] now bottoms his argument.</blockquote>

Rather, in discussing the first issue, the court noted that trial counsel had testified that he was aware that the diagnosis would come out on cross-examination, and so he determined to deal with it “proactively in the full context of Dr. Sadoffs professional medical explanation.” Furthermore, according to the court, it was the only potentially mitigating factor “from a diagnosis perspective” that trial counsel possessed. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8.</p>

Appellant argues that penalty phase counsel was inexperienced and had not tried a capital case, or any murder case, before. This inexperience, he says, was highlighted by the fact that Dr. Sadoff was not contacted until fourteen days before trial. Furthermore, appellant argues that more experienced trial counsel in 1994 would have known that Dr. Sadoffs diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder was not a mitigating factor.</p>

The records, he says, would have shown a significant drop in appellant’s performance on IQ tests between the ages of six and fourteen (a twenty-six point testing decrease overall and a forty-two point decrease in verbal performance), as measured by IQ tests administered <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>at those ages.

The relevant school records (from Allentown School District and Harbor Creek juvenile placement facility), however, were not listed, and thus, Dr. Sadoff testified that he did not receive these records. Appellant avers that trial counsel was unable to produce a cover letter indicating what documents he sent to Dr. Sadoff and trial counsel stated that he would have had no strategic reason for not providing the records to Dr. Sadoff. Appellant next looks back twelve years to trial counsel’s testimony during post-sentence motions, claiming that counsel then disavowed any reliance on school records because they would have opened the door to damaging rebuttal testimony. Appellant speculates from the reasoning of trial counsel at postsentence motions that he did not provide the records to Dr. Sadoff for fear that the records would ultimately have to be disclosed to the Commonwealth. Appellant then notes that, at trial, trial counsel stated that Dr. Sadoff was “basing his diagnosis, your Honor, on his interviews and evaluations of [appellant] independently of the medical records.” N.T., 11/9/94, at 2544.

Similarly, appellant argues that if counsel had thoroughly reviewed the records provided to him, he would have noticed the decrease in performance on the two IQ tests and reasonable counsel would have questioned the import of the decrease. Appellant also argues that a competency evalu<a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>ation of appellant conducted by Paul Gross, M.D., prior to trial raised “doubts” as to appellant’s mental stability, yet trial counsel failed to raise the issue with Dr. Sadoff.</p>
    <p id="b396-4" data-blocks='[["BL_396.4",396,[273,504,1156,586]]]'>Appellant then contends that trial counsel’s alleged failures prejudiced him because the jury was never presented with evidence of his allegedly severe brain damage. Instead, the jury was presented with very limited testimony about appellant’s drug and alcohol dependence and harmful evidence of his antisocial personality disorder. Appellant believes that there is a reasonable probability that evidence of brain damage would have persuaded at least one juror to find a mental health mitigating circumstance pursuant to Section 9711(e)(3), which would have altered the outcome of the proceedings, even in the context of this triple rape and murder.</p>

Appellant avers that the court conflated neuroimaging and neuropsychological testing. Appellant offers that neuropsychological testing was widely used in 1994; the battery of neuropsychological tests administered to him in 2009, he says, were also used in 1993 and 1994. Additionally, although appellant’s 1989 IQ test result of 100 might be in the “normal” range, he says the pertinent question is whether the 26 point drop in test scores between 1981 and 1989 was significant and Dr. Sadoff testified that the decrease indicated a need for neuropsychological testing.</p>

      <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>The Commonwealth responds that resolution of this issue is straightforward. The PCRA court found the testimony of trial counsel more credible and reliable than that of Dr. Sadoff. The Commonwealth argues that the credibility determinations made by the PCRA court were based on observations and review of the relevant evidence, which “must” be accepted by this Court. Furthermore, the Commonwealth contends that appellant’s speculation that trial counsel chose to withhold the records from Dr. Sadoff because he feared that they would be disclosed to the Commonwealth, and then misrepresented the facts at the PCRA hearing, is unfounded; this Court should not use a speculative argument to establish a finding of ineffectiveness. The Commonwealth reiterates that this issue presented a question of credibility and the PCRA court’s determination is supported by trial counsel’s testimony and the report of Dr. Sadoff. On the latter point, the Commonwealth explains that Dr. Sadoffs report states that he “reviewed the records that [trial counsel] provided, <em>including </em>the following” and then enumerates the documents he reviewed. According to the Commonwealth, the use of “including” suggests that Dr. Sadoff possessed more documents than were enumerated in the report.</p>

Instead, the Commonwealth argues that the nature of the crimes them<a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>selves show an actor who possessed sufficient executive functioning to stalk his victims and plan and carry out the sexual assaults and murders.</p>

According to the Commonwealth, this lack of availability undermines the opinion of appellant’s expert, Dr. Ruben Gur (PhD), which was based, in part, on the results from the neuroimaging tests. Alternatively, the Commonwealth argues that even if neuroimaging was available, its application for forensic purposes was extremely limited. In fact, the Commonwealth argues that it presented testimony that the common wisdom in 1994 was that neuroimaging should not be used to predict or explain a particular person’s behavior. Finally, the Commonwealth avers that none of appellant’s experts specifically related their findings of brain damage to explain appellant’s serial murderous behavior in 1992-93.</p>

Dr. Martell opined that the testing revealed frontal lobe brain damage and that most of the damage involved the forward part of the lobes, “the areas that control impulse <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>control, organization and control of behavior, the ability to learn from mistakes, the ability to switch between competing stimuli.” Dr. Martell discussed the “significant” decrease in IQ represented in the two test scores, expressing “shock” that it was not addressed. He acknowledged that an IQ of 100 is in the average range. Dr. Martell also opined that “IQ tests are relatively insensitive to frontal lobe damage.” Dr. Martell explained the tests that he administered, testifying that these were the “gold standards” to measure frontal lobe damage. Like Dr. Gur, Dr. Martell did not believe that the brain damage he testified to was attributable to a 2006 head injury, but believed that appellant “has always been this way. I think that something happened in his neuro-development between six and fourteen, that changed the way his brain functions .... ” Following cross-examination, the court questioned the witness as to appellant’s specific impairments. Dr. Mar-tell reiterated that the brain damage he was speaking to impaired executive function and control. Dr. Martell further testified that appellant’s IQ of 100 was in the “normal” range and that he was not mentally retarded. N.T., 12/21/10, at 19-20, 36-38, 51, 61, 89-91.</p>

Dr. Thomas Swirsky-Sacchetti testified that he has a PhD in psychology and focuses his practice on neuropsychology. Dr. Swirsky-Sacchetti reviewed the other experts’ reports, as well as the prior records, school and psychological, of appellant. He testified that PET scans were available in 1994, but that they were not in widespread clinical use. He agreed that the test results showed some mild impairment in appellant’s brain, but he did not agree that the impairments were “severe.” He further opined that the decrease in appellant’s IQ test performance could be attributed to test-taking anxiety and his limited educational opportunities. Dr. Swirsky-Sacchetti also disagreed with Dr. Martell’s report, which compared appellant to other people who had completed 12 years of education. In his opinion, Dr. Martell should have compared appellant to people who completed nine years of education.

Dr. Martell explained that he did not dispute that appellant had antisocial personality disorder, but that, in his opinion, appellant had “more going on,” <em>ie., </em>brain damage. He clarified that his belief that appellant suffered from brain damage was based on more than just the decrease in the IQ test results, including the testing that was done in his early life, the learning disabilities, and the history that followed.

Although appellant makes a passing argument that counsel should have recognized that the IQ scores could be significant to Dr. Sadoff s evaluation, penalty phase counsel was not a psychiatrist or mental health expert, nor was he required by the Sixth Amendment to be one. <em>See Commonwealth v. Lesko, </em><a href="/pa/609/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="609 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="4201010" data-case-paths="/pa/609/0128-01">609 Pa. 128</a>, <a href="/pa/609/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="15 A.3d 345" data-case-ids="4201010,7338275" data-case-paths="/pa/609/0128-01,/a3d/15/0345-01">15 A.3d 345</a>, 382 (2011) (and discussed infra). Rather, the relevant allegation, in this layered Sixth Amendment claim, is that counsel allegedly failed to provide his mental health expert, Dr. Sadoff, with “red flag” style information that the expert would have recognized warranted neuropsychological testing. The factual question of whether counsel obtained the school records and provided them to Dr. Sadoff was specifically disputed below. If counsel in fact obtained and provided the records to Dr. Sadoff, and Dr. Sadoffs expert review provided counsel with no basis upon which to pursue mental health mitigation evidence further, appellant cannot prove counsel’s ineffectiveness.</p>

The PCRA court further explained that counsel’s recollection was more specific and was supported by his testimony regarding his strategy at the penalty phase. The PCRA court noted that counsel’s belief that Dr. Sadoffs role as an impartial expert was critical to mitigation lent credibility to counsel’s statement that there was no reason why he would have obtained the records and not provided them to Dr. Sadoff. The PCRA court also found that penalty phase counsel “convincingly” testified that if Dr. Sadoff had suggested further testing, he would have pursued it since this was precisely the type of guidance he was seeking from his expert. But, no person, including Dr. Sadoff, ever suggested that further testing was warranted. In contrast to counsel’s testimony, the PCRA court noted that Dr. Sadoff “had no independent recollection” of whether he had received the school records, but instead relied solely on the absence of a reference to school records in his report. The PCRA court also emphasized that Dr. Sadoffs report stated that he had reviewed records, “including the following,” which left open the possibility that he had reviewed additional records that were not listed in his report. Although Dr. Sadoff attempted to explain that notation, the PCRA court was not obliged to credit the explanation. Finally, the PCRA court noted that Dr. Sadoff testified that he normally requested all relevant records and it seemed likely “that he would have requested” the school records at issue here, “or at least made a note regarding any gaps or omis<a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>sions.” PCRA court opinion at 10.

In this case, the PCRA court had to make a credibility determination between penalty phase counsel’s forceful and repeated assurances that he provided the records to Dr. Sadoff and Dr. Sadoffs declarations that he could not have been provided the records because he always listed all of the records he reviewed in preparing his report for trial, and he did not list school records here. The PCRA court ultimately credited counsel’s testimony over that of Dr. Sadoff, and explained why. The record supports the credibility determination of the PCRA court, and we cannot disturb the finding.</p>
    <p id="b406-5" data-blocks='[["BL_406.5",406,[282,1319,1152,795]]]'>Appellant nevertheless attacks the PCRA court’s factual determination, on two main grounds. First, appellant argues that counsel’s declared strategy at the PCRA hearing does not match the strategy he actually pursued during the penalty phase. Appellant specifically takes issue with counsel’s testimony that his penalty phase strategy was to put Dr. Sadoff s antisocial personality disorder diagnosis in context to show that, had appellant been properly treated for the disorder, the crimes may never have happened. According to the PCRA court, this declared strategy supported counsel’s assurances that he provided the school records to Dr. Sadoff because he wanted to find anything in appellant’s history to give context to appellant’s actions. Appellant now argues that counsel never pursued such a strategy at trial and, in fact, admitted that appellant was to blame for the crimes he committed.</p>

In any event, the theory is dubious. At trial, penalty phase counsel presented testimony from a friend of appellant and four of appellant’s family members, who testified that they did not believe appellant was guilty of the murders. They also testified that he was both “normal” and a loyal friend. Dr. Sadoff testified, opining that appellant suffered from antisocial personality disorder and alcohol abuse, as discussed above. Appellant declined to testify on his own behalf, as was his exclusive right, even though counsel had “begged” him to testify. N.T., 11/24/98, at 193. Thus, penalty phase counsel had little material to work with when presenting mitigating evidence on appellant’s behalf, all in the face of a series of powerful aggravating circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b407-4" data-blocks='[["BL_407.4",407,[186,1071,1155,1282]],["BL_408.1",408,[273,310,1150,248]]]'>Even faced with this limited evidence, the jury found the catchall mitigating circumstance, citing multiple factors counsel had stressed: “family background and environment,” “use of alcohol and drugs,” and “school history.” Additionally, and contrary to appellant’s argument, it is clear from his closing argument that counsel made use of the antisocial personality disorder diagnosis to explain the “sum total of a life, sum total of a life spent in the bowels of society; the sum total of a life with an abusive alcoholic father.” In pleading for his client’s life to be spared to serve life in prison, counsel stressed that appellant could be treated in prison for his disorder and that the jury could “let him go join the fraternity of other antisocial personality disordered people.” Counsel also argued to the jury that appellant’s antisocial personality disorder was never addressed before his crimes; it was not diagnosed and was not treated and, counsel stated, “this man’s background, this man’s past, has caused this man, as he sits before you here today, to be what he is.” N.T., 11/10/94, at 2716, 2717, 2727, 2729. Counsel’s closing demonstrates that he pursued a strategy to give context to appellant’s actions, which was consistent with his testimony before the PCRA court. The strategy may have failed, but this was hardly surprising given the fact of the serial rapes and murders, the additional attack on Ms. Sam-Cali, and the presence of multiple statutory aggravators. The <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>record supports that the strategy declared at the PCRA hearing was the one that counsel actually pursued; and this, in turn, undercuts appellant’s hindsight theory. Accordingly, appellant’s first attack upon the court’s credibility determination fails.</p>
    <p id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.4",408,[271,587,1154,993]]]'>Second, appellant notes that during trial, counsel stated that Dr. Sadoffs opinion was based solely on his interviews and evaluations of appellant, independent of any medical records. Appellant speculates that limiting Dr. Sadoffs access to the school records would have been consistent with counsel’s understanding that providing the records to Dr. Sadoff risked opening the door to Commonwealth questioning about the school records, which painted a very damaging picture of appellant. Furthermore, according to appellant, counsel’s testimony during the post-verdict evidentiary hearing demonstrated that he did not want to use the school records because they would open the door to negative evidence. N.T., 11 /13/98, at 30; 11 /24/98, 186. Appellant also notes that, during trial, the trial judge was clear that any of the records reviewed and relied upon by Dr. Sadoff in making his diagnosis would be open to use by the Commonwealth. Based upon this evidence, appellant argues that counsel’s testimony that he provided the records to Dr. Sadoff is unsupported by the record.</p>
    <p id="b408-5" data-blocks='[["BL_408.5",408,[272,1613,1152,737]]]'>As with his first argument, this theory was one for appellant to pose to the PCRA court, in the hope that the court would credit Dr. Sadoffs account over that of trial counsel, an account which itself was corroborated by co-counsel. It is no basis upon which this Court can set aside the PCRA court’s credibility determination. Moreover, we are disinclined to credit the suggestion that a member of the bar should be deemed to have misrepresented the facts, under oath, when the accusation, as here, is based entirely upon speculation. The fact that penalty phase counsel wanted to limit the damaging information that was presented to the penalty phase jury does not ineluctably mean that he limited Dr. Sadoffs access to this information, much less that he falsified testimony under oath by testifying that he had provided the records.</p>

N.T., 11/9/94, at 2542. Nothing in this scenario contradicts counsel’s assurances that the school records were provided to Dr. Sadoff. It is likely that Dr. Sadoff reviewed the records and determined that they did not reveal anything that he had not already diagnosed based on his evaluations and interviews with appellant, <em>i.e., </em>antisocial personality disorder. Thus, if speculation is to be indulged, as appellant would have us proceed, it is logical that the records were not referred to in Dr. Sadoffs report (even though he was given them) because they did not add anything to his diagnosis, and he failed in his usual practice of tracking all that was provided to him. Again, Dr. Sadoff had no recollection specific to this case. Accordingly, appellant’s theories do not establish that the PCRA court’s credibility determinations are unsupported by the record.</p>

In light of the PCRA court’s supported credibility determination that the records were provided to Dr. Sadoff, and Dr. Sadoffs unquestioned expertise, the Court would be hard pressed to fault trial counsel for failing to perceive a mental health “red flag” when the same information did not raise a red flag with the expert hired specifically for that purpose. This Court has made clear that in applying <em>Strickland, </em>courts must be careful not to conflate the roles and professional obligations of lawyers and experts, and cannot demand that counsel, who otherwise act reasonably (as, for example, by hiring a mental health expert), recognize psychological “red flags.” <em>See Lesko, </em><a href="/pa/609/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="15 A.3d 345" data-case-ids="4201010,7338275" data-case-paths="/pa/609/0128-01,/a3d/15/0345-01">15 A.3d at 382</a>.

Accordingly, appellant contends that the reasoning of <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Roper </em>should be extended to severely brain damaged individuals because the execution of such individuals offends the “evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.” Appellant’s Brief at 57 <em>(quoting Trop v.

Appellant notes that “nearly every major mental health association” believes that the execution of severely brain damaged offenders should be barred by the Eighth Amendment.

Accordingly, I join the majority’s pronouncement and its application to Appellant’s present claim under the Eighth Amendment. Critically, however, I would highlight the majority’s caveat to this general rule regarding certain exceptional claims. <em>See id. </em>at 384 n.12, 82 A.3d at 1022 n.12.

As a result of <em>Grant, </em>we have limited direct appeals as a forum for the innovation of federal or state constitutional law regarding the right to counsel; yet, our no-innovation construction of the PCRA would prohibit the raising of such claims collaterally as well. Accordingly, in the appropriate case, this conundrum may warrant modulation of our <em>Grant </em>line of decisions, or adjustments to our construction of the PCRA.</p>
