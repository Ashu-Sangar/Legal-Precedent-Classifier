    <p id="b460-6" data-blocks='[["BL_460.5",460,[271,625,1153,1495]]]'>Ramos states that the only question presented to this Court for review is the legality of imposing a mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9712.1 which is equal to the statutory maximum sentence provided for that offense. Brief for Appellant at 10. Ramos contends it is an impermissible violation of Pennsylvania’s indeterminate sentencing scheme mandated by 42 Pa.C.S. § 9756(b) to impose a flat, five year mandatory minimum sentence under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9712.1, when the maximum sentence for the underlying conviction of PWID is also five years pursuant to 35 P.S. § 780-113(f)(2). Ramos reasons that as Section 9712.1 was adopted in 2005, years after 18 Pa.C.S. § 7508 had been enacted and <em>Bell </em>had been decided, if the Legislature intended a reading that would have allowed Sections 9712.1 and 113(f)(2) to be interpreted consistently, it would have included prefatory language similar to that which it included in 18 Pa.C.S. § 7508. Ramos further argues that under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9756, his sentence must have a range that includes a minimum and a maximum prison term, and, therefore, his sentence of nine months to five years on the Manufacture of a Controlled Substance conviction and concurrent five year prison sentence for the PWID conviction violates the minimum-maximum rule. Stated another way, Ramos posits that if the flat, five year term is added to the minimum sentence, the sentence becomes five years and nine months to five years, which violates the minimum-maximum rule, and if it is added to his maximum sentence, it becomes nine months to ten years, and exceeds the maximum term set forth under 35 P.S. § 780-113(0(2).</p>

Brief of <em>Amicus Curiae </em>Defender Association of Philadelphia on Behalf of Appellant Guillermo Ramos at 9. <em>Amicus </em>concludes that an interpretation of Section 9712.1 which requires a flat, five-year term of incarceration where the underlying, substantive drug offense has a maximum authorized penalty of imprisonment not exceeding five years would lead to an unconstitutional result and, therefore, such a construction should be avoided. <em><a href="/citations/?q=47%20A.3d%201238" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="47 A.3d 1238">Id.</a> </em>at ll.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The Commonwealth finds support for its position in the Statutory Construction Act which provides that whenever a general provision in a statute conflicts with a special provision in the same or another statute, that special provision shall prevail and shall be construed as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision was enacted later and it is the manifest intention of the General Assembly that the <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>general provision will be paramount. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1933.

Section 7508(a)(1)(h) provided that a three-year minimum sentence shall be imposed for marijuana trafficking of between ten and fifty pounds, while section 113(f)(2) of the Drug Act set the maximum sentence for the offense at five years. This, Bell argued, resulted in the minimum sentence exceeding one-half of the maximum sentence in violation of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9756(b). In addition, Bell further claimed that while Section 7508(a)(i)(iii) set the minimum sentence for the marijuana trafficking of over fifty pounds at five years, Section 113(f)(2)’s provision that five years is the maximum sentence for that offense also was incompatible with Section 9756(b) of the Sentencing Code.</p>

Instead, we found it was possible for the terms of incarceration mandated in the two provisions to be applied consistently. We explained that Section 7508(a)(1)(ii)’s mandatory minimum sentence of three years, read together with Section 113(f)(2)’s maximum five year sentence, results in a three to five year sentence for individuals convicted of possession with the intent to deliver between ten and fifty pounds of marijuana and similarly, one convicted of possession with the intent to deliver at least fifty pounds of marijuana would receive a flat, five-year term of imprison<a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>ment, i.e., a five-year minimum and five-year maximum.

Three decades later, in 2004, the General Assembly enacted Section 9712.1(a), instructing courts to impose a five-year mandatory minimum sentence upon those convicted of violating Subsection 30, possession with intent to deliver, while in possession of a firearm. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9712.1(a) (enacted Dec. 1, 2004, effective Jan. 31, 2005).</p>

As applied to this case, the minimum-maximum provision of Section 9756(b)(1) is the general provision because it applies to all criminal sentences. In contrast, the other two sections relevant to this case are specific provisions: the five-year mandatory minimum sentence of Section 9712.1(a) applies only to the subset of criminals who have been convicted of 35 P.S. § 780-113(a)(30) while in physical possession of a firearm, and the five-year maximum sentence of Section 780-113(f)(2) applies only to the <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>subset of criminals who have been convicted of three subsections of Section 780-113(a), including Subsection 30.

Because the provisions were not in conflict at the time of enactment, an intent to override is not discernable given that any sentence for the relevant crimes merely would have a maximum sentence of five years or less and a minimum sentence of one half or less of that maximum.
