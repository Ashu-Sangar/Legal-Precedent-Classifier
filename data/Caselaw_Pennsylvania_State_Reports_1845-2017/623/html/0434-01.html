Corporal Wealand activated his emergency lights and initiated a traffic stop of the Mustang, which was traveling west-bound on a one-way street. The vehicle, driven by Appellant, came to rest with the passenger side tires approximately two feet from the curb, but the vehicle was not blocking traffic. Corporal Wealand approached the driver’s-side door and requested Appellant’s driver’s license, registration, and insurance information. During the stop, Corporal Wealand noticed that Appellant’s vehicle did not have the required emissions sticker, and he also learned Appellant’s license was suspended. Thus, he issued Appellant two citations, one for driving with a suspended license, and one for operating a vehicle without a valid inspection, and asked Appellant to step out of his car in order to sign <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>for the citations. At that time, Corporal Wealand told Appellant that he was free to leave, but that the car would be towed because of Appellant’s suspended license.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant indicated that he had a friend with a tow truck whom he could call to take possession of his vehicle, but the officer informed Appellant of the Department’s policy of impoundment and towing (“towing policy”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Corporal Wealand also advised Appellant that, pursuant to Department policy, he was required to conduct an inventory of the contents of the vehicle (“inventory policy”).

N.T. Suppression Hearing, 9/22/09, at 9. Corporal Wealand further testified that each field on the computer form must be completed before the computer will allow the officer to proceed to the next field. <em>Id. </em>at 10.

Therefore, when he began the inventory search and observed a jacket in the backseat of the car, he asked Appellant if he wanted the jacket. Appellant indicated that he did, and Corporal Wealand advised Appellant that he would first need to check it for weapons. Appellant consented, and when Corporal Wealand “squeezed” the jacket to make sure there were no weapons, he felt a hard object, which <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>Appellant indicated was an eyeglass case, in one of the pockets. Corporal Wealand testified that Appellant told him to “go ahead” and open the eyeglass case. <em>Id. </em>at 12. When Corporal Wealand opened the eyeglass case, he observed two bags containing marijuana seeds, several plastic bags with what he believed to be cocaine residue, and a box-cutter. At this point, Appellant was placed under arrest, handcuffed, and seated behind the vehicle. Corporal Wealand then resumed the inventory search, and, upon opening the trunk of the vehicle, discovered a Savage Stevens 20-gauge shotgun and a Sears and Roebuck .30-06 hunting rifle. Based on the earlier computer check of Appellant’s license, Corporal Wealand knew Appellant was a convicted felon who could not possess weapons, and Appellant admitted the hunting rifle was stolen.</p>
    <p id="b475-5" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[188,1067,1154,1050]]]'>Appellant filed a pre-trial motion to suppress evidence of the drugs and weapons discovered during the inventory search, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that he did not consent to the opening of the eyeglass case and there was no basis for Corporal Wealand to open the case under the plain feel doctrine, and that Corporal Wealand lacked authority to tow his vehicle pursuant 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 6309.2 because the vehicle did not present an issue of public safety. The trial court denied the motion with respect to the weapons, but granted the motion with respect to the drugs found in the eyeglass case. Thereafter, Appellant was convicted at a bench trial of receiving stolen property and unlawful possession of a firearm, and sentenced to 3 to 10 years incarceration. Appellant appealed his judgment of sentence to the Superior Court, wherein he argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that police may not tow a vehicle simply because their agency has issued a written order authorizing them to do so, and that 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 6309.2 allows for the towing of a vehicle only if there is an issue of public safety, which he contends was lacking in the instant case.</p>

She further noted that nothing of value was visible in the vehicle; that, contrary to the majority’s suggestion, the Commonwealth presented no evidence that the search took place pursuant to the Department’s standard procedures; and that, even if the search began as an inventory search, it became investigatory once Corporal Wealand discovered the drug residue in the eyeglass case, at which time Corporal Wealand should have stopped the inventory search and obtained a search warrant.</p>
