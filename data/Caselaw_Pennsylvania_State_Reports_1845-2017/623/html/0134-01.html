The court then recited that Bozek advanced several assertions in response, namely: (1) the bond order was void <em>ab initio </em>because PPM was the appellant before the trial court, and as such, under <em>Rickert v.

In this regard, the court first quoted from <em>Takacs </em>for the position that the trial court’s bond directive fell within the “ancillary order” provision of Pa.R.A.P. 1701(b)(1), thus making it final and appealable as of right. The court observed that, unlike in <em>Takacs, </em>Bozek did not appeal the bond order, thus precluding the court from considering its propriety. <em>See PPM Atlantic, </em><a href="/a3d/22/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="22 A.3d 253" data-case-ids="7277073" data-case-paths="/a3d/22/0253-01">22 A.3d at 259</a>.

Our conclusion in this regard rests on two interrelated premises. First, Section 1003-A(d) of the MPC, <em>quoted in supra </em>note 2, primarily governs appeals to the common pleas court by an objector from a zoning board decision favorable to the developer. Second, even if the provision may be construed to authorize imposition of a bond in connection with an objector’s further appeal to the Commonwealth Court — a question this Court has not yet addressed, <em>see </em>infra note 6 — such authorization only exists where the objector was the party who originally appealed to the common pleas court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

It is located in Article X-A of the MPC, which sets forth the exclusive mode for securing review of decisions rendered pursuant to Article IX, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 11001-A, which, in turn, relates to decisions of “zoning hearing boards and other administrative agencies.” MPC, Article IX, Title. Additionally, Section 1003-A’s language supports such a conclusion, as, for example, subsection (b) mandates that the “governing body, board or agency whose decision or action has been appealed” must certify the record to the reviewing court for purposes of the appeal in question. 53 P.S. § 11003-A(b). This would make little sense in the context of an appeal to the Commonwealth Court, where the court of common pleas would be the entity certifying the record. As well, subsection (d) is explicit in providing that an order granting or denying a bond petition “shall be interlocutory,” which, again, does not logically relate to an appeal from a final order of the common pleas court. Thus, the <em>Rickert </em>court provided an explanation that applies equally to the present controversy:</p>

The “appellants” in this land use appeal were [the developers]. They were not “seeking to prevent the development of the land of another.” [53 P.S. § 11003-A(d).] To the contrary, their appeal was filed so that they could pursue the development of their own land. Simply, Section 1003-A(d) could not be invoked by [the developers] because they <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>were the appellants before the trial court, not the appellees, and they challenged a denial, not a grant, of their final plan.</blockquote>

Even if one assumes, however, that this language affirmatively authorizes the trial court to require a bond relative to an appeal to the Commonwealth Court, it is couched in terms of an appellee’s revocation of a prior waiver, and hence, it can only pertain where the same party is the appellee before both courts. The present case illustrates the point. The developer appealed to the common pleas court. As such, it was not in a position to seek an appeal bond in the first instance, and thus, it could not have “waived” its right to do so — meaning that there was no waiver to revoke.

        <em>. </em>The dissent reasons that ”[o]ne cannot waive a right that is nonexistent — hence, the authority to require a bond has to exist — it is a condition precedent to a waiver.” Dissenting Opinion, at 145, 81 A.3d at 903. This is precisely our point: since PPM never had a statutory right to request an appeal bond prior to the trial court’s final merits ruling, it could not have "waived” such a right for purposes of the subsequent appeal. To the extent the dissent states that Section 1003-A(d) "recognizes that one <em>can </em>petition for an appeal bond, even if one did not do so previously,” <em>id. </em>(emphasis in original), we have no quarrel with this assertion in the context of an initial waiver. The statement is incomplete, however, as it does not purport to answer our essential position that waiver is impossible when the land developer had no right to request a bond before the common pleas court. Finally, regarding the dissent’s contention pertaining to the rights of a land developer who was the appellee before the common pleas court and exercised its right <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>to request a bond, <em>see id. </em>(describing our interpretation as "counter-intuitive” relative to “an appellee [who] asked for a bond at the trial level against a frivolous challenge”), that scenario is not before the Court and, as such, we decline to address it. <em>See infra </em>note 7. In all events, this Court has never analyzed whether Section 1003-A(d) authorizes a land developer in that circumstance to petition the trial court for a bond in connection with an objector’s appeal to the Commonwealth Court. This is a non-trivial issue, as the Legislature has clarified that all bond orders contemplated by Section 1003-A(d) are interlocutory. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 11003-A(d), <em>quoted in </em>supra note 2.</p>

In relevant part, § 11003-A(d) provides: “The right to petition the court to order the appellants to post bond may be waived by the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is taken from a final decision of the court.” 53 P.S. § 11003-A(d). The majority states, even assuming “this language affirmatively authorizes the trial court to require a bond relative to an appeal to the Commonwealth Court, it is couched in terms of an appellee’s revocation of a prior waiver, and hence, it can only pertain where the same party is the appellee before both courts.” Majority Op., at 142, 81 A.3d at 901.</p>
    <p id="b181-7" data-blocks='[["BL_181.8",181,[156,1330,1157,906]]]'>Respectfully, such an interpretation convolutes the purpose of allowing a bond in the first place. The statute does not talk at all about limiting the eligibility for a bond — it talks about revoking a prior waiver of a right, which acknowledges that such a right exists. One cannot waive a right that is nonexistent — hence, the authority to require a bond has to exist — it is a condition precedent to a waiver. This statute merely acknowledges that an eligible party may have waived the right to ask for a bond at the trial level, but provides that any such waiver may be revoked if there is an appeal beyond the trial court level — which means the bond may go forward. It does not say a bond is unavailable to an appellee unless that party was appellee below and previously did not ask for a bond. Section 11003-A(d) simply means what it says — a prior waiver, if one exists, does not preclude a subsequent request. Indeed, this recognizes one <em>can </em>petition for an appeal bond, even if one did not do so previously.</p>

Under this interpretation, if an appellee asked for a bond at the trial level against a frivolous challenge, and prevails, the appellee is to be denied the right to ask for a bond on appeal — yet a concurrent appellee who waived a bond at trial may now obtain it on appeal. This is not the statute’s purpose or meaning. Again, it is a statute about the scope of a waiver, not about eligibility.</p>
    <p id="b182-4" data-blocks='[["BL_182.4",182,[291,687,1150,780]]]'>Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1701(b)(1) permits a lower court to take certain limited actions after an appeal has been filed, including ancillary actions such as the issuance of a bond order as a condition to appeal. When the bond order was issued, appellant had three options: challenge it, comply with it, or ignore it. He chose the latter, at his peril. The bond was properly made a requirement of pursuing the appeal. The Commonwealth Court, therefore, properly held his failure to meet that requirement doomed the appeal — if there is an order making a bond a prerequisite to further proceedings, failure to post the bond ends the matter. If the proceeding is an appeal of the final disposition, one must obey, or appeal the bond order. This is not a new legal concept. Thus, I would find the bond order was proper, and appellant’s failure to challenge or comply with it was fatal.</p>
