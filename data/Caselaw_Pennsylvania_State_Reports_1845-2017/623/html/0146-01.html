The questions presented by this case involve the admissibility of a videotape of the daughter’s allegations under the relevant hearsay exception for child victims and, if admissible, whether that videotape constitutes the requisite substantial evidence for denying the father’s request to expunge. Upon careful review of the record, we conclude that the father in this case waived any challenge to the admissibility of the videotape by failing to object before the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), both when the father was unrepresented on the first day of the hearing and when he was represented by counsel on the second day of the hearing. Moreover, we reverse the Commonwealth Court’s determination that DPW failed to present substantial evidence to support the indicated report of sexual abuse under the Child Protective Services Law, 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 6301-6386.</p>

Investigator, via phone from New York, to testify to the relevance and reliability of the videotaped interview. In response to the ALJ’s questions, the Investigator discussed her extensive training in forensic interviewing. The investigator next described the interview process. She related that the interview began with a series of questions to obtain the child’s stage of cognitive development and her ability to understand the difference between the truth and a lie. Turning to the heart of the interview, she detailed the allegations summarized above suggesting that Father engaged in cunnilingus, digital <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>penetration, and vaginal intercourse upon E.A. Based upon the interviewer’s experience, the interview process, the persons present during the interview, and the proximity of the interview to the alleged abuse, the ALJ found “that the hearsay testimony has, at this point, met the first prong, that it’s relevant, reliable and definitely probative in this matter.” N.T., March 15, 2010, at 32.</p>

Significantly, he questioned Mother as to why she was willing to allow E.A. to go to the scheduled Father’s Day visit, days after E.A. alleged that he sexually abused her. Mother responded that Father had previously threatened her with contempt for denying visitation. On redirect, Mother testified that, upon the advice of CYS after the <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>videotaped interview, she did not allow E.A. to visit Father the following regular visitation weekend.

He also asserted that once E.A. was in the car, she would become calm very quickly. Turning to the videotaped interview, Father raised questions about the Investigator and Caseworker’s assessment of E.A. as being credible and consistent. He disputed their interpretation of E.A.’s use of the term “butt” to apply credibly to all male and female genitalia, asserting that E.A. only used the term “butt” to apply to “[h]er actual behind.” <em>Id. </em>at 61. Additionally, he emphasized that E.A. had never used some of the terms that she used in the video, such as “nuts” and “weenie,” which would suggest that someone coached her to use those terms to level accusations against him. <em>Id. </em>at 62. Father also attempted to undermine a portion of the video in which E.A. alleged that Father had climbed into her bed and unzipped her pajamas before licking her. He maintained that E.A. did not wear pajamas with zippers and that it would have been impossible for him to have climbed into her bed due to its construction. <em>Id. </em>at 65.</p>

When E.A. said that she was naked when the boy changed her, Grandmother told E.A. not to remove her underwear.

We respectfully reject the Commonwealth Court’s imposition of additional requirements and instead rely upon the balance struck by this Court in AY. Moreover, the Commonwealth Court improperly required, in most cases, medical or other evidence to corroborate the hearsay statements, in conflict with the statutory language contained in Section 6303. This section defines an “indicated report” as one supported by substantial evidence “based on any of the following: (1) Available medical evidence^] (2) The child protective service investigation^] (3) An admission of the acts of abuse by the perpetrator.” <em><a href="/a2d/641/1148-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="641 A.2d 1148" data-case-ids="11296751,775545" data-case-paths="/a2d/641/1148-01,/pa/537/0116-01">Id.</a> </em>Notably, the statute does not require medical evidence but, instead, allows for a finding of substantial evidence purely on the agency’s investigation, which we deem to encompass the interview of the child.</p>

While we ultimately determine that the substantial evidence standard is also met through the corroboration of the videotaped statement under the second guideline of AY, we first consider whether the videotaped statement alone could constitute substantial evidence under the third guideline of AY., requiring uncorroborated hearsay statements of child victims to have been accurately recorded, to identity the images and voices of all present during the interview, and to involve statements not made in response to leading questions or improper suggestion.</p>

Finding Father not credible, the ALJ instead credited the testimony of the Broome Co.

After hearing their testimony and watching the video, the ALJ concluded that the questions were not leading or improperly suggestive. Deferring to the fact finder’s credibility determinations, as we must and the Commonwealth Court erred in failing to do, we conclude that the record supports the conclusion that the videotape satisfies the third guideline of <em>A.Y. </em>addressing uncorroborated hearsay statements and may be considered substantial evidence on its own.</p>

While one could potentially question whether a reasonable person would find E.A.’s statements credible if she were an older child or an adult given the rambling nature of the interview, some of the inconsistencies in her statements, and some unrealistic elements, we conclude that it was not unreasonable for the ALJ to credit E.A.’s statements, in part because of the testimony of the Caseworkers and Interviewer who found E.A. to be extremely credible for a four-year-old. Unlike the average lawyer or judge, these individuals are trained in interviewing young victims of sexual assault. Accordingly, we conclude that E.A.’s videotaped interview alleging sexual abuse by Father constitutes substantial evidence under 23 Pa.C.S. § 6303, as applied by <em>A.Y. </em>to hearsay statements of child victims.</p>

The Commonwealth Court began its analysis with the third and final issue, ultimately concluding: “substantial evidence does not support the factual finding that [appellee] committed a sexual assault....” <em><a href="/a3d/41/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="41 A.3d 131" data-case-ids="7313403" data-case-paths="/a3d/41/0131-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a3d/41/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="41 A.3d 131" data-case-ids="7313403" data-case-paths="/a3d/41/0131-01">at 141</a>. With respect to the second issue, whether the hearing officer should have admitted the DVD without first interviewing Daughter, the Commonwealth Court agreed with appellee that the hearing officer erred. In light of these holdings, the Commonwealth Court granted appellee relief, while expressly opting not to address appellee’s remaining constitutional issue, namely, whether the proceedings before the hearing officer violated appellee’s constitutional right to confront the witness against him. <em>Id. </em>at n. 11 (“In light of this holding, we need not address [appellee]’s constitutional issue.”). The panel’s decision to resolve the case on nonconstitutional grounds, when presented with multiple allegations of error, is a proper approach. <em>In re Stevenson, </em><a href="/pa/608/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="608 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="4199113" data-case-paths="/pa/608/0397-01">608 Pa. 397</a>, <a href="/pa/608/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="12 A.3d 273" data-case-ids="4199113,7282698" data-case-paths="/pa/608/0397-01,/a3d/12/0273-01">12 A.3d 273</a>, 275 (2010) (“[A]s a general matter, it is better to avoid constitutional questions if a non-constitutional ground for decision is available.”); <em>Commonwealth v.

The Majority does not indicate that it intends, by this broad conclusion, to rule upon issues not accepted for review, and thus to obviate, <em>sub silentio, </em>the necessity for a remand; more likely, it is an oversight.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> In any event, the statement is overbroad as to the issues actually before us; the Commonwealth Court never passed upon whether the constitutional issue was properly preserved; and the constitutional issue (including the sub-issue of issue preservation) should be resolved, in the first instance, by the Commonwealth Court following targeted briefing.

While Section 505 of the General Rules of Administrative Practice and Procedure, 2 Pa.C.S. § 505, provides that “Commonwealth agencies shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence at agency hearings,” it also provides that “[rjeasonable examination and cross-examination shall be permitted.” <em>Id. </em>Beyond that, legitimate constitutional concerns are implicated in DPW’s expungement proceedings pertaining to indicated reports of child abuse or child sexual assault, as the accused person’s reputation is at stake.

Thus, in the context of expungement hearings before DPW, the accused’s right to cross-examine witnesses is both statutorily provided and constitutionally protected. As stated in <em>R. v.

Notably, after the child finished testifying on direct examination in that case, DPW provided a transcript of her testimony to the accused and his attorney to review in preparation for cross-examination. “This procedure allowed R. to know precisely what evidence <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>the government was using to prove its case, and gave R. an opportunity to challenge that evidence.” <em><a href="/pa/535/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="636 A.2d 142" data-case-ids="1841512,7354007" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0440-01,/a2d/636/0142-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/535/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="636 A.2d 142" data-case-ids="1841512,7354007" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0440-01,/a2d/636/0142-01">at 150</a>.</p>

The question of waiver is complicated by appellee’s tardiness in securing counsel, and the ALJ’s March 15, 2010 determination not to afford him a continuance to secure counsel when admission of the DVD was first discussed. As the Majority notes, although the ALJ approved admission of the DVD at that hearing, it was not actually viewed because of technical difficulties, a circumstance that undercut the ALJ’s rationale for denying a continuance. The ALJ held a second hearing on April 20, 2010, where the DVD was introduced. At that time, appellee appeared with counsel. Concerning the issue of Daughter’s unavailability, the ALJ informed appellee’s counsel at the outset, “We’re not going to go back and rehash the hearing.” N.T., 4/20/10, at 6. Whether these circumstances, and counsel’s later failure to lodge an objection to formal admission of the DVD, in fact operate to waive the constitutional claim, is a matter for the Commonwealth Court to determine in the first instance.</p>
