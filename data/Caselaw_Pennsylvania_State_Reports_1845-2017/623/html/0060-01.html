For the reasons that follow, we conclude that claims for occupational disease which manifests outside of the 300-week period prescribed by the Act do not fall within the purview of the Act, and, therefore, that the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) does not apply to preclude an employee from filing a common law claim against an employer.

The Superior Court reasoned that application of Section 303(a) “does not deny access to the courts, rather it limits recovery as contemplated by the legislative scheme.” <em>Ranalli, </em><a href="/a2d/983/0732-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="983 A.2d 732" data-case-ids="7292991" data-case-paths="/a2d/983/0732-01">983 A.2d at 735</a>.

Although both Appellants and Employers make grammatical arguments based on punctuation placement, the common and approved usage of the terms in Section 301(c)(2) clearly support Appellants’ interpretation of the statute. While an act generally is described as applying or not applying in certain situations, the term “compensation” is not invoked in the same manner. Indeed, our research reveals no published decision in which any Pennsylvania court has utilized the verb “apply” to describe the term “compensation.” Similarly, there are no Pennsylvania statutes which invoke the terms “apply” and “compensation” in this manner. Thus, we conclude that the term “it” applies not to “compensation,” but to the term “act,” as contained in (1) the phrase “for disability or death under <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>this act” immediately preceding “it”; and/or (2) the phrase “as used in this act” in the preamble to Section 301(c)(2).

Additionally, they posit that considerations such as the object to be attained and the consequences of a particular interpretation, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c), militate in favor of their proffered construction. Here, Plaintiffs note that the WCA establishes a <em>quid pro quo </em>whereby an employer assumes no-fault liability but is shielded from potentially greater liability at common law, while the employee receives expeditious compensation but forgoes some elements of damages. <em>See Alston v.

Anticipating that Employers will argue that allowing a common-law remedy would undermine the act’s objective of limiting employer liability, Plaintiffs contend that, to the degree the legislation is designed to limit liability, it is only intended to limit no-fault (or absolute) liability.

Thus, since it is undisputed that mesothelioma is an occupational disease as defined in Section 108, <em>see supra </em>note 2, Chemetron proffers that this alone is sufficient to implicate remedy exclusivity without consulting Section 301(c)(2). Alternatively, Employers state that, even if Section 301(c)(2) is deemed controlling, Plaintiffs’ grammatical analysis is in error since the antecedent of the pronoun “it” in the phrase “it shall apply” is not the word “act,” but “compensation,” and that this construction is appropriate because the commas surrounding the phrase, “for disability or death under this act,” signify that the clause is a nonrestrictive one — that is, it contains parenthetical, explanatory information, and as such, the commas may be replaced with parentheses without altering the meaning. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brief for Chemetron at 20 (citing, <em>inter alia, </em>William Strunk, Jr. &amp; E.B.

This is significant, according to Employers, because it shows that the statutory proviso was not intended to negate the act’s coverage of mesothelioma, and any covered disease is subject to the rule of exclusivity even where the injury is ultimately non-compensable on some independent basis (such as the expiration of a limitation period).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a>

As applied here, Employers reason that, although Plaintiffs’ disease first manifested beyond the 300-week period, their condition fell within the WCA’s <em>ambit </em>— i.e., was covered by the WCA — and hence, Section 303(a) exclusivity applies notwithstanding non-compensability. <em>See generally </em>Brief for Chemetron at 26 (citing <em>Kline v.

Thus, the issue forwarded here touches on social policy which, of course, is the primary domain of the Legislature. The advent of workers’ compensation laws in the early twentieth century accomplished two things broadly described in terms of a compromise between the interests of employers and employees. It gave employees compensation based solely on a loss of earning power, and it immunized employers from large and unexpected costs they might incur through the tort system. <em>See Shick v. Shirey, </em><a href="/pa/552/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="552 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="559529" data-case-paths="/pa/552/0590-01">552 Pa. 590</a>, 603, <a href="/a2d/716/1231-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="716 A.2d 1231" data-case-ids="11706881,559529" data-case-paths="/a2d/716/1231-01,/pa/552/0590-01">716 A.2d 1231</a>, 1237 (1998) (describing this compromise). This system provided employers better means of predicting the costs of doing business, while workers also gained in the aggregate because, under the old common law system, most injuries remained uncompensated notwithstanding the presence, in many cases, of employer negligence or adverse workplace conditions. <em>See Exceptions to the Exclusive Remedy Requirements of Workers’ Compensation Statutes, </em><a href="/citations/?q=96%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%201641" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="96 Harv.

Such a system inevitably contained limitations on compensation, both in the form of time restrictions (due to its essentially administrative nature) and in terms of substantive limitations on liability.

To the degree the majority suggests that the long latency period associated with mesothelioma "operates as a <em>de facto </em>exclusion of coverage under the Act for essentially all mesothelioma claims,” Majority Opinion, at 80, 81 A.3d at 863, the majority is mistaken. The latency period is measured from the first exposure, <em>see, e.g., Jones v. United States, </em><a href="/f-supp-2d/751/0835-01" class="citation" data-index="171" data-cite="751 F. Supp. 2d 835" data-case-ids="4265348" data-case-paths="/f-supp-2d/751/0835-01">751 F.Supp.2d 835</a>, 840-41 (E.D.N.C.2010) (referencing the definition of "latency period” provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), whereas the 300-week statutory interval is measured from the last exposure. <em>See supra </em>note 6. This distinction is significant for persons who have had a long occupational history of exposure. The majority responds by pointing out that many workers may fall outside such a group. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 79-80 n.5, 81 A.3d at 863-64 n.5. Indeed, the rights of some workers will undoubtedly be negatively affected by legislative line drawing. However, legislation by its nature involves line-drawing and classifications. <em>Accord Ryan v. Burlington County, </em><a href="/f2d/889/1286-01" class="citation" data-index="172" data-cite="889 F.2d 1286" data-case-ids="10538300" data-case-paths="/f2d/889/1286-01">889 F.2d 1286</a>, 1291 (3d Cir.1989). Our initial task exclusive of Appellants’ separate constitutional claims, is not to judge the wisdom of specific lines the Legislature has chosen to draw, but to endeavor to ascertain that body's intention at the time it drew them. Here, I see no reason to suppose that the General Assembly, when it brought diseases within the scope of the Act beginning in 1937 or moved from an elective to a mandatory scheme in 1974, meant to leave employers open to suit in the event the disease in question would manifest beyond the period of repose. Indeed, the decisions this Court rendered in the era when diseases were incorporated point in the opposite direction — namely, that if a particular type of work-related injury is covered by the Act, the lack of compensability under the circumstances does not render the employer liable to common-law tort liability — and the majority’s protestation that it is "inconceivable” that the Legislature would have intended such a result, Majority Opinion, at 79, 81 A.3d at 863, is difficult to reconcile with such cases, which are briefly discussed below. Finally, to the extent the majority suggests <em>Bowman v. Sunoco, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/620/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="173" data-cite="620 Pa. 28" data-case-ids="4327207,4328845" data-case-paths="/pa/620/0028-01,/pa/620/0028-02">620 Pa. 28</a>, <a href="/pa/620/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="174" data-cite="65 A.3d 901" data-case-ids="4327207,4328845,7309973,7309987" data-case-paths="/pa/620/0028-01,/pa/620/0028-02,/a3d/65/0901-01,/a3d/65/0901-02">65 A.3d 901</a> (2013), prohibits such a result based on public policy, the majority misapplies <em>Bowman. </em>The policy referenced in that case relates to preventing an employer, through an exercise of bargaining power, from requiring an employee <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>to relinquish his rights under the Act in the pre-injury timeframe. <em>See </em>

The central point made in <em>Moffett </em>was that, as a matter of statutory interpretation in light of the history of Pennsylvania's workers' compensation legislation, once the Legislature decided to bring a certain occupational disease within the scope of the act’s coverage, the statutory remedies were intended to be exclusive even where the act made compensation unavailable under the circumstances. <em>See Moffett, </em><a href="/pa/339/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="175" data-cite="339 Pa. 112" data-case-ids="1201284" data-case-paths="/pa/339/0112-01">339 Pa. at 116</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20A.2d%20111" class="citation" data-index="176" data-cite="14 A.2d 111">14 A.2d at 113</a> (recognizing that there are various types of limitations on compensability under the WCA, but that none of them have been construed as permitting a common-law remedy so long as the WCA covers injuries stemming from the disease in question).

I pause to emphasize that I am not without sympathy for workers who suffer from diseases that manifest beyond the time period permitted for compensation under Section 301(c)(2), and am cognizant of the harshness of the result that would ensue in such cases under my present interpretation. However, I am constrained by what I believe to be the legislative policy and intent underlying the time limitation, and as such, I would affirm the Superior Court’s expression that, absent constitutional infirmity, “removal or fine-tuning of the statute of repose is for the legislature, not for the courts.” <em>Ranalli v.

Additionally, I would observe that, in some cases at least, the injured worker will have recourse against other parties besides the employer. <em>See, e.g., </em>Supplemental Reproduced Record of Oglebay (reflecting that the Tooey plaintiffs have reached settlements with several defendant corporations).</p>

This aspect of Plaintiffs’ representation appears somewhat evasive, as Plaintiffs do not state that they served notice on the Attorney General. Plaintiffs also attach to their reply brief two documents purporting to be such notices at the common pleas level, one for the Tooey plaintiffs and the other for the Landis plaintiffs. Each contains a single sentence, stating: "Notice is hereby given that on May 13, 2008, the Plaintiffs have served their Challenge to the Constitutionality of the Workersf] Compensation Act.” The documents do not specify who received service of the challenge. The common pleas docket entries are similar.</p>

It may be true, as Plaintiffs suggest, that various parties involved in this litigation are interested in seeing the statute upheld. Still, I disagree with Plaintiffs' suggestion that this Court’s waiver analysis should consider whether those parties are powerful corporations who defend the enactment vigorously. Such considerations would require the Court to inquire into the financial strength of the parties before it and make an assessment as to whether their advocacy was sufficiently forceful that the Attorney General's input would be superfluous — a standard that would be unworkable in practice.</p>
