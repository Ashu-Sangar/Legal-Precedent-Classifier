Washington County Tax Claim Bureau, </em>No. 2009-10264 (Ct. Common Pleas, filed 12/29/10) (hereinafter “Trial Court Opinion”). The property at issue is Unit 1021 in the Fairways Condominium at Southpointe (hereinafter the “Property”), located in Cecil Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania. The Property was purchased by Gerald W. and Susan M. Horton (hereinafter, collectively, “Appellees”) on June 22, 2006, for $200,000 cash. It was used for <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>purposes related to their business, USG Insurance Services, Inc., which was based in Florida, with a local office in Washington County. The Property was occasionally occupied by business associates and family; mail was not delivered to the address. The deed to the Property contained three errors: (1) Gerald W. Horton’s name was listed as “Jerry W. Horton;” (2) Susan M. Horton’s name was listed as “Susan W. Horton;” and (3) a Certificate of Residence filed with the deed to the Property identified Appellees’ “precise residence” as 1021 Eagle Point Drive, Canonsburg, PA, 15317 (the Property’s address) even though, at all times relevant to this case, Appellees resided in Florida.</p>

Appellees made no real estate tax payments on the Property for the years 2007 and 2008. On September 23, 2009, still having received no tax payments, the Bureau sold the Property in a tax upset sale. The buyer was E.D. Lewis (hereinafter “Appellant”), who purchased the Property for $10,298.96 without competitive bidding.</p>

Specifically, these efforts included the following. On April 2, 2008, the Bureau mailed a courtesy letter regarding the 2007 unpaid taxes to Appellees at the Property’s address; the letter was returned by USPS as “No Such Number.” Subsequently, at various times over the next year, the Bureau checked several sources, some sources more than once, in an unsuccessful attempt to determine Appellees’ whereabouts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> On May 29, <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>2009, the Bureau mailed, via first-class to Appellees at the Property’s address, a courtesy pre-sale warning letter advising of the sale scheduled for September 23, 2009, and containing a payment due date of June 30, 2009; the letter was returned by USPS as “Return to Sender — Attempted—Not Known — Unable to Forward.” On July 14, 2009, as required by statutory provision 72 P.S. § 5860.602(e)(1), the Bureau sent tax upset sale notices via certified mail, restricted delivery, to each Appellee at the Property’s address; each notice was returned by USPS as “Not Deliverable as Addressed— Unable to Forward.” On July 22, 2009, as required by statutory provision 72 P.S. § 5860.602(e)(3), a Bureau agent posted the Property; his affidavit indicated that personal service had not been made as there was no answer at the Property. On August 20, 2009, as required by statutory provision 72 P.S. § 5860.602(a), the Bureau gave notice in three local newspapers of the scheduled September 23, 2009 tax upset sale of the Property. On August 27, 2009, as required by statutory provision 72 P.S. § 5860.602(e)(2), second notices of the impending tax upset sale of the Property were sent via first-class mail to each Appellee at the Property’s address; each notice was returned by USPS as “Not Deliverable as Addressed — Unable to Forward.” On September 8, 2009, the Bureau filed with the Prothonotary’s Office a petition to waive personal service.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Notes of Testimony, 4/22/10, (“N.T.”) at 167-69, 172. Mr. Holland was also unable to learn any information about Appellees’ whereabouts when he did an internet search of the Property’s address; the search came up with the name “USG Insurance” and a telephone number that yielded merely a recorded message directing one to enter a remote access code. <em>Id. </em>at 173-74. In addition, an internet search for a condominium association related to the Property did not yield any helpful information. <em>Id. </em>at 169-70. In a further attempt to locate a condominium association office, Mr. Holland then asked Appellant “to canvas the neighborhood” around the Property. <em>Id. </em>at 170. Appellant “drove around the neighborhood,” found a sales office, and made inquiry. <em>Id. </em>From the sales office, Mr. Holland obtained a phone number in Columbus, Ohio, through which, after several calls, he learned of Appellees’ business address in Florida. <em>Id. </em>at 171-72, 181; <em>see </em>Trial Court Opinion at 6-7 ¶ 16. On October 19, 2009, Appellant’s counsel served the quiet title action upon Appellees via certified mail, restricted delivery, at their Florida business address.

Recognizing that the legislature chose to use the USPS terms first class mail, certified mail, restricted delivery, and return receipt in Section 602(e), we must conclude that, if the legislature had intended to mandate the proffer of a Certificate of Mailing in order to establish proof of mailing, then the legislature would have so specified by use of that specific USPS term in subsection 602(e)(2).

I agree this proof is not limited to a denominated USPS Form, but encompasses whatever document the postal service provides to document the mailing. These services record the pertinent information and provide documentary evidence the statutory requirements were met. What form the postal service uses as a receipt seems immaterial and is not denominated by the statute as a required element. A review of the relevant provisions also suggests the legislature, in connection with the second notice under § 602(e)(2), did not require any specific mailing service, but instead, any of the services that provide documentation of the information outlined above. <em>Compare </em>72' P.S. § 5860.602(e)(1) (delineating specific mailing services), <em>with <a href="/a3d/3/0765-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="3 A.3d 765" data-case-ids="7289656" data-case-paths="/a3d/3/0765-01">id.,</a> </em>§ 602(e)(2) (requiring only “proof of mailing”).</p>

The pertinent phrase in the statute is not talking about burden of proof — indeed, there must be proof of all the prerequisites to sale, not just this one — and does not say any means of proof that mailing occurred is sufficient. It requires “first class mail, proof of mailing,” and while this language does not quite rise to a clear term of art, the statute is manifestly referring to evidence from the postal service. Putting the “proof of mailing” directly adjacent to the means of service (the postal service) certainly contemplates a document from the postal service, by whatever form number or title it chooses to designate it, which vouches for the mailing.
