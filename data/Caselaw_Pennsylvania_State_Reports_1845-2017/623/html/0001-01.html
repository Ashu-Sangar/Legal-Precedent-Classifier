The contracts, which were prepared by Portnoff and submitted to the municipalities for execution, provided that Portnoff would be compensated for her collections by charging her legal fees to the delinquent taxpayer. Specifically, taxpayers would be charged $150 for the opening of a file and preparation of a demand letter; $150 for the filing of a lien and preparation of a second letter; and $150 for preparation and filing of a writ of <em>scire </em>facias.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The contracts further <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>required the municipalities to enact an ordinance or resolution authorizing Portnoff to impose legal fees upon the delinquent taxpayer.</p>

The administrative cost plus the placement amount was referred to by Portnoff as “principal.” From the time a file was sent to her for collection, Portnoff began charging 10% interest on the principal.</p>

On July 8, 2009, the trial court issued an award in favor of Taxpayers in the amount of $1,058,697.10, which represented compensatory damages based on violations of Act 6 and unjust enrichment, plus statutory interest and attorneys’ fees.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> On November 6, 2009, the court granted Taxpayers’ motion for attorneys’ fees and expenses in the amount of $1,267,386.25 and $20,923.11, <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>respectively.

Second, the Court concluded the language of Section 504, which provides that “[a]ny person affected by a violation of the act shall have the substantive right to bring an action on behalf of himself individually,” 41 P.S. § 504, “does not preclude such individuals from complaining collectively in the form of a class action.” <a href="/a3d/25/1274-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="25 A.3d 1274" data-case-ids="7282476" data-case-paths="/a3d/25/1274-01">25 A.3d at 1278</a>.

Moreover, Portnoff asserts that, based on the rules of statutory construction, the first sentence of Section 502 of the Act — “for the loan or use of money” — must be read to modify not just the term “interest,” but also the word “charges.” Portnoff additionally disputes Taxpayers’ effort to characterize themselves as “debtors” under the Act, citing this Court’s decision in <em>In re Moorehead’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/289/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="289 Pa. 542" data-case-ids="1103305" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0542-01">289 Pa. 542</a>, 553, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.%20802" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="137 A. 802">137 A. 802</a>, 806 (1927) (stating “a tax is not a debt”).</p>
