The litigation proceeded below in an accelerated fashion, in part because the legislation itself was designed to take effect quickly and imposed obligations which required the challengers to formulate their legal positions swiftly; and in part in recognition of the obvious economic importance of the legislation to the Commonwealth and its citizens.</p>

This Opinion, representing the views of this author, Madame Justice Todd, and Mr. Justice McCaffery, finds that several core provisions of Act 13 violate the Commonwealth’s duties as trustee of Pennsylvania’s public natural resources under the Environmental Rights Amendment; other challenges lack merit; and still further issues require additional examination in the Commonwealth Court. Mr. Justice Baer, in concurrence, concurs in the mandate, and joins the Majority Opinion in all parts except Parts III and VI(C); briefly stated, rather than grounding merits affirmance in the Environmental Rights Amendment, Justice Baer would find that the core constitutional infirmity sounds in substantive due process.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the Commonwealth Court’s decision, and remand for further proceedings consistent with specific directives later set forth in this Opinion. <em>See </em>Part VI (Conclusion and Mandate), <em>infra.</em>

    <p id="b622-4" data-blocks='[["BL_622.4",622,[280,581,1150,629]]]'>The Marcellus Shale Formation has been a known natural gas reservoir (containing primarily methane) for more than 75 years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Particularly in northeastern Pennsylvania, the shale rock is organic-rich and thick. Early drilling efforts revealed that the gas occurred in “pockets” within the rock formations, and that the flow of natural gas from wells was not continuous. Nonetheless, geological surveys in the 1970s showed that the Marcellus Shale Formation had “excellent potential to fill the needs of users” if expected technological development continued and natural gas prices increased. Those developments materialized and they permitted shale drilling in the Marcellus Formation to start in 2003; production began in 2005.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Over time, <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>tectonic and hydraulic stresses fracture the rock and natural gas <em>(e.g., </em>methane) migrates to fill the fractures or pockets. In the Marcellus Shale Formation, fractures in the rock and naturally-occurring gas pockets are insufficient in size and number to sustain consistent industrial production of natural gas. The industry uses two techniques that enhance recovery of natural gas from these “unconventional” gas wells: hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” (usually slick-water fracking) and horizontal drilling. Both techniques inevitably do violence to the landscape. Slick-water fracking involves pumping at high pressure into the rock formation a mixture of sand and freshwater treated with a gel friction reducer, until the rock cracks, resulting in greater gas mobility. Horizontal drilling requires the drilling of a vertical hole to 5,500 to 6,500 feet— several hundred feet above the target natural gas pocket or reservoir — and then directing the drill bit through an arc until the drilling proceeds sideways or horizontally. One unconventional gas well in the Marcellus Shale uses several million gallons of water.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The development of the natural gas industry in the Marcellus Shale Formation prompted enactment of Act 13.</p>

The Commonwealth claims that, as named trustee, the sovereign is “plainly” given “the authority and the obligation to control Pennsylvania’s natural resources.” The mu<a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>nicipalities have no power to assert authority under Section 27 “as against the Legislature.” OAG’s Brief (as cross-appellee) at 28-29. In short, the Commonwealth’s position is that the Environmental Rights Amendment recognizes or confers no right upon citizens and no right or inherent obligation upon municipalities; rather, the constitutional provision exists only to guide the General Assembly, which alone determines what is best for public natural resources, and the environment generally, in Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth thus requests that we affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court in this respect.</p>

The first obligation arises from the prohibitory nature of the constitutional clause creating the trust, and is similar to other negative rights articulated in the Declaration of Rights. Stated otherwise, the Commonwealth has an obligation to refrain from performing its trustee duties respecting the environment unreasonably, including via legislative enactments or executive action. As trustee, the Commonwealth has a duty to refrain from permitting or encouraging the degradation, diminution, or depletion of public natural resources, whether such degradation, diminution, or depletion would occur through direct state action or indirectly, <em>e.g., </em>because of the state’s failure to restrain the actions of private parties.

The drafters and the citizens of the Commonwealth who ratified the Environmental Rights Amendment, aware of this history, articulated the people’s rights and the government’s duties to the people in broad and flexible terms that would permit not only reactive but also anticipatory protection of the environment for the benefit of current and future generations. Moreover, public trustee duties were delegated concomitantly to all branches and levels of government in recognition that the quality of the environment is a task with both local and statewide implications, and to ensure that all government neither infringed upon the people’s rights nor failed to act for the benefit of the people in this area crucial to the well-being of all Pennsylvanians.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_51" id="ref_footnote_1_51">51</a>

The question of how Article I, Section 27 obligations restrain the exercise of police power by the government <em>(e.g., </em>to regulate an industry), although a significant matter, has not presented itself for judicial resolution and this Court has had no opportunity to address the original understanding of the constitutional provision in this context until now. <em>See Heller, </em><a href="/us/554/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="306" data-cite="554 U.S. 570" data-case-ids="3677081" data-case-paths="/us/554/0570-01">554 U.S. at 625-26</a>, <a href="/us/554/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="307" data-cite="554 U.S. 570" data-case-ids="3677081" data-case-paths="/us/554/0570-01">128 S.Ct. 2783</a>. Subsequent to ratification, the Court entertained claims regarding the application of Section 27 in factual scenarios that generally fell within two categories: (1) challenges to specific private or governmental development projects, which implicated alleged violations of constitutional environmental rights and (2) challenges to local or statewide environmental quality laws, which implicated alleged violations of constitutional property rights. In light of the challenges, precedent has tended to define the broad constitutional rights in terms of compliance with various statutes and, as a result, to minimize the constitutional import of the Environmental Rights Amendment. Moreover, existing precedent has failed to differentiate <a id="p667" href="#p667" data-label="667" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*667</a>between challenges based on whether they implicated the people’s rights under the first or second clauses of Section 27, or the Commonwealth’s trustee duties under the second and third clauses, or both.

The residents/challengers argued that the Commonwealth violated its duties as trustee of Pennsylvania’s public natural resources by approving the River Street project. In affirming the Commonwealth Court’s denial of relief, this Court held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the <a id="p669" href="#p669" data-label="669" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*669</a>residents had not met their burden of proof. <a href="/pa/468/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="309" data-cite="468 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="1719712" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0226-01">361 A.2d at 273</a>. According to the Court, the residents were seeking automatic relief by merely asserting a common right to a protected value under the trusteeship of the state. But, the Court stated, the proper approach was to balance interests in conservation of natural resources and maintenance of an adequate highway system, a task that the legislation pursuant to which the River Street project had been approved, Act 120 of 1970, already accomplished. <em>See <a href="/pa/468/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="310" data-cite="468 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="1719712" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0226-01">id.</a> </em>(citing 71 P.S. § 511 <em>el seq. </em>(Powers and Duties of Department of Transportation)). The residents, therefore, were not entitled to relief under Section 27.

In its subsequent applications, the Commonwealth Court has indicated that the viability of constitutional claims premised upon the Environmental Rights Amendment was limited by whether the General Assembly had acted and by the General Assembly’s policy choices, rather than by the plain language of the amendment. <em>See, e.g., Larwin Multihousing Pa.

But, while the <em>Payne </em>test may have answered a call for guidance on substantive standards in this area of law and may be relatively easy to apply, the test poses difficulties both obvious and critical. First, the <em>Payne </em>test describes the Commonwealth’s obligations — both as trustee and under the first clause of Section 27 — in much narrower terms than the constitutional provision. Second, the test assumes that the availability of judicial relief premised upon Section 27 is contingent upon and constrained by legislative action. And, finally, the Commonwealth Court’s <em>Payne </em>decision and its progeny have the effect of minimizing the constitutional duties of executive agencies and the judicial branch, and circumscribing the abilities of these entities to carry out their constitutional duties independent of legislative control. <em>Accord </em>Fernandez, 17 Harv.

In short, local government is required to authorize oil and gas operations, impoundment areas, and location assessment operations (including seismic testing and the use of explosives) as permitted uses in all zoning districts throughout a locality. Local government is also required to authorize natural gas compressor stations as permitted uses in agricultural and industrial districts, and as conditional uses in all other zoning districts. Local governments are also commanded to authorize natural gas processing plants as permitted uses in industrial districts and as conditional uses in agricultural districts. Moreover, Section 3304 limits local government to imposing conditions: on construction of oil and gas operations only as stringent as those on construction activities for industrial uses; and on heights of structures, screening and fencing, lighting and noise only as stringent as those imposed on other land development within the same zoning district. Local government is also simply prohibited from limiting subterranean operations and hours of operation for assembly and disassembly of drilling rigs, and for operation of oil and gas wells, compressor stations, or processing plants. Localities also may not increase setbacks from uses related to the oil and gas industry beyond those articulated by Act 13. In addition, the dictated approach to setbacks focuses only on “existing buildings,” offering residents and property owners no setback protections should they desire to develop further their own properties.

The Commission’s orders related to enacted ordinances are subject to <em>de novo </em>review in the Commonwealth Court, while the advisory opinions are deemed unappealable.

Oil and gas resources are both privately owned and partly public, <em>ie., </em>insofar as they are on public lands. Act 13 does not remotely purport to regulate simply those oil and gas resources that are part of the public trust corpus, but rather, it addresses the exploitation of all oil and gas resources throughout Pennsylvania. Act 13’s primary stated purpose is not to effectuate the constitutional obligation to protect and preserve Pennsylvania’s natural environment. Rather, the purpose of the statute is to provide a maximally favorable environment for industry operators to exploit Pennsylvania’s oil and natural gas resources, including those in the Marcellus Shale Formation. <em>See </em>58 Pa.C.S. § 3202 (primary purpose is to permit “optimal development of oil and gas resources”). The authority to regulate the oil and gas industry in this context derives, therefore, from the General Assembly’s plenary power to enact laws for the purposes of promoting the general welfare, including public convenience and general prosperity, rather than from its corresponding duties as trustee of Pennsylvania’s public natural resources. <em>See Clifton, </em><a href="/pa/600/0662-01" class="citation" data-index="351" data-cite="969 A.2d 1197" data-case-ids="4192574,7264164" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0662-01,/a2d/969/1197-01">969 A.2d at </a>1211 n. 19; <em>Best, </em><a href="/citations/?q=141%20A.2d%20606" class="citation" data-index="352" data-cite="141 A.2d 606">141 A.2d at 611</a>.

The lessons learned from that history led directly to the Environmental Rights Amendment, a measure which received overwhelming support from legislators and the voters alike. When coal was “King,” there was no Environmental Rights Amendment to constrain exploitation of the resource, to protect the people and the environment, or to impose the sort of specific duty as trustee upon the Commonwealth as is found in the Amendment. Pennsylvania’s very real and mixed past is visible today to anyone travelling across Pennsylvania’s spectacular, rolling, varied terrain. The forests may not be primordial, but they have returned and are beautiful nonetheless; the mountains and valleys remain; the riverways remain, too, not as pure as when William Penn first laid eyes upon his colonial charter, but cleaner and better than they were in a relatively recent past, when the citizenry was less attuned to the environmental effects of the exploitation of subsurface natural resources. But, the landscape bears visible scars, too, as reminders of the past efforts of man to exploit Pennsylvania’s natural assets. Pennsylvania’s past is the necessary prologue here: the reserved rights, and the concomitant duties and constraints, embraced by the Environmental Rights Amendment, are a product of our unique history.</p>

We have explained that, <a id="p689" href="#p689" data-label="689" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*689</a>as a result, all existing branches and levels of government derive constitutional duties and obligations with respect to the people. The municipalities affected by Act 13 all existed before that Act was adopted; and most if not all had land use measures in place. Those ordinances necessarily addressed the environment, and created reasonable expectations in the resident citizenry. To put it succinctly, our citizens buying homes and raising families in areas zoned residential had a reasonable expectation concerning the environment in which they were living, often for years or even decades. Act 13 fundamentally disrupted those expectations, and ordered local government to take measures to effect the new uses, irrespective of local concerns. The constitutional command respecting the environment necessarily restrains legislative power with respect to political subdivisions that have acted upon their Article I, Section 27 responsibilities: the General Assembly can neither offer political subdivisions purported relief from obligations under the Environmental Rights Amendment, nor can it remove necessary and reasonable authority from local governments to carry out these constitutional duties. Indeed, if the General Assembly had subsumed local government entirely by Act 13 — it did not, instead it required local government essentially to be complicit in accommodating a new environmental regime irrespective of the character of the locale — the General Assembly could not eliminate the commands of Article I, Section 27. Rather, the General Assembly would simply have shifted the constitutional obligations onto itself. And those obligations include the duty to “conserve and maintain” the public natural resources, including clean air and pure water, “for the benefit of all the people.” The Commonwealth, by the General Assembly, declares in Section 3303 that environmental obligations related to the oil and gas industries are of statewide concern and, on that basis, the Commonwealth purports to preempt the regulatory field to the exclusion of all local environmental legislation that might be perceived as affecting oil and gas operations. Act 13 thus commands municipalities to ignore their obligations under Article I, Section 27 and further directs municipalities to take affirmative actions to undo existing protections of the <a id="p690" href="#p690" data-label="690" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*690</a>environment in their localities. The police power, broad as it may be, does not encompass such authority to so fundamentally disrupt these expectations respecting the environment. Accordingly, we are constrained to hold that, in enacting this provision of Act 13, the General Assembly transgressed its delegated police powers which, while broad and flexible, are nevertheless limited by constitutional commands, including the Environmental Rights Amendment.</p>

Insofar as Section 3304 permits the fracking operations and exploitation of the Marcellus Shale at issue here, the provision compels exposure of otherwise protected areas to environmental and habitability costs associated with this particular industrial use: air, water, and soil pollution; persistent noise, lighting, and heavy vehicle traffic; and the building of facilities incongruous with the surrounding landscape. The entirely new legal regimen alters existing expectations of communities and property owners and substantially diminishes natural and esthetic values of the local environment, which contribute significantly to a quality of environmental life in Pennsylvania. Again, protected by their organic charter, these communities and property owners could reasonably rely upon the zoning schemes that municipalities designed at the General Assembly’s prompt, schemes in which participation was mandatory and which imposed costs (for example, land use restrictions) upon participants, in addition to benefits. The costs, under the local schemes, presumably were rationally related to the scheme’s benefits. For communities and property owners affected by Act 13, however, the General Assembly has effectively disposed of the regulatory structures upon which citizens and communities <a id="p693" href="#p693" data-label="693" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*693</a>made significant financial and quality of life decisions, and has sanctioned a direct and harmful degradation of the environmental quality of life in these communities and zoning districts.

But, Act 13’s blunt approach fails to account for this constitutional command at all and, indeed, exacerbates the problem by offering minimal statewide protections while disabling local government from mitigating the impact of oil and gas development at a local level. <em>See </em>58 Pa.C.S. § 3304(b)(2)-(4), (10)-(11).

Remarkably, Section 3304 then goes even further, as it prohibits local government from tailoring protections for water and air quality <em>(e.g., </em>through increased setbacks) and for the natural, scenic, and esthetic characteristics of the environment <em>(e.g., </em>through increased setbacks, screening, fencing, reduced hours of operation requirements) in the affected areas within a municipality. <em><a href="/pa/487/0592-01" class="citation" data-index="377" data-cite="487 Pa. 592" data-case-ids="1759057" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0592-01">Id.</a> </em>Imposing statewide environmental and habitability standards appropriate for the heaviest of industrial areas in sensitive zoning districts lowers environmental and habitability protections for affected residents and property owners below the existing threshold and permits significant degradation of public natural resources.

In the Commonwealth’s view, the Department’s discretion is limited by Act 13’s express intent and by the Commonwealth’s various existing environmental statutes. But, predictably enough given the broad language of Section 3215, the Commonwealth fails to identify any actual substantive conditions that may be deemed necessary for the purposes of Act 13. Rather, the necessary protections are determined according to criteria that the Environmental Quality Board shall articulate, which are to account for the impact on public natural resources of oil and gas operations; notably, those criteria must ensure optimal development of the industry. <em>See </em>58 Pa.C.S. § 3215(e).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_60" id="ref_footnote_1_60">60</a> The direction to the Depart<a id="p698" href="#p698" data-label="698" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*698</a>ment of Environmental Protection then is merely “to consider” the Environmental Quality Board’s criteria in granting well permits.

The statute does not provide any ascertainable standards by which public natural resources are to be protected if an oil and gas operator seeks a waiver of the Section 3215(b) setbacks. The statement of legislative intent, which simply articulates broad principles, offers no additional clarification regarding the environmental standard governing either the applicant or the Department of Environmental Protection. Moreover, Act 13 offers no reference, however oblique, to any requirement that the Department is obligated to consider the Commonwealth’s environmental statutes in rendering its permit decisions or imposing well permit conditions under Act 13. Section 3257 of Act 13, for example, which the Commonwealth cites as incorporating standards of environmental statutes into the Section 3215(b) decision, declares as a general matter (while offering specific examples) merely <a id="p699" href="#p699" data-label="699" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*699</a>that Chapter 82 of Act 18 “provide[s] additional and cumulative remedies to control activities related to drilling for or production of oil and gas in this Commonwealth, and nothing contained in this chapter abridges or alters rights of action or remedies existing, or which existed previously, in equity or under common or statutory law, criminal or civil.” 58 Pa.C.S. § 3257. The provision makes no reference to whether or how substantive standards of existing environmental acts enter into a well permit determination, let alone into a Section 3215(b)(4) decision. Considered in its totality, the Section 3215(b) scheme lacks identifiable and readily-enforceable environmental standards for granting well permits or setback waivers, which yields at best arbitrary terms and conditions and, at worst, wholly ineffective protections for the waters of the Commonwealth.

From the outset, Section 3215(b) appears to provide for nothing more than a set of voluntary setbacks or, as an alternative, the opportunity for a permit applicant to negotiate with the Department of Environmental Protection the terms or conditions of its oil or natural gas well permit. If an applicant appeals permit terms or conditions — and only the applicant can appeal — Section 3215 remarkably places the burden on the Department to “prov[e] that the conditions were necessary to protect against a probable harmful impact of [sic] the public resources.” 58 Pa.C.S. § 3215(e). Viewed in terms of the constitutional mandates, this is topsy-turvy: Act 13 places on the Department the burden of proof and persuasion, and the people are allocated thereby the risk of an erroneous decision by the Environmental Quality Board. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In response, the Commonwealth Court proceeded to assess the constitutionality of Section 3304, and Act 13 as a vague whole, based on an overly broad distinction and absent any analysis of whether the distinction had any fair and substantial relationship to the challenged provisions’ object, in light of the distinct constitutional breaches alleged by the citizens.</p>

Identifying the oil and gas industry as a class that may be subject to different treatment at law and concluding that regulation of oil and gas operations accomplishes a legitimate state purpose are only the beginning of the special legislation constitutional inquiry. It is neither sufficient to look at the oil and gas industry and determine whether it is different from other industries, nor simply to accept that the declared benign purpose of Act 13 controls the constitutional inquiry, as the Commonwealth argues. <em>See, e.g., Stilp, </em><a href="/pa/588/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="403" data-cite="905 A.2d 918" data-case-ids="3787763,8472059" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0539-01,/a2d/905/0918-01">905 A.2d at 945</a>. Rather, the required inquiry is into the effect of the provisions challenged by the citizens, with respect to whether the admitted different treatment of the oil and gas industry represented by Act 13 rests upon some ground of difference that is reasonable rather than arbitrary and has a fair and substantial relationship to the object of each challenged provision. <em>See Pennsylvania Tpk.

To illustrate the point, it is simple enough to explain why the oil and gas industry is <em>sui generis, </em>and simple enough to declare that a statutory scheme designed to facilitate extraction promises economic benefits. But, those facts hardly explain why, for example, in the event of a “spill,” notice is required to public water suppliers but not to owners of private wells. Finally, to the extent that the citizens also offered the alternate theory, as the Commonwealth suggests, that Act 13 is <em>per se </em>unconstitutional because it creates a class of one, the Commonwealth Court also failed to dispose of that claim.</p>

Mount Pleasant is a thirty-six square mile community of approximately 3,500 people. When Marcellus Shale development began, the local zoning ordinance permitted oil and gas drilling operations as a use of right in all zoning districts. Gas drilling, as a result, developed unrestrained in all areas and zoning districts between 2004 and 2010-11. Mount Pleasant has 108 gas wells, of which 97 are active, two compressor stations, one dew point control facility, four fracking fluid impoundment areas, and miles of pipeline. The manager relates that, "Mount Pleasant has experienced an overturned tanker truck, an explosion, a spill, and seven fires at well sites.” The Township was forced to close one road and threatened to close another in a residential area because the roads had not been built for the "onslaught of heavy truck traffic.” <em>Id. </em>at ¶ 8.

One commentator has observed that, "For a constitutional provision to be self-executing, the provision must provide the court with a complete and enforceable rule.... [T]he constitutional language must supply a sufficient rule by means of which the right which the provision grants may be enjoyed and protected.” Fernandez, 17 Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. at 333; <em>see also </em>Williams, 27 Okla. City U.L. Rev. at 221. On the issue of whether Section 27 of Article I was self-executing, no majority holding or reasoning emerged from the <em>Gettysburg </em>Court. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth Court in that case had held earlier that Section 27 was self-executing. <em>See Commonwealth v. Nat'l Gettysburg Battlefield Tower, Inc., </em>8 Pa.Cmwlth. 231, <a href="/citations/?q=302%20A.2d%20886" class="citation" data-index="547" data-cite="302 A.2d 886">302 A.2d 886</a>, 892 (1973). The parties here do not dispute the self-executing nature of Section 27 in such terms, albeit aspects of the Commonwealth's arguments concerning justiciability implicate the point. Nor do the parties dispute that the Commonwealth may adopt legislation on the issues addressed in Section 27 pursuant to its police power. We note that the characterization of the <em>Gettysburg </em>Court’s ultimate stance on these points in <em>United Artists Theater Circuit, Inc. v. City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/535/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="548" data-cite="535 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1841544" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0370-01">535 Pa. 370</a>, <a href="/pa/535/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="549" data-cite="635 A.2d 612" data-case-ids="1841544,7368836" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0370-01,/a2d/635/0612-01">635 A.2d 612</a>, 620 (1993), is erroneous. In <em>United Artists, </em>the Court stated that "a plurality of the <em>[Gettysburg </em>] Court held that [Section 27] was not self-executing, and legislative action was necessary to accomplish [its] goals.” In fact, only two of the seven Justices in <em>Gettysburg </em>subscribed to that view; two Justices concluded the opposite; and three Justices did not address the issue. The prevailing view, insofar as the <em>Gettysburg </em>case was concerned, was the Commonwealth Court's holding that the provision was self-executing.</p>

In <em>Fox, </em>for example, the Commonwealth Court held that the decision of the former Department of Environmental Resources to grant a permit to run a sewer extension line along a stream was proper under the Clean Streams Act. The panel therefore vacated the decision of the Environmental Quality Board, which had remanded the matter to the Department for consideration, in light of the Department's constitutional trustee duties, of the impact on constitutional environmental values of the proposed development. In the panel’s view, while the Department could consider such impact pursuant to other environmental statutes, the review of a permit decision under the Clean Streams Act was more limited. According to the Commonwealth Court, the Board's <a id="p672" href="#p672" data-label="672" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*672</a>decision would have required the Department to overstep its statutory authority under the Clean Streams Act, an action which the Environmental Rights Amendment did not authorize. <a href="/citations/?q=342%20A.2d%20468" class="citation" data-index="550" data-cite="342 A.2d 468">342 A.2d at 482-83</a>. The Commonwealth Court’s conclusions that the Amendment limits rather than expands executive agency authority, and that executive agency authority to act is limited by its enabling legislation, are certainly reasonable. The difficulty with the <em>Fox </em>decision is in how the court went about reaching those conclusions. Thus, the Commonwealth Court indicated that satisfying the <em>Payne </em>test (pursuant to which legislative enactments are deemed to delineate the parameters of constitutional trustee duties, rather than the plain language of the constitutional provision) was sufficient to dispose of any constitutional challenge to an agency decision. The court seemingly relieved executive agencies of the obligation to apply statutes and exercise their statutory discretion in a manner consonant with the Constitution, indicating that mere compliance with the enabling statute and relevant regulations was sufficient to satisfy constitutional strictures. <em>See Hartford, </em><a href="/pa/505/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="551" data-cite="505 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1788868" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0571-01">482 A.2d at 549</a>.

In addition to strengthening the citizens’ claims that the statutory scheme offers no clear standards for determining permit applications, the absence of data also suggests that the Commonwealth has failed to discharge its trustee duty of gathering and making available to the beneficiaries complete and accurate information as to the nature and amount of the trust property. <em>In re Rosenblum’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/459/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="555" data-cite="459 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="481063" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0201-01">459 Pa. 201</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="556" data-cite="459 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="481063" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0201-01">328 A.2d 158</a>, 164-65 (1974) (citing Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 173) (right of access to trust records is essential part of beneficiary's right to complete information concerning administration of trust; right of inspection has independent source in beneficiaiy's property interest in trust estate); <em>see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 173 cmt. c ("[BJeneficiary is always entitled to such information as is reasonably necessary to enable him to enforce his rights under the trust or to prevent or redress a breach of trust.”).</p>

The citizens also assert broadly that only quasi-judicial bodies, rather than any administrative agencies vested with jurisdiction, may render decisions on constitutional issues.

While Administrative Agency Law compliance issues and complaints of unfairness may raise questions regarding whether the administrative process is adequate, or concerns of due process and of vindication of the right of appeal, these concerns alone do not implicate the principle of separation of powers. The citizens’ challenge here is premised solely upon the separation of powers.

May the General Assembly, through a law applicable statewide, remove <em>en toto </em>from local municipalities the apparatus it provided to vindicate the individual substantive due process rights of Pennsylvanian landowners? Justices Saylor and Eakin would seem to say “yes,” so long as the legislature substitutes adequate alternative safeguards, which they believe it did through Act 13. The Commonwealth Court, in the decision below, said “no,” reasoning that by requiring municipalities to forego their established zoning restrictions regarding, for example, oil and gas drilling and production, the General Assembly forced municipalities to “violat[e] substantive due process because [municipalities can no longer] protect the interests of neighboring property owners from harm,” and further because Act 13 “alters the character of neighborhoods, and makes irrational classifications .... ” <em>Robinson Tp. v.

To the Commonwealth, the maxim of <em>sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas </em>cannot be used to establish constitutional due process violations, as a landowner cannot violate the due process rights of his neighbor; only government can infringe upon constitutional rights. Thus, it asserts that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and Article I, Section 1 are shields against governmental action only, and to the extent a landowner wants to drill for gas on his own land, his neighbor does not have a constitutional argument to voice.

While Act 13 does restrict the ability of Municipalities to exclude oil and gas development from specified zoning districts as a matter of course, it does not leave a vacuum. Rather, it establishes minimum setback requirements, strict environmental standards, and other criteria which must be met before property may be used for oil and gas related activities. Act 13, therefore, does not eviscerate the protections provided by local zoning ordinances; it simply substitutes the regulations and standards established by local government officials as they relate to the location of oil and gas development with those of the General Assembly.</blockquote>

This Act does not force a derrick into every neighborhood; Justice Saylor’s opinion recounts the protections in the Act that have precisely the opposite effect. This Act is about a pipeline — it is aimed at the method of transporting the gas more than the extraction itself.

It is not an obtrusive means of transporting energy; a person would be hard pressed to locate a current pipeline were it not for the occasional roadside marker. In fact, the PUC currently inspects the existing pipeline infrastructure that serves consumers — that portion alone consists of over 46,000 miles. Despite the fear mongering about pipelines, practical experience shows the contrary, and there is no evidence suggesting these interfere with our environment in any significant way.</blockquote>

The number of trucks needed to transport the gas that could flow through a pipeline may be fewer than the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin, but not by much. Will the environment, which underlies the constitutional argument, be better or worse when fleets of trucks expel their exhausts into our air and spill fuel and oil that leaks into our water? Beyond the environmental consequences, the physical toll of such an armada on the repair of our state roads and local highways can hardly be overstated.</blockquote>

As an example of its tendency to broaden our function, the lead opinion states the "Commonwealth is named trustee and, notably, duties and powers attendant to the trust are not vested exclusively in any single branch of Pennsylvania’s government. The plain intent of the provision is to permit the checks and balances of government to operate in their usual fashion for the benefit of the people” for accomplishing the trust purposes. Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court, at 956. It is <em>not </em>notable that no branch is given exclusive administrative power, in this or any similar concern — the judicial role is not administrative at all. We are a check or balance to be sure, but we have no authority to “administer” things "for the benefit of the people.” We benefit the people by assuring constitutional compliance, not by second-guessing the administrative decisions made by the branch of government manifestly charged with that responsibility.</p>
