One month later, the body of Keaton’s ex-girlfriend, Sherrill Ann Hall, was found. Police questioned Keaton, who was in custody for the attack on Nadine S., about Hall’s death. After waiving his rights, Keaton gave a written statement incriminating himself in the killing, and he was charged with murder. Later that day, police questioned Keaton about the June, 1992 rape of another woman, Michelle B. After waiving his rights, Keaton gave a written statement in which he admitted having oral sex with this victim, but denied assaulting her. He was charged with the rape of Michelle B. and related offenses. The Commonwealth moved to consolidate the charges for all three victims. Over defense objection, the trial court granted the motion. Prior to trial, Keaton moved to suppress his statements; the motion was denied, and Keaton was tried before a jury and found guilty of first degree murder, rape, and related offenses.

Keaton recalled the circumstances surrounding his December 19, 1992 arrest, stating he had just exited a grocery store on Ridge Avenue, Philadelphia, when a uniformed police officer standing alongside a patrol car called him over for a brief talk before detaining him. N.T. 11/16/12 at 8. Handcuffed and seated in the back of the patrol car, Keaton observed the officer walk over to Nadine S., whom Keaton knew from the neighborhood, and talk to her for several minutes before returning to inform him he was being arrested for rape. N.T. at 8. Believing the officer was unwilling to listen to “his side of the story,” Keaton testified, he asked for a lawyer. N.T. at 8.</p>
    <p id="b270-5" data-blocks='[["BL_270.4",270,[285,1057,1152,466]]]'>Keaton claimed on direct examination that he made this request in the presence of arresting officers as a matter of routine, as it had recently procured his release from police detention on two occasions in the recent past, including several weeks earlier in the Nadine S. case at a South Philadelphia police station and in a September 14th, 1992 arrest, also on allegations of rape. N.T. at 9-10, 14-15. “That’s [requesting a lawyer] what you do in the hood. You don’t speak to the police[,]” Keaton testified. N.T. at 19.</p>

Keaton, however, testified that he declined to tell his side and instead asked for a lawyer, which differed from his earlier testimony that the officer was unwilling to listen. N.T. at 25.

N.T. at 11. He further described the room as little and windowless, <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>with tables and two chairs. N.T. at 11. An “olive-complected, dark hair[ed]” detective who was “smaller than [Keaton]” entered, Keaton said, and he informed Keaton of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. N.T. at 12, 26-27.

    <p id="b271-5" data-blocks='[["BL_271.4",271,[176,641,1152,564]]]'>Commonwealth witness Lieutenant Michael Boyle provided a differing account of both the interrogation site and the physical description of the detective. He described the South Philadelphia Sex Crime Unit to where Keaton was transported as having no such interrogation room in the back; defendants were interviewed at the investigating detective’s desk in an open room where all detectives worked. N.T. at 58-59. He also knew the detective assigned to Keaton’s case, George Hicks, and was of the opinion that he was neither olive-complexioned nor aptly described as “dark-haired” given his baldness.

Perez testified Keaton did not ask for a lawyer at any time during his arrest and transport to the Sex Crimes Unit. N.T. at 44-48. Also refuting Keaton’s claimed practice of always asking for a lawyer was Officer Christopher Boyle, who was assigned to interview Keaton in a cell at the Sex Crimes Unit after Keaton’s September 14, 1992 arrest on suspicion of rape in another case. Christopher Boyle acknowledged Keaton repeatedly refused to talk “about that girl,” but unequivocally testified that Keaton never once demanded an attorney. N.T. at 75-76.

Sufficient to support Keaton’s assertion, if believed, was his explanation that he invoked the right on December 19, 1992 <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>not only in conformance with prevailing wisdom in his neighborhood but also because his own personal experience had shown the act to instantly stop prior investigations into his involvement in crimes. The investigatory paperwork of December 19, 1992 likewise was not inconsistent with Keaton’s having asked for an attorney. Though lacking direct evidence to disprove the alleged invocation, the Commonwealth’s proffer of circumstantial evidence relating both to Keaton’s prior arrests and to how the Sex Crimes Unit’s records suggested Keaton probably did not expressly request an attorney at the station on December 19th, if believed, were sufficient to undermine Keaton’s assertion.</p>

Most persuasive to the court was the testimony of former Sex Crime Unit Sergeant Michael Boyle, the supervisor of Detective George Hicks, who was assigned to investigate Keaton’s case.</p>
    <p id="b272-6" data-blocks='[["BL_272.5",272,[273,1450,1153,676]]]'>Boyle’s explanation that any interrogation of a suspect at the Sex Crime Unit would have taken place at the assigned detective’s desk situated in a large, crowded room where all the other detective’s desks were located served to impeach Keaton’s recollection of events on December 19th, as Boyle flatly rejected the notion of a secluded, windowless, back of the building interrogation room as described by Keaton. Also impressing the court was Boyle’s testimony undermining Keaton’s physical description of Hicks as an olive-complexioned, dark haired man. Boyle could not recall any of his detectives fitting that description, and he denied that Hicks had either olive skin or would be described as having dark hair, as he was balding.</p>

N.T. at 55. While conceding the statement could possibly mean Keaton either refused to give a statement or requested a lawyer, Boyle explained that if a detective had Mirandized the suspect and received a request for an attorney in reply, then it was expected that such occurrence would be recorded as the reason questioning stopped. N.T. at 56-57. Boyle’s conclusion from the report, therefore, was that Keaton probably refused to talk and Hicks made no further attempt to obtain a statement.</p>

Specifically, neither of the two men to whom Keaton claims to have invoked his right on that day-his arresting officer, Officer Pitts, and the detective assigned his case at the Sex Crime Unit, George Hicks-testified at his hearing.

Further contributing to the court’s error, Keaton continues, was its disregard of his testimony that it was only common sense that he would have invoked the right on December 19th, as those who grew up in his neighborhood “learned at an early age not to talk to police,” and had successfully employed that tack during two recent arrests on September and November of 1992 in which he gained immediate release after asking for a lawyer. Finally, Keaton alludes to how certain Commonwealth witnesses corroborated the details he supplied in his testimony, including his recollection of arresting officers in September, his description of Detective Hicks — which, contrary to the court’s conclusion, Keaton says, was corroborated by Michael Boyle’s testimony that Hicks was 5'8", stocky, and resembled “Super Mario,” and that he remembered being brought to the South Philadelphia Sex Crimes Unit on December 19, 1992. Collectively, this evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that Keaton invoked his right to counsel at the December 19, 1992 custodial interrogation, Keaton concludes.</p>

Decisional law sets forth no requirement that a fact finder must accept testimony that goes without direct contradiction, the Commonwealth asserts, and the PCRA court was free to accept all, some, or none of Keaton’s testimony that he asked for a lawyer on December 19, 1992. Moreover, Commonwealth witnesses undermined Keaton’s testimony that his September and November arrests demonstrated his pattern of practice of asking for a lawyer whenever arrested. Officer Christopher Boyle testified that Keaton repeated in unequivocal terms during the September 14, 1992 custodial interview at the Sex Crime Unit that he would speak to Boyle about anything except the alleged rape victim in that case, Shareefa H., but he never asked for a lawyer during their entire exchange. Nor did Keaton invoke the right at any time while Officer Jose Perez arrested Keaton and transported him to the Sex Crimes Unit on November 22, 1992 on <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>suspicion of raping Donna S., Perez testified. In addition, Sex Crime Unit Michael Boyle successfully called into question Keaton’s recollection of events through his testimony that Keaton could not have been interviewed in a secluded interrogation room that did not exist. Interviews took place at the desk of the detective assigned to the case, in a room in which all other detectives and their desks were located. Nor did Boyle believe George Hicks could accurately be described as olive-complexioned and dark haired. In sum, the totality of this evidence sufficed to support the PCRA court’s credibility determinations.</p>

    <p id="b275-5" data-blocks='[["BL_275.5",275,[174,1030,1151,474]]]'>Our standard of review is well settled: “In addressing the grant or denial of post-conviction relief, an appellate court will consider whether the PCRA court’s conclusions are supported by record evidence and are free of legal error.” <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/597/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="597 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="3924340" data-case-paths="/pa/597/0109-01">597 Pa. 109</a>, <a href="/pa/597/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="950 A.2d 294" data-case-ids="3924340,8226424" data-case-paths="/pa/597/0109-01,/a2d/950/0294-01">950 A.2d 294</a>, 299 (2008) (citations omitted). Moreover, we are bound by the PCRA court’s credibility findings where those determinations are supported by the record. <em>Commonwealth v. Moore, </em><a href="/pa/580/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="580 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="1100738" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0279-01">580 Pa. 279</a>, <a href="/pa/580/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="860 A.2d 88" data-case-ids="1100738,9145814" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0279-01,/a2d/860/0088-01">860 A.2d 88</a>, 99 (2004) (citation omitted).</p>
    <p id="b275-6" data-blocks='[["BL_275.6",275,[171,1561,1153,797]]]'>Keaton’s disagreement with the PCRA court’s credibility determinations is simply not enough to set aside the court’s order. Revealed repeatedly throughout the notes of testimony taken of the November 16, 2012 evidentiary hearing is the PCRA court’s appreciation that the factual question before it will turn entirely upon its credibility assessment; the court painstakingly asked numerous follow-up questions of witnesses in its clear attempt to secure as clear, comprehensive, and detailed a record as possible about what transpired nearly twenty years earlier on December 19, 1992. In the end, after Appellant often testified he asked for a lawyer on that day and Commonwealth witnesses often addressed other matters suggesting Appellant did not, the PCRA court reached the conclusion that Appellant certainly refused to give a statement but did not go so far as to demand a lawyer.</p>

Sullivan, </em><a href="/pa/472/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="472 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1727761" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0129-01">472 Pa. 129</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="472 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1727761" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0129-01">371 A.2d 468</a>, 476 (1977) (recognizing well-settled principle that “[w]e will not disturb the findings of the PCRA court if they are supported by the record, even where the record could also support a contrary holding”). As it was, the court disbelieved Appellant, as was its prerogative under prevailing standards and believed, instead, Commonwealth witnesses who impeached various aspects of Keaton’s account as described above. Because evidentiary support, detailed above, existed to sustain this determination, we discern no grounds upon which to disturb the court’s credibility decision in favor of the Commonwealth.</p>
