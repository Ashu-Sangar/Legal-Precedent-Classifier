    <p class="author" id="b285-16" data-blocks='[["BL_285.13",285,[207,1757,290,33]]]'>PER CURIAM.</p>
    <p id="b285-17" data-blocks='[["BL_285.14",285,[162,1836,1154,523]],["BL_286.1",286,[286,307,1151,139]]]'>AND NOW, this 16th day of December, 2013, the May 1, 2007 and July 18, 2011 orders of the Lancaster County Court of Common Pleas issued pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”) are VACATED. For the reasons stated below, the PCRA petition and its amendments are reinstated, and the matter is REMANDED to the PCRA court for review and disposition limited to the issues raised in the PCRA petition as amended, including holding an evidentiary hearing on any claim which the court believes raises a material issue of fact and is not resolvable as a matter of law, in accordance <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>with applicable rules and decisional law. The PCRA court is further directed to prepare a thorough opinion supporting its decision.</p>
    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[286,497,1152,1378]]]'>Presently, this Court is unable to conduct effective appellate review in light of the PCRA court’s determination — without further explanation in a reasoned opinion — that the majority of Appellant’s claims were previously litigated or waived. Many of these claims contained pleading deficiencies that were correctable; however, the PCRA court failed to order amendment of Appellant’s petition pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 905(B), and failed to provide Appellant notice of its intent to dismiss or the opportunity to respond and address the deficiencies in his petition pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 909(B). As a result, Appellant did not have the opportunity to “cure” the defects in his petition as contemplated by the notice of intent to dismiss process. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 909(B)(2). Moreover, in dismissing Appellant’s layered ineffectiveness claims on the grounds they were previously litigated or waived, the PCRA court failed to acknowledge or appreciate this Court’s case law concerning the pleading and presentation of PCRA ineffectiveness claims which developed from the time Appellant filed his initial PCRA petition in 1999 until the time his petition was dismissed in 2007. <em>See Commonwealth v.
