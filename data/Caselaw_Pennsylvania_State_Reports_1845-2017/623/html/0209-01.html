At a March 8, 2010, public meeting of the Township’s three-member Board of Supervisors (the “Board”), the Township’s solicitor announced that a series of gatherings with interested parties would take place to obtain information about relevant matters, such as the nature of quarrying and the Citizens Group’s environmental concerns.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> He referred to these gatherings as “executive sessions” of the Board and noted that they would be closed to the public as permitted under the Sunshine Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Four such gatherings took place on March 9-12, 2010, with a quorum of the Board in attendance at each: two with representatives of adjacent municipalities that had experience dealing with quarries; one with the Citizens Group and its attorney; and one with Lehigh Cement and its attorneys.</p>

He explained that the supervisors did not deliberate on, conduct, or make any decisions on, Township business at any of the four gatherings, and he indicated that their sole purpose was for the Supervisors to ask questions of the invited persons so as to obtain information regarding the impact of a quarry in the Township. Thereafter, the Board appointed Supervisor Kurtz as its representative to join the solicitor in settlement discussions with Lehigh Cement and report back to the Board.

In the early morning hours of May 11, 2010, at the conclusion of the public debate, Supervisor Kurtz moved to accept the settlement agreement, and his motion was seconded by Supervisor Brumbach. The third Board member, Supervisor Angstadt, voted against the motion. The motion carried by a 2-1 vote.</p>

Smith, a resident of the Township acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a complaint in county court, naming as defendants the Township and its Supervisors (collectively, the “Township Parties”), and challenging the validity of the four gatherings. Appellant alleged that, on each such occasion, a quorum of the Board discussed and deliberated Township business, and that they were closed to the public in violation of Section 704 of the Act, which requires that “[official action and deliberations by a quorum of the members of an agency shall take place at a meeting open to the public----”65 Pa.C.S. § 704.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Appellant request<a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>ed a declaratory judgment that the Board violated the Sunshine Act, a permanent injunction to force the Board to comply with the Sunshine Act in the future, and an order invalidating “all action taken during, or as a result of discussions held at [such] meeting[s].” Complaint at 4-5, <em>reproduced in </em>R.R. 7a-8a. In their answer, the Township Parties denied the allegations, asserting that the gatherings were held solely to obtain information, and did not involve any agency business, official action, or discussion among Supervisors. <em>See </em>Answer &amp; New Matter at 5 &amp; Exh. 1, <em>reproduced in </em>R.R. 14a, 18a.</p>

The gathering with the Citizens Group was held so that the Supervisors could understand its environmental concerns involving issues such as water quality, blasting, and toxins being released into the environment. The group’s spokesman testified that he understood the gathering to be a fact-finding mission, and that no vote was taken by the Supervisors. Depositions of individuals at the gathering with Lehigh Cement reflected that it was also fact-finding in nature. The Supervisors asked questions that arose from information learned in the prior three gatherings. Some of the issues raised by those questions were ultimately addressed in the settlement agreement drafted by Lehigh Cement.</p>

In this regard, Appellant termed the gathering with Lehigh Cement a “settlement conference,” and testified that such characterization was based on information he had obtained during discovery. <em>See id. </em>at 36-37. As well, with regard to the gathering -with the Citizens Group, Appellant testified to his belief that its purpose was to identify terms that would be included in a settlement agreement, and that this belief was grounded on information relayed to him by John Reiser, the head of the group. Appellant admitted, though, that he was unaware of any “official actions” that might have occurred that could have bound the Township to specific settlement terms. Appellant further conceded that the official vote to accept Lehigh Cement’s proposed agreement took place at an open meeting after the public had had time to comment.</p>

Twp. of Richmond, </em><a href="/a3d/54/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="54 A.3d 404" data-case-ids="7311291" data-case-paths="/a3d/54/0404-01">54 A.3d 404</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2012). The court initially observed that, under Section 704 of the Sunshine Act, “meetings,” as defined by the Act, must be open to the public. It noted that the enactment defines a meeting, in relevant part, as a gathering held to “deliberare] agency business or tak[e] official action.” 65 Pa.C.S. § 703. Thus, since Appellant did not assert that the challenged private gatherings involved any official action, the court concluded that the central issue was whether they included “deliberations” about Township business.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In this regard, moreover, the court explained that the <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>Act defines “deliberation” as “[t]he discussion of agency business held for the purpose of making a decision.” <a href="/a3d/54/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="54 A.3d 404" data-case-ids="7311291" data-case-paths="/a3d/54/0404-01">Id.</a><a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Shaughnessy, </em><a href="/a2d/705/0942-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="705 A.2d 942" data-case-ids="11874156" data-case-paths="/a2d/705/0942-01">705 A.2d 942</a>, 945-46 (Pa.Cmwlth.1998) (stating the Sunshine Act does not require agency members to inquire and learn about issues only at open meetings), and that public officials have an affirmative duty to be fully informed and, as such, may “study, investigate, discuss and argue problems and issues” outside the confines of public meetings. <em>Belle Vernon Area Concerned Citizens v. Bd. of Comm’rs of Rostraver Twp., </em>87 Pa.Cmwlth. 474, 481, <a href="/citations/?q=487%20A.2d%20490" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="487 A.2d 490">487 A.2d 490</a>, 494 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). The court also referenced <em>Conners v. West Greene School District, </em>131 Pa.Cmwlth. 95, <a href="/pa-commw/131/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="569 A.2d 978" data-case-ids="1399110" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/131/0095-01">569 A.2d 978</a> (1989), which had expressed that “[t]here is a substantial difference between discussion and deliberation,” and that agency members may informally discuss and debate proposals among themselves without violating the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 105, <a href="/pa-commw/131/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="569 A.2d 978" data-case-ids="1399110" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/131/0095-01">569 A.2d at 983</a>. Thus, the court rejected a broad interpretation of “deliberation” as subsuming all discussion of any topic related to future agency business. As for Appellant’s assertion that the purpose of the discussions was to come to a decision, the court expressed that such assertion lacked record support. <em>See Smith, </em><a href="/a3d/54/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="54 A.3d 404" data-case-ids="7311291" data-case-paths="/a3d/54/0404-01">54 A.3d at 409-10</a> (“The testimony of all who participated showed that the Supervisors were collecting information to allow them to make an informed decision <em>at some later time. </em>They sought <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>this information in the event the opportunity to settle the case might develop in the future.” (emphasis in original)).</p>

In <em>Trib Total Media, </em>the court explained, the public officials affirmatively conceded that they engaged in deliberations at the private meeting at issue, whereas, here, the deposition testimony uniformly described the gatherings as only involving the collection of information. In <em>Ackerman, </em>an amendment to the township’s zoning ordinance was pending at the time of the non-public meeting in question, and the meeting’s discussion addressed the merits of that amendment, which was later adopted at an open meeting. Here, by contrast, there was no pending settlement or discrete proposal before the Board during its four discussions on March 9-12, 2010. <em>See Smith, </em><a href="/a3d/54/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="54 A.3d 404" data-case-ids="7311291" data-case-paths="/a3d/54/0404-01">54 A.3d at 411</a>.

In <em>Ackerman, </em>the Commonwealth Court determined that, since Section 713 only authorizes the invalidation of official action taken at an unlawful meeting, it does not permit courts to invalidate votes taken at a public meeting held after a private meeting, even if the private meeting was improper. <em>See Ackerman, </em>130 Pa.Cmwlth. at 262-63, <a href="/pa-commw/130/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="567 A.2d 1116" data-case-ids="1397426" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/130/0254-01">567 A.2d at 1120</a>; 65 Pa.C.S. § 713 (stating, in relevant part, that "[sjhould the court determine that the meeting did not meet the requirements of this chapter, it may in its discretion find that any or all official action taken <em>at the meeting </em>shall be invalid” (emphasis added)). The court continued that the General Assembly has provided no remedy for this situation beyond summary criminal proceedings against the members involved. <em>See Ackerman, </em>130 Pa.Cmwlth. at 262-63, <a href="/pa-commw/130/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="567 A.2d 1116" data-case-ids="1397426" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/130/0254-01">567 A.2d at 1120</a>; <em>see also </em>65 Pa.C.S. § 714 (making it a summary offense punishable by a fine and the costs of prosecution for an agency member to "participate[ ] in a meeting with the intent and purpose” of violating the Act). This issue is discussed briefly below at footnote 10.</p>

Appellant has omitted from both the reproduced record and the certified record large portions of the Keiser transcript, including the section where the Township’s attorney questioned the deponent. We find this problematic insofar as Appellant seeks to rely on that very transcript as alleged proof of a Sunshine Act violation. Absent the ability to review the missing portion of the deposition, we are left without any information concerning whether Mr. Keiser may have clarified, or “backtracked” from, his earlier answers.</p>

Even if Appellant were able to adduce sufficient evidence to prove that the challenged closed-door gatherings entailed deliberations, the primary relief he requested would be unavailable: his complaint asks that the county court invalidate actions taken during, or as a result of, discussions held at the closed-door meetings. No official actions were taken at the closed-door gatherings, however, and it is the prevailing law of this Commonwealth that the Sunshine Act does not authorize courts to invalidate official action taken at a subsequent public meeting that conforms to the Act's requirements, based on an earlier, improper closed-door meeting. <em>See supra </em>note 8; <em>see also ACORN v. SEPTA, </em><a href="/a2d/789/0811-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="789 A.2d 811" data-case-ids="9401677" data-case-paths="/a2d/789/0811-01">789 A.2d 811</a>, 813 (Pa.Cmwlth.2002) ("[T]his [c]ourt has repeatedly held that official action taken at a later, open meeting cures a prior violation of the Sunshine Act.”). The Township Parties raised this argument in their brief to the Commonwealth Court, and they repeat it presently. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellees at 42-44 &amp; n.9. The Commonwealth Court did not address it, presumably because of its holding that the closed-door discussions did not violate the Sunshine Act in the first instance.</p>
