Applied Business Controls Inc., 63 Pa.Cmwlth. 479, 440 A.2d 638 (1981), to reject legal arguments \u2014 including several with constitutional dimensions \u2014 which simply were not before the court in that case; the super-credit construction requires other taxpayers, who also reside in municipalities and school districts outside Philadelphia, to bear a disproportionate tax burden in supporting their school districts and municipalities of residence; and such a construction of Section 317 is too greatly in tension with the constitutional uniformity norm and Article VIII, Section 5\u2019s limitation on the General Assembly\u2019s power to implement tax exemptions to be sustained. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(3) (prescribing the presumption, in statutory construction, that the Legislature did not intend to violate constitutional norms).\nAccordingly, I agree with Appellants and their amici that the application of conventional apportionment methodology\u2014 and not the imposition of a \u201csuper credit\u201d \u2014 is the appropriate approach to the Section 317 offset.",
