        "text": "OPINION\nJustice McCAFFERY.\nThe issue before the Court is a matter of statutory interpretation of Section 602 of the Real Estate Tax Sale Law which sets forth the requirements for notice prior to an upset tax sale for non-payment of delinquent taxes. Specifically, we must determine if the Commonwealth Court correctly held that \u201cproof of mailing\u201d in subsection 602(e)(2) refers exclusively to United States Postal Service (hereinafter \u201cUSPS\u201d) Form 3817, also known as a Certificate of Mailing.\nThe relevant facts are not at issue and are summarized below. See Horton v. Washington County Tax Claim Bureau, No. 2009-10264 (Ct. Common Pleas, filed 12/29/10) (hereinafter \u201cTrial Court Opinion\u201d). The property at issue is Unit 1021 in the Fairways Condominium at Southpointe (hereinafter the \u201cProperty\u201d), located in Cecil Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania. The Property was purchased by Gerald W. and Susan M. Horton (hereinafter, collectively, \u201cAppellees\u201d) on June 22, 2006, for $200,000 cash. It was used for purposes related to their business, USG Insurance Services, Inc., which was based in Florida, with a local office in Washington County. The Property was occasionally occupied by business associates and family; mail was not delivered to the address. The deed to the Property contained three errors: (1) Gerald W. Horton\u2019s name was listed as \u201cJerry W. Horton;\u201d (2) Susan M. Horton\u2019s name was listed as \u201cSusan W. Horton;\u201d and (3) a Certificate of Residence filed with the deed to the Property identified Appellees\u2019 \u201cprecise residence\u201d as 1021 Eagle Point Drive, Canonsburg, PA, 15317 (the Property\u2019s address) even though, at all times relevant to this case, Appellees resided in Florida.\nAt no time relevant to the instant dispute did the Washington County Tax Claim Bureau (hereinafter the \u201cBureau\u201d) receive or determine the correct information as to the location of Appellees\u2019 residence. Appellees made no real estate tax payments on the Property for the years 2007 and 2008. On September 23, 2009, still having received no tax payments, the Bureau sold the Property in a tax upset sale. The buyer was E.D. Lewis (hereinafter \u201cAppellant\u201d), who purchased the Property for $10,298.96 without competitive bidding.\nPrior to the upset tax sale, the Bureau made a variety of efforts, many of which are required by the Real Estate Tax Sale Law, to try to locate and notify Appellees. Specifically, these efforts included the following. On April 2, 2008, the Bureau mailed a courtesy letter regarding the 2007 unpaid taxes to Appellees at the Property\u2019s address; the letter was returned by USPS as \u201cNo Such Number.\u201d Subsequently, at various times over the next year, the Bureau checked several sources, some sources more than once, in an unsuccessful attempt to determine Appellees\u2019 whereabouts. On May 29, 2009, the Bureau mailed, via first-class to Appellees at the Property\u2019s address, a courtesy pre-sale warning letter advising of the sale scheduled for September 23, 2009, and containing a payment due date of June 30, 2009; the letter was returned by USPS as \u201cReturn to Sender \u2014 Attempted\u2014Not Known \u2014 Unable to Forward.\u201d On July 14, 2009, as required by statutory provision 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(e)(1), the Bureau sent tax upset sale notices via certified mail, restricted delivery, to each Appellee at the Property\u2019s address; each notice was returned by USPS as \u201cNot Deliverable as Addressed\u2014 Unable to Forward.\u201d On July 22, 2009, as required by statutory provision 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(e)(3), a Bureau agent posted the Property; his affidavit indicated that personal service had not been made as there was no answer at the Property. On August 20, 2009, as required by statutory provision 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(a), the Bureau gave notice in three local newspapers of the scheduled September 23, 2009 tax upset sale of the Property. On August 27, 2009, as required by statutory provision 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(e)(2), second notices of the impending tax upset sale of the Property were sent via first-class mail to each Appellee at the Property\u2019s address; each notice was returned by USPS as \u201cNot Deliverable as Addressed \u2014 Unable to Forward.\u201d On September 8, 2009, the Bureau filed with the Prothonotary\u2019s Office a petition to waive personal service.\nOn September 23, 2009, the tax upset sale was conducted as scheduled, and the Property was sold to Appellant. In October 2009, the Bureau mailed several post-sale notices to Appellees at the Property\u2019s address via certified mail; all were returned via USPS as not deliverable.\nAfter the tax upset sale, Appellant retained David Holland, Esq., to file a quiet title action against Appellees. Mr. Holland was unable to locate Appellees through USPS; utility companies; or several internet sites, including the on-line data service Accurint, Social Security obituaries, and telephone directories. Notes of Testimony, 4/22/10, (\u201cN.T.\u201d) at 167-69, 172. Mr. Holland was also unable to learn any information about Appellees\u2019 whereabouts when he did an internet search of the Property\u2019s address; the search came up with the name \u201cUSG Insurance\u201d and a telephone number that yielded merely a recorded message directing one to enter a remote access code. Id. at 173-74. In addition, an internet search for a condominium association related to the Property did not yield any helpful information. Id. at 169-70. In a further attempt to locate a condominium association office, Mr. Holland then asked Appellant \u201cto canvas the neighborhood\u201d around the Property. Id. at 170. Appellant \u201cdrove around the neighborhood,\u201d found a sales office, and made inquiry. Id. From the sales office, Mr. Holland obtained a phone number in Columbus, Ohio, through which, after several calls, he learned of Appellees\u2019 business address in Florida. Id. at 171-72, 181; see Trial Court Opinion at 6-7 \u00b6 16. On October 19, 2009, Appellant\u2019s counsel served the quiet title action upon Appellees via certified mail, restricted delivery, at their Florida business address. On November 18, 2009, Appellees filed a petition to open and/or set aside the tax upset sale.\nThe trial court conducted a hearing on the matter on April 22, 2010. Yvonne Orsatti, the Bureau\u2019s financial operations manager at the time of the tax upset sale, testified as to the Bureau\u2019s procedures prior to and after the tax upset sale. N.T. at 4-38, 72-83. Appellee Mr. Horton testified that he had received no final closing documents, including the deed and title insurance policy, from his settling agent following his purchase of the Property in 2006. Id. at 92-93, 96. In addition, he testified that he had never received any tax bill for the Property, any notice of his tax delinquencies, or any notice of the tax upset sale. Id. at 110-12, 115-16, 139. He admitted that the deed to the Property contained three errors, that those errors would make it difficult to locate Appellees, and that the Bureau had not been responsible for the errors. Id. at 93-95,125-31; Trial Court Opinion at 7 \u00b6 18.\nBefore the trial court, Appellees argued that the Bureau had not exercised reasonable investigative efforts to locate them, and, as a secondary argument, that the Bureau had not placed contemporaneous notations in the Property file to document the investigative efforts that had been undertaken. N.T. at 184-90 (closing argument) (citing 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.607a).\nOn December 29, 2010, the trial court granted Appellees\u2019 petition to set aside the tax upset sale, holding that the Bureau had not satisfied the notice requirement of 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(e)(2), pursuant to In Re: York County Tax Claim Bureau, 3 A.3d 765 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010). Trial Court Opinion at 9, 12. The trial court determined that although the Bureau had complied with the statutory requirements to provide three separate methods of notice prior to a tax upset sale (to wit, publication, certified mail, and posting), it had failed to provide \u201cproof of mailing\u201d of the second notice to Appellees, mailed via first-class on August 27, 2009, as required by subsection 5860.602(e)(2). Id. at 12. Accordingly, the trial court declared the tax upset sale of the Property to be null and void. Id. at 13. Notably, York, the basis for the trial court\u2019s holding here, was decided months after the sale and the hearing in the instant case, and no party here raised the subsection 602(e)(2) issue that the Commonwealth Court decided in York.\nAppellant appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which affirmed. Horton v. Washington County Tax Claim Bureau, 44 A.3d 710 (Pa.Cmwlth.2012). Agreeing with the trial court, the Commonwealth Court relied on York, supra, to hold that the \u201cproof of mailing\u201d requirement set forth in subsection 602(e)(2) can be satisfied only with a USPS Certificate of Mailing, also known as USPS Form 3817. Id. at 714. Although the Bureau had submitted a United States Postal Service Consolidated Postage Statement with an attachment delineating to whom mailings had been sent on August 27, 2009, as well as the actual envelopes sent to both Appellees and returned with USPS\u2019s official stamp, the Bureau had not obtained a USPS Certificate of Mailing and thus, pursuant to York\u2019s holding, had failed to satisfy the strict notice requirement set forth in subsection 602(e)(2). Id. at 714-15.\nAppellant sought allowance of appeal from this Court, which we granted. The sole issue presented for our review is as follows:\nWhether the Commonwealth Court erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s decision to set aside the upset tax sale on the basis that the bureau failed to provide certificates of mailing under 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(E)(2) where the trial court made an express finding that the bureau mailed each taxpayer a notice of tax sale on August 27, 2009 by first class mail, and the trial court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial, undisputed evidence?\nHorton v. Washington County Tax Claim Bureau, Petition of Lewis, 618 Pa. 170, 55 A.3d 1054 (2012).\nPursuant to 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602 (\u201cNotice of sale\u201d), a tax claim bureau is required to take several steps to attempt to provide notice to a property owner before conducting a tax upset sale due to a delinquency in payment of taxes on the property. The notice provisions of the statute \u201cmust be strictly complied with in order to guard against the deprivation of property without due process of law.\u201d Krumbine v. Lebanon County Tax Claim Bureau, 541 Pa. 384, 663 A.2d 158,162 (1995) (citation omitted).\nSection 602 specifically requires the following types of notice. At least thirty days prior to a scheduled tax upset sale, the Bureau must give notice of the scheduled sale by publication in two local newspapers and a legal journal. 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(a). Also, at least thirty days prior to a scheduled sale, the Bureau must give notice by \u201cUnited States certified mail, restricted delivery, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to each owner.\u201d 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(e)(1). At least ten days prior to the scheduled sale, the property must be posted. 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(e)(3). In the instant case, there is no dispute that these three requirements (the publication notice, the certified mail notice, and the posted notice) were all satisfied. Horton, supra at 713; Trial Court Opinion at 11-12.\nThe dispute here concerns another statutory requirement, to wit, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(e)(2), which mandates the mailing of a second notice if a return receipt is not received from each owner in response to the first, certified mail notice. Subsection 602(e)(2) provides, in relevant part, as follows:\nIf return receipt is not received from each owner [in response to the certified mail notice required under subsection 602(e)(1), supra], then, at least ten (10) days before the date of the sale, similar notice of the sale shall be given to each owner who failed to acknowledge the first notice by United States first class mail, proof of mailing, at his last known post office address....\n72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(e)(2) (emphasis added).\nThe issue presented here requires us to interpret the phrase \u201cproof of mailing\u201d in subsection 602(e)(2), an issue that the Commonwealth Court addressed in York, supra. In York, fifteen days prior to a tax upset sale, the tax bureau sent a second notice to the property owner via first-class mail, as required by subsection 602(e)(2). When the tax bureau did not receive a timely response, it proceeded with the tax upset sale. The property owner, who had not received the first-class notice until after the sale of his property had been accomplished, challenged the sale. Before the trial court, as evidence of the second notice mailed via first-class pursuant to subsection 602(e)(2), the tax bureau proffered an internal office document indicating, in the supervisor\u2019s handwriting, the date that the notice was sent. York, supra at 766-67. Noting that the tax bureau has the burden of proving compliance with all applicable notice provisions, the Commonwealth Court relied on the plain language of the statute to hold that the tax bureau had not established \u201cproof of mailing\u201d as required by subsection 602(e)(2). Id. at 768-69. The Commonwealth Court found it \u201cevident that \u2018proof of mailing\u2019 in [subjection 602(e)(2) refers to a document obtained from the USPS.\u201d Id. at 769. The rationale behind the court\u2019s determination was that all the other types of mailing specified in Section 602 are USPS services. Therefore, particularly since \u201cproof of mailing\u201d immediately follows \u201cUnited States first class mail\u201d in the statutory text, there was \u201cno reason to believe that the legislature was referring to anything other than a USPS form\u201d in subsection 602(e)(2). Id.\nWith regard to what specific USPS form was statutorily mandated, the Commonwealth Court looked to the USPS official website, from which the court determined that \u201cthe only \u2018Proof of Mailing\u2019 for \u2018First-Class Mail\u2019 is a \u2018Certificate of Mailing,\u2019 \u201d also known as USPS Form 3817. Id. at 769-770. The Commonwealth Court then held as follows:\n[A]fter reviewing the text of section 602(e) in its entirety, as well as the types of mailing services available through the USPS, we are compelled to conclude that \u2018proof of mailing\u2019 refers only to a USPS certificate of mailing.\nId. at 770.\nBecause the tax bureau in York had not proffered a Certificate of Mailing to establish \u201cproof of mailing,\u201d the Commonwealth Court held that the bureau had failed to prove compliance with the subsection 602(e)(2) notice provision, and accordingly affirmed the order of the trial court vacating the tax upset sale. Id. at 771.\nIn the case presently before us, both the Commonwealth Court and the trial court relied upon York to conclude that the Bureau had not satisfied subsection 602(e)(2)\u2019s \u201cproof of mailing\u201d requirement because it had not obtained and proffered a Certificate of Mailing from USPS. Horton, supra at 714-15. Accordingly, as in York, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the order of the trial court setting aside the tax upset sale. Horton, supra at 714-15.\nBecause the interpretation of the statutory phrase \u201cproof of mailing\u201d presents a pure question of law, our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. Newman Development Group of Pottstown, LLC v. Genuardi\u2019s Family Markets, Inc., 617 Pa. 265, 52 A.3d 1233, 1239 (2012); Dechert LLP v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 606 Pa. 334, 998 A.2d 575, 579 (2010). \u201cThe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). The best indicator of the legislature\u2019s intent is the statute\u2019s plain language. Dechert, supra. \u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b).\nFrom our review of Section 602(e), we must conclude that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s determination that \u201cproof of mailing\u201d can be satisfied only via proffer of a Certificate of Mailing, USPS Form 3817, does not reflect the intention of the legislature as revealed by the plain text of the statute.\nPreliminarily, we express our agreement with the Commonwealth Court that, in several instances, the types of mailings expressly delineated in Section 602(e) are specific USPS terms specifying specific USPS services, which are explained and defined on the USPS website. See York, supra at 769 & n. 8 and n. 9; https://www.usps.com/send. This is easily visualized on a page from the USPS website that describes first-class mail and the extra services available with that class of mail:\nFirst-Class Mail\nFirst-Class Mail\u00ae is a fast and affordable service for envelopes and packages weighing up to 13 oz. Delivery is in 3 days or less. It\u2019s perfect for personal correspondence, bills, and light merchandise.\nExtra Services Rules & Restrictions\nYou can add the following options to all First-Class Mail\u00ae (except for postcards) to ...\nInsure the contents.\nInsurance coverage up to $5,000.\nRegistered Mailtm for loss or damage up to $25,000.\nGet delivery information.\nUSPS Tracking\u2122 to see tracking updates....\nSignature Confirmation\u2122 [ ] to see when it was delivered ....\nGet proof of mailing.\nCertificate of Mailing as a way of proving the date you sent it.\nGet proof of mailing and delivery information.\nCertified Mail\u2122 See when it was delivered or delivery was attempted.

Specifically, the extra services, listed using terms specifically chosen by USPS, are as follows: Insurance*, Registered Mail\u2122, USPS Tracking\u2122, Signature Confirmation\u2122, Certificate of Mailing, Certified Mail\u00ae, Return Receipt, Return Receipt for Merchandise, Restricted Delivery, Collect on Delivery (COD), Special Handling, Adult Signature Required, and Adult Signature Restricted Delivery. See https://www.usps.com/send/insurance- and-extra-services.htm. \u201cCertificate of Mailing\u201d is defined as follows: \u201cHave evidence that you sent the item when you say you did. This official record shows the date your mail was accepted. Certificates of mailing furnish evidence of mailing only.\u201d Id. A footnote to the definition clarifies that a Certificate of Mailing refers only to Form 3817 or Form 3877. Id.\nThus, as set forth on the USPS website, First>-Class Mail, Certified Mail, Restricted Delivery, and Return Receipt, inter alia, are specific USPS terms for specifically defined USPS service options. These terms are used in subsection 602(e)(1) (\u201cUnited States certified mail, restricted delivery, return receipt requested\u201d) or subsection 602(e)(2) (\u201cUnited States first class mail\u201d). As the Commonwealth Court determined, it is clear from the statutory text that the legislature intended these terms to be interpreted pursuant to USPS definitions.\nHowever, \u201cproof of mailing,\u201d the statutory phrase at issue here, is not a USPS term specifying a particular USPS service option. Rather, as illustrated above by the USPS website pages, the specific USPS term for the service option designed to provide evidence of the date that an item was mailed is \u201cCertificate of Mailing.\u201d We cannot conclude that the General Assembly\u2019s failure to use the USPS term \u201cCertificate of Mailing\u201d in the statutory text is irrelevant or insignificant. Recognizing that the legislature chose to use the USPS terms first class mail, certified mail, restricted delivery, and return receipt in Section 602(e), we must conclude that, if the legislature had intended to mandate the proffer of a Certificate of Mailing in order to establish proof of mailing, then the legislature would have so specified by use of that specific USPS term in subsection 602(e)(2). Thus, we hold that the Commonwealth Court erred by promulgating a per se rule that subsection 602(e)(2)\u2019s requirement for \u201cproof of mailing\u201d could be satisfied only and exclusively by the proffer of a Certificate of Mailing, USPS Form 3817.\nHere, the Bureau proffered other USPS documents as \u201cproof of mailing\u201d pursuant to subsection 602(e)(2). First, the Bureau proffered a \u201cUnited States Postal Service Consolidated Postage Statement \u2014 First-Class Mail & Priority Mail\u201d (hereinafter \u201cUSPS Consolidated Postage Statement\u201d), signed by a USPS employee, bearing a USPS stamp, and showing a mailing date of August 27, 2009, for a total of 2,913 pieces. This document was accompanied by an attachment containing a list of several persons, with their addresses, to whom second notice mailings were sent; Jerry W. Horton and Susan W. Horton, at the Property\u2019s address, are both on the list. Second, and more importantly, the Bureau proffered the actual envelopes sent via first-class mail to Jerry W. Horton and Susan W. Horton, respectively, and returned to the Bureau on or about September 10, 2009, with the following USPS notation:\nRETURN TO SENDER\nNOT DELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED\nUNABLE TO FORWARD.\nThus, although the Bureau did not obtain a Certif\u00edcate of Mailing, it did proffer other documents from the USPS as evidence to establish \u201cproof of mailing.\u201d We hold that these USPS documents satisfy the statutory mandate for \u201cproof of mailing\u201d in subsection 602(e)(2).\nIn sum, we vacate the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order in the instant case; we disapprove of York\u2019s holding to the extent that it mandated a Certificate of Mailing, USPS Form 3718, to the exclusion of any other USPS documentation, in order to establish \u201cproof of mailing\u201d under 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(e)(2); and we remand to the trial court for consideration of the other issues raised in Appellees\u2019 petition.\nFormer Justice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices SAYLOR and TODD join the opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a concurring opinion.\nJustice BAER files a dissenting opinion.\n. Act of July 7, 1947, P.L. 1368, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5860.101-5860.803.\n. The sources checked by the Bureau included the Prothonotary\u2019s Office, the Washington County Tax Assessment Office, the Washington County Treasurer\u2019s Office, the 2007 Lien Docket, the Register of Wills Office, and voter registration records. The Bureau also did internet searches via the Switchboard on-line directory and Accurint Search Assistance. Via the latter, the Bureau found a Susan W. Horton in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and sent her a delinquent tax statement in March 2009. The statement was returned by the USPS marked as \"Return to Sender \u2014 Attempted\u2014Not Known \u2014 Unable to Forward.\u201d The Bureau also sent post-sale notices to this Lancaster address, but these were returned by USPS as \"Attempted \u2014 Not Known.\u201d There is no indication from the record that this individual had or has any relationship to Appellees.\n. The tax collector for Cecil Township also attempted, unsuccessfully, to locate Appellees via the local Sewage Authority, the earned income tax files, and an internet telephone directory. She billed Appellees for the 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax years. USPS returned the 2007 and 2009 tax bills as not deliverable and unable to forward. The 2008 tax bills were not returned. See Notes of Testimony, 4/22/10, (\"N.T.\u201d) at 39-48.\n. Yvonne Orsatti, the Bureau\u2019s financial operations manager at the time of the tax upset sale, testified that the Bureau went to the sale with 270 properties and sold approximately 30. Id. at 73.\n. Mr. Horton testified that he had filled out and signed a document provided to him by his settling agent indicating that tax bills and notices for the Property were to be sent to his home address in Florida. N.T. at 91-92, 97-98, 132. He further testified that he had never received a tax bill, did not have \u201cany idea that [the tax bills] weren't paid,\u201d and \u201cfigured that [the tax bills] had been taken care of ... by [his] accounting department\u201d in Florida as \"[a]ll other bills have been routinely paid.\u201d Id. at 139, 144. Utility bills for the Property were sent to USG\u2019s business address in Florida and were paid by USG. Id. at 99-109, 121.\n. Section 607a(a) requires the Bureau to \"exercise reasonable efforts\u201d to discover the whereabouts of a property owner if it appears that he or she has not received notice of an upcoming tax upset sale. In relevant part, Section 607a(a) provides as follows:\n... the bureau must exercise reasonable efforts to discover the whereabouts of such person or entity and notify him. The bureau\u2019s efforts shall include, but not necessarily be restricted to, a search of current telephone directories for the county and of the dockets and indices of the county tax assessment offices, recorder of deeds office and prothonotary\u2019s office, as well as contacts made to any apparent alternate address or telephone number which may have been written on or in the file pertinent to such property. When such reasonable efforts have been exhausted, regardless of whether or not the notification efforts have been successful, a notation shall be placed in the property file describing the efforts made and the results thereof, and the property may be rescheduled for sale or the sale may be confirmed as provided in this act.\n. The tax upset sale and the hearing in the instant case were conducted, respectively, on September 23, 2009, and April 22, 2010. York was decided on September 1, 2010.\n. Appellant raised two issues before the Commonwealth Court: (1) the trial court had erred by concluding that the Bureau had failed to provide \u201cproof of mailing\u201d as required by subsection 602(e)(2), as discussed in the text, supra; and (2) the trial court had erred by concluding that the Bureau had not conducted a reasonable investigation to discover Appellees' whereabouts. The Commonwealth Court addressed only the first issue, concluding that York, supra, controlled the outcome of the case and also determining that the trial court's discussion of the second issue was dicta. Horton, 44 A.3d at 715 n. 6. In its opinion, the trial court opined that it \"is hard pressed to find that the Bureau conducted a reasonable investigation\u201d to determine Appellees' whereabouts and notify them, as required pursuant to 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.607a. Trial Court Opinion at 12. The trial court specifically cited the Bureau's failure to conduct an internet search of the Property, but also stated that the \"issue of whether or not an address internet search is required under 'reasonable' efforts shall not be decided in the case sub judice.\u201d Id. at 13. We agree with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s determination that the trial court's discussion of the subsection 607a \"reasonable investigation\u201d issue was dicta. See Horton, supra at 715 n. 6.\n. The Commonwealth Court cited Figueroa v. Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, 900 A.2d 949, 950 n. 1 (Pa.Cmwlth.2006), for the proposition that the court may take judicial notice of information provided on a website. York, supra at 770 n. 10.\n. The Commonwealth Court also noted the need for statewide uniformity in proof of mailing, and determined that it was not an onerous burden to require the county tax bureaus to purchase a Certificate of Mailing at an additional cost of $1.15. York, supra at 770.\n. The \"Run Date\u201d of the attachment is provided at the top of the page as August 20, 2009. This date matches the date on the line of the USPS Consolidated Postage Statement where one is instructed to \"Enter Date of Address Matching and Coding,\u201d which is distinct from the mailing date provided on another line of the USPS Consolidated Postage Statement.\n. We recognize that a Certificate of Mailing, USPS Form 3817, may in general be the most consistently reliable form of evidence of the date of mailing. However, under the facts of this case, where the Bureau proffered the actual envelopes mailed to Appellees and returned by USPS to the Bureau as undeliverable, we cannot conclude that the Bureau failed to establish \"proof of mailing\u201d merely because it did not also proffer a Certificate of Mailing.",

        "text": "Justice EAKIN,\nconcurring.\nProspectively, I believe \u201cproof of mailing\u201d is limited to documents (receipts, certificates, etc.) issued by the post office, showing mailing of the notice to the property owner by first class mail, to his/her address, on a specific date. Given the difficulties in defining \u201cproof of mailing,\u201d and the somewhat unique facts of this case, however, I would not apply this stricter definition of the term retroactively. Thus, I join the reasoning of the dissent, but the result of the majority.\nI cannot join the majority\u2019s broad interpretation of \u201cproof of mailing,\u201d which, in my opinion, does not comport with established practice and opens the door to unwarranted results. An envelope alone is not what the statute calls for. I agree \u25a0with Justice Baer, that \u201cproof of mailing\u201d refers to postal service acknowledgement the matter was placed in the mail. I agree this proof is not limited to a denominated USPS Form, but encompasses whatever document the postal service provides to document the mailing. These services record the pertinent information and provide documentary evidence the statutory requirements were met. What form the postal service uses as a receipt seems immaterial and is not denominated by the statute as a required element. A review of the relevant provisions also suggests the legislature, in connection with the second notice under \u00a7 602(e)(2), did not require any specific mailing service, but instead, any of the services that provide documentation of the information outlined above. Compare 72' P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(e)(1) (delineating specific mailing services), with id., \u00a7 602(e)(2) (requiring only \u201cproof of mailing\u201d).\nTherefore, I do not believe the rules permit \u201cproof of mailing\u201d to be established by an envelope, which purportedly contained the required \u00a7 602(e)(2) notice, returned to the sender as undeliverable. The pertinent phrase in the statute is not talking about burden of proof \u2014 indeed, there must be proof of all the prerequisites to sale, not just this one \u2014 and does not say any means of proof that mailing occurred is sufficient. It requires \u201cfirst class mail, proof of mailing,\u201d and while this language does not quite rise to a clear term of art, the statute is manifestly referring to evidence from the postal service. Putting the \u201cproof of mailing\u201d directly adjacent to the means of service (the postal service) certainly contemplates a document from the postal service, by whatever form number or title it chooses to designate it, which vouches for the mailing. Proof by non-postal service evidence is statutorily insufficient.",

        "text": "Justice BAER,\ndissenting.\nSection 602 of the Real Estate Tax Sale Law, entitled \u201cNotice of Sale,\u201d provides extremely detailed and explicit instructions that taxing bureaus must follow to execute the tax sale of a delinquent property. First, all of the notices published and sent to advise delinquent taxpayers of the potential tax sale of their property must: (1) be printed within a conspicuous text box; (2) in at least ten-point font; and (3) contain the explicit warning:\nYOUR PROPERTY IS ABOUT TO BE SOLD WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT FOR DELINQUENT TAXES. YOUR PROPERTY MAY BE SOLD FOR A SMALL FRACTION OF ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AS TO WHAT YOU MUST DO IN ORDER TO SAVE YOUR PROPERTY, PLEASE CALL YOUR ATTORNEY, THE TAX CLAIM BUREAU AT THE FOLLOWING TELEPHONE NUMBER_, OR THE COUNTY LAWYER REFERRAL SERVICE.\n72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(g).\nSubsection (a) of Section 602 further delineates that taxing bureaus must at least thirty days before a scheduled tax sale place the above-quoted notice in two newspapers of general circulation within the county, as well as in a legal journal if one exists within that county, which sets forth in addition to the notice: \u201c(1) the purposes of such sale, (2) the time of such sale, (3) the place of such sale, (4) the terms of the sale including the approximate upset price, [and] (5) the descriptions of the properties to be sold as stated in the claims entered and the name of the owner.\u201d 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602(a).\nConcomitant with the posting of the notice in two newspapers of general circulation and a legal journal, if one is available, the taxing bureau must, \u201cby United States certified mail, restricted delivery, return receipt requested, postage prepaid\u201d notify the owners of the delinquent property of the impending sale with the aforementioned notice. Id. \u00a7 5860.602(e)(1). Should the taxing bureau not receive a return receipt from the delinquent property owner, \u201cthen, at least ten days before the date of the sale, similar notice of the sale shall be given ... by United States first class mail, proof of mailing, at his last known post office address by virtue of the knowledge and information possessed by the bureau.... \u201d Id. \u00a7 5860.602(e)(2) (emphasis added). What the General Assembly meant by \u201cproof of mailing\u201d is the only issue before this Court.\nDespite the specific, detailed, and particular instructions given by the legislature to county taxing bureaus for the publication and sending of tax sale notices, the Majority in the instant appeal countenances a scheme where a taxing bureau can, upon a challenge by the property owner contending notice was not provided pursuant to Section 602(e)(2), simply bring to court any documents it may have to \u201cprove\u201d that mailing of the second, subsection (e)(2) notice actually occurred. In my respectful view, when the legislature mandated that taxing bureaus send the (e)(2) notice by \u201cfirst class mail, proof of mailing,\u201d it intended for the first class mail to be sent accompanied with a USPS document that constitutes \u201cproof of mailing,\u201d and did not intend to countenance anything else. My reasoning follows.\nPrior to 1986, Section 602(e)(2) actually mandated that the ten-day notice be sent via \u201cUnited States certified mail.\u201d When the General Assembly made vast revisions to the Real Estate Tax Sale Law in 1986, one such change was revising \u201ccertified mail\u201d to \u201cfirst class mail, proof of mailing.\u201d Contrary to the reasoning of the Majority, the 1986 revision did not change the (e)(2) notice from certified mail to first class mail without more, which would have permitted taxing bureaus to put a stamp on an envelope containing the requisite notice, and then, when challenged, to proffer any generic evidence that it mailed the envelope. Rather, the General Assembly specified that notice had to be sent by first class mail, which must then be proven through a \u201cproof of mailing\u201d form provided by the USPS.\nLooking first at the subsection (e)(1) notice provisions provides support for this conclusion. Subsection (e)(1) states that the initial, thirty-day notice must be sent \u201cby United States certified mail, restricted delivery, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.\u201d All of these terms \u2014 certified mail, restricted delivery, return receipt requested, and postage prepaid \u2014 are types of mailings and services added to the mailing; they are not burdens of evidentiary proof that may be provided by a mailer. Indeed, they are terms contained and defined within the Code of Federal Regulations, as incorporated by the United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual. See 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 111.1.\nFirst class mail, as defined by the Domestic Mail Manual, is \u201cany mailable item, including postcards, letters, flats, and small packages\u201d that contains \u201cpersonal information ... specific to the addressee,\u201d or any \u201cmail containing handwritten or typewritten material.\u201d Domestic Mail Manual, Part 133, \u00a7\u00a7 3.1, 3.3, & 3.4. First class mail is then eligible for any number of \u201cextra services, including: registered mail, certified mail, certificate of mailing, collection on delivery, USPS tracking, insured mail, return receipt for merchandise, restricted delivery, signature confirmation, and special handling.\u201d Id. Part 133, \u00a7 2.2.5.\nNone of these extra services are entitled \u201cproof of mailing,\u201d as delineated within subsection (e)(2). However, the Domestic Mail Manual does provide for a \u201cmailing receipt\u201d as part of several of the extra services listed above. As defined in the Manual, a mailing receipt shows \u201cthe time and date of mailing\u201d and is provided to the mailer at the time of mailing. See, e.g., id. Part 313 \u00a7 4.1. Mailing receipts are available for first class mailings that are accompanied by the following extra services: registered mail, certified mail, insured mail, return receipt for merchandise, USPS tracking (when purchased at a post office), signature confirmation (when purchased at a post office), and collect on delivery. Id. Part 503, \u00a7\u00a7 1.2.1, 2.2.1, 3.4.1(c), 9.2.1, 10.2.5(a), 11.2.4(a). Similarly, the extra service of a certificate of mailing \u201cis available only at the time of mailing and provides evidence that mail has been presented to the USPS for mailing.\u201d Id. Part 503, \u00a7 4.2.1.\nIn my respectful view, these mailing receipts and certificates, which are provided by the USPS to the mailer at the time of sending first class mail, provide the uniform scheme of \u201cproof of mailing\u201d as anticipated by the General Assembly and Section 602(e)(2). Indeed, all of the forms and labels associated with these extra services uniformly designate: (1) the receiver of the mail and his address; (2) the associated postage or cost; and (3) a postmark, depicting the date the USPS took custody of the first class mailing. See, e.g., USPS Form 3817 (certificate of mailing); USPS Form 3800 (certified mail); and Form 3813 (insured mail). Put differently, these all satisfy the requirement of a notice sent \u201cUnited States first class mail, proof of mailing,\u201d and ensure that each of the sixty-seven county taxing bureaus in the Commonwealth follow a discrete, predictable procedure for obtaining \u201cproof of mailing.\u201d Thus, the legislature expanded the type of extra service mailing a taxing bureau may use to accomplish the sending of the (e)(2) notice from solely certified mail to these other USPS services. It did not, however, negate the necessity of taxing bureaus using some type of USPS proof of mailing when providing the (e)(2) notice.\nAccordingly, pursuant to Section 602(e)(2), the General Assembly mandated the ten-day notices to be sent via first class mail, with one of the special services available to first class mail that demonstrate proof of mailing, i.e., a mailing receipt or certificate of mailing. I would therefore find that the Washington County Tax Bureau did not comply with the plain language of Section 602(e)(2) in this case and affirm the decisions of the lower courts that declared the upset tax sale to be null and void. As the Majority holds otherwise, I respectfully dissent.\nFormer Justice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.602; Act of July 7, 1947, P.L. 1368, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5860.101-5860.803.\n. Indeed, in this case, the taxing bureau submitted to the court a self-prepared \"United States Postal Service Consolidated Postage Statement \u2014 -First Class Mail & Priority Mail\u201d and the envelope that allegedly contained the (e)(2) notice to Appellees as its \"proof of mailing.\u201d Attached to the Consolidated Postage Statement was a ledger apparently listing the names and addresses of persons to whom the taxing bureau sent (e)(2) notices. Respectfully, these documents do not comply with subsection (e)(2) for various reasons.\nFirst, while the Majority finds of primary importance that the taxing bureau \"proffered the actual envelopes sent via first-class mail\u201d to the property owners, Maj. Op. at 127, 81 A.3d at 891, respectfully, this exemplifies the problem with the Majority\u2019s holding. While here, there does not appear to be a dispute that the taxing bureau produced the actual envelopes sent to the property owners, in the thousands of tax sales that occur in the Commonwealth annually, the Majority's holding essentially gives license to taxing authorities to bring whatever proof they can find into court, thus placing judges, who must sit as fact-finders in any challenges raised, in the position of determining credibility and weight of evidence. Such cannot be what the General Assembly envisioned when codifying a uniform system of providing notice in the statutory language under scrutiny.\nIn the same vein, the Consolidated Postage Statement by itself does nothing to show \u201cproof of mailing.\u201d The statement was no more than a cover sheet for bulk mailings prepared by the mailer, not the USPS, that sets forth the number of parcels and the postage cost for the bulk mailing. While this cover sheet is then later signed and stamped by a USPS employee, that signature only verifies that the cost of postage submitted covers the costs of mailing; it does nothing to prove to whom anything was mailed. Finally, the \"attachment\u201d of intended recipients of (e)(2) notices, while also prepared by the taxing bureau, does not seem to be verified in the same manner as the Consolidated Postage Statement, and is therefore no more \"proof of mailing\u201d than anything else submitted by the taxing bureau to the court. See Reproduced Record 289a-296a.\n. The USPS's website describes all of the extra services enumerated in the Domestic Mail Manual in plain English. To that end, the website informs customers that they may obtain \"proof of mailing\" by purchasing either certified mail or certificates of mailing. While I rely upon the actual federal regulation as contained within the Domestic Mail Manual to arrive at my conclusion herein, I would, at the very least, restrict the meaning of \"proof of mailing\" as contained within Section 602(e)(2) to these two services. Related thereto, I respectfully note that the Majority, at 122, 81 A.3d at 888 of its opinion, quotes these plain English provisions from the USPS website, and then inexplicably ignores this very language in permitting self-made ledgers and envelopes to be brought into court as \"proof of mailing.\u201d",
