        "text": "OPINION\nJustice TODD.\nIn these consolidated appeals, we consider whether the manifestation of an occupational disease outside of the 300-week period prescribed by Section 301(c)(2) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the \u201cWCA\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d), 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2), removes the claim from the purview of the Act, such that the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 481, does not apply. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that claims for occupational disease which manifests outside of the 300-week period prescribed by the Act do not fall within the purview of the Act, and, therefore, that the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) does not apply to preclude an employee from filing a common law claim against an employer. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Superi- or Court.\nJohn Tooey worked for Ferro Engineering (\u201cFerro\u201d), a division of Oglebay-Norton Co. (\u201cOglebay\u201d), as an industrial salesman of asbestos products from 1964 until 1982, during which time he was exposed to asbestos dust. In December 2007, Tooey developed mesothelioma and died less than one year later. Spurgeon Landis worked for Alloy Rods, Inc. (\u201cAlloy\u201d), predecessor in interest to Chemetron Corp. (\u201cChe metro n\u201d), and ESAB Group, Inc. (\u201cESAB\u201d), from 1946 until 1992. He, too, was exposed to asbestos throughout his employment, and, in July 2007, was diagnosed with mesothelioma.\nIn 2008, Tooey, Landis, and their spouses (hereinafter \u201cAppellants\u201d) filed separate tort actions against multiple defendants, including their respective employers (collectively, \u201cEmployers\u201d). Employers filed motions for summary judgment, alleging Appellants\u2019 causes of action were barred by the exclusivity provision of Section 808(a) of the Act. Appellants responded that the Act, the federal and state constitutions, and precedent from this Court, permit a tort action against an employer where, as here, a disease falls outside the jurisdiction, scope, and coverage of the Act. The trial court agreed \u25a0with Appellants, and denied Employers\u2019 motions for summary judgment.\nEmployers filed an interlocutory appeal with the Superior Court, which reversed in an unpublished memorandum decision. In so doing, the court concluded it was bound by its recent decisions in Ranalli v. Rohm & Haas Co., 983 A.2d 732 (Pa.Super.2009), and Sedlacek v. A.O. Smith Corp., 990 A.2d 801 (Pa.Super.2010). In Ranalli, the Superior Court determined that the fact that the plaintiffs injuries, which resulted from his exposure to vinyl chloride and manifested more than 300 weeks after his last employment, were not compensable under the Act did not render the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) inapplicable. The Superior Court reasoned that application of Section 303(a) \u201cdoes not deny access to the courts, rather it limits recovery as contemplated by the legislative scheme.\u201d Ranalli, 983 A.2d at 735. Similarly, in Sedlacek, the Superior Court observed that both the WCA and the Occupational Disease Act (\u201cODA\u201d), 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1201 et seq., contain provisions which purport to limit compensation for disability or death resulting from occupational disease to injuries that occur within a defined period from the date of last employment, and the court determined that such provisions do not violate the federal Due Process or Equal Protection Clause, or the Remedies Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\nAlthough the Superior Court in the instant case acknowledged Appellants\u2019 position that Ranalli and Sedlacek \u201cimproperly expanded the application of the exclusivity provision,\u201d the court concluded it lacked authority to overrule its prior decisions. Tooey v. AK Steel, 1540-42 WDA 2009, unpublished memorandum at 7, 11 A.3d 1046 (Pa.Super. filed Aug. 31, 2010). Appellants filed a petition for allowance of appeal with this Court, and we granted review to determine (1) whether, under the plain language of Section 301(c)(2), the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d excludes an occupational disease that first manifests more than 300 weeks after the last occupational exposure to the hazards of such disease, such that the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) does not apply; (2) whether Section 301(c)(2), in conjunction with the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a), results in an unconstitutional denial of reasonable compensation under Pa. Const. Art. Ill, \u00a7 18; and (3) whether the substitution of an exclusive statutory remedy for a common law remedy for an occupational disease which is \u201cinvariably noncompensable\u201d under the statutory remedy violates the Open Court and Remedies Clause of Pa. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 2 and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Tooey v. AK Steel Corp., 610 Pa. 405, 20 A.3d 1184 (2011) (order).\nAs it is this Court\u2019s policy to resolve claims on non-constitutional grounds when it is possible to do so, see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Long, 592 Pa. 42, 50, 922 A.2d 892, 897 (2007), we first consider Appellants\u2019 argument that, because their injuries are excluded from the definition of injury set forth in Section 301(c)(2), their claims do not fall within the parameters of the Act, and, therefore, the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) of the Act does not preclude them from pursuing common law claims against Employers. As this issue raises a question of law, our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. Dechert LLP v. Commonwealth, 606 Pa. 334, 340, 998 A.2d 575, 579 (2010).\nThe WCA was designed \u201cto compensate claimants for earnings loss occasioned by work-related injuries.\u201d City of Erie v. W.C.A.B. (Annunziata), 575 Pa. 594, 601, 838 A.2d 598, 602 (2003). The Act seeks \u201cto provide recompense commensurate with the damage from accidental injury, as a fair exchange for relinquishing every other right of action against the employer.\u201d Id. Indeed, Section 303(a) of the Act specifies that \u201cliability of an employer under the act shall be exclusive and in place of any and all other liability to such employes.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 481(a). We have further explained that \u201c[t]he goal of the workers\u2019 compensation legislative scheme is to relieve the employee \u2018from the economic consequences of his injury and make [those consequences] a part of the cost of operation of the business, to be paid ultimately by the consuming public.\u2019 \u201d Annunziata, 575 Pa. at 601, 838 A.2d at 602 (quoting Rudy v. McCloskey Corp., 348 Pa. 401, 35 A.2d 250, 253 (1944)).\nRelevant to the case sub judice, Section 301(c)(2) of the Act provides, in pertinent part:\nThe terms \u201cinjury,\u201d \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d and \u201cinjury arising in the course of his employment,\u201d as used in this act, shall include ... occupational disease as defined in section 108 of this act [i.e., 77 P.S. \u00a7 27.1]: Provided, That whenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation, for disability or death under this act, it shall apply only to disability or death resulting from such disease and occurring within three hundred weeks after the last date of employment in an occupation or industry to which he was exposed to hazards of such disease: And provided further, That if the employe\u2019s compensable disability has occurred within such period, his subsequent death as a result of the disease shall likewise be compensable.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2) (emphasis added).\nAppellants argue that, under the plain language of Section 301(c)(2), an occupational disease which first manifests more than 300 weeks after the last occupational exposure to the hazards of the disease does not fall within the definition of injury set forth in Section 301(c)(2); that the Act, therefore, does not apply to employees seeking compensation for such diseases; and, accordingly, that the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) does not preclude an employee from seeking recovery for such disease through a common law action against an employer. Appellants contend their interpretation of the statutory language is supported by general rules of grammar, and, to the extent the statute may be deemed ambiguous, that their interpretation is consistent with the humanitarian purposes of the Act, as well as precedent from this Court.\nEmployers, conversely, assert that Section 303(a), by its express language, \u201cunequivocally precludes current or former employees from making civil claims for damages against their employers for work-related injuries,\u201d including occupational disease claims. See, e.g., ESAB/Chemetron Brief at 9-10. Employers, like Appellants, argue their interpretation is supported by recognized principles of grammar, the underlying purpose of the Act, and this Court\u2019s prior decisions interpreting the Act. Additionally, Employers emphasize the distinction between compensability and coverage under the Act, and they contend that Section 301(c)(2) is a valid statute of repose that serves as a temporal limitation on recovery, rather than a jurisdictional limitation of the Act.\nIt is well settled that \u201c[t]he object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly. Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(a). Further, \u201c[i]n giving effect to the words of the legislature, we should not interpret statutory words in isolation, but must read them with reference to the context in which they appear.\u201d Giant Eagle, Inc. v. W.C.A.B. (Givner), 614 Pa. 606, 39 A.3d 287, 290 (Pa.2012) (citation omitted). When construing statutory language, \u201c[wjords and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1903. Furthermore, when reviewing issues concerning the Act, we are mindful that the Act is remedial in nature and its purpose is to benefit the workers of this Commonwealth. Thus, the Act is to be liberally construed to effectuate its humanitarian objectives, and borderline interpretations are to be construed in the injured party\u2019s favor. Sporio v. W.C.A.B. (Songer Const.), 553 Pa. 44, 49, 717 A.2d 525, 528 (1998).\nTurning to the pertinent language of Section 301(c)(2)\u2014 \u201cwhenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation, for disability or death under this act, it shall apply only to disability or death resulting from such disease and occurring within three hundred weeks after the last date of employment in an occupation or industry to which he was exposed to hazards of such disease\u201d \u2014 Appellants contend that the word \u201cit\u201d in the phrase \u201cit shall apply,\u201d refers to \u201cthis act\u201d and not to \u201cthe basis for compensation.\u201d Thus, they read Section 301(c)(2) as follows: \u201cwhenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation, for disability or death under this act, this act shall apply only to disability or death resulting from such disease and occurring within three hundred weeks after the last date of employment.\u201d\nIn support of their argument, they rely on \u201can elementary rule of grammar, [that] a pronoun may substitute for or refer to an immediately preceding noun.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Brief at 16 (citing The Chicago Manual of Style, \u00a7 5.34 (15th ed. 2003)). They further assert that, while a legislative act is frequently said to \u201capply,\u201d the phrase \u201cbasis for compensation\u201d is not ordinarily used in the same manner.\nEmployers, on the other hand, argue that the term \u201cit\u201d in the phrase \u201cit shall apply only to disability or death,\u201d refers to the term \u201ccompensation,\u201d an interpretation they contend is supported by the rules of grammar concerning restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses. Specifically, Employers assert:\nA restrictive clause is a clause that is essential to the meaning of a sentence, including the identification of nouns or pronouns in the sentence. It is not set off by commas.\nBy contrast, nonrestrictive clauses, which contain nonessential and mere explanatory information, are set apart from the rest of the sentence by a pair of commas. Nonrestrictive clauses \u201cdo not restrict the meaning of the word or words they relate to ...; they could be removed from the sentence without changing the [sentence\u2019s] basic meaning.\u201d The pair of commas around a nonrestrictive clause act exactly like a pair of parentheses.\nBrief for ESAB/Chemetron, at 20 (citations omitted). Applying these grammatical rules to Section 301(c)(2), Employers argue that the phrase \u201cfor disability or death under this act,\u201d is nonrestrictive, such that the word \u201cit\u201d clearly refers to the word \u201ccompensation,\u201d and not \u201cact.\u201d Id. at 21. Thus, Employers read Section 301(c)(2) as follows: \u201cwhenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation, for disability or death under this act, compensation shall apply only to disability or death resulting from such disease and occurring within three hundred weeks after the last date of employment.\u201d\nUpon review, we find Appellants\u2019 interpretation of the language of Section 301(c)(2) to be the most reasonable one. Although both Appellants and Employers make grammatical arguments based on punctuation placement, the common and approved usage of the terms in Section 301(c)(2) clearly support Appellants\u2019 interpretation of the statute. While an act generally is described as applying or not applying in certain situations, the term \u201ccompensation\u201d is not invoked in the same manner. Indeed, our research reveals no published decision in which any Pennsylvania court has utilized the verb \u201capply\u201d to describe the term \u201ccompensation.\u201d Similarly, there are no Pennsylvania statutes which invoke the terms \u201capply\u201d and \u201ccompensation\u201d in this manner. Thus, we conclude that the term \u201cit\u201d applies not to \u201ccompensation,\u201d but to the term \u201cact,\u201d as contained in (1) the phrase \u201cfor disability or death under this act\u201d immediately preceding \u201cit\u201d; and/or (2) the phrase \u201cas used in this act\u201d in the preamble to Section 301(c)(2). Accordingly, we construe Section 301(c)(2) as follows: \u201cwhenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation, for disability or death under this act, [the act] shall apply only to disability or death resulting from such disease and occurring within three hundred weeks after the last date of employment.\u201d\nAssuming, for purposes of argument, that Employers\u2019 interpretation of Section 301(c)(2) also is reasonable, such that there exists an ambiguity, see Giant Eagle, 39 A.3d at 294 (where there are at least two reasonable interpretations of statutory text, there exists an ambiguity), we turn, as the parties do in the alternative, to further principles of statutory construction. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(c). In determining the intent of the legislature with regard to Section 301(c)(2), we are guided primarily by consideration of the occasion and necessity for the statute; the object to be attained; and the consequences of the proposed interpretations.\nThis Court has recognized that the Act \u201csubstitutes a quick and inexpensive scheme to provide compensation for work-related injuries in place of the common law process where the employee must sue the appropriate parties for damages. Employers pay benefits at a set rate and they are immune from common-law liability.\u201d Sporio, 553 Pa. at 53, 717 A.2d at 530 (citation omitted); see also Markle v. W.C.A.B. (Caterpillar Tractor Co.), 541 Pa. 148,153, 661 A.2d 1355,1357 (1995) (\u201cWorker\u2019s Compensation can best be understood as a replacement of common law tort actions between employees and employers as a means for obtaining compensation for injuries.\u201d).\nWith regard to the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a), this Court, in Alston v. St. Paul Ins. Cas., explained that Section 303(a):\nreflects the historical quid pro quo between an employer and employee whereby the employer assumes liability without fault for a work-related injury, but is relieved of the possibility of a larger damage verdict in a common law action. The employee benefits from the expeditious payment of compensation, but forgoes recovery of some elements of damages.\n531 Pa. 261, 267, 612 A.2d 421, 424 (1992). We have repeatedly stressed, however, that the Act is \u201cremedial in nature and intended to benefit the worker, and, therefore, the Act must be liberally construed to effectuate its humanitarian objectives.\u201d Giant Eagle, 39 A.3d at 290; see also Lancaster Gen. Hosp. v. WCAB (Weber-Brown), 616 Pa. 333, 47 A.3d 831, 839 (2012).\nIn the case sub judice, Appellants contend that, as a result of the 300-week time provision contained in Section 301(c)(2), in cases involving latent, asbestos-related mesothelioma, \u201cthe quid pro quo contemplated by the Act cannot be effectuated. The employee does not benefit from \u2018expeditious payment of compensation,\u2019 and in fact has no reasonable opportunity to obtain compensation at all.\u201d Appellants Brief at 19. Thus, according to Appellants, \u201c[i]t would violate the spirit of the Act to ... grant the employer full immunity based on the illusion that the employer bears \u2018no-fault\u2019 liability for the worker\u2019s non-compensable occupational injury.\u201d Id.\nIn support of their position, Appellants rely on this Court\u2019s prior decisions in Lord Corp. v. Pollard, 548 Pa. 124, 695 A.2d 767 (1997), Boniecke v. McGraw-Edison Co., 485 Pa. 163, 401 A.2d 345 (1979), and Greer v. U.S. Steel Corp., 475 Pa. 448, 380 A.2d 1221 (1977). In Lord Corp., the plaintiff filed a wrongful death action on behalf of her deceased husband, alleging he died as a result of complications from malignant nodular lymphoma caused by his exposure to toxic and deadly chemicals during his employment with Lord Corp.\u2019s chemical products division. Lord Corp. filed preliminary objections to the complaint, alleging that the claim was barred by the exclusivity provisions of the WCA and the ODA. The trial court granted the preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed, reasoning \u201cthe trial court\u2019s order granting a demurrer was premature because there had been no determination of compensability and this question could not be resolved from the pleadings.\u201d 548 Pa. at 127, 695 A.2d at 768.\nOn further appeal to this Court, an equally divided Court determined that an employee\u2019s common law action is not barred by the exclusivity provision of either the WCA or the ODA until there has been a final determination that the injury or disease in question is cognizable under either Act. The Opinion in Support of Affirmance provided, in relevant part:\nThis Court has previously examined the question of whether an employee\u2019s common law action is barred under circumstances similar to those presented here. In Boniecke v. McGraw-Edison Co., 485 Pa. 163, 401 A.2d 345 (1979), an employee commenced an action in trespass against his employer after being denied relief under the ODA. The employer then filed a motion for summary judgment, contending, as Lord does in the present case, that the ODA and WCA bar all common law actions by an employee against his employer for occupational diseases. This Court rejected the employer\u2019s argument, holding that the employee\u2019s claims were not barred because although the employee had been denied relief under the ODA, there had been no adjudication of the employee\u2019s rights under the WCA, and \u201cthere [was] nothing in the record, aside from [the employer\u2019s] mere allegations, which would indicate that [the employee was] entitled to relief under the Acts.\u201d Boniecke, 485 Pa. at 167, 401 A.2d at 347.\nWe reached a similar conclusion in Greer [v. U.S. Steel Corp., 475 Pa. 448, 380 A.2d 1221 (1977)], wherein an employee sought common law recovery for a disease allegedly contracted in the course of employment due to the negligence of the employer. The employer\u2019s answer to the complaint claimed, in part, that the employee\u2019s exclusive remedy was under the ODA. In rejecting the employer\u2019s claim, we reasoned that:\n[i]n the pleadings we have no assertion by either side as to whether the existence of [the applicable conditions of the ODA] can or cannot be demonstrated nor have we had any argument by counsel as to who has the burden of proof on the issue. In any event, the uncertainty of this factual question makes it inappropriate for the grant of judgment on the pleadings.\nGreer, 475 Pa. at 453, 380 A.2d at 1223.\nIn accordance with our decisions in Boniecke and Greer, we would hold that an employee\u2019s common law action is not barred by the exclusivity provisions of either the WCA or the ODA until there has been a final determination that the injury or disease in question is cognizable under either Act. See Boniecke; Greer. Thus, in the present case, if it is determined that decedent\u2019s nodular lymphoma is compensable, then Pollard\u2019s common law action is barred. Conversely, if the facts do not warrant such a finding, her common law cause of action may be maintained.\nLord Corp., 548 Pa. at 128-29, 695 A.2d at 769 (Opinion in Support of Affirmance) (footnote omitted). According to Appellants, this Court\u2019s decisions in Lord Corp., Boniecke, and Greer support the conclusion that, because their claims are not compensable under the Act, the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) does not bar their common law claims against Employers.\nEmployers, however, insist that the workers\u2019 compensation system was not intended to provide, in every case, either compensation for a workplace injury or an opportunity to seek redress at common law. Employers contend there is a difference between coverage and compensability under the Act, and they further suggest that individuals who contract mesothelioma or other latent asbestos-related diseases are not completely without a remedy at common law, as such individuals still may seek compensation from non-employer defendants. Employers additionally maintain that Section 301(c)(2) is a statute of repose which serves as a legitimate temporal limitation on recovery, as opposed to a jurisdictional limitation of the Act.\nIn support of their argument that the Act\u2019s remedies are exclusive, even where compensation is unavailable, Employers cite, inter alia, this Court\u2019s decision in Kline v. Arden H. Vemer Co., 503 Pa. 251, 469 A.2d 158 (1983). In Kline, the plaintiff, a painter, was injured when he fell from a ladder. He applied for, and received, workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the month he was disabled. Subsequently, the plaintiff sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits for impotency resulting from his fall. When he was denied benefits, the plaintiff filed suit against his employer, alleging negligent conduct by another employee as the cause of his injury. Summary judgment was granted in favor of the employer, and, on appeal, this Court held the Act was the exclusive avenue of compensation. We explained:\nTo change, alter or abolish a remedy lies within the wisdom and power of the legislature and in some instances, the courts. Access to a tribunal is not denied when the tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain either the claim or the remedy. Time and circumstances require new remedies to adjust to new and unforeseen losses and conditions. To do so, facets of the society often require new immunities or larger responsibility, as the legislature may determine. The workmen\u2019s compensation law has deprived some of rights in exchange for surer benefits, immunized some, to make possible resources to benefit many, who where [sic] heretofore without possible or practical remedies.\nId. at 255, 469 A.2d at 160.\nEmployers additionally assert that this Court \u201crecognized the crucial distinction between \u2018coverage\u2019 and \u2018compensation\u2019 under the WCA in Moffett v. Harbison-Walker Refractories Co., 339 Pa. 112,14 A.2d 111 (1940).\u201d Brief for Oglebay at 29; see also Brief of ESAB/Chemetron at 25. In Moffett, a partially-disabled employee sought relief at common law for work-related silicosis because the WCA and the ODA provided relief only for total disability. In holding the WCA provided the exclusive avenue of compensation, this Court stated:\nthe original act, providing for accidental injuries, allowed no compensation until after a definite period, provided no compensation to nonresident dependents, and allowed nothing for disfigurement. That was the legislative policy and was well understood when the supplement of 1937 was passed. In harmony with that policy, the legislature, in providing for compensation for silicosis, made other exceptions: section 5(a) provided it \u2018shall be paid only when it is shown that the employe has had an aggregate employment of at least two years in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, during a period of eight years next preceding the date of disability, in an occupation having a silica or asbestos hazard.\u2019 It is inconceivable that the legislature intended, for example, that a person recently come into the state, and becoming totally disabled, within two years, should have the right to sue in tort and that after two years he should be subject only to the compensation statute. We think in each case the employe\u2019s contract resulted from the statute and in each case was the same; he gave up his right to sue in tort for the absolute certainty provided by the Act of receiving the compensation on bringing himself within its compensatory clauses. By coming under the Act, plaintiff surrendered his right, in the words of the Act \u2018to any method of determination thereof, other than as provided, in article three.\u2019\n339 Pa. at 115-16,14 A.2d at 113.\nUpon review, it is evident that this Court\u2019s decisions in Lord, Greer, and Boniecke support Appellants\u2019 construction of the Act. See Sporio, supra. Moreover, we find neither Kline, nor Moffett, compels the conclusion for which Employers advocate. With respect to Employers\u2019 reliance on Moffett, we note that Moffett was decided prior to 1974, when participation in the workers\u2019 compensation system was elective, and employees could opt out of a system which might deprive them of compensation for an entire category of injuries. See supra note 4. Employees no longer have that option, and are required to participate in a system that likely will deny them the opportunity to seek compensation from their employer for any late-manifesting work-related injuries.\nFurthermore, in Kline, this Court recognized that \u201cthe injury suffered was clearly within the scope of the Act and the appellant was fully compensated under the Act.\u201d 503 Pa. at 255, 469 A.2d at 160. Unlike the plaintiff in Kline, Appellants herein did not and, indeed, could not seek any compensation under the Act, given the fact that their injuries did not manifest until nearly 780 weeks (in the case of Mr. Landis), and 1300 weeks (in the case of Mr. Tooey), after their employment-based exposure to asbestos. Indeed, the average latency period for mesothelioma is 30 to 50 years. See Daley v. AW. Chesterton, Inc., 614 Pa. 335, 37 A.3d 1175, 1188 (2012). Even mesothelioma that manifests at the lower end of this average will not occur for decades following an employee\u2019s exposure to asbestos. Thus, Section 301(c)(2)\u2019s 300-week time window operates as a de facto exclusion of coverage under the Act for essentially all mesothelioma claims.\nRecently, in Bowman, supra, this Court again considered the historical development of the Act. In Bowman, we addressed the issue of whether a third-party workers\u2019 compensation release signed by an employee as a condition of her employment was void against public policy to the extent the language of the release conflicted with the language of Section 204(a) of the Act. We determined that the release was enforceable and not against public policy, as Section 204(a) prohibits agreements to waive workers\u2019 compensation claims only against the employer, not third parties. In reaching our conclusion, we observed:\nThe Act, as originally conceived, established a dual system of recovery for injured employees against their employers\u2014 principally through the Article III schedule, but, barring that, through an action at law under Article II.\nArticle II remains in the Act, although modified considerably. Section 204(a) now contains a series of provisions pertaining only to offsets enjoyed by the employer to be applied to specific compensation benefits an employer is obligated to pay under \u00a7\u00a7 108 or 306 of the Act. In addition, \u00a7 305(d) explicitly provides an action at law pursuant to Article II continues to be available to any employee whose employer is either uninsured or not an approved self-insurer. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 501(d) (\u201cWhen any employer fails to secure the payment of compensation under this act as provided in sections 305 and 305.2, the injured employee or his dependents may proceed either under this act or in a suit for damages at law as provided by article II.\u201d).\nBowman, 65 A.3d at 908 (footnote omitted). We noted that the Act, in providing for a dual system of recovery, \u201cmade it a violation of public policy for an employer to avoid both recovery tracks.\u201d Id. Were this Court to interpret Section 301(c)(2) as Employers suggest, and hold that Appellants are precluded from seeking damages at common law for their injuries, notwithstanding their inability to seek compensation under the Act, we would enable exactly what this Court in Bowman recognized the Act was intended to prohibit \u2014 an employer\u2019s avoidance of liability through both recovery tracks.\nIndeed, the consequences of Employers\u2019 proposed interpretation of the Act to prohibit an employee from filing an action at common law, despite the fact that employee has no opportunity to seek redress under the Act, leaves the employee with no remedy against his or her employer, a consequence that clearly contravenes the Act\u2019s intended purpose of benefitting the injured worker. It is inconceivable that the legislature, in enacting a statute specifically designed to benefit employees, intended to leave a certain class of employees who have suffered the most serious of work-related injuries without any redress under the Act or at common law.\nThe dissent suggests that allowing employees to seek damages at common law when they cannot proceed under the Act \u201cwould expose employers to potentially unlimited liability for occupational diseases, an exposure that could undermine the compromise of interests\u201d between the employers and employees manifest in the Act. Dissenting Opinion at 93, 81 A.3d at 871. The dissent fails to acknowledge, however, as we have repeatedly emphasized, that the Act is \u201cremedial in nature and intended to benefit the worker, and, therefore, the Act must be liberally construed to effectuate its humanitarian objectives.\u201d Giant Eagle, 39 A.3d at 290; see also Lancaster Gen. Hosp., 47 A.3d at 839. Thus, close interpretations should be resolved in favor of the employee.\nFurthermore, we recognize that Section 301(c)(2), which requires that an occupational disease-based disability manifest within 300 weeks of an employee\u2019s last exposure to the hazards of the disease, \u201cwas intended to prevent stale claims, and prevent speculation over whether a disease is work-related years after an exposure occurred.\u201d Sporio, 553 Pa. at 50, 717 A.2d at 528 (citation omitted). However, allowing an employee to seek recovery for occupational disease-based injuries at common law when the disease does not manifest within 300 weeks of the last employment-based exposure does not, in and of itself, malign this objective. Employers, like any other entity not covered by the Act, will be subject to traditional tort liability requiring a showing by the plaintiff of, inter alia, negligence on the part of the employer, and employers will retain all of their common law defenses. Plaintiffs, in turn, will bear the higher burden of proof in terms of causation and liability. As a result, contrary to the dissent\u2019s claim, employers are not exposed to \u201cpotentially unlimited liability.\u201d Dissenting Opinion at 87, 81 A.3d at 871.\nThus, consideration of the relevant factors set forth in 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(c), particularly the remedial purpose of the Act and the consequences of both Employers\u2019 and Appellants\u2019 proposed interpretations, indicates the legislature did not intend the Act to apply to claims for disability or death resulting from occupational disease which manifests more than 300 weeks after the last occupational exposure.\nFor the above reasons, we conclude the Act does not apply to Appellants\u2019 claims. As a result, we hold that the exclusivity provision of Section 303(a) does not preclude Appellants from seeking compensation for their injuries via a common law action against Employers, and, therefore, we reverse the Superior Court\u2019s decision reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of Employers\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\nReversed. Case remanded to Superior Court for remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\nFormer Justice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices EAKIN, BAER and McCAFFERY join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\n. Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736 (as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1 \u2014 1041.1; 2501-2626).\n. Section 303(a) of the Act provides:\nThe liability of an employer under this act shall be exclusive and in place of any and all other liability to such employes, his legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin or anyone otherwise entitled to damages in any action at law or otherwise on account of any injury or death as defined in section 301(c)(1) and (2) or occupational disease as defined in section 108.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 481(a) (footnotes omitted). Pursuant to Section 108 of the Act, the term \"occupational disease\" includes, inter alia, \"[ajsbestosis and cancer resulting from direct contact with, handling of, or exposure to the dust of asbestos in any occupation involving such contact, handling or exposure.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 27.1 (Z).\n. Employers, in arguing that the word \"it\" refers to the word \"compensation,\u201d and not \u201cact,\" ignore the possibility that the word \"it\u201d might refer to the word \"act,\" as contained in the preamble, which states: \"The terms \u2018injury,\u2019 \u2018personal injury,\u2019 and 'injury arising in the course of his employment,\u2019 as used in this act, shall include ... occupational disease as defined in section 108 of this act.\u201d\n. Notably, the Act did not always provide the exclusive remedy for workplace injuries. Prior to 1974, participation in the Workers\u2019 Compensation system was elective, although there existed a rebuttable presumption that the employer and its employees accepted the compensation scheme. See, e.g., Bowman v. Sunoco, Inc., 65 A.3d 901, 907-08 (Pa.2013); see also McKinney Mfg. Corp. v. W.C.A.B., 9 Pa.Cmwlth. 79, 305 A.2d 59, 61 (1973) (interpreting prior version of Act and noting \"[ojften forgotten or overlooked is the fundamental premise that when the employer and the employee accept the provisions of the Act[,] their relations become contractual and the employee receives the right to compensation under the statute.\u201d); Fonner v. Shandon, Inc., 555 Pa. 370, 375, 724 A.2d 903, 905 (1999) (observing that 1974 amendments made it mandatory for employers and employees to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation scheme).\n. The dissent, challenging our de facto exclusion conclusion, is correct in noting that the latency period is measured from the first exposure, whereas the 300-week time period is measured from the last exposure, and that, as a result, some mesothelioma claims could theoretically be covered by the Act for persons \"who have had a long occupational history of exposure.\u201d Dissenting Opinion at 96 n.12, 81 A.3d at 873 n.12. However, we question the size of such a group, as, essentially, such persons would have to have had asbestos exposure at the beginning, and continuously up and towards the end (less 300 weeks), of a 30 to 50 year period of employment.\n. As this Court recognized in Daley v. A.W. Chesterton, Inc., 614 Pa. 335, 37 A.3d 1175 (Pa.2012), mesothelioma is an extremely rare disease, even among persons exposed to asbestos, and only between 1000 and 2000 cases of mesothelioma are diagnosed in the United States each year. 37 A.3d at 1188-89.\n.

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\ndissenting.\nI respectfully dissent, as I would find that the diseases in question were meant to be covered by the terms of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, but that compensation is unavailable due to the expiration of the 300-week statutory period. Thus, I would find that the constitutional claims raised by Plaintiffs have become salient and that the Attorney General should be given an opportunity to participate. My reasoning follows.\nAs described by the majority, Plaintiffs contend, based on their reading of Section 301(c)(2) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cWCA\u201d), that their common-law claims are not barred by the exclusive-remedy provision appearing in Section 303(a) of the WCA, see 77 P.S. \u00a7 481, because their injuries are not covered by the act due to the expiration of the 300-week limitation period. Plaintiffs acknowledge that their diseases are \u201cpotentially\u201d covered in light of Section 108(()- However, they repeat an argument they made to the common pleas court, that a proviso appearing in Section 301(c)(2) ultimately precludes such coverage. That provision states, in relevant part:\nThe terms \u201cinjury,\u201d \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d and \u201cinjury arising in the course of his employment,\u201d as used in this act, shall include ... occupational disease as defined in section 108 of this act [ie., 77 P.S. \u00a7 27.1]: Provided, That whenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation, for disability or death under this act, it shall apply only to disability or death resulting from such disease and occurring within three hundred weeks after the last date of employment in an occupation or industry to which he was exposed to hazards of such disease: And provided further, That if the employe\u2019s compensable disability has occurred within such period, his subsequent death as a result of the disease shall likewise be compensable....\n77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2) (emphasis added). As noted by the majority, Plaintiffs have contended throughout this litigation that the above should be interpreted to remove their injuries entirely from the scope of the WCA, which in turn would render Section 303(a)\u2019s exclusivity clause inapplicable. Plaintiffs support this position by adverting to rules of grammar, arguing that the \u201cit\u201d in \u201cit shall apply\u201d refers to \u201cthis act\u201d rather than \u201cthe basis for compensation.\u201d They observe that pronouns often substitute for the immediately preceding noun, see Brief for Appellants at 16 (citing The Chicago Manual of Style \u00a7 5.34 (15th ed. 2003)), and argue that, generally speaking, an act may \u201capply,\u201d whereas a \u201cbasis for compensation\u201d is not ordinarily said to \u201capply.\u201d\nAs a fallback position, Plaintiffs reason that, to the extent Section 301(c)(2) may be ambiguous, such ambiguity should be resolved in favor of permitting a tort cause of action to proceed, since that interpretation will be less likely to raise constitutional difficulties such as a potential violation of the Remedies Clause. See Pa. Const, art. 1, \u00a7 11 (\u201c[E]very man for an injury done him in his land, goods, person or reputation shall have remedy by due course of law____\u201d). Additionally, they posit that considerations such as the object to be attained and the consequences of a particular interpretation, see 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c), militate in favor of their proffered construction. Here, Plaintiffs note that the WCA establishes a quid pro quo whereby an employer assumes no-fault liability but is shielded from potentially greater liability at common law, while the employee receives expeditious compensation but forgoes some elements of damages. See Alston v. St. Paul Ins. Cos., 531 Pa. 261, 267, 612 A.2d 421, 424 (1992). They assert that the quid pro quo cannot be effectuated in cases such as theirs where the latency period is greater than 300 weeks, and that such time limitation, if interpreted according to the Superior Court\u2019s reasoning, is inconsistent with the WCA\u2019s goal of expanding the ability of employees to obtain compensation for work-related injuries. Anticipating that Employers will argue that allowing a common-law remedy would undermine the act\u2019s objective of limiting employer liability, Plaintiffs contend that, to the degree the legislation is designed to limit liability, it is only intended to limit no-fault (or absolute) liability. They point out that in a common law cause of action Employers\u2019 liability would not be absolute because Plaintiffs would be required to demonstrate negligence and causation. See Appellants\u2019 Brief at 19-20.\nFinally, Plaintiffs bolster their position by reference to case law from this jurisdiction and one sister State. They draw attention, first, to Lord Corp. v. Pollard, 548 Pa. 124, 695 A.2d 767 (1997), on which the common pleas court relied in denying Employers\u2019 motions for judgment on the pleadings. In Pollard, this Court was evenly divided, and one group of Justices reasoned that the employer\u2019s demurrer to an employee\u2019s negligence claim should not be sustained unless it was clear from the pleadings that the injury was cognizable under either the WCA or the Occupational Disease Act of 1939 (the \u201cODA\u201d). See id. at 129, 695 A.2d at 769 (Opinion in Support of Affirmance). The extra jurisdictional decision, Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County, 276 Mont. 67, 915 P.2d 175 (1996), involved a so-called \u201cmental-mental\u201d injury \u2014 that is, a mental injury caused by mental stress \u2014 which was categorically excluded from coverage under that state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statute. The Montana court concluded that, where there is no possibility of recovery under the statute, the central quid pro qux> is defeated, and hence, the concept of remedy exclusivity is inapplicable \u2014 meaning that the employer was exposed to potential common law tort liability. See.id. at 180-81.\nEmployers respond that the workers\u2019 compensation scheme was enacted pursuant to an express grant of legislative power reflected in the state charter, see Pa. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 18, and that it was intended by the General Assembly to operate as a comprehensive substitute for common-law tort liability based on concepts of efficiency and compromise. They maintain that the WCA embodies a compromise whereby employers are made liable without regard to fault, while employees forfeit the right to recover greater sums at common law. Employers indicate that remedy exclusivity is integral to the compromise, is firmly entrenched in Pennsylvania law, and is applicable even in instances where no compensation is available due to the expiration of a time limitation \u2014 as otherwise employers would be exposed to potentially unlimited liability, which would be contrary to legislative intent. They state that the Commonwealth Court has expressly endorsed this view by pointing out that, while arbitrary time limits may at times seem harsh in their effects, they are necessary because of the practical limits on the amount of benefits that can reasonably be provided \u2014 and that such limitations \u201cmust be established by the Legislature possessed of all the [actuarial] facts, not by a court deciding one case, however unfortunate.\u201d Brief for Oglebay at 34 (quoting Bethlehem Steel Co. v. Gray, 4 Pa. Cmwlth. 590, 594, 288 A.2d 828, 829-30 (1972) (en banc)).\nAs a matter of textual analysis, Chemetron initially stresses the disjunctive nature of the language used in the exclusivity provision (Section 303(a) of the WCA), noting that employer liability is made to exist in place of all other liability on account of injury or death as defined in section 301(c)(1) and (2) or occupational disease as defined in Section 108. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 481(a). Thus, since it is undisputed that mesothelioma is an occupational disease as defined in Section 108, see supra note 2, Chemetron proffers that this alone is sufficient to implicate remedy exclusivity without consulting Section 301(c)(2). Alternatively, Employers state that, even if Section 301(c)(2) is deemed controlling, Plaintiffs\u2019 grammatical analysis is in error since the antecedent of the pronoun \u201cit\u201d in the phrase \u201cit shall apply\u201d is not the word \u201cact,\u201d but \u201ccompensation,\u201d and that this construction is appropriate because the commas surrounding the phrase, \u201cfor disability or death under this act,\u201d signify that the clause is a nonrestrictive one \u2014 that is, it contains parenthetical, explanatory information, and as such, the commas may be replaced with parentheses without altering the meaning. See, e.g., Brief for Chemetron at 20 (citing, inter alia, William Strunk, Jr. & E.B. White, The Elements of Style 2-5 (3d ed. 1979), and The Chicago Manual of Style \u00a7 5.29 (13th ed. 1982)). This is significant, according to Employers, because it shows that the statutory proviso was not intended to negate the act\u2019s coverage of mesothelioma, and any covered disease is subject to the rule of exclusivity even where the injury is ultimately non-compensable on some independent basis (such as the expiration of a limitation period).\nMoreover, Employers argue that cases such as Pollard, on which Plaintiffs rely for the contrary position, actually support Employers\u2019 argument since the determinative issue in those matters was whether the disease or injury was of a type that was encompassed by the WCA, and not whether the individual plaintiffs particularized circumstances foreclosed compensability. As applied here, Employers reason that, although Plaintiffs\u2019 disease first manifested beyond the 300-week period, their condition fell within the WCA\u2019s ambit \u2014 i.e., was covered by the WCA \u2014 and hence, Section 303(a) exclusivity applies notwithstanding non-compensability. See generally Brief for Chemetron at 26 (citing Kline v. Arden H. Vemer Co., 503 Pa. 251, 255, 469 A.2d 158, 160 (1983) (suggesting that the WCA has \u201cimmunized some [employers] to make possible resources to benefit many, who [were] heretofore without possible or practical remedies\u201d)).\nAs for Plaintiffs\u2019 argument pertaining to the WCA\u2019s embodiment of a quid pro quo, Employers offer that the central quid pro quo transcends individual cases and pertains to employees and employers as a class who give up certain rights in exchange for others. Employers maintain that the balancing of these rights was performed by the Legislature and that Plaintiffs\u2019 disagreement is with that body. Oglebay also implies that the harshness of particular outcomes ensuing from this legislative compromise is mitigated because workers who develop long-latency asbestos diseases may seek redress from non-employer defendants. It avers that, here, Plaintiffs filed actions against numerous entities, and that the Tooey plaintiffs in particular have already obtained settlements from several of them, as reflected in the Supplemental Reproduced Record. Oglebay asserts, in this regard, that individuals who develop asbestos-related cancers may avail themselves of claims procedures with various bankruptcy trusts established to compensate individuals exposed to the asbestos-containing products of now-insolvent companies.\nAs noted, Chemetron initially suggests that the dispute can be resolved solely by reference to Section 303(a) in view of its disjunctive phraseology and its reference to Section 108. That provision states, in full:\nThe liability of an employer under this act shall be exclusive and in place of any and all other liability to such employe[e], his legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin or anyone otherwise entitled to damages in any action at law or otherwise on account of any injury or death as defined in section 301(c)(1) and (2) [77 P.S. \u00a7 411(c)(1) and (2) ] or occupational disease as defined in section 108 [77 P.S. \u00a7 27.1].\n77 P.S. \u00a7 481(a) (emphasis added). The above represents a forceful statement by the Legislature that it intends for both injuries and occupational diseases to be treated uniformly under the act and, more particularly (in my view, at least), to be covered by the remedies prescribed thereunder to the exclusion of common-law remedies. Thus, Employers understandably seek to rely on its language as a shield against common law suits without reference to other provisions. Still, Sections 303(a) and 108 are part of the WCA\u2019s overall scheme pertaining to liability for occupational diseases. That scheme also subsumes Section 301(c)(2), which makes the diseases enumerated in Section 108 compensable by classifying them as injuries (thus triggering potential liability under Section 301(a)), see generally Brockway Pressed Metals v. WCAB (Holben), 948 A.2d 232, 234 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008), and additionally contains the specific 300-week limitation at issue here. Therefore, the analysis would be incomplete if Sections 303(a) and 108 were viewed in isolation. Rather, this Court should also evaluate whether the General Assembly intended that occupational diseases manifesting more than 300 weeks after the last employment-based exposure to the hazard should be subject to WCA remedy exclusivity even where benefits are unavailable. See generally Allstate Life Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth, 617 Pa. 1, 6-8, 52 A.3d 1077,1080-81 (2012) (Opinion in Support of Affirmance) (observing that statutes or parts of statutes in pari materia should be construed together, with the court giving effect to each provision, if possible (citing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1921(a), 1932)).\nAs recited by the majority, the parties\u2019 first point of contention centers on whether the pronoun \u201cit\u201d in the phrase \u201cit shall apply\u201d refers back to \u201cact\u201d or \u201ccompensation.\u201d Plaintiffs claim that \u201cit\u201d refers to \u201cact,\u201d so that late-manifesting occupational diseases are entirely removed from the scope of coverage under the WCA, with the result that the enactment\u2019s exclusivity clause has no present application. However, the proviso\u2019s most natural reading is that \u201cunder this act\u201d simply modifies \u201cdisability or death,\u201d and not that it was intended to provide the predicate for the following pronoun. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a) (directing that words and phrases should ordinarily be interpreted according to rules of grammar and their common and approved usage). Similarly, the grammatical structure of the proviso, including its placement of commas, militates against Plaintiffs\u2019 reading. See generally United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 241-42,109 S.Ct. 1026, 1030-31, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989) (deeming comma placement significant in arriving at a statute\u2019s plain meaning). In particular, the phrase, \u201cfor disability or death under this act,\u201d is set off from the main flow of the sentence by a pair of commas. This indicates that it is a \u201cnonrestrictive\u201d clause containing explanatory or descriptive information that is parenthetical in nature. See Cash Am., 607 Pa. at 450-51 & n. 4, 8 A.3d at 293 & n. 4. As such, the commas could be replaced with parentheses without changing the sentence\u2019s essential meaning. See id. at 446^17, 8 A.3d at 291; In re Gallagher, 332 Or. 173, 26 P.3d 131, 136-37 (2001) (citing Chicago Manual of Style \u00a7 5.41, at 167-68 (14th ed. 1993), and William Strunk, Jr. & E.B. White, The Elements of Style, 3-4 (3d ed. 1979)). Hence, the pronoun \u201cit\u201d must refer back to a noun appearing in the sentence prior to the nonrestrictive clause. The only such noun that could reasonably serve as the pronoun\u2019s antecedent is \u201ccompensation.\u201d It follows that the proviso states, in effect, that \u201cwhenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation (for disability or death under this act) [compensation] shall apply only to disability or death\u201d occurring within the 300-week period. This understanding is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s stated intention that the act should \u201capply to all injuries occurring within this Commonwealth,\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 1 (emphasis added), a point the majority overlooks.\nI would conclude, then, that the plain meaning of the proviso is more limited than Plaintiffs contend and the majority concludes: in my view, it states that compensation is unavailable for late-manifesting occupational diseases, but it does not state that the WCA has no application with regard to such diseases. Further, the parties, as noted, agree that Plaintiffs\u2019 illnesses fall within the definition of a covered occupational disease for purposes of the act, and Plaintiffs do not suggest any other, independent, aspect of the statute as a basis to conclude that employer liability for their illnesses is not governed by the WCA. See generally 77 P.S. \u00a7 431 (making employers liable for all work-related injuries with certain exceptions not presently relevant). Still, Plaintiffs assert that their inability to obtain compensation due to the expiration of the 300-week time interval affects Section 303(a)\u2019s command that the liability of an employer under the WCA is \u201cexclusive and in place of any and all other liability[.]\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 481(a). Referencing Pollard and Stratemeyer, they maintain that the presence or absence of actual compensation is the litmus for whether remedy exclusivity applies. See Appellants\u2019 Brief at 22, 24. For the following reasons, I disagree.\nWorkers\u2019 compensation is social legislation. Thus, the issue forwarded here touches on social policy which, of course, is the primary domain of the Legislature. The advent of workers\u2019 compensation laws in the early twentieth century accomplished two things broadly described in terms of a compromise between the interests of employers and employees. It gave employees compensation based solely on a loss of earning power, and it immunized employers from large and unexpected costs they might incur through the tort system. See Shick v. Shirey, 552 Pa. 590, 603, 716 A.2d 1231, 1237 (1998) (describing this compromise). This system provided employers better means of predicting the costs of doing business, while workers also gained in the aggregate because, under the old common law system, most injuries remained uncompensated notwithstanding the presence, in many cases, of employer negligence or adverse workplace conditions. See Exceptions to the Exclusive Remedy Requirements of Workers\u2019 Compensation Statutes, 96 Harv. L. Rev. 1641, 1641 n.2 (1983) (citing W. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts \u00a7 80, at 526,530 & n.32 (4th ed. 1971) (70% to 94% uncompensated), and Compendium on Workmen\u2019s Compensation 11 (Nat\u2019l Comm\u2019n on State Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws ed. 1973) (workers recovered for 15% of injuries, although 70% involved employer negligence or workplace conditions)). Such a system inevitably contained limitations on compensation, both in the form of time restrictions (due to its essentially administrative nature) and in terms of substantive limitations on liability. This was necessary in order that the administrative scheme could function with some regularity and so that the aggregate of payouts could remain practically affordable.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 argument \u2014 that, since the act is designed to provide reasonable indemnity to employees who sustain work-related injuries, when such indemnity is lacking employees should have access to the courts as a forum to obtain a remedy \u2014 has some logical force. The main difficulty, however, when the broad policy goals are considered, is that such a result would expose employers to potentially unlimited liability for occupational diseases, an exposure that could undermine the compromise of interests described above. In this regard, one of our federal colleagues has aptly stated that, through the WCA, the Legislature has created a \u201ccomprehensive statutory scheme encompassing all injuries arising out of accidents occurring within the course of employment.\u201d Hartwell v. Allied Chem. Corp., 320 F.Supp. 75, 77 (W.D.Pa.1970).\nSupporting Hartwell\u2019s observation is that the legislative trend in the workers\u2019 compensation arena has consistently been to expand the WCA\u2019s reach to ever greater classes of injury. For example, while the legislation originally covered only accidents, it was later amended to bring non-accidental injuries within its scope. Further, the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d was eventually changed from \u201cviolence to the physical structure of the body\u201d to any work-related \u201cinjury to an employe, regardless of his previous physical condition[.]\u201d Act of March 29, 1972, P.L. 159, No. 61, \u00a7 7 (amending Section 301(c)). Thereafter, occupational diseases were brought within the ambit of the WCA. See Act of Oct. 17,1972, P.L. 930, No. 223, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 (adding Section 108 and 301(c)(2)). As well, the Legislature eventually changed the nature of the scheme from an elective system to a mandatory one. See Act of Dec. 5, 1974, P.L. 782, No. 263; Bible v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 548 Pa. 247, 254-56, 696 A.2d 1149, 1152-53 (1997); Lewis v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., 517 Pa. 461, 471-72, 538 A.2d 862, 867 (1988). Hence, the legislative motivation and movement has been to steadily broaden the act\u2019s coverage while foreclosing recourse against the employer in tort for negligence. See Tsarnas v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 488 Pa. 513, 519-20, 412 A.2d 1094, 1097 (1980). At the same time, the General Assembly has designated the WCA as the \u201csole and exclusive\u201d means of recovery against employers for all workplace injuries. Hackenberg v. SEPTA, 526 Pa. 358, 370, 586 A.2d 879, 885 (1991); see 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 481(a). See generally Pawlosky v. WCAB (Latrobe Brewing Co.), 514 Pa. 450, 461, 525 A.2d 1204, 1210 (1987) (\u201c[T]he legislature, by including occupational diseases in the Act\u2019s concept of \u2018injury,\u2019 was attempting to create a unified, integrated compensation law for all work-related harm.... \u201d).\nWithin this historical development, moreover, the General Assembly\u2019s particular treatment of occupational diseases is also germane. The Assembly was initially disinclined to provide no-fault compensation for disease victims and, indeed, it waited twenty-two years after the enabling constitutional amendment was ratified to bring such work-related illnesses within the act\u2019s scope. There were various reasons for this delay, including problems of proof in difficult etiological contexts, see Sporio, 553 Pa. at 50, 717 A.2d at 528 (expressing that the disease manifestation requirement serves, inter alia, to \u201cprevent speculation over whether a disease is work-related years after an exposure occurred\u201d), and a \u201cfear that the compensation system could not bear the financial impact of full liability for dust diseases.\u201d 3 Arthur Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 41.81 (1983). Thus, when the General Assembly ultimately incorporated diseases into the system, it was careful to cabin employers\u2019 liability using devices such as defined manifestation periods. See Act of July 2, 1937, P.L. 2714, No. 552, \u00a7 6(b) (repealed) (reflecting a two-year period); Act of June 21, 1939, P.L. 566, No. 284, \u00a7 301(c) (reflecting a four-year period under the ODA).\nThese limitations appear to represent an exercise in legislative line-drawing stemming from a generalized aversion toward holding employers liable to all disease victims under a strict-liability scheme. Accord David B. Torrey, Time Limitations in Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation and Occupational Disease Acts: Theoretical Doctrine and Current Applications, 24 Duq. L. Rev. 975, 1013 (1986) (hereinafter, \u201cTime Limitations \u201d). More to the point, they do not reflect an intent that, if the disease occurs outside the defined time period, the employee should remain free to prosecute a lawsuit in tort. Rather, the legislative sense has been that, if latent diseases are to be compensable on an absolute-liability basis, businesses and insurers at least need to be able to make rough predictions concerning the cost of coverage, which would be significantly more difficult absent some time-based prerequisite to compensability for diseases that may occur years after employment has ended. See Bond & Silver, Workers\u2019 Compensation,[:] Employers and Insurers Present Their Side of the Case, Penna. L.J. Rptr., Aug. 5, 1985, at 8 (\u201cAlthough we are not aware of the legislative intent behind the [300-week] time requirement, it seems to be [an] example of legislative line-drawing intended to afford employers and insurers reasonable limits on their exposure under the act.\u201d), quoted in Time Limitations, 24 Duq. L. Rev. at 1015 n.196. In light of these considerations, to conclude, as Plaintiffs urge, that the absence of compensability was intended by the Legislature to alone negate remedy exclusivity, would be inconsistent, not only with the Legislature\u2019s expressed intent that the act apply to \u201call injuries\u201d occurring within Pennsylvania, but with its motivation for imposing time limitations on disease compensability. All of this militates against a litmus based solely on the availability of compensation under the circumstances.\nNor does Plaintiffs\u2019 position find support in our case precedent. To the contrary, where an injury is of a class that is cognizable under the WCA, this Court has virtually always construed the enactment to foreclose an action at law even if compensation is ultimately unobtainable. In Kline v. Arden H. Verner Co., 503 Pa. 251, 469 A.2d 158 (1983), for example, the Court affirmed remedy exclusivity although the worker could not receive compensation for some of the injuries he sustained in a work-related accident. Kline explained that the act\u2019s remedies are exclusive even where compensation is unavailable, because the WCA by its terms \u201ccovers \u2018all injuries, \u2019 and the exclusivity clause bars tort actions flowing from any work-related injury.\u201d Id. at 256, 469 A.2d at 160 (emphasis in original); see also Scott v. C.E. Powell Coal Co., 402 Pa. 73, 77-78, 166 A.2d 31, 34 (1960) (explaining that, when an employee sustains injuries that bring him within the provisions of the WCA, such provisions determine the amount he may be compensated and, as such, provide the exclusive remedy even if no compensation is available); Moffett v. Harbison-Walker Refractories Co., 339 Pa. 112, 117, 14 A.2d 111, 113-14 (1940) (enforcing remedy exclusivity relative to a plaintiff who suffered a disability due to work-related silicosis but was unable to obtain any compensation because his disability was only partial; the Court reasoned that the Legislature\u2019s provision of benefits for total silicosis disability manifested an intent to bring all silicosis sufferers under the act). See generally 7 David B. Torrey & Andrew E. Greenberg, Pennsylvania Workers\u2019 Compensation Law & Practice \u00a7 10.15 (3d ed. 2011) (\u201cIt is ... the rule under the [WCA] that a common law action is barred even if there is no specific recovery available under the [WCA].\u201d).\nConversely, where courts have permitted an action at law for a work-related disease, the illness in question was of a type that was totally excluded from the definition of a compensable injury. Thus, in Billo v. Allegheny Steel Co., 328 Pa. 97, 195 A. 110 (1937), the plaintiffs lawsuit was permitted because no occupational diseases had yet been brought within the scope of the act, see id. at 99-100, 195 A. at 112, and indeed, Moffett expressly distinguished Billo on that basis. See Moffett, 339 Pa. at 117, 14 A.2d at 114. The reasoning of Pollard\u2019s Opinion in Support of Affirmance is similar. Although that opinion, at one point, appears to predicate the existence of a common law claim on the lack of \u201ccompensability],\u201d see Pollard, 548 Pa. at 129, 695 A.2d at 769, the use of the term is imprecise in context because the focus of the opinion is on whether the injury itself is covered under the WCA, and not on whether compensation is or is not barred by some other feature of the statute. See also Perez v. Blumenthal Bros. Chocolate Co., 428 Pa. 225, 227-28, 237 A.2d 227, 229 (1968) (permitting a common law trespass action to proceed because the plaintiffs illness fell outside the scope of defined occupational diseases under the ODA); cf. Martin v. Lancaster Battery Co., 530 Pa. 11, 17, 606 A.2d 444, 447 (1992) (allowing a suit for fraudulent misrepresentation where the employee was \u201cnot seeking compensation for the work-related injury itself\u2019); Urban v. Dollar Bank, 725 A.2d 815, 820 (Pa.Super.1999) (permitting a defamation suit against the plaintiffs employer upon finding that harm to reputation is not a covered injury under the act). Finally, the Stratemeyer case from Montana is to the same effect: because \u201cmental-mental\u201d injuries were categorically excluded from coverage under that state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation act, an action at law could be maintained. See Stratemeyer, 915 P.2d at 180.\nThus, there is a qualitative difference between coverage and compensability under the WCA. Accord Hartwell, 320 F.Supp. at 77; cf. Weldon v. Celotex Corp., 695 F.2d 67, 72 (3d Cir.1982) (distinguishing coverage from compensability in interpreting the similar manifestation period under the ODA). I would therefore reject Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that compensability is the sole appropriate litmus for ascertaining whether the act\u2019s remedial provisions are \u201cexclusive and in place of any and all other\u201d avenues of relief. 77 P.S. \u00a7 481(a). In my analysis, Section 301(c)(2) is limited to specifying that compensation is unavailable for diseases manifesting beyond the 300-week time window; hence, it functions only as a temporal limitation on the availability of compensation as part of the overall legislative scheme, and not as a means to exclude from \u201ccoverage\u201d under the act all diseases enumerated in Section 108 that manifest in a delayed timeframe. It functions, in other words, as a statute of repose in that it obviates potential liability after a defined amount of time has elapsed. See Abrams v. Pneumo Abex Corp., 602 Pa. 627, 649 n. 10, 981 A.2d 198, 212 n. 10 (2009) (in dicta, describing Section 301(c)(2) as a statute of repose); 8 David B. Torrey & Andrew E. Greenberg, Pennsylvania Workers\u2019 Compensation Law & Practice \u00a7 14.10 (3d ed. 2011) (expressing that Section 301(c)(2)\u2019s time limitation constitutes a \u201csubstantive prerequisite to ascertainment of the compensability,\u201d intended to \u201cestablish, via arbitrary time basis, some outside limit to govern the potential liability of the employer\u201d). Accordingly, I would hold that the 300-week limitation in Section 301(c)(2) has no effect on whether a worker\u2019s occupational disease comes within the WCA\u2019s coverage. As such, the exclusivity mandate appearing in Section 303(a) of the statute applies, in my view, to preclude Plaintiffs from maintaining a negligence-based lawsuit against Employers.\nAs I would conclude that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides the exclusive remedy for Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries although compensation is unavailable, I would find that the constitutional issues raised by Plaintiffs are salient. These issues pertain to whether the time-based limitation under review violates the Reasonable Compensation Clause of Article III, Section 18 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, the Remedies Clause contained in Article I, Section 11 of the state charter, or the federal Equal Protection Clause or Due Process Clause. Plaintiffs have provided substantive advocacy on these constitutional questions, to which Employers have responded on the merits.\nEmployers additionally state that Plaintiffs did not give notice to the Pennsylvania Attorney General of their challenge to the constitutionality of the WCA in the common pleas court in compliance with civil procedural rule 235. They also allege that Plaintiffs failed to provide the Attorney General with similar notification at the appellate level and a copy of their appellate briefs as required by our appellate rules. See Pa.R.A.P. 521(a). They indicate that, where a party fails to notify the Attorney General that the constitutionality of a statute is being attacked, the issue is deemed waived. See Kepple v. Fairman Drilling Co., 532 Pa. 304, 313, 615 A.2d 1298, 1303 (1992).\nIn reply, Plaintiffs maintain that they \u201cdid indeed serve notice of their challenge to the constitutionality of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act,\u201d and reference portions of the common pleas docket sheets reflecting that \u201cPlaintiffs have served their Challenge to the Constitutionality of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Reply Brief at 10 (citing RR. 12a (Tooey), 107a-108a (Landis)). In the alternative, Plaintiffs proffer that notice to the Attorney General is unnecessary because the constitutionality of the WCA is being \u201cvigorously defended\u201d by powerful corporations. Appellants\u2019 Reply Brief at 12. Finally, Plaintiffs advocate that notice to the Attorney General is not required because their constitutional challenges are as-applied, rather than facial. They argue that this distinction is sensible because successful facial challenges invalidate the statute entirely, whereas successful as-applied challenges only prevent application of the statute under the factual circumstances before the court. See id. at 11.\nThe Pennsylvania Attorney General is the Commonwealth official statutorily charged with defending the constitutionality of all enactments passed by the Pennsylvania General Assembly. See City of Phila. v. Commonwealth, 575 Pa. 542, 570, 838 A.2d 566, 583 (2003) (citing 71 P.S. \u00a7 732-204(a)(3) (\u201cIt shall be the duty of the Attorney General to uphold and defend the constitutionality of all statutes.... \u201d)). As such, when a constitutional attack upon an act of the Assembly is lodged, \u201cthe Attorney General stands in a representative capacity for, at a minimum, all non-Commonwealth parties having an interest in seeing the statute upheld.\u201d Id. at 570-71, 838 A.2d at 584. Moreover, the Attorney General may wish to seek further review on behalf of the Commonwealth of an adverse decision on the constitutional question. See Pa. R.A.P. 521(b) & Note. Therefore, where (as here) the Commonwealth is not a party to the proceedings, the party challenging the validity of a statute is required,\nupon the filing of the record, or as soon thereafter as the question is raised in the appellate court, to give immediate notice in writing to the Attorney General of Pennsylvania of the existence of the question; together with a copy of the pleadings or other portion of the record raising the issue, and to file proof of service of such notice.\nPa.R.A.P. 521(a). See generally Md. Cas. Co. v. Odyssey Contracting Corp., 894 A.2d 750, 755-56 (Pa.Super.2006) (recognizing that the Rule 521(a) notification requirement is separate from, and in addition to, the counterpart requirement under civil procedural rule 235).\nUnder prevailing precedent, a threshold question is whether Plaintiffs allege a facial, or as-applied, challenge to the constitutionality of the provision under review. This is because, as Plaintiffs observe, Kepple indicated that an as-applied challenge does not implicate civil rule 235 or appellate rule 521(a). See Kepple, 532 Pa. at 313 n. 3, 615 A.2d at 1303 n. 3. However, the policy rationale underlying Rule 521 is implicated where a meritorious as-applied challenge would invalidate a statute as to an entire class of parties who are not before the Court. Indeed, the term \u201cas applied\u201d is susceptible of different meanings and, moreover, a reviewing court may declare a statute facially unconstitutional when adjudicating an as-applied challenge. Thus, I would find Kepple\u2019s simple dichotomy (for which the Court cited no authority) insufficient to provide meaningful guidance as to whether the Attorney General must be given an opportunity to participate. As such, excepting from the scope of Rule 521(a) all challenges that can, in some sense, be labeled \u201cas applied\u201d \u2014 an exception that, in any event, does not appear in the Rule\u2019s text \u2014 may leave the Attorney General without notice in some instances where she should be given an opportunity to participate.\nThese appeals present such a case. Plaintiffs are seeking to maintain an action at law, and they propose that the exclusive-remedy command of Section 303(a) may not constitutionally be applied to them. Their challenge, in that limited sense, is as-applied. However, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument focuses on whether Section 303(a)\u2019s exclusivity clause can constitutionally be enforced in conjunction with Section 301(c)(2) under any circumstances, not just their own. See Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Brief at 12. Indeed, Plaintiffs do not purport to rely on any facet of their circumstances that would differentiate them from any other worker whose occupational disease occurs beyond the 300-week period, nor do they assert that such proviso, in conjunction with remedy exclusivity, can potentially be applied to other workers under different circumstances. See generally Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 331, 130 S.Ct. 876, 893, 175 L.Ed.2d 753 (2010) (discounting any \u201cas-applied\u201d label since the constitutional claims at issue would, if meritorious, invalidate the challenged statute as to all corporations); id. at 375-76, 130 S.Ct. 876, 919 (Roberts, C.J., concurring). Thus, while the challenge here may nominally be as-applied, it has many of the incidents of a facial challenge. See Richmond Med. Ctr. For Women v. Herring, 570 F.3d 165, 172 (4th Cir.2009) (noting that facial challenges allow courts to \u201cefficiently address [the] constitutional concerns of a large group without engaging in the long and unwieldy process of case-by-case analyses\u201d). Under these circumstances, where the constitutional validity of enforcing an act of the General Assembly vis-\u00e1-vis a large class of potential litigants is being challenged, I would conclude that the Attorney General should be given an opportunity to participate in conformance with Rule 521(a).\nHere, Plaintiffs do not specifically allege that they provided notice to the Attorney General. See supra note 17. Further, the docket sheets from this Court and the Superior Court do not contain entries to that effect, nor is there any indication in the record of an appellate-level notification. Finally, as Plaintiffs have not sought to augment the record with such proof, there is no basis to believe that Plaintiffs satisfied their obligations under Rule 521(a).\nRegarding issue preservation, it is true, as Employers contend, that Kepple reflects a holding of this Court that failure to notify the Attorney General as required ordinarily results in waiver. See Kepple, 532 Pa. at 313, 615 A.2d at 1303; see also In re Adoption of Christopher P., 480 Pa. 79, 90, 389 A.2d 94, 100 (1978) (finding constitutional issues waived where the challenger failed to notify the Attorney General and also failed to raise the issues in the orphan\u2019s court). However, I would find it unduly harsh to dismiss Appellant\u2019s constitutional claims as waived in the present context. Plaintiffs were entitled to rely on Kepple\u2019s statement that waiver is only triggered for facial challenges and, in a limited sense at least (as explained above), the present challenge may be termed as-applied. Thus, I would not dismiss such claims as waived. At the same time, I would not overlook the requirements of our appellate rules.\nFor the reasons given above, I would hold that Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries are covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, but that compensation is unavailable. Additionally, I would retain jurisdiction and direct that Plaintiffs give immediate written notice to the Attorney General concerning the constitutional issues raised by such a holding, in conformance with appellate rule 521(a). Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to reverse the Superior Court\u2019s order and remand to the common pleas court for further proceedings.\n. Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736 (as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-1041.1; 2501-2626).\n. The parties agree that Employees\u2019 injuries fall within the Section 108(Z) definition of \"occupational disease.\u201d See 77 P.S. \u00a7 27.1(Z) (defining the term to include \u201c[a]sbestosis and cancer resulting from direct contact with, handling of, or exposure to the dust of asbestos in any occupation involving such contact, handling or exposure\u201d).\n.

The ODA contains an exclusivity provision that this Court has described as \"very similar\" to that of the WCA. Barber v. Pittsburgh Corning Corp., 521 Pa. 29, 34, 555 A.2d 766, 769 (1989). Compare 77 P.S. \u00a7 1403 (ODA's exclusivity clause), with 77 P.S. \u00a7 481, Historical and Statutory Notes (reflecting the WCA\u2019s exclusivity clause as it existed prior to a 1974 amendment).\n. Chemetron and the ESAB Group, the employer parties in the Landis litigation, have filed one brief, and Oglebay Norton Company, the employer party in the Tooey case, has filed a separate brief individually and on behalf of its Ferro Engineering division.

Celotex Corp., 695 F.2d 67, 71 (3d Cir.1982) (applying similar reasoning within the framework of the ODA); Kilvady v. U.S. FSteel Corp., 90 Pa.Cmwlth. 586, 592, 496 A.2d 116, 120 (1985) (same).F\n. Although Section 301(c)(2) references the employee\u2019s \"last date of employment,\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2), this Court has stated that the 300-week period begins on the last day of employment-based exposure to the hazard.

Any distinction along these lines is immaterial to the resolution of these appeals, however, since Employees\u2019 mesothelioma manifested more than 300 weeks after both occurrences.\n. Because the current version of Section 301(c)(2) was finally enacted after December 31, 1964, its punctuation may be considered. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1923(b); Cash Am. Net of Nevada, LLC v.

The majority suggests that \"it\u201d may refer to the word \u201cact\u201d in the phrase \"as used in this act,\u201d which appears in a sentence extrinsic to the proviso. See Majority Opinion, at 73 n.3, 81 A.3d at 859 n.3. To my mind, such a reading seems overly attenuated.\n. In criticizing this observation, the majority appears to view the act as designed solely for the benefit of injured workers. See Majority Opinion, at 80-82, 81 A.3d at 864-65. That is indeed one of the central aims of the statute. However, the broader historical context, including the essential underlying compromise, is also relevant to ascertaining legislative intent.\n. See also Time Limitations, 24 Duq. L. Rev. at 1015 (\"The disease manifestation provisions [of the WCA and ODA] are unique creatures of the statutory scheme ... reflecting ... the simple legislative judgment that employers are to be relieved of at least some of the liability which might possibly accrue, by means of an arbitrary time limit on the manifestation of disability-causing diseases.\u201d); id. at 979 (\"Having sacrificed its common law defenses, the employer faces increased and almost certain liabilities; it is thus reasonable that at least the time frame within which such liability may accrue is established clearly.\u201d); cf. 3 Arthur Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 53.03 (criticizing such substantive limitations on compensability as leading to inequities for workers suffering from long-latency occupational diseases, including asbestos-related ailments).\n. To the degree the majority suggests that the long latency period associated with mesothelioma \"operates as a de facto exclusion of coverage under the Act for essentially all mesothelioma claims,\u201d Majority Opinion, at 80, 81 A.3d at 863, the majority is mistaken. The latency period is measured from the first exposure, see, e.g., Jones v. United States, 751 F.Supp.2d 835, 840-41 (E.D.N.C.2010) (referencing the definition of \"latency period\u201d provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), whereas the 300-week statutory interval is measured from the last exposure. See supra note 6. This distinction is significant for persons who have had a long occupational history of exposure. The majority responds by pointing out that many workers may fall outside such a group. See Majority Opinion, at 79-80 n.5, 81 A.3d at 863-64 n.5. Indeed, the rights of some workers will undoubtedly be negatively affected by legislative line drawing. However, legislation by its nature involves line-drawing and classifications. Accord Ryan v. Burlington County, 889 F.2d 1286, 1291 (3d Cir.1989). Our initial task exclusive of Appellants\u2019 separate constitutional claims, is not to judge the wisdom of specific lines the Legislature has chosen to draw, but to endeavor to ascertain that body's intention at the time it drew them. Here, I see no reason to suppose that the General Assembly, when it brought diseases within the scope of the Act beginning in 1937 or moved from an elective to a mandatory scheme in 1974, meant to leave employers open to suit in the event the disease in question would manifest beyond the period of repose. Indeed, the decisions this Court rendered in the era when diseases were incorporated point in the opposite direction \u2014 namely, that if a particular type of work-related injury is covered by the Act, the lack of compensability under the circumstances does not render the employer liable to common-law tort liability \u2014 and the majority\u2019s protestation that it is \"inconceivable\u201d that the Legislature would have intended such a result, Majority Opinion, at 79, 81 A.3d at 863, is difficult to reconcile with such cases, which are briefly discussed below. Finally, to the extent the majority suggests Bowman v. Sunoco, Inc., 620 Pa. 28, 65 A.3d 901 (2013), prohibits such a result based on public policy, the majority misapplies Bowman. The policy referenced in that case relates to preventing an employer, through an exercise of bargaining power, from requiring an employee to relinquish his rights under the Act in the pre-injury timeframe. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 71(a). That situation is materially different from discerning legislative policy in enacting a statute of repose.\n. I am not convinced by the majority's attempt to distinguish Moffett on the grounds that it was decided at a time when participation in the workers' compensation system was elective. See Majority Opinion, at 79, 81 A.3d at 863. The central point made in Moffett was that, as a matter of statutory interpretation in light of the history of Pennsylvania's workers' compensation legislation, once the Legislature decided to bring a certain occupational disease within the scope of the act\u2019s coverage, the statutory remedies were intended to be exclusive even where the act made compensation unavailable under the circumstances. See Moffett, 339 Pa. at 116, 14 A.2d at 113 (recognizing that there are various types of limitations on compensability under the WCA, but that none of them have been construed as permitting a common-law remedy so long as the WCA covers injuries stemming from the disease in question). Although potential constitutional difficulties are perhaps more pronounced in a non-elective scheme, it would be a misreading of Moffett to suggest that the holding in that matter rested on the availability of an opt-out provision for employees.\n. This understanding is confirmed because that portion of the opinion relies on Boniecke v. McGraw-Edison Co., 485 Pa. 163, 401 A.2d 345 (1979), where this Court stated, centrally, that claims may be asserted in the common pleas court only if they are based on \"diseases not covered by\u201d the WCA and ODA, id. at 167, 401 A.2d at 346, and thus, the crucial issue was whether the plaintiff\u2019s illnesses were defined as occupational diseases by those statutes. See generally Sedlacek v. A.O. Smith Corp., 990 A.2d 801, 807-08 (Pa.Super.) (observing that this Court has sometimes been imprecise in its terminology by using terms such as coverage, cognizability, recovery, and relief interchangeably), alloc, denied, 607 Pa. 706, 4 A.3d 1055 (2010).\n. The Third Circuit explained its reasoning as follows:\nSince it is coverage that takes away employees\u2019 rights under the common law, the employer\u2019s immunity from tort liability continues even though the limitations period in the [ODA] bars compensation for the employee.... Although that result is harsh, arbitrariness is a necessaiy result of any period of limitations, and no system of compensation yet devised avoids all inequities.\nCelotex, 695 F.2d at 72 (emphasis added).\n. I pause to emphasize that I am not without sympathy for workers who suffer from diseases that manifest beyond the time period permitted for compensation under Section 301(c)(2), and am cognizant of the harshness of the result that would ensue in such cases under my present interpretation. However, I am constrained by what I believe to be the legislative policy and intent underlying the time limitation, and as such, I would affirm the Superior Court\u2019s expression that, absent constitutional infirmity, \u201cremoval or fine-tuning of the statute of repose is for the legislature, not for the courts.\u201d Ranalli v. Rohm & Haas Co., 983 A.2d 732, 735 (Pa.Super.2009). Additionally, I would observe that, in some cases at least, the injured worker will have recourse against other parties besides the employer. See, e.g., Supplemental Reproduced Record of Oglebay (reflecting that the Tooey plaintiffs have reached settlements with several defendant corporations).\n. This aspect of Plaintiffs\u2019 representation appears somewhat evasive, as Plaintiffs do not state that they served notice on the Attorney General. Plaintiffs also attach to their reply brief two documents purporting to be such notices at the common pleas level, one for the Tooey plaintiffs and the other for the Landis plaintiffs. Each contains a single sentence, stating: \"Notice is hereby given that on May 13, 2008, the Plaintiffs have served their Challenge to the Constitutionality of the Workersf] Compensation Act.\u201d The documents do not specify who received service of the challenge. The common pleas docket entries are similar.\nIn denying an allegation with waiver implications predicated on an alleged lack of notice to the Attorney General, an express indication concerning who received the notices in question seems indispensable. That Plaintiffs fail to give this Court any such indication makes their presentation appear less than forthright.\n. See, e.g., Sonnier v. Crain, 613 F.3d 436, 458 (5th Cir.2010) (Dennis, J., dissenting) (\"[FJacial and as-applied challenges are not categorically different types of cases to which different rules of decision apply[; o]n the contrary, in order to adjudicate constitutional challenges, courts apply whatever constitutional doctrines and tests are relevant to the substance of each particular case, and the results of that analysis determine whether a challenged law is unconstitutional, either on its face or as applied to a particular situation.\"), majority op. withdrawn in part on reh'g, 634 F.3d 778 (5th Cir.2011); Richard H. Fallon, Jr., As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L. Rev. 1321, 1336 (2000) (indicating that it is misleading to suggest that there is a sharp, categorical distinction between facial and as-applied adjudications).\n. It may be true, as Plaintiffs suggest, that various parties involved in this litigation are interested in seeing the statute upheld. Still, I disagree with Plaintiffs' suggestion that this Court\u2019s waiver analysis should consider whether those parties are powerful corporations who defend the enactment vigorously. Such considerations would require the Court to inquire into the financial strength of the parties before it and make an assessment as to whether their advocacy was sufficiently forceful that the Attorney General's input would be superfluous \u2014 a standard that would be unworkable in practice.",
