L. 525, is final and conclusive, and it is error thereafter to appoint a jury of review.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Williams, Mc-Collum and Mitchell, JJ.\nNo. 271 October Term 1889, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 15 September Term 1888, Q.

The act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 525, makes no provision for the appointment of reviewers.\n2. Under said act, the court alone, \u201c on the hearing of such parties as choose to contest the same,\u201d has the exclusive power to review, \u201c modify, approve and confirm \u201d the report of the viewers, and no authority is vested in the court either to appoint reviewers, or to consider and dispose of their report.\n\u2014Said exceptions having been argued, the court on June 1, 1889, filed an order vacating the order of March 2, 1889, appointing reviewers, and dismissing the petition of Mary Rogers therefor.\nAn order having been entered on October 12, 1889, confirming the report of the viewers, Mary Rogers took this appeal, assigning the order of June 1st, for error.\nMr. James Fitzsimmons (with him Mr. John S. Fobb'), for the \u2018 appellant.\nCounsel cited: Street v. Commonwealth, 6 W. & S. 209; Cohen v. Commonwealth, 6 Pa. Ill; Commonwealth v.
