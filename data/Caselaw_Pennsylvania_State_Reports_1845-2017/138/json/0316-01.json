    "head_matter": "PETITION OF WM. WOLFF, FOR LICENSE.\nAPPEAL BY PETITIONER FROM THE COURT OE QUARTER SESSIONS OE ALLEGHENY COUNTY.\nArgued October 29, 1890 \u2014\nDecided November 10, 1890.\nAn order o\u00ed the court below refusing, after hearing held, the appellant\u2019s application for a license to sell liquors at wholesale, under the act of May 24, 1887, P. L. 194, affirmed.\nBefore PaxsoN, C. J., Steeeett, G-reex, Williams, Mc-Collum and Mitchell, JJ.\nNo. 93 October Term 1890, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 597 March Term 1890, Q. S.\nThe paper-books of the appellant, in this case, set out: (1) A copy of the petition of Wm. Wolff, filed on February 5,1890, praying the court below to grant him a license, under the act of May 24, 1887, P. L. 194, to sell vinous, spirituous, malt or brewed liquors, in quantities of not less than one quart; (2) a copy of the bond of the petitioner filed in said application; (3) a \u201c History of the Case,\u201d embracing copies of Buies 6, 7, adopted January 2,1888, (see Pollard\u2019s Pet., 127 Pa. 508), and copies of the act of April 3,1872, P. L. 843, and of the act of May 24, 1887, P. L. 194. No opinion, order or decree of the court, however, was presented otherwise than in the \u201c Docket Entry \u201d which preceded the foregoing, where it was shown:\n\u201c And now, hearing held April 25,1890, and license refused April 30, 1890.\u201d\nThe petitioner took this appeal, filing the following assignments of error:\n1. The court erred in refusing the application of William Wolff for a wholesale license.\n2. The record showing that no objections were made or remonstrances filed to his application, the court erred in refusing the same.\n3. So far as the record shows, William Wolff was entitled to a license to sell liquors at wholesale, and therefore the judgment of the court in refusing his license was erroneous.\n4. William Wolff, being a citizen of the United States, and there being no intimation that he was either intemperate or of immoral character, the court below had no discretion, but was legally bound to grant him license on the record as it stood.\nMr. John F. Cox, for the appellant.\nNo appearance contra.\nBy the act of March 28, 1889, P. L. 22, it is made the \u201c duty of the State Reporter \u201d to report all the cases decided. For this reason, the dilution of the Reports occasionally cannot be avoided. But such cases are not altogether unprofitable in the preparation of paper-books."
