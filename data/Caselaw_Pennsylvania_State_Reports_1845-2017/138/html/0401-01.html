The term of office of the members of select council shall be two years, and of common council one year, except in cities of the first class. The time and mode of election was not fixed, nor the powers specified. This was left to the acts previously existing which had been preserved by the first section. The organization of councils of the city of Pittsburgh, under this. act, was the same as under the act of 1868, which was in force when the act of 1874 was adopted. It so continued until the passage of the act of June 14, 1887, P. L. 395. That act. provides that the legislative powers of cities of the second class shall be vested “ as heretofore ” in two branches, etc., reducing the number of members of select councils to one for each ward, to serve for four years instead of two. It mates no change in the representation of common councils, but provides that they shall serve for two years instead of one.</p>

The city of Pittsburgh is a municipal corporation having undoubted legal existence. The councils constitute its government. In them all of its legislative and much of its executive power is placed. A body of men have been organized as constituting this body, and have exercised its functions under the provisions of an act of assembly.

All that can then be said is that the members should have been elected in the mode prescribed by acts of assembly previously existing.

For instance, the clause relating to ferries and bridges does not require that all legislation as to one must include the other.

So, the clause relating to the practice and jurisdiction of courts does not require that the practice and jurisdiction of courts of record, aldermen and justices of the peace shall be identical. They must be uniform in each class. It is equally clear that the clause relating to the affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards, boroughs and school districts, recognizes them as distinct classes.

All that is required is, that laws shall apply to all of such class and relate to affairs of that class, so that we may have one set of laws relating to counties, another to cities, etc. The same rule would therefore apply to- the creation of offices in these several classes of municipal organizations and prescribing their duties.</p>

The words, roads, highways, streets and alleys, do not refer to the same subject matter, and these clauses do not require that the same law shall be applicable to all. It is true that these terms are sometimes used indiscriminately one for the other, but in common acceptation they have clearly defined distinctions. A road is defined to be ground appropriated for traveling, forming a communication between one city, town or place and another; a street, a paved way or road, but in usage any way or road in a city; an alley, a narrow passage or way in a city as distinct from a public street; a highway, a public road. These are the definitions given in Webster, and they are substantially the same as given by other authors. A highway, however, has a broader signification, including all public ways by land or by water, by foot, teams or machinery. Railroads, canals, rivers and bridges are highways as well as ordinary roads. In speaking of roads one might be understood as including streets; Sharett’s Road, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Pa.%2092" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="8 Pa. 92">8 Pa. 92</a>; but, in using the word street or alley, it would not ordinarily be understood as referring to roads.</p>

The proceedings for opening public roads through country districts by petition setting forth the termini only, and leaving to viewers the determination of the route between those points, and the fixing the width by the court, would be clearly insufficient for the location and width of public streets and alleys. And the provisions for maintaining country roads by supervisors who should call upon the citizens to work out their road taxes, would be an inadequate means of maintaining streets in a populous city. The constitution should be construed in recognition of these distinctions, and therefore it must be held to authorize legislation as to the different classes of municipal bodies, and to authorize legislation as to roads and streets, both as to their opening and maintenance. It will be found that the Supreme Court has not restricted but has enlarged this view, by recognizing the right to classify cities and counties for some of these purposes.</p>

They fasten upon such of the citizens of the commonwealth as are owners of property, in a city of the second class, a new, inconvenient, injurious and despotic system for the assessment of damages done by the exercise of the' power of eminent domain, to which citizens in other parts of the state are not subjected.” Thus far, the opinion is in accord with the ruling in Euan St., and would render nugatory all action by this board in assessing damages for property taken, injured or destroyed in opening or grading streets, which matters, however, were not directly involved in these cases. But the case goes further and says: “ They fasten upon lot-holders who are assessed benefits, a new, inconvenient, injurious and despotic system for the assessment of benefits, to which citizens in other portions of the state are not subjected.”</p>

Walter, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20Pa.%20865" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="69 Pa. 865">69 Pa. 865</a>, the power fails ; at least, so far as to the taking of property in the one case and assessments of benefits in the other. The same act gives to councils power to construct sewers whenever they may deem the same necessary, and collect the costs and expenses thereof by assessment upon property benefited, to be made by assessors appointed by councils. This power of assessment was transferred to the board of viewers to be appointed by the Court of Quarter Sessions under the acts of May 13, 1871, P. L. 840 ; March 20, 1873, P. L. 325. This is substantially the same board of viewers, appointed in the same manner, and having the same powers, as the board under the act of 1887. If we are right as to the reasons for holding it to be illegal, they will apply as well to the board under these acts, and it must be held to be illegal.</p>

There would appear to be no objection to assessing the cost of sewers under the act of 1864, unless the ordinance should fall under the prohibition of the act of May 1, 1876, P. L. 94. This is a general act which would not repeal any local laws, unless so expressed or implied. It is not so expressed, but by implication it imposes a condition upon all cities inconsistent with the old laws, at least as to the power to impose the cost upon property owners, and therefore prevents any local assessment of the cost of sewers in the city of Pittsburgh. But the power to <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>grade and paye streets and construct sewers, was given to the city of Pittsburgh by its original charter, the act of March 18, 1816, which conferred upon it the powers of Philadelphia under the act of February 18, 1769, 1 Sm. L. 284, and was expressly given by the act of April 6,1867, known as the Consolidation Act. As to the construction of sewers, it has been held to bo an incidental power of municipal corporations: Fisher v.

At all events, it is not necessary to so decide in this case. The only special interest the plaintiffs have is to protect their property Horn illegal assessments, and they have no equity to require that the whole proceedings should be declared void, especially in view of the fact that large expenditures have been made with the knowledge of plaintiffs. And, besides, to stop the work now, would leave those large improvements unfinished and worse than useless, as they now actually operate as obstructions to passage of the streets and drainage of the neighborhood.

The objection made that the dates in the act render it of local application, is answered by the fact that the- act of May 23, 1874, P.

If the dates are inapplicable to cities coming into that class in the future, the things required can be done nevertheless, or further legislation can be procured. Nor does the act infringe the provisions of § 6, article III. of the constitution. So far as powers and duties of officers, boards and departments, created by ordinance, are transferred to the new officers and departments created by the act, clearly there is no such violation, as an ordinance is not a law within the meaning of the constitutional provision prohibiting the amending, extending or conferring of laws without re-enactment at length. And, in so far as the act transfers powers and duties, conferred by prior statutes, to new officers who are to take the place of others whose offices are abolished, it does not fall within the class of legislation the evil of -which the constitution intended to guard against: People v.

To ascertain the nature and extent of the powers and jurisdiction thus conferred, it is necessary to examine a body of law found in numerous statutes passed during the preceding thirty or forty years. These sections are in flagrant violation of § 6, article III. of the constitution: Donohugh v. Roberts, 11 W. N. 186; Titusville I. Wks. v.

The importance of these cases to the officers and the property holders of the city, was such that we felt it our duty to facilitate the final hearing. We accordingly transferred them to the Eastern District, advanced them on the calendar, and have given them a full and patient examination.

An appeal from that decree raises two questions : First, is the rule laid down in the appeals of Wilbert et al. to be adhered to ? Second, if so, are there not enough of the provisions of the acts of 1887 and 1889, known as the “ street laws,” remaining, to enable the city to proceed with its improvements at the expense of property benefited by them ? The first of these questions was not seriously pressed in the argument. Two of our brethren did not concur in all the reasons given for the judgment in the appeals of Wilbert et al., but they concurred in the judg<a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>ment entered. We think it stands on solid ground, and shall not enter upon a re-examination of it. Referring to it as tbe starting point from which to begin the examination of this case, we will consider very briefly the second question, viz., to what extent are the acts of 1887 and 1889 affected by the decision in that case ?</p>

A somewhat different system had prevailed previously. The foot-front rule was in use in some portions of the territory embraced within the city limits. In other portions, this was not applicable, because the property in them was rural in character. The street acts undertook to provide a uniform system and apply it to all improvements within the territory of the city. It was based on the assumption that wherever one lotowner was injured by taking his land, or by a change of grade in the street bounding it on either side, some other lotowner was correspondingly benefited, and ought therefore to pay his neighbor’s loss. Proceeding upon this theory, the street acts provided for a preliminary inquiry in every case where a new improvement was projected, to ascertain whether damages would be inflicted upon any lot-owner by the improvement if made, and whether corresponding benefits would result to other lotowners therefrom. This inquiry was made by the board of viewers. If they reported that the damages would exceed the benefits, then, as wc understand the street acts, the project was for the time abandoned. If they reported that the benefits would be sufficient to pay the damages and expenses, then the city proceeded to direct the improvement to be made. After this was done, the viewers made a detailed estimate and award of damages sustained by those whoso property was taken or injured, and reported the same to the city. The aggregate of these awards, with all the costs and expenses, was then to be assessed upon the property benefited. When the assessment was completed, it was returned to the councils for adjustment and collection. If not paid on notice, municipal liens were entered against the several pro<a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>perties assessed, and proceedings were taken to collect the same by levy and sale by the sheriff.</p>
    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[262,485,1174,1220]]]'>The board of viewers is thus made an indispensable part of the system. Without its agency, no improvement can be undertaken except it be by the city and at its own cost. An ascertainment of damages cannot be had except through the action of the board of viewers. The assessment of benefits must be made by it. The report of the board is the basis on which liens for the sums assessed as benefits must rest. When the work of the board of viewers is taken out of the system, all that depends upon that work goes with it, and the system itself is literally eviscerated. The few detached and unrelated provisions that might remain are without significance or value and ought not to survive the system to which they belonged. The system provided by the street acts must fall as a whole. The way will thus be clear for the enactment of a street law for cities of the second class. As nothing remains of the system provided by the acts of 1887 and 1889, it is hardly necessary to say that its authority cannot survive for any purpose. All the preliminary reports made by it fall, and no improvements can be ordered under them. All the assessments of damages and benefits fall, and all the uncollected liens, entered upon these assessments, go with the assessments. All work done or to be done upon these improvements, as the law now stands, must be paid for by the city. All the damages inflicted upon lotholders must be recovered from the city.</p>

There are two cities of the second class at this time. At the end of the present decade, the city of Scranton, and probably one or two more, may be brought by their growth in population into it. A system should be prepared for cities of the second class that shall not undertake to transfer the powers of the courts of law to city councils, or to regulate the practice in the courts by reference to the town or city in which they are held; that shall not denpr to the citizen free access to the courts for redress of injuries, and that shall not treat the ascertainment of <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>damages sustained by a citizen, by reason of an entry upon bis land under the power of eminent domain, as a matter of municipal control.

The appellants contend that the injunctions which were issued did not go far enough, because they did not restrain the city from completing the improvements entered upon under the street acts of 1887 and 1889, even though done at its own cost. The position is taken that the act of June 14, 1887, [P. L. 895,] entitled “ An Act in relation to the government of cities of the second class,” is unconstitutional, and that the heads of departments selected under its provisions are not competent to contract or bind the city in any manner whatever. The question presented by these appeals is therefore over the constitutionality of that act, and the organization of the city of Pittsburgh as a city of the second class.</p>
    <p id="b451-8" data-blocks='[["BL_451.9",451,[224,1709,1169,703]],["BL_452.1",452,[266,389,1178,1010]]]'>It is urged that §§ 1, 2,10 and 20 make the act local, by fixing dates at which acts necessary to put the government in operation are to be done, which were possible only to one city, the city of Pittsburgh, and which are impossible to the city of Allegheny, which has come into the class since the act was passed. The reply to this objection is, that, at the date when the act became a law, there was but one city in the second class. The provisions of the act were general in their character. They related to all cities of the second class. If there had been several such cities, the terms employed would have applied to all alike. It was necessary, in order to give effect to the change in the system of municipal government, that a definite time should be fixed upon at which the change should take place and the new system be put in operation. The trouble with the <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>act is not that it made such a provision for cities then entitled to a place in the second class, but that it did not also make similar provisions for cities that should thereafter be entitled to come into the class. We cannot hold, however, that the failure to provide a date for the organization of cities after-wards to come into the class, deprives such cities of the benefit of the law, or renders it local, and so, inoperative, in the cities to which it would otherwise be applicable. It may be that dates following the proclamation of the governor showing a given city to be entitled to become a city of the second class, corresponding with the dates following the passage of the act which were fixed for the cities then in the class, would be properly adopted. Something like this was done in Shurley v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/121/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="121 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="561275" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0511-01">121 Pa. 511</a>. But,, if this should be thought inadmissible and further legislation should be resorted to, we do not see that the conclusion of the appellants would follow. The act of 1887 is general in terms, and it is clearly applicable to all the members of the class as it was then composed, and answered the test laid down in Weinman v. Railway Co., <a href="/pa/118/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="118 Pa. 192" data-case-ids="556692" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0192-01">118 Pa. 192</a>, and kindred cases.</p>

This does not extend or confer powers, previously exercised in some other way, to the two branches of the councils, but leaves the legislative power just where it was before, with no change in its extent, in the body exercising it or in the name or title of that body. The city councils possessed the power before the city came into the second class, and when it came it brought its councils with it, just as it brought its mayor, with their powers and titles unchanged. Such a declaration does not violate the constitution in any particular. The same thing may be said of the ninth section, which declares that certain offices named, including that of city treasurer and controller, “ shall remain as heretofore, ex<a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>cept as herein otherwise provided.” These offices, with the incumbents, came also with the city into the new scheme of government, and became a part of it, as did the mayor and councils. So far as new duties were put upon them, or old ones taken away, the act made the necessary provisions ; but where no change was made, the officers assumed the responsibilities and discharged the duties belonging to them, just as though no change in class had taken place. Nothing was added to or taken from their functions or powers, except by express words.</p>

These sections do undertake to confer powers, previously exercised by a number of officers whose offices are discontinued, upon the heads of departments created by the act. They undertake to extend to these new officers all the acts of assembly relating to the duties and powers of all these unnamed and abolished offices, without even a reference to their dates, their titles, or their subject matter. To understand what was, and what was not within their control, it would be necessary to digest all the local laws relating to all the officers whose functions are thus gathered up and dropped into the hands of the “ heads of departments.” This mode of defining the powers of a newly created officer is in violation of the letter and the spirit of the constitutional provision, and cannot be sustained: Titusville Iron W. v.

It is nevertheless true that supplementary legislation is needed in order that these officers may be able to assume the importance in the management of municipal affairs, which the system of government for cities of the second class plainly contemplates. The seventh section is not as objectionable as the fifth and sixth. It professes to confer upon five magistrates the right to exercise for certain purposes the same police powers as are possessed by the mayor. The police power of the mayor is not diminished. That remains as before, but for certain purposes five <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>magistrates have the right to exercise the same police powers. The police power is a common-law power. The legislature may properly confer it upon a newly created office by general words, for that reason. But, if the mayor exercises powers created and conferred by statute, in addition to the general police power of which we have spoken, such statutory powers could not be conferred on the magistrates by such general words as are employed in this section. It may be that the mayor’s police powers are only such as fall properly within the general or common-law meaning of the words. If so, we do not see why this section may not stand.</p>

This cannot be sustained. The legislature must settle the system of government for each class of cities, and it must be the same for each and every member of each class. No city in any class can change the number of or the distribution of powers among the departments into which its government is cast by the legislature. If this were not so, no two cities in the same class would long retain the same form of municipal government, and general legislation for the class would, on many subjects, become impossible.</p>

This may be a convenient mode for the assessor, and a desirable one for the city; but we do not understand how the legislature can fix an arbitrary valuation of property in one city or class of cities wholly unlike that in actual use in all other cities or classes of cities. The constitution requires that taxes shall be uniform and assessed under general laws. We do not doubt the power of the legislature to adopt such a standard of valuation for the whole commonwealth. What we do doubt, is the power to adopt it for a city or class of cities. If this provision for cities of the second class is good, then there might be another standard of value adopted for cities of the first class, another for cities of the third class, and so on through the boroughs and townships, until any approach to equality in taxation would be rendered impossible.</p>

The provision relating to the subject is in these words: “ The value of the property taken, or damage done to property thereby, shall be levied and collected upon the several properties benefited .by such improvement in the manner provided by section twelve of this act.” No provision is found not coupled with a reference to the board of viewers, which gives any direction upon the subject of damages or benefits. The method for the assessment of damages and benefits which was provided has fallen under the weight of Wilbert’s Appeal. The whole system built upon that method has fallen under the decision in the appeals of the city of Pittsburgh in the injunction cases just decided. The acts of 1887 and 1889 can therefore afford no help to the city, for they are literally expunged from the statute book.</p>

Under the act of 1864, neither the Quarter Sessions nor the Common Pleas was authorized to appoint viewers. The city appointed her own appraisers to estimate the injury she inflicted on her citizens by her own entry on their land. This body reported to the city, not to the courts. The city and not the courts of law had immediate appellate jurisdiction, and sat to hear and determine, in the first instance, the claims against her upon which she had already passed by her board of viewers. The act of 1878 authorized the Quarter Sessions to appoint viewers, but the pre-<a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>lirainary examination was made, as we understand, by the city engineer, wlio was required to give notice to the owners of property affected, at least thirtjr days before the time fixed for opening, etc. Upon the letting of any contract, it was made the duty of the city engineer to assess “ fifty per cent of the cost thereof, which shall be pay ble within thirty days from the commencement of the work, and the remainder of the cost thereof shall be assessed at the completion of the work; both of said assessments shall be collected and liens therefor shall be filed and proceeded on as now provided by law.” An assessment under the act of 1878 is not practicable, because none of the proceedings have been under or in accordance with the directions of that act. These improvements were authorized on the petition of one third of the property owners, under the act of 1887, and they have been conducted in accordance with the directions of that act and the act of 1889. It is clear, therefore, that the system provided by the act of 1864, and its supplements, is wholly inapplicable to these improvements in their present condition, even if we should concede that the system is still in existence for any purpose. We see no relief for the city from the dilemma in which its unconstitutional street law has placed it, except through the legislature. We should be glad to escape this conclusion if we could, but we cannot. The responsibility for the resulting inconvenience does not rest on us.</p>

This is an undertaking of great delicacy, upon which we should not have entered except at the request of counsel representing both sides, and in which wo shall confine ourselves to a very <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>few suggestions which seem to us elementary. They are as follows:</p>
    <p id="b458-4" data-blocks='[["BL_458.4",458,[253,496,1171,493]]]'>1. A city may determine when, where, in what manner, and to what extent it will enter upon and appropriate the property of a private person in the exercise'of the right of eminent domain. This is a municipal question. The constitutional requirement that just compensation shall be made to the owner, must be enforced by the state courts in accordance with general laws. This is a judicial question. The city has no more control over the proceedings, than it would have over an action against it brought to recover the price of goods sold or work and labor done.</p>
    <p id="b458-5" data-blocks='[["BL_458.5",458,[253,1006,1174,705]]]'>2. The assessment of benefits is an exercise of the taxing power. The tax is defensible on the groltnd that it rests on an actual benefit conferred on the particular piece or pieces of property on which it is levied. It is a local tax resting on local benefit. This was distinctly ruled in the recent case of Allegheny City v. Railroad Co., ante 375. An assessment levied in order to cover all the cost of a given improvement, without regard to the actual benefits conferred by it, is simply confiscation. As an assessment is only valid because of actual benefits, it follows that these benefits should be fairly estimated. When determined, they may be collected by instalments if that seems desirable; but the assessment or adjustment of the benefits cannot be changed when once made, except for reasons that invalidate it and require it to be made de novo.</p>
    <p id="b458-6" data-blocks='[["BL_458.6",458,[254,1719,1173,247]]]'>3. The benefits to be assessed are such as are peculiar to the property assessed. A mere general increase in the value of property in that part of the city, is not enough. It must relate to the increase that is peculiar to the property liable to assessment, and is due simply to the improvement proposed.</p>
    <p id="b458-7" data-blocks='[["BL_458.7",458,[256,1974,1176,452]],["BL_459.1",459,[201,414,1178,604]]]'>4. This tax stands on peculiar grounds. When the benefits are assessed, a city cannot add to the assessment anything except the taxable costs incurred in its collection. All its officers are paid by salaries. The duties they perform, in connection with the streets and sewers, are such as belong appropriately to their respective offices, and are compensated by their salaries. The city solicitor receives a salary of five thousand dollars per year, and his assistant one or two thousand. He is required, by a succession of ordinances, to pay into the city treasury all <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>foes and commissions collected. Tbe same system prevails in cities of tbe first class and in cities of the third class. The officers are paid by salaries and all fees go into the city treasury, and this is the plain intent of the constitution: See §§ 7 and 12, article V., and § 5, article XIV. See, also, § 15, act of March 81, 1876, [P. L. 17?;] § 40, act of May 23, 1874, P. L. 253. As no commission can be paid by the city or received by the solicitor for the collection of municipal liens entered upon an assessment of benefits, the payment of it by the property holder is simply a payment of the amount, whatever it may be, in aid of the taxpayers in general. If the city can collect five per cent for such a purpose, it can collect one hundred.</p>
    <p id="b459-4" data-blocks='[["BL_459.4",459,[210,1026,1173,454]]]'>5. Section 31 of the act of 1887, authorizes the city to suspend work by its contractors without liability for the loss such suspension inflicts. "We have no doubt that a contractor may agree that the city shall reserve such a power, and be bound by his agreement; but, it may be worth while to consider whether the legislature can authorize a city of the second class to violate its contracts without liability* Can contracts made b}r a city of one class, be put on different ground from contracts made by other cities belonging to other classes ?</p>
    <p id="b459-5" data-blocks='[["BL_459.5",459,[212,1486,1174,499]]]'>6. Section 22 establishes a system of practice in the courts relating to municipal liens in cities of the second class. The practice may be changed in regard to particular subjects by general laws. Municipal liens is such a subject; but not municipal liens in one city or class of cities. There cannot be a different system of practice in the courts for the collection of municipal liens, for every class of municipal corporations in the commonwealth. Classification will not justify that: Ayars’ App., <a href="/pa/122/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="122 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1948405" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0266-01">122 Pa. 266</a>; Weinman v.

    <p id="b459-6" data-blocks='[["BL_459.6",459,[215,1997,1177,452]],["BL_460.1",460,[255,445,1174,1063]]]'>7. It should be remembered that while a city is to be regarded as representing the commonwealth, and acting as an instrumentality of the sovereign power for certain purposes of local government, it may and often does occupy a widely different position toward its citizens. This court has repeatedly said that when a city sells gas or water to its citizens, it enters into a contract relation with them. When it enters upon their land, under the power of eminent domain, it becomes a trespasser unless it follows the directions of the general laws re<a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>lating to that subject. ■ When it contracts with or trespasses on its citizens, it has no higher position than any other contracting party or trespasser. When, in either of these relations, it gets into the courts, it is neither greater nor better than its humblest citizen. The rules of law do not change with the name of the party to litigation. There is not one law for the rich, and another for the poor; one for the city that commits a trespass, and another for a citizen who does the same thing; but city and citizen stand on the same level as parties litigant. What would be thought of a law that authorized a railroad company to exercise the right of eminent domain, to appoint viewers to assess. the damages their entry might inflict, to receive the report of their viewers, and sit as an appellate court to hear evidence for and against themselves, and render a judgment in their own cases which should “ be final and eoñ-clusive, unless ” the injured party could plant his appeal in a court of'record within one half the time that is allowed for an appeal in the most trivial case from a judgment of a justice of the peace ? This, with* a slight change in the name of the party taking land under the power of eminent domain, is the system which the city of Pittsburgh has enjoyed.</p>
