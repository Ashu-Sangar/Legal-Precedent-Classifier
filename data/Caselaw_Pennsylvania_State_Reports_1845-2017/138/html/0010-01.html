This court had previously adjudged the affidavit of defence insufficient, and that judgment necessarily involved a decision that the plaintiff’s claim was good in form, as otherwise no affidavit of defence would be necessary, and consequently no judgment could be entered, no matter how defective the affidavit might be. But, in the case now at bar, there was no question as to the sufficiency of the affidavit of defence, and the legality of the plaintiff’s claim was never passed on by any court, until argued upon the demurrer and motion to strike off, by which alone that question was raised in the regular and ordinary course of practice.</p>

The paper by which it was proposed to amend or explain the lien, is not before this court. The plaintiff had no right to file it as an amendment. There was nothing to amend by. Amendment is not creation, and a lien which is fatally defective, for want of a description of the building, cannot be made good by filing an “ amendment ” after the lapse of six months. As an explanatory statement, it is entitled to precisely the same weight as an offer to prove by parol, upon trial, what is necessary to make good a totally defective description. The question whether the act of February 27, 1868, P. L. 212, is still in force or not, is entirely immaterial. It is now the settled law that a lien against an oil refinery may be sustained under the act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 695. But under no act of assembly can a lien be sustained without a sufficient description of the property against which it is filed. The buildings must be so described as to be capable of identification: Short v. Ames, <a href="/pa/121/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="121 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="561234" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0530-01">121 Pa. 530</a>.

There is nothing to identify the structures, severally or as a whole. Their size, character, form, height, material, etc., are not given. The alleged description would apply to any refinery. An interested and inquiring purchaser or lien creditor might wander around in a labyrinth of structures upon the land described, and never ascertain to what he would obtain title, ’or how far his own lien might be affected, so far as the statement of claim gives information.</p>

Does it describe any building to which the addition was made ? The statement that it was an addition to a refinery, is not sufficient to designate the buildings composing the refinery : Short v. Ames, <a href="/pa/121/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="121 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="561234" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0530-01">121 Pa. 530</a>. The claim shows on its face that an undescribed thing was an addition to another un-described thing, and we are asked to presume that both are substantial buildings to which the lien of a material-man could attach. Again; the act of May 18, 1887, P. L. 118, requires notice to be given to the owner or reputed owner, of the intention to claim a lien under the act of 1861, at the time the materials are furnished, and this, like every other essential fact, necessary to show the claimant’s right, should appear upon the face of the lien : Barclay’s App., <a href="/pa/13/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="13 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="964978" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0495-01">13 Pa. 495</a>. In this case, it does not appear with sufficient definiteness that the notice was given at the time of furnishing the materials. The claim is therefore defective, in not showing affirmatively upon its face that the plaintiff was within the statutes authorizing the filing of a lien.</p>

If the claim be insufficiently stated, the proper course is to move to strike it off: Lehman v. Thomas, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 262" data-case-ids="477741" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0262-01">5 W. &amp; S. 262</a>; orto demur: Howell v.

In the case now under consideration, under stress of a rule to plead the appellees did both, and the court below, upon argument, made the rule absolute and sustained the demurrer.

    <p id="b42-4" data-blocks='[["BL_42.4",42,[269,954,1172,808]]]'>By the third clause of the twelfth section of the act of June 16, 1836, it is required that a mechanics’ claim shall set forth “the locality of the building, and the size and number of the stories of the same, or such other matters of description as shall be sufficient to identify the same.” If there be enough in the description of the locality and of the peculiarities of the building, to point out and identify it with reasonable certainty, it is a sufficient compliance with the requirements of the act: Kennedy v. House, <a href="/pa/41/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="41 Pa. 39" data-case-ids="480042" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0039-01">41 Pa. 39</a>. The building or structures against which this lien was entered was an oil refinery, which is so peculiar in its construction that the ordinary forms or methods of description are inapplicable. A description of an oil refinery by “ the size and number of its stories,” would be absurd and wholly inadequate. The mechanics’ lien creditor must therefore resort to “such other matters of description as shall be sufficient to identify the same.”</p>

Works v. Keystone Oil Co., <a href="/pa/130/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="130 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="568964" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0211-01">130 Pa. 211</a>, the claim enumerated the principal buildings and structures constituting the plant, described their uses, gave the dimensions, height, or capacity of each, and the materials of which they were constructed, and averred that the whole, taken together, constituted an oil refinery, the location <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>of which was fixed by a particular description of the land upon which it was constructed. This description was also held to be sufficient under the act of 1836. In Short v. Ames, <a href="/pa/121/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="121 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="561234" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0530-01">121 Pa. 530</a>, this form of description was not pursued; indeed, there was no sufficient identification of the buildings intended to be embraced. The description in that case was as follows: “ Said buildings and oil refinery are situate in the county of McKean, and state of Pennsylvania, and is bounded and described as follows: [then follows a description of the land;] and haying buildings and machinery erected thereon, consisting of boiler and boiler-house, tanks, and tank-houses, stills, warehouse and bam, and donkey pumps, engines, and fittings.” This was radically defective. The description was all in such general form that it might, with equal propriety and accuracy, have been applied to almost any oil refinery.</p>

The buildings and structures are described, in general terms, as follows : “ A large oil refinery, used to refine crude petroleum, and to manufacture gasoline, etc.; which refinery has a capacity of 1,800 barrels, and upwards per day; a map or plan showing the exact location of said refinery, its tanks, buildings, stills, etc., being hereunto attached.” The claim further sets forth that “ all the steel plates, specifically mentioned in the itemized statement annexed hereto and made part hereof, were made and furnished by the said Linden Steel Company, Limited, for the erection and construction of a material and essential addition to the refinery aforesaid of the Imperial Refining Company, Limited, to improve the same, and increase its capacity and efficiency; ” that “ the above-mentioned material and essential addition to said refinery, for and about the erection and construction of which said steel plates were furnished, consisted of one six hundred-barrel steam still for steaming naphtha, said still being inseparably connected with said refinery, and being an essential part thereof; the relative location of said still, and of the various component parts of said refinery, being shown in the map or plan above referred to, in which said map or plan, said still, for and about the erection and con-<a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>.straction of which said material was furnished, is colored red.” Referring to the map, which is made part of the claim, we find a complete description of the land, with the buildings and structures composing the refinery, protracted upon a scale of forty feet to the inch. This map shows the sizes and relative locations of all the buildings, with respect to the lines of the land, the creek and the railroad, and with respect to each other. The pump-house, the boiler-house, the agitator, the condensers, the stills, shops, blacksmith shop, water-tanks, oil tanks, the office, etc., drawn to this scale, are not only represented by name, but the various pip.e connections are fully exhibited in variously colored lines, representing the alkali, acid, air, water, steam, and oil pipes, respectively, as they are used in the regular operation of the refinery. The structures not named are numbered as if with reference to some explanatory paper, which however was not filed with the lien.</p>

An oil refinery is not a single structure, in the same sense as a dwelling: it consists of a variety of structures, peculiar in form, large and small, each adapted to some particular use in the process of refining oil; but the whole of these several and various structures, taken together, is but a single establishment, and is known and used as an oil refinery. It is not necessary that every part and appliance of the refinery should appear in the claim, but- there should, as in the case of a dwelling, be such reasonable certainty of description as would clearly identify the subject of the lien.</p>
