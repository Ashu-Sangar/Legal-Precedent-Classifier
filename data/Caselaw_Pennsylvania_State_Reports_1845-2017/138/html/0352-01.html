    <p class="summary" id="b377-6" data-blocks='[["BL_377.6",377,[264,962,1175,405]]]'>It is contended by his counsel that the condition annexed to the legacy is in terrorem and void, and that it vested absolutely in him. The rule “ in terrorem ” was derived from the civil law, and seems to be as follows: “ A condition subsequent, which is against public policy, public decency or good manners, will be treated as in terrorem, unless there is a specific devise over.” In adopting it, the English and American courts have stricken out that part relating to good manners.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b377-7" data-blocks='[["BL_377.7",377,[265,1374,1179,966]]]'>The first inquiry is whether the condition annexed to this legacy is a condition precedent or subsequent. The answer to this does not depend upon the special phraseology of the bequest, but upon the general intent of the testator. The language used in making the gift is in the present tense; but the gift was not absolute, as it was given upon condition that the testator’s widow should accept under his will. Until she made her election, the estate could not be settled and distribution made. If she accepted, the legacy became vested, and it would be distributed to the legatee; but if she did not, it was evidently the intention of the testator that the legacy should fall into the residue of the estate. Compliance with the condition would necessarily precede the payment of the legacy, and its acquisition was therefore limited, and not its enjoyment. The condition was also in the nature of a consideration for the legacy, and its performance, in sneh cases, is regarded as intended to precede the vesting of the legacy: 2 Redfield on Wills, 283. This, then, being a condition precedent, if the in terrorem rule has been properly stated it does not apply.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b377-8" data-blocks='[["BL_377.8",377,[268,2349,1176,93]],["BL_378.1",378,[273,400,1181,761]]]'>But it is claimed upon the authority of 2 Redfield on Wills, 296, that the rule applies to bequests upon conditions prece<a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>■dent as well as subsequent. However, in Gilliland v. Bredin, <a href="/pa/63/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="63 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="1018917" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0397-01">63 Pa. 397</a>, it was held that where the condition was precedent the legacy would not vest until the condition was performed, and that the want of a bequest over made no difference. “ It becomes merged in the residue if it never vests.” But, even if this condition be subsequent, it does not follow that the in terrorem rule applies to this case. In 2 Jarman on Wills, 60, it is said: “ And, even in regard to personal estate, the in terrorem doctrine is not admitted in cases arising on other conditions than those relating to marriage and disputing a will. Thus, in Dickson’s Trust, where a testator bequeathed to his daughter a life-interest in 110,000, and by a codicil provided that if she should become a nun she should foi'feit the legacy, there was no gift over, and it was held, she having become a nun, that she forfeited the legacy.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b378-4" data-blocks='[["BL_378.4",378,[274,1168,1179,905]]]'>This will provides two plans of distribution; one if the widow accepts under it, another if she does not. She is at perfect liberty to accept or not. No penalty is or could be visited upon her for refusing to comply with the conditions upon which this legacy is given, and as to her it cannot be in terrorem. The testator was no doubt desirous that she should accept under the will, so that its provisions could be fully carried out; and it may be that one purpose for making the condition was to induce her to accept. But, evidently, another purpose was that if she refused, the legacy might fall into the residue, to compénsate the residuary legatees who would be disappointed by her election. And, as she refused, is there anything against public policy or good manners in sustaining the testator’s alternative disposition of his estate <em>? </em>It certainly would be carrying the in terrorem rule very far to apply it here. As the condition upon which the legacy is given to Harry R. Hilliard has not been complied with, it falls into the residue.</p>

Hilliard at the testator’s death.1</p>
