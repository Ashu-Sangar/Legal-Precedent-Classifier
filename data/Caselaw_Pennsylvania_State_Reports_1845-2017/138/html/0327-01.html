    <p class="summary" id="b352-5" data-blocks='[["BL_352.4",352,[227,725,1180,815]]]'>On December 5, 1884, Mrs. Rankin, the devisee, presented a petition to this court, setting forth, inter alia, that the land devised to her was subject to contingent remainders, as limited in the will of Mrs. Giffin; that it would be for the best interests of all parties that it should be sold, and praying the court to decree its sale in fee-simple. On December 20, 1884, the prayer of the petition was granted, and Graham Scott was appointed trustee to make the sales. Sales of a part of the land were made, and $8,000 purchase money received by the trustee; and on June 5, 1887, he was authorized to and did lend this purchase money to Mrs. Rankin, taking as security a bond and mortgage executed by her and her husband on other real estate devised to her in fee. It is now claimed that Mrs. Rankin had a fee in the devise, and that she was entitled to the purchase money; and the purpose of this petition is to procure an order on the trustee to satisfy the said bond and mortgage.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b352-7" data-blocks='[["BL_352.6",352,[226,1598,1179,300]]]'>It is contended by petitioners’ counsel that the words “ children and their descendants,” as used in the devise to Mrs. Rankin, are synonymous with “ heirs of the body; ” and that under the rule in Shelley’s Case the devise to her was in fee-tail, which under the act of April 27,1855, P. L. 368, was enlarged into a fee-simple.</p>

The cases cited to support this position would be in point, if the <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>devise had been to Mrs. Rankin for life and upon her death to her descendants. The devise, however, is to her for life, and at her decease to her children and their, not her, descendants. ‘The limitation being to the descendants of the remainder-men, shows that it was the intention of the testatrix that Mrs. Rankin’s children should become the root of a new succession, and take under the will as purchasers and not as her heirs.
