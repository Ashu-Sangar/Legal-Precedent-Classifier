M., was in the hands of the sheriff of Allegheny county, having been levied upon by virtue of several executions against the assignor; that, pursuant to an agreement in writing made by the execution creditors, the sheriff delivered the stock of goods to the assignee, to be by him sold and the proceeds applied to the satisfaction of the several executions, according to the order of priority of lien thereof; &lt;■ that, in the order of priority, the first of the judgments was in favor of Josephine Hanika, the wife of the assignor, for $540, entered December 10, 1887, upon a judgment note of that date and for that amount, payable six months after date, on which an execution <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>bad issued which came into the sheriff’s hands at 10.30 A. M. on December 15,1887; that the second judgment was in favor of Maloney brothers for $367.50, entered December 15, 1887, on a judgment note of that date and for that amount, payable on demand, on which an execution was issued which came into the sheriff’s hands at 1.10 p. m., December 15, 1887; that objection was made to the payment of the judgment of Josephine Hanika for the reason that the execution thereon was issued before the maturity of the note upon which the judgment was entered, but the auditor, citing Stewart v. Stocker, 13 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 199; Lowber’s App., <a href="/watts-serg/8/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 387" data-case-ids="483334" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0387-01">8 W. &amp; S. 387</a>, and Wilkinson’s App., <a href="/pa/65/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="65 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="430633" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0189-01">65 Pa. 189</a>, ruled that, though the suing out of the execution was an irregularity for which the court on application of the defendant would have set the execution aside, yet it was well settled that none but the plaintiff himself, pr his legal representatives, had standing to complain of such irregularity. The auditor found further, that there was no sufficient evidence to sustain a finding against the bona fides of the judgment, or that the same was given to hinder, delay and defraud the creditors of the defendant therein; moreover, that proceedings to open the judgment and for an issue, etc., had been had before the court, and the matters then raised as to the validity of the judgment had been heard and decided adversely to the contesting creditors. Wherefore, the auditor awarded the fund, after deducting costs, on account of the debt, etc., due on the judgment and execution in favor of Josephine Hanika.</p>

The exceptions having been overruled by the auditor, were renewed before the court on the filing of the report, and, after argument thereof, the court, White, J., on May 15, 1890, dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the report. Thereupon, the exceptants took this appeal, specifying the dismissal of their exceptions and the confirmation of the report, for error.</p>
