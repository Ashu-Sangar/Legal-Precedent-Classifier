Re-entry is the most effective remedy to enforce a forfeiture, and is the most emphatic declaration a grantor can make of his intention to avoid an estate upon condition. But possession, being the equivalent of entry, must have the same effect. It is true that in all the Pennsylvania cases we have cited, the grantor or lessor was insisting on the forfeiture. But how can that affect the principle of law? It is only in cases where the lessee is resisting the claim of forfeiture that the question of waiver can arise, and it is then held that there has been a waiver, only when both parties have treated the contract as a valid and subsisting contract between them. The present case is not ruled by Wills v. Natural Gas Co., <a href="/pa/130/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="130 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="568992" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0222-01">130 Pa. 222</a>; for, in that case, the question of the possession of the landlord was not raised. The record discloses no such question, and we take it that this court decided the case upon the record. Nor was the grantor or lessor in possession of the land in any of the cases, English or American, cited in the opinion of the court in Wills v. Natural Gas Co., or in any other case holding a like doctrine.</p>

Elliott, 5 S. &amp; R. 375, was decided, down to 1889, when the decision in Wills v. Natural Gas Co. was announced, the uniform, undoubted and oft-repeated rule in Pennsylvania, was that nou-performanee of such a condition, when the lessor was in possession, ipso facto determined the lease and the relation of landlord and tenant, as a conclusion of law. This being so, when these contracts were made the parties dealt with a knowledge of the law, and, as the affidavits of defence aver, the leases would not have been executed by the lessees, in the form in which they were written, had this not been understood to be the law. For this court now to declare that this settled rule of property in Penn-, sylvania is changed, and that the changed rule will be applied to pre-existing contracts, is to hold the lessees to a bargain that they never made, and work a result in violation of the clause in the constitution of the United States forbidding a <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>state to pass any law impairing the obligation of a contract: Ohio Trust Co. v.

Why then should the judiciary change the law, and impose an obligation which did not exist when the contract was entered into? The nature of the transaction, and of the business proposed to be conducted on the demised premises, should be considered. This is not like an ordinary leiting. The lessors have had the full and complete use and enjoyment of the land; and, if subsequent developments show that neither oil nor gas exists in paying quantities in the premises, the lessors have lost and given nothing by the leases, and the lessees have received nothing. Why should they be compelled to pay rental on leases for which there is no consideration? As to the Agerter lease, under the settled law of this state, it is clear that the lease was a nullity, and that the lessee acquired no title whatever thereunder: Innis v. Templeton, <a href="/pa/95/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="95 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="492948" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0262-01">95 Pa. 262</a>. Nor did the defendant ever enjoy the possession of the land. No case has gone to the length of holding a defendant in these circumstances. The lease has expired by its own limitation, and no ratification now can vest any estate or right in the defendant.</p>

The principle that, on breach of a condition annexed to a grant, when the grantor is -in possession, the estate re-vests in him, without any act on his part, would apply, if the contingency upon which the forfeiture' is to take place were a definite event, not depending upon the performance or nonperformance of any covenant of the grantee or lessee. But, when the grantee or lessee, by breaking his covenant, endeavors to put an end to his contract and thus take advantage of his own wrong, a different rule exists, and he is estopped from setting up his own failure to keep his covenant against the lessor. We have in this state, by slow approaches, turned into the general current of decisions in which is found without doubt the great weight of authority both in England and in this country: Wills v.

The oil and gas rights were exclusively in the lessee from the instant when the lease was executed, until the instant of the breach, and the lessor therefore was not in possession of any right to drill for oil or gas at the time of the breach. Consequently, under the facts shown by the affidavit of defence, there is no room to raise the question of a re-entry and ouster, either in fact or by operation of law, and the cases cited by the appellant are misfits. Again, a right of re-entry exists only for the benefit of the lessor and at his election, and he may waive it. As related to the facts of these cases, it is not correct to allege that the law of Pennsjd vania, at the time when the leases were made, was that non-performance of the condition ipso facto determined the lease and the relation of landlord and tenant.</p>

The said sum of $500 gas rent shall be paid within one month from the time said well is completed on said premises, and to be paid annually, in advance, thereafter. It is further agreed by said second party, that if a well is not completed within fifteen months from the date of this lease, they are to pay a further sum of $250, said sum to be a credit on well when drilled; and, in case of failure to complete one well within such time, the party of the second part hereby agrees to pay thereafter to party of the first part, for any future delay, the sum of $106 per annum, within one month after the time for completing such well, as above specified, payable semi-annually at the First National Bank of Washington, Pa.; and the party of the first part hereby agrees to accept such sum as full consideration and payment for such yearly delay, until one well shall be completed.

We agree with the appellant in its contention that if, in such a case as this, the lessor should choose to avail himself of the forfeiture clause in his contract, a formal re-entry, to take advantage of the breach, was not required ; the authorities cited by the appellant are decisive of the question. In Hamilton v. Elliott, 5 S. &amp; R. 375, there was a conveyance of a freehold by A to B, upon certain conditions which were not complied with, the grantor, in accordance with the terms of the grant, remaining in the possession from the time of the conveyance until after the forfeiture accrued; and it was held in a suit by the assignee of A that, by reason of the breach of the condition whilst A was in the actual possession, the estate re-vested in A without a formal entry to take advantage of the breach, or notice of the non-performance of the condition. As the grantor was already in the possession, it was deemed unnecessary that <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>be should go out in order that he might re-enter, or, that the grantee should have formal notice of what he already knew, viz., that the condition was not performed.

But, as by the terms of the lease, Ray, the plaintiff, was entitled to remain in possession of the land, subject to the right of the company to drill and operate for oil and gas, his occupancy of the land at and after the time of the breach can be of little consequence, unless by some act in assertion of the forfeiture he gave it a greater effect. It was certainly not necessary that he should abandon the possession to which, by the very terms of his contract, he was entitled, in order that he might insist upon performance by the lessee; the lessor’s election to forfeit, whilst he is in the actual possession, may be regarded as a constructive entry, under his title.</p>

It is a somewhat significant fact, that in all the cases cited, including Davis v. Moss, <a href="/pa/38/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="38 Pa. 346" data-case-ids="994059" data-case-paths="/pa/38/0346-01">supra,</a> the forfeiture was set up by the lessor, in whose interest the condition was inserted, upon the default of the lessee; in none of them, as in the case at bar, did the lessee set up his own default as a cause of forfeiture. No case has been brought to our notice in which the lessee was allowed to take advantage of his own wrong, or to set up his own default, to work a forfeiture of his own contract; it must be conceded, however, that if the old rule is the right one, this anomalous result must ensue. Persons may perhaps contract expressly in this form, and to this effect; when they do, tho transaction amounts to a mere option, and the lessee, in setting up his own default, simply avails himself of an elective right secured to him in his contract. We do not understand the contract in suit to be of this character. The clear purpose of the lessor was to have his lands operated for oil or gas, and the condition was inserted for his benefit. Whilst the. obligation on part of the lessee to operate is not expressed in so many words, it arises by necessary implication. The lease was for the expressed purpose of drilling and boring for oil or gas, the lessor, in a certain event, to receive a share of tbe production as a royalty or rent, and, in another event, to be paid $500 per annum for each gas-well, the product of which w'as conducted from the land for consumption. If a farm is leased for farming purposes, the lessee to deliver to the lessor a share of the crops, in the nature of rent, it would be absurd to 3ay, because there was no express engagement to farm, that <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>the lessee was under no obligation to cultivate the land; an engagement to farm in a proper manner, and to a reasonable extent, is necessarily implied. The clear purpose of the parties to this lease was to have the lands developed, and the half-yearly payments, and the other sums stipulated, were intended not only to spur the operator, but to compensate Ray for the operator’s delay or default. The lessor’s hands have been tied for two years. We do not know that he- lost anything in royalties, or that he suffered by drainage, for the territory might have proved unproductive; but, as the transaction was founded in the hope that either oil or gas, or both, might be found in paying quantities, it was competent for the parties to con.tract in advance for the amount of compensation to which, in the event of delay or default in development, the lessor would be entitled. The provision for forfeiture was doubtless inserted in anticipation that the lessee might make default and become unable to pay, in which event he might put an end to the lessee’s pretensions and seek other means of development. This clause having been inserted as a protection to the lessor, he had the right either to declare the forfeiture or to' affirm the continuance of the contract; and, if the lessor did not choose to avail himself of the forfeiture, the lessee cannot set it up as a defence to an action in affirmance of the contract: Galey v.

The prohibition is aimed at the legislative power of the state, and not at the decisions of its courts, or the acts of administrative or executive boards, or officers, or the doings of corporations or individuals. This court, therefore, has no jurisdiction to review a judgment of the highest court of a state, on the ground that the obligation of a contract has been impaired, unless some legislative act of the state has been upheld by the judgment sought to be reviewed.” “We are not authorized by the judiciary act,” says Mr. Justice Milleu, in Knox v.
