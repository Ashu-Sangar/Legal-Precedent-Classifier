It was shown that the optional contract of sale was entered into in writing in January, 1882, possession given, and the terms of the contract extended from time to time until June 17,1882, when a final agreement under seal, canceling the option and dividing the stock on hand, materials and tools among the parties, was made. The defendants admitted that they had sold the stock, materials, etc., but alleged that, notwithstanding the terms of the agreement and its extensions and the final agreement of June 17,1882, it was verbally agreed between the plaintiff S. S. McKenney and defendants to carry on business at the steel works as a partnership, under the name of the Glendon Steel Company, Limited, and that, during all the time covered by the said agreement and its extensions, the defendants and the said plaintiff operated the said works as partners. They further alleged that the copartnership was <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>indebted beyond the amount of its assets, and that the said plaintiff bad agreed tbat the stock, materials and tools should be sold and the proceeds applied to the payment of said debts. This was denied, however, by the plaintiffs, who alleged that no agreement existed between them and the defendants other than that expressed in the written contracts submitted, and claimed to be entitled to a verdict for at least $6,000.</p>
