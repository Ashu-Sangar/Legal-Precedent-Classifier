Then this question would have arisen before the auditor as to who was entitled to the funds, whether it was the lien creditor, or whether first the payment of those legacies must be made; and then, the money still being in court and the court having control of it, if it was determined against the lien creditor, he could then come in and ask to have the sale set aside, upon the ground that there was a fraud there, or that he was deceived.</p>

It was Osmer’s duty, under the law, to furnish a certificate of the legacies to the sheriff, and the latter was as much entitled to notice of them as he was to notice of judgments and mortgages : Mather v. McMichael, <a href="/pa/13/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 Pa. 301" data-case-ids="965013" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0301-01">13 Pa. 301</a>. Osmer knew of the existence of the legacies before the sale, and his talk with John Pryer, about bidding up the land to cover the legacies, shows that he knew they were a lien upon the land. At the sale and afterwards he fraudulently concealed this knowledge from the sheriff, and claimed and represented that he was entitled to the entire proceeds, and with guilty knowledge took the money.</p>

No special return was or could have been made by the sheriff, because Osmer failed to give or tender his receipt as a lien creditor in time to enable this to be done. The taking of the receipt after the deed had been acknowledged was an unofficial act. The giving of the receipt was equivalent to the receipt of the money by Osmer: Mann’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Pa.%2029" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Pa. 29">1 Pa. 29</a>; but it cannot be said that the money was honestly received. There was intentional fraud. It is true, as held in Sankey v.

In this case, we have both an affirmative act of fraud, the defendant representing that he was entitled to the entire proceeds of sale, when he knew better; and also a statutory duty to give information: §§ 1, 2, act of April 20, 1846, P. L. 411. The court below says that “the party should suffer whose wrong has occasioned the loss.” Who committed the wrong? The only wrong that was committed was the defendant’s, and he got <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>thereby $600 to which he was not entitled. No reasonable diligence would have enabled the sheriff to discover the fraud until after the legacies matured. When it was discovered, he at once sought the defendant, who agreed to protect him from loss. This suit was brought immediately after the final determination of the action against the sheriff.</p>

The second count is sustained by the positive testimony of Mark, that the defendant agreed, in October, 1885, to stand between Mark and the other parties. The language used in that conversation was a clear and explicit ■ agreement to indemnify. Moreover, we submit that it was error to give binding instructions for the defendant, and that the testimony ought to have been submitted to the jury under proper instructions: Hyatt v. Johnston, <a href="/pa/91/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="91 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="488781" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0196-01">91 Pa. 196</a>; Longe-necker v.

    <p class="summary" id="b31-6" data-blocks='[["BL_31.6",31,[231,1534,1172,901]]]'>1. Osmer was informed by the sheriff’s advertisement that, as a lien creditor, he might bid the amount of his judgment without being obliged to pay more than the costs in case he became the purchaser. Upon the terms of the sale, the sheriff had no right to demand payment of his bid in money. Osmer stood upon his statutory right to give his receipt for the amount of the bid, less the costs; and, even if the validity of that receipt, as a payment of his bid, had been adjudicated against him in the appropriate proceeding, he could not have been compelled to pay the bid in money. Under the statute he had the option to pay within ten days or to let the land be resold. He may have been, and probably was, unable to pay so large a sum in cash. Or, if able, he may have been unwilling to pay so much for the land otherwise than by his receipt on a judgment which was worthless if not entitled to the proceeds of the sale. To hold him liable to pay the money to the sheriff, is to change the terms of the sale and to make a new contract between him and the sheriff.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b32-3" data-blocks='[["BL_32.3",32,[247,362,1173,862]]]'>
      <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>2. The argument of the plaintiffs’ counsel that no special return could be made, because Osmer did not give his receipt or make his claim until after the acknowledgment of the deed, is all afterthought. It is manifest that both the sheriff and the purchaser were acting under paragraph 1 of the terms of sale, down to the time when the receipt was given; that the sheriff waived the giving of the lien creditor’s receipt on the day of sale and accepted it at a later day, and that no return of the writ was made till afterward. Independent of that, the acknowledgment of the deed did not stand in the way of making a special return. Until the deed is delivered to the purchaser, the record of its acknowledgment is within the control of the court and maybe vacated: Cock v. Thornton, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20Pa.%20642" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="108 Pa. 642">108 Pa. 642</a>. The money was due to Osmer from the defendant in the execution, and therefore he could receive and retain it with a good conscience, provided he practiced no deception to induce the sheriff to accept his receipt.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b32-4" data-blocks='[["BL_32.4",32,[247,1233,1175,914]]]'>8. The only evidence upon which the charge of fraud is based, is in the’testimony of John Pryer. Nowhere does it appear that Osmer knew that the legacies were liens upon the land having priority over his judgment; and the fair import of the words, which Pryer put into his mouth, was simply that he hoped, by running up Jesse’s land and the personal property bequeathed to him, so as to produce a surplus over and above Osmer’s judgment, out of which the legacies might be realized, to enable Jesse to pay them. Nobody seems to have known that the legacies were liens. The legatees themselves did not know it. The sheriff and his counsel were not willing to believe it until this court so decided. Why, then, should it be assumed that Osmer knew it ? It is not pretended that Osmer made any false statements to the sheriff. He merely claimed the rights of a lien creditor purchasing at sheriff’s sale. The evidence of fraud relied on to toll the statute of limitations, was too unsubstantial to submit to the jury, and there was even less to support the claim of a subsequent promise to indemnify.</p>

If, in this instance, he had followed the act of assembly and made the special return therein pointed out, he would have been in no peril, and would have suffered no loss. Instead of making such return and placing himself within the protection of the law, he merely returned that he had sold the real estate for the sum of $2,085, and took the receipt of the purchaser, who was also a lien creditor, for the amount. It so happened that there was a charge upon the land which did not appear upon the searches. This charge, the plaintiff, who was the high sheriff of Venango county at the time, has been obliged to make good, and he now sues the lien creditor, whose receipt he took, for the money which he was thus obliged to pay. Upon the trial below the learned judge gave the jury a binding instruction to find for the defendant. We see no error in this.</p>
    <p id="b33-5" data-blocks='[["BL_33.5",33,[231,1499,1173,861]]]'>The statute of limitations was a bar to the claim. Our attention has not been called to any such fraud in the case as would toll the statute. Osmer does not appear to have made any false statements to the sheriff which induced him to take Osmer’s receipt. Nor is there any clear evidence that he knew these legacies were a charge upon the laud. He might well have known of their existence, and yet not have been aware that they were a lien. Had there been evidence that he had such knowledge, that he concealed it from the plaintiff, and by means of such concealment induced the sheriff to give the receipt, there might have been ground for the position that the statute would not run until the discovery of such fraud and concealment. But, as the case stands, it is merely the assertion of the claim of a lien creditor to receipt for the purchase money, and the unwise acquiescence of the sheriff thereto, without protecting himself as ho might and should have done, by a compliance with the law specially provided for that purpose.</p>

But if be bad been, there was not sufficient evidence to base it upon. There was no proof of a promise “ to indemnify ” tbe plaintiff. Tbe only witness upon this point was the plaintiff himself. Taking bis testimony as a whole, it did not come up to tbe standard of indemnity. It was vague and uncertain.</p>
