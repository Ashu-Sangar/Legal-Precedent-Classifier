The defendants claim that the evidence shows that it was not; that these writings, although in form in the name of Hodge, were in fact made for and on behalf of Scatcherd &amp; Son; that Hodge was the mere cover to the transaction ; and that the $9,500, the money paid for the consideration, was the money of Scatcherd &amp; Son, and that this suit is <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>prosecuted for the joint benefit of the plaintiffs and Scatcherd &amp; Son instead of Hodge. If the evidence satisfies yon that the defendants’ claim in this respect is correct, then your verdict should be a general verdict in favor of the defendants. As bearing upon this question, it becomes an important question of fact, who furnished the $9,500 that was paid to the plaintiffs. Was it, as testified by Hodge, his own funds, an investment made by him ? If so, then there may be a recovery in this suit. Was it Scatcherd &amp; Son’s money? If so, then the verdict should be for the defendants. Now, you will see the importance of that question and why you should give it careful consideration. You have heard the comments of counsel upon the transaction through which this assignment was made to Hodge, and what is claimed by the defendants, that Hodge’s name was used as a mere cover for Scatcherd &amp; Son; and what is claimed on the part of the plaintiffs, that it was an honest bona fide transaction of the transfer of the claim in suit to Hodge.

The words of the statute impose no liability on the defendant to pay interest, and we think no such liability can be inferred from its terms or its purpose. The act has a double purpose, viz., to punish the wrongdoer and amply compensate the owner. It is highly penal, so far as the wrongdoer is concerned, and, measured by the rules generally applied in suits for damages, it is amply compensatory to the owner for the injury sustained and the delay and expense of litigation, without the addition of interest.</p>

Beemer, 12 Cent. B. 492, and, if that can be taken as authority to the extent claimed, it sustains the position of the plaintiffs. In that case, the court below said to the jury, and it was assigned for error, that “should you find in favor of the plaintiff, it would be proper for you to find the amount of the damages and multiply it by three, because the plaintiff is entitled to treble damages ; and you may also allow interest from the time of the cutting.” To this the Supreme Court, affirming the judgment in a brief per curiam, after speaking of the other assignments, say: “ And the third section of the act of March 29, 1824, was properly applied to the case in hand.” That it was properly applied, so far as the instruction to multiply the damages by three was concerned, is beyond question; but we are of the opinion that the case ought not, and was not intended by the Supreme Court, to be taken as authority for the proposition that the act of 1824 authorized the jury to treble the damages and add the interest thereon from the time of the cutting to the time of the verdict. If the case is authority for the allowance of interest on the single damages, it is authority for allowing interest on the treble damage; and thus an act severe in its penalty, <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>especially when it is invoked” against one wbo innocently cuts timber on the land of another without the consent of the owner, is made still more severe by construction extra the words of a penal statute.

But such is not the language. It is a liability to pay double or treble “ the value of such tree or trees so out down or felled.” That is to say, a penalty is imposed, to be fixed by the value of the timber cut. The effect of a penal statute is to be limited by the express words employed, and should not be extended by implication ; and interest is not given by the act of 1824. If interest is' a right incident to a liability for double and treble the value of the timber, as of the date of the cutting, it should be computed upon the entire liability. We fail to see any reason for allowing interest on the single value of the timber cut, that would not be equally applicable to such an allowance on the double and treble value.

In the light of these authorities, the act of March 29, 1824, 8 Sm.

Nor did he cut it by another, within the intendment of the statute. Under the maxim, expressio unius est exclusio alte-rius, the addition in the act of the words, “or employ any other person or persons to cut down or fell,’’ excludes the application of the principle, qui facit per ahum facit per se, to the preceding words, “ If any person or persons . . . shall cut down or fell,” and limits the operation of the statute to the two cases expressed, to wit, a cutting personally by the hand of the defendant, and a cutting by his employee. The signification of the maxim, qui facit per alium, etc., is that the acts of an agent are the acts of his principal: 2 Bouv. Law Diet., 206; Broom’s Maxims, 818; 1 Sharswood’s Bl. Com., 429 ; Story on Agency, §§ 440-452. It has never been applied, so far as a careful research has shown, to the relation of vendor and vendee, except in this case. Nor can it reasonably be applied to such a relation. The vendee is not the agent of the vendor; their relation is antagonistic, and each acts for himself, dealing with the other at arms length.</p>

An action of trespass will’not lie, upon the act of 1824, against a vendor for the acts of his vendee. The statute provides that the form of the action shall be “ trespass or trover as the case may be ; ” that is, when trespass would lie at common law upon the facts of the case, that shall be the remedy. The word trespass, as the name of an action, has a known technical signification, and it must be presumed that the statute uses it in that sense. Trespass will lie only when the injury is done by the direct act of the defendant; force directly applied is the criterion : 1 Chitty’s PL, 141; Strohl v.

The cutting in this case was a consequence of the erroneous survey and estimate, but it was not the act of Powell, nor had he any control over it. It may be conceded that by the sale he “ encouraged the cutting,” but the statute does not punish encouraging. It applies only to a personal cutting or the employing others to cut. The statute did not contemplate that a vendor should be liable for a cutting by his vendee, ten, twenty, or fifty years after the sale: Offerman v.

    <p id="b420-4" data-blocks='[["BL_420.4",420,[257,1033,1178,451]]]'>The court declined so to charge, and said, in substance, that as Powell neither cut the trees down with bis own hands, nor paid the wages of those who did, be was not liable under tbe provisions of tbe act of 1824. This instruction was assigned for error, and raised the question in tbe case. Tbe point predicated Powell’s liability, not of tbe illegal acts of his vendees, but of bis own illegal acts by which be became a trespasser. These acts, as grouped in tbe point, were four in number, and may be separately stated as follows:</p>
    <p id="b420-5" data-blocks='[["BL_420.5",420,[256,1493,1175,145]]]'>1. That be procured his west line to be so run and marked as to include two hundred and sixty acres of tbe plaintiffs’ land. This was a breach of tbe plaintiffs’ close, a trespass.</p>
    <p id="b420-6" data-blocks='[["BL_420.6",420,[254,1646,1175,195]]]'>2. That be caused tbe trees thus wrongfully enclosed to be counted, and their contents estimated as belonging to him. This was an assertion of ownership of tbe trees belonging to plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b420-7" data-blocks='[["BL_420.7",420,[253,1850,1176,195]]]'>3. That be caused tbe line so run to be pointed out to tbe agent of Scatcherd &amp; Son as bis true line. This was an assertion that they might lawfully enter upon tbe land under his authority.</p>
    <p id="b420-8" data-blocks='[["BL_420.8",420,[252,2054,1171,198]]]'>4. That be sold tbe timber so enclosed and estimated to Scatcherd &amp; Son by the thousand feet, board measure, and took bis pay for it. This was a clear and distinct authority to Scatcherd &amp; Son to cut down tbe trees and take them away.</p>
    <p id="b420-9" data-blocks='[["BL_420.9",420,[252,2258,1172,136]],["BL_421.1",421,[210,365,1179,760]]]'>Tbe point asked, if tbe jury should find from tbe evidence that tbe acts enumerated bad been done by Powell, and if they should further find that Scatcherd &amp; Son cut and removed tbe <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>timber “by reason of said acts of Powell,” then the court should instruct them, as matter of law, that he was liable as a co-trespasser. This was the question before us on the plaintiffs’ appeal in 1888, and the only question. We held, reversing the court below, that upon the facts assumed in the point the plaintiffs were entitled to the instruction asked for as to their legal effect. The case went back for another trial, which has now been had, and which has resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. The defendant appeals, and assigns as error the answer of the court below to the same point, given in accordance with our decision in <a href="/citations/?q=128%20Pa.%2062" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="128 Pa. 62">128 Pa. 62</a>. We are asked, and are quite willing, to examine and determine this question as an original one. The question is, are the acts enumerated in the point sufficient to make him who does them a principal in the trespass of cutting and removing the trees ?</p>
    <p id="b421-4" data-blocks='[["BL_421.4",421,[223,1133,1181,1272]],["BL_422.1",422,[273,369,1174,196]]]'>It is the doctrine of the common law that every party to a trespass, whether contributing to the physical force employed or not, is liable to an action of trespass; and the reason given is, because there can be no accessory in trespass, and therefore all who aid, abet, counsel, direct, or encourage are liable as principals: 9 Bac. Abr., 492; The same rule prevails in this country. It is stated in Coats v. Darby, <a href="/ny/2/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="2 N.Y. 517" data-case-ids="492210" data-case-paths="/ny/2/0517-01">2 N. Y. 517</a>, in these words: “ All who aid, command, advise, or countenance the commission of a trespass by another are liable as if they had committed the tort with their own hands.” In Moak’s Under-hill on Torts, 567, the result of the cases is said to be that the plaintiff is entitled to recover if the evidence shows that the defendant took part in the trespass personally, or that he authorized it. It is not necessary that the authority should be given by the defendant in person; it is enough if it be given by his attorney: Gillingham v. Clark, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Phila.%2051" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="1 Phila. 51">1 Phila. 51</a>. The basis of liability is well stated in Green v. Kennedy, <a href="/barb/46/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="46 Barb. 16" data-case-ids="5150301" data-case-paths="/barb/46/0016-01">46 Barb. 16</a>, thus: “ The direction, suggestion, or encouragement that is given, is adjudged to be part of the act itself,” done under such direction, suggestion, or encouragement. Much stronger than the cases now referred to are those that hold that one may become liable for a trespass committed without his knowledge, if he agrees to it and is benefited by it. Such cases are abundant where a landlord is proceeded against for the act of his bailiff; a sheriff or constable, for the act of his deputy; a prin<a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>cipal, for tbe act of bis agent. Thus, not only accessories before the fact, but accessories after the fact, who are benefited by or in whose interest the act has been done, are liable as principals.</p>
    <p id="b422-4" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[266,575,1182,1320]]]'>It is urged that, while the rule may be as stated in all actions for tort, yet a different rule must be applied when the plaintiff declares under the act of 1824. But the act of 1824 does not give a new action, but a statutory measure of damages “ to be recovered with costs of suit by action of trespass or trover, as the case may be.” This action is trespass quare clausum, in which the plaintiffs have declared for double or treble value of the trees as their measure of damages, instead of single value with interest. The trespass complained of is an entry upon the lands belonging to the plaintiffs, and the cutting and removal of their timber trees growing thereon, without their consent. The defendant does not deny that the plaintiffs’ close has been entered, nor that the timber trees growing there have been cut and removed without their consent. The only question raised is, who is liable for this admitted trespass ? The laborers whose blows felled the trees are liable. Ryder, who hired the laborers and superintended their work, is liable, because he directed the work to be done. Scatcherd &amp; Son, who never saw either the trees or the laborers who felled them, are liable, because Ryder represented them as their agent, and qui facit per alium facit per se. So far, both parties are agreed. The plaintiffs propose to go to the top of this series of connected acts, and hold Powell also liable, because, asserting that they were his own, he sold the timber trees that have been cut and removed to Scatcherd &amp; Son, and distinctly authorized their removal from the land.</p>
    <p id="b422-5" data-blocks='[["BL_422.5",422,[264,1905,1176,502]],["BL_423.1",423,[211,356,1179,1331]]]'>To this the defendant objects. His position is that the law of 1824 prescribes against the act of cutting any timber trees, and that of employing any person to cut or fell such trees; that, as a penal law, it must be strictly construed; and that, as he neither wielded the axe, nor paid the wages of those who did, he is not liable. This would be a very strict construction, indeed; so strict and narrow that the criminal courts would not adopt it even in favor of human life. It is well settled that he who counsels, directs, or authorizes the commission of murder is guilty of the crime, equally with him by whom the <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>fatal blow was delivered. The direction is adjudged to be part of the act itself, and to incur the same degree of guilt, if the act be criminal, and the same degree of civil responsibility, if the act be a trespass merely. If one should go to his neighbor’s stable, representing it to be his own, sell the horses standing there, take the price, and require the purchaser to remove the horses within a fixed time, whatever might bo said about the criminal character of his conduct, no one would doubt his liability in trespass for the removal of the horses. His sale of them as his own, to be removed, is a clear and direct authority for the act of removal by his vendee, which makes him a principal in the trespass. If, instead of going to his neighbor’s stable, he should go to his timber land, and point out a tree or a grove of trees as his own, estimate the contents of the tree or trees, board measure, sell them, take the price, and require them to be removed within a fixed time under penalty of loss of the price paid, such sale is as clear an authority to cut and remove the trees as it would be possible to devise; and the subsequent removal of them by the purchaser, in consequence of such purchase, would support an action against the seller, not because of the act of his vendee merely, but because of his own acts connecting him with the trespass. We are fully satisfied, after a careful re-examination of the whole subject, that upon the facts embodied in the point the law was correctly given to the jury upon the last trial, and that the error assigned thereto is not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b423-4" data-blocks='[["BL_423.4",423,[217,1696,1177,708]],["BL_424.1",424,[269,363,1175,452]]]'>Much was said upon the argument of this case about the hardship of holding a vendor liable for the unauthorized acts of his vendee. It is enough to say that no such question was before this court in 1888, and no such question is presented now. We have no doubt that an owner who sells his tract by its official description, or its adjoiners, could not be held liable because his vendee might cut over the lines. The vendee must take notice of the lines, and fix their location at his peril. If there are interfering surveys, and one or more of the lines be involved in dispute, the purchaser takes the dispute with the tract, and must wait until it is settled, or be liable in trespass if he gets over the lines. This case presents no such features. The point assumed that the defendant procured a line to be run and marked to enclose his neighbor’s trees. Whether <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>be was misled by his surveyor, or mistook the fine, is not important. The fact is that by his positive acts-, as assumed and now found by the jury, he misled his vendee. He sold his neighbor’s trees as his own, took pay for them, and authorized and required their removal within a fixed time. He cut the trees by means of his sale of them to be cut. His direction and authorization of the act of his vendees is adjudged part of the act itself, and makes him, equally with those whom he directed and authorized, a trespasser.</p>

The plaintiffs complain of the ruling of the learned judge of the court below upon the subject of interest. The jury found the valué of the timber trees, and computed interest thereon at $641.88. The court directed judgment to be entered for three times the value of the timber, and excluded the interest therefrom. The precise point was ruled in Dunbar Fur. Co. v. Fairchild, <a href="/citations/?q=121%20Pa.%20568" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="121 Pa. 568">121 Pa. 568</a>, and is clear upon principle. The treble damages are given as a penalty, and we know of no case in which a penalty bears interest until the plaintiff’s right to it has been settled by judgment. The learned judge of the court below was right, therefore, in excluding the interest, and entering the judgment for three times the single value of the trees cut and carried away.</p>
