In § 5 it provides that judgments for want of a sufficient affidavit shall be taken “ in accordance with the present practice.” An insurance policy does not come within the affidavit of defence law, as it is not an instrument for the payment of money, but a contract of indemnity; and the insurer’s liability, in the event of a fire, is conditioned upon the performance of certain duties by the assured, and dependent, as to its extent, upon the existence and amount of concurrent insurance, as well as upon the value of the property destroyed: Morton v.

In bold-ing the affidavit insufficient because it was obligatory on the company, under the act of May 11, 1881, P. L. 20, to attach the application to the policy, the court erred: (a) Because that act is in conflict with § 7, article III., of the constitution, being an attempt to prevent persons who are sui juris from making contracts of insurance in a manner to suit their own pleasure : Godcharles v. Wigeman, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20Pa.%20487" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="118 Pa. 487">118 Pa. 487</a>; and (5) because, by its terms, the act limits its operation to policies upon property and persons within this state, and therefore it does not apply in the present case. Nor was it necessary to attach a copy of the application to the affidavit. We do not understand Erie City v. Butler, <a href="/pa/120/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="120 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="559850" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0374-01">120 Pa. 374</a>, as deciding that every mention made of a paper in such an affidavit makes this necessary. It is necessary only where the court would be called on to judge of the legal effect of the paper referred to, in order to determine the sufficiency of the affidavit. The mention of the application in this instance was purely incidental. The affidavit would be sufficient if that word were expunged, and it alleges representations “ otherwise.” It merely indicates the sources of/ the defendant’s evidence, which it was unnecessary to recite. Nor does the affidavit allege that the application was in writing. It is immaterial whether it was or not, as the court could not judge of its legal effect until proof had been made that its contents were false. Hence it does not come within the reason of Erie City v. Butler, supra.</p>

The decisions made in this case by two of the president judges of the courts of Armstrong county, familiar with their own rules of practice, should have greater weight than the decisions made in Philadelphia and Dauphin counties, so much relied on by the appellant. It has never been questioned in Armstrong county, since the decision in Lycoming Ins. Co. v. Dickinson, 4 W. N. 271, that judgment could be taken in a case of this kind for want of an affidavit of defence. Our Court Rules are similar to those upon which that case was decided. <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>But the procedure act of May 25,1887, P.

Its constitutionality and beneficial character are supported by the decisions: Norristown Title Co. v.

It is a procedure act, and was intended to apply to all policies sued on within this state. Moreover, the defendant’s affidavit is clearly evasive. It states that the facts alleged were ascertained only from the proofs of loss, since the fire. But where are the proofs of loss and the application ? They are in the hands of the defendant, and why are they not produced ? When reference is made in an affidavit of defence to a paper, a copy must be annexed to enable the court to judge of its legal effect: Erie City v.

    <p id="b203-6" data-blocks='[["BL_203.7",203,[258,1336,1178,504]]]'>The first point suggested by the affidavit of defence, is that, under the declaration accompanied by a copy of the policy of insurance sued upon, an affidavit of defence was not necessary. In Lycoming Ins. Co. v. Dickinson, 4 W. N. 271, this court sustained a judgment for want of an affidavit of defence in a suit brought upon an insurance policy. “ And,” as was said in Byrne v. Hayden, <a href="/pa/124/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="124 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="563118" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0170-01">124 Pa. 170</a>, “the act of 1887, providing for filing of statement of claim, etc., was intended to have a wider scope than the old affidavit of defence law.” We do not regard this point as well taken.</p>

The most important matters contained therein are conclusions drawn by defendant from two papers viz., <em>(a) </em>the application, and <em>(b) </em>the proofs of loss. There was not a copy of either paper attached to the affidavit. It was held in Erie City v. Butler, <a href="/pa/120/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="120 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="559850" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0374-01">120 Pa. 374</a>, that where, in an affidavit of defence, reference is made to a paper, a copy must be annexed in order that the court may judge of its legal effect. In that case, the affidavit referred to the contract between the city and the contractor, which was the subject-matter of the suit. The defendant gave his version or understanding of the contract in his affidavit. We held that he should have attached a copy, in order that the <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>court might construe the contract. This ruling needs no vindication. It was not intended by that case to rule that a mere incidental reference to a paper or writing necessarily involves the placing of a copy on the record. But, where the paper is an important factor in the case, and the defendant attempts to set up his interpretation of it as a defence to the action, or draws therefrom alleged facts as a defence, he must attach a copy to his affidavit.</p>
    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[253,808,1183,1218]]]'>The learned judge below made the further point in regard to the application, that by the act of May 11,1881, P. L. 20, it is the duty of the insurance company to attach to the policy a copy of the application; otherwise, it is not to be received in evidence or made a part of it. In Imp. F. Ins. Co. v. Dunham, <a href="/pa/117/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="117 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="555758" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0460-01">117 Pa. 460</a>, we sustained the court below in excluding the application because it was not attached to the policy, Mr. Justice Clabe: saying: “ No copy of the application or of the by-laws of the company was attached to the policy, as that act (1881) requires ; it constituted, therefore, no part of the policy or of the contract between the parties, and it was not receivable in evidence. The case is to be considered as if no such paper existed.” To the same effect is New Era Life Ass’n v. Musser, <a href="/pa/120/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="120 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="559949" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0384-01">120 Pa. 384</a>. In Norristown Title Co. v. Insurance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=132%20Pa.%20391" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="132 Pa. 391">132 Pa. 391</a>, we held that this provision in the act of 1881 was a duty imposed upon the company for the benefit of the assured, and that when they had neglected tó attach the application to the policy, they had . no standing to object to the admissson of the application because not attached. The affidavit of defence, here, makes no mention of the fact that the application was attached to the policy; the defendant could not offer it in evidence unless so attached, nor does it form any part of the contract between the parties. The affidavit omits the very thing necessary to give the paper referred to any force whatever.</p>
    <p id="b204-5" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[266,2033,1170,451]]]'>It was urged, however, that the act of 1881 applies only to “policies upon the lives or property of persons within this commonwealth,” and that, as the property insured by the defendant company was located in the state of West Virginia, the rule above stated does not apply. We regard this as a narrow construction of the act. We think it was intended to produce a uniform rule of procedure, and to apply to all insurance companies incorporated by the laws of this state, and to all other corporations insuring lives or property within the state.</p>
