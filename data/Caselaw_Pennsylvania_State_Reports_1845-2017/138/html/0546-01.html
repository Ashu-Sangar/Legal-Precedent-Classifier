A number of wells were drilled upon the farm prior to September, 1886, some of which were large producers. About September 25, 1886, the company made a verbal contract with McCauley Brothers, a firm of oil-well contractors, for the drilling of a well on said farm designated as Cameron No. 8, for the consideration of $1.75 per foot, the depth to which the well should be drilled not being specified in the contract. S. F. McCauley, the member of the contracting firm with whom the agreement was made, testified that his understanding of the contract was that the well was to be drilled to completion; that is, through all the producing sands in the district wherein it was located. A number of witnesses testified for the garnishee that by the usage of the oil trade, the words, “ to drill a <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>well,” in such a contract, meant, in tbe absence of any provision as to the depth of the well, to drill through all known producing sands of the particular district, and to deliver the well to the owner clear of all obstructions.' Testimony for the plaintiffs tended to disprove the existence of any general and uniform usage to that effect.</p>

In accordance with the usage of the trade and the understanding of the parties to the contract, the contractors were to receive and did receive from the company, on account of the contract price, $500 when the first casing was inserted, and $500 upon the insertion of the salt-water casing, these sums being paid, however, without regard to the depth of the well at those stages of the work. When the well had been drilled into the Gantz sand, a “ pay-streak ” was developed. The depth of this pay-streak was in dispute; the testimony for the plaintiffs placing it at twelve to fifteen feet below the top of the Gantz sand, and the testimony for the garnishee tending to show that it was twenty-three feet below the top of the sand. Drilling was continued through the Gantz sand and into the Fifty-foot, until, at the depth of seventy-eight feet below the top of the former, according to the plaintiffs’ testimony, or seventy-one feet, according to the testimony for the garnishee, the drilling tools were dropped in the well. By means of a few days’ “fishing,” the tools were recovered and drilling resumed, but, after four days’ more work, which added probably from two to eight feet to the depth of the well, they were again lost and the effort to recover them, though continued for some time, proved unavailing.</p>

There was also testimony that no pay-streak had ever been discovered in the numerous wells drilled in that locality, below the depth to which this well was alleged by the plaintiffs’ witnesses to have been drilled. Witnesses for the garnishee testified that a pay-streak was sometimes found in the bottom of the Fifty-foot sand, and this was admitted upon cross-examination by S. F.

If, as the charge indicated, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover whether the contract was entire or severable, then the oil company had a legal right to offer the testimony objected to, under its plea of set-off, or even under the general issue. The offer covered by the first assignment was admissible to meet the claim of the plaintiffs that the company had received certain fruits of labor performed on the well, over and above the sums advanced to the contractors, without compensation. <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>And if, as the answer to our fifth point intimated, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover on a quantum meruit, it was unfair to refuse to permit us to show, as proposed by the offer referred to in the second assignment, that the compensation claimed had not been earned.

In the answers to points the court made no distinction between an entire and a severable contract, or rather between an éntire contract which may be met by substantial performance, and one that, by its nature and the intention of the contracting parties, requires a strict performance.

The first of these questions the court below submitted to the jury, for the reason that the contract was oral. The law is well settled that where a contract is in writing, its construction is for the court; where it is oral, it is for the jury: McFarland v.

As to the offers embraced in the first and second assignments, we are unable to see their relevancy. The contract, as claimed by Mc-Cauley Brothers and as found by the jury, was to sink an oil-well at the price of $1.75 per foot, without specifying the depth. The well was drilled to a depth of about 2,400 feet and until it had passed from seventy to eighty feet through what is known as the Gantz sand, when the tools were lost and could not be recovered. The garnishee company appear then to have taken possession of the well, tubed it, and pumped two thousand or more barrels of oil therefrom. The attaching creditors, representing the contractors, claimed that there had been a substantial compliance with the contract; the oil company claiming that the contract was entire, and that there was no such compliance therewith as would entitle McCauley Brothers to recover. Under this state of facts, we are unable to see the relevancy of the testimony referred to. The claim on behalf of McCauley Brothers was to recover the contract price of sinking the well, less such deduction for damages as would compensate the company for any loss sustained by it on account of the failure of McCauley Brothers to remove the tools from <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>tbe bottom of said well. It is obvious, therefore, that an inquiry into the average cost of drilling a well in 1886 could not have thrown any light upon the issue before the jury. Its only effect would have been to mislead them.</p>

We do not so regard it. In that case there was a wilful departure from the terms of the contract in several respects, as will readily be seen by the following extract from the opinion of Mr. Justice Stekrett: “In several particulars the work contracted for was not done according to the plain terms of the contract. Nearly one half of the well was not reamed out, as required, to an eight-inch diameter, so as to admit five and five eighths inch casing in the clear. About 180 feet of the lower section of the well, also, was bored four or four and one quarter inches, instead of five and five eighths inches in diameter. In neither of these particulars, nor in any other respect, was there any serious difficulty in the way of completing the work in strict accordance with the terms of the agreement.” The difference between that case and this is so obvious that extended comment is unnecessary. In the former there was a wilful departure from the terms of the contract, for. which no excuse or justification was offered. In this case there appears to have been no such departure. The jury have found that the well had been drilled to a proper depth, and the only omission was to fish up the tools from the bottom of the well, which, the evidence shows, the contractors were unable to do. The loss of the tools in this manner was a matter which might occur to any contractors. The well, as drilled, was a producing well, and the jury were properly instructed to deduct from fhe contract price any loss or damage which the company sustained by reason of the tools remaining therein.</p>
