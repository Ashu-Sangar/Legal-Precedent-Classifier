Thirty years afterward, a company was incorporated to construct a turnpike over substantially the same route, but it continued to be maintained as a public highway until about 1862, when the Franklin &amp; Oil Creek Turnpike Company was incorporated, took possession of the highway under its charter, and improved and maintained it as a toll road until in 1865, when the Atlantic &amp; Great Western Railroad Company, in the construction of its roadbed, so encroached upon the turnpike as to injure it materially. Thereupon the turnpike company abandoned the road, and it became and was once more maintained by the township as a public highway. In 1871, the franchises, etc., of the Atlantic &amp; Great Western Railroad Company were sold, and the purchasers organized as a railroad company under the name of the Now York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, the defendant in this proceeding. The principal office of the defendant company was at Cleveland, Ohio, but its principal place of business in Pennsylvania was at Meadville, Crawford Co., Pa., where an office was maintained and where Mr. Derickson, one of its directors, resided.</p>

A demurrer and replication was then filed, after which the writ was served upon D. V. Derickson, a director of the company living at Meadville, in the adjoining county of Crawford.

L. 32,] repeals the act of 1847 before recited. . The act of May, 1881, is a supplement to the act of 1886, and provides that it be amended to read as follows:. There is no repealing clause, and if any act is repealed it is by implication only. The act of 1881 is an affirmative act, and no mention is made of the act of 1847 in any of its provisions. And if such a construction can be placed upon the latter act as that <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>both may stand, it is our plain duty to so construe it. “ Repeal by implication is not favored. It is a reasonable presumption that the legislature did not intend to keep really contradictory enactments in the statute book, or to effect so important a measure as the repeal of a law without expressing an intention to do so. Such an interpretation, therefore, is not to be adopted unless it be inevitable: ” Endlich on Statutes, 280.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b86-4" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[242,731,1180,608]]]'>The act of 1881 invests the court with power to grant the writ of mandamus in certain specified cases. And, if there was no prior act in force, extending or enlarging that power, the court could not entertain jurisdiction, upon the well established rule that certain objects being specified, all not specified are excluded. But the act of 1847 was in force at that <em>time; </em>and, as the legislature did not limit the power of the courts to ■the objects .specified in the latter act, and as the legislature is presumed to be familiar with every act they propose to amend or supplement (a violent presumption, I must admit,) and as both acts can be reconciled as not in conflict, I am of the opinion that the act of 1847 was not repealed.</p>

It provides “that it shall be lawful to sue such company in any county in the state where the works of such company shall be located, or adjoining thereto, or, where any director, manager or other officer shall reside,” etc. If service could only be had in a county where one of these officers resides, the evil in the act of 1836, which is sought to be remedied, would still remain. And the important amendment, viz., the bringing of suit in any county where the works are located or adjoining thereto, would be a dead letter upon the statute book; and, that the power to simply bring suit was' not the intention of the legislature is clearly evidenced by the further provision in immediate connection, to wit, “ and such company shall be taken to be both in law and equity, for every purpose of legal proceedings,” etc. I am of the opinion that the works of the company being located in this county a service of the writ upon a director in an adjoining county was valid.

If they have occupied any portion of the road, then they are to reconstruct it again, in the most favorable location, and in as perfect a manner as the original road at the time they took it.</p>

Upon the abandonment of the road it reverted to the township authorities, and it was their duty to have the road reconstructed, if necessary, or to compel the railroad company to do so, if they had occupied any portion of the public road, and had not constructed as good a one for the use of the public.</p>

In the use of its franchise, and at the time of the building of the railway, it had possession in breadth of the roadway as you may find it; and, if defendants occupied or changed the site of the public road, they were bound to cause the same to be reconstructed in the most favorable location, of the same width, and in as perfect a manner as was the road when they occupied it. [There are some cases, where after great lapse of time, and after improvements have been honestly made upon the faith of appearances, and when parties could not have learned the true situation, and possession thus taken has been acquiesced in for more than twenty-one years, an equitable estoppel would be allowed, but, in my opinion, this is not one of those eases.

The motion to quash was properly refused. The consent of the attorney general was not necessary to the commencement of the proceedings. It was sufficient that they were instituted by the road commissioners acting in their official capacity. So much was said in Whitemarsh Tp. v. Railroad Co., <a href="/watts-serg/8/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 365" data-case-ids="483399" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0365-01">8 W. &amp; S. 365</a>. Nor, have we any doubt as to the jurisdiction. The pleadings establish all the facts necessary to give the Common Pleas of Venango county jurisdiction, and we think the service sufficient. We find nothing to criticise in the trial below.</p>
