Gavin ? Was this defendant acting bona fide in selling, as he says he was?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b659-6" data-blocks='[["BL_659.6",659,[229,1282,1166,1117]]]'>If you believe there was a bona fide agency, then the next question that arises is, were these liquors shipped in due course of trade and commerce between the state of West Virginia and this state, and were they sold in the original package of commerce as imported from the state of West Virginia, or were the liquors shipped here in original packages which, by this defendant, were broken and separated and retailed so as to suit customers who might wish to buy, but who did not wish to buy the whole of the package. [Did this defendant and P. Gavin enter into this agreement bona fide, exercising a right guaranteed to P. Gavin of West Virginia, of having his liquors imported into this state and sold in the original packages; or, was it merely a semblance of exercising this right granted under the United States constitution, and were these packages pre-tendedly shipped in the course of trade between the states, and is the arrangement set up a contract merely to evade what is a valid law in this state ? This bears upon the good faith of the claim here set up, that this man was a bona fide agent of P. Gavin, and P. Gavin was bona fide, in the due course of his business, shipping his liquors here for the purpose of selling them as ho had a right to sell them under the clause of the constitution regulating commerce between the states.] 8</p>

Gavin, and that he made no sales except in the original package of commerce. Now, gentlemen, if you believe that, then, under the law as we have given it to you, the Brooks law would be inoperative.</p>

[The commonwealth claims that this man has failed to show that there was an agency; they have commented on the fact that he goes on the stand and swears to that fact, that there was an agency; but that he failed to bring here the man who owned these liquors, the man who set up this agency, the man who had the right under the constitution to make sales in this way; that he is absent, and not called. Now, gentlemen, this bears upon the credibility of the story of this defendant, and it is a fact in the case which you will take into consideration, the fact that the man who owned the liquors, who was exercising the constitutional right, is absent from this trial and not here to corroborate this defendant in his story that he was acting as his agent and was selling his liquor as imported liquor sent here by him.] 3 The commonwealth further claims that this defence set up is not bona fide, from the fact that the liquors, as sold by the defendant, were in small bottles, half-pints or less, covered with pasteboard; and that the sealing in these pasteboard boxes of these bottles did not constitute such packages as are recognized as original packages in the world of commerce, in a business of this kind.</p>

An appeal was taken in each case, but, as no error is assigned in the last case, No. 187 of this court, No. 21 in the court below, we affirm that case without comment. Most of the questions involved have been disposed of in the cases of Commonwealth v. Zelt, ante, 615, and Commonwealth v.

It was alleged that “ there was positive evidence that defendant was such agent in good faith, and no evidence whatever to contradict it.” The only evidence in the case was the statement of the defendant himself. He testified to the agency, but was wholly unsupported. His principal was not called, nor does any effort appear to have been made to procure his <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>attendance at the trial. The defendant was not bound, as a matter of law to produce him, but his absence left his testimony unsupported, and, the evidence being q^al, it was for the jury to pass upon its credibility. Aside from this, the defendant testified that he had written authority from his principal to act as his agent, yet the writing was not produced. Strictly speaking, he had no right to testify to the contents of this paper; it should have been produced, so that the court and jury could judge of its force and effect. The non-production of this paper was a grave omission, and justified all the learned judge said about it; and, moreover, justified the jury in the conclusion that this defence was not set up in good faith. The fourth assignment does not conform to our rules, and the fifth is disposed of by what was said in the cases above referred to.</p>
