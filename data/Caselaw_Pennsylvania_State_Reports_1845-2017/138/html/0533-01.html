    <p class="summary" id="b559-5" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[195,1117,1172,1165]]]'>The most meritorious defence set up is the last averment, which we will now consider. The defendant states that Main street is a great public thoroughfare, one of the principal streets, and that the locus in quo is partly abutting on his property against which the lien is filed; that this street has been and was macadamized for many years prior to 1889, and was at the time the improvement was commenced, for which the lien is filed, in reasonably good condition and repair, and that at all times heretofore, for at least thirty years, had been kept up and repaired at public expense. From this the defendant contends that the roadway, now newly paved, is on this Main street near the court house and in the long since built up portion of the town near its centre; that having been paved by macadamizing, heretofore, at the public expense of the borough, to which the defendant contributed his quota of taxes, his property cannot now be specially assessed for the present paving. If the fact was, as stated by the defendant in his affidavit, that the locus is in the old, well built up portion of the town, that it has been paved before at the public expense, this lien cannot be enforced against him. The plaintiff’s counsel did not so much deny this principle, as he did that macadamizing, as averred in the affidavit, was an original paving within the meaning of the decisions. We cannot agree with him.</p>

What is paving? Says Webster: To lay or cover with stone or brick, so as to make a level or convenient surface for horses,” etc. In the old American.Encyclopedia, that source of reliable information, we find no large European city, except Rome with its Yia Triumphalis, had paved streets until the twelfth century. Then it says, “ Of late pavements have been much improved; stones have been -squared so as to better fit each other, or the streets have been macadamized.” What is macadamizing ? It " is defined in Webster, “To cover as a roadway, or path, with broken stone, so as to form a smooth, hard surface.” It is not pedantic we trust, in these days when much is said about good road making, to say, it is the sjrstem of roadway making established by the Scotch' engineer, John L. Macadam, who lived in New York during our Revolution, but returned to his native country, and in 1815 began it, and it became so popular that it is said, out of the 25,600 miles of public roads in Great Britain, less than 250 of them were not macadamized. Then, the system itself shows it to be a pavement, under a critical definition. We will not enlarge on it more than to remark, it contemplates large broken stones in the bottom, smaller ones toward the surface, the top covered with a crust of small stones, making a comparatively smooth, safe and convenient driveway. Then, says Justice Ag-NNW, in Wistar v. Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=80%20Pa.%20511" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="80 Pa. 511">80 Pa. 511</a>: “ What would any one ordinarily understand is meant by paving streets at the expense of lot owners ? Clearly, that paving which is customary.” Our observation recalls that the streets of our Pennsylvania towns have been macadamized as the customary pavement. Then, in Huidekoper v. Meadville City, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20Pa.%20158" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="88 Pa. 158">88 Pa. 158</a>, Judge Lowkib says: “Paving the gutters with cobble-stones and the cartway with broken stones (macadamizing), is a paving within the meaning of the act of assembly.” We conclude, then, that the averment of macadamizing is an averment of paving, within the meaning of the act of assembly and the decision, in that behalf.</p>

There the affidavit of defence recited that the part of Broad street, in question, had been “ well paved with cobble stone.laid by the city.with such material as they chose;. the entire expense thereof, both of materials for paving and the laying, were paid by the then owner of the real estate to the city,” etc. Then came Washington Ave., <a href="/citations/?q=69%20Pa.%20852" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="69 Pa. 852">69 Pa. 852</a>, approving it, while deciding the first assessment was not applicable to rural property.

In all these cases about paving, the original paving had been paid by the lot owner. No case had yet been decided, where the original paving was at public expense. On the contrary, in Huidekoper v. Meadville City, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20Pa.%20158" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="88 Pa. 158">supra,</a> the affidavit of defence averred that along a portion of the street an existing well-made pavement was removed, that the street had been open more than seventy years, and that the streets were all paved at public expense, to which defendant contiibuted his ratio, and the lien was held good. Then last fall came the case of Williamsport v. Beck, <a href="/pa/128/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="128 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="567049" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0147-01">128 Pa. 147</a>, with the syllabus: “ While the cost of an original paving of a city street may be assessed against properties abutting, as a species of taxation for special benefit accruing, the re-paving of such roadway, being a purely public duty for the general benefit, the cost thereof cannot be imposed on abutting properties, even though the cost of the original paving had been paid out of the city treasury.” Mr. Justice Stejrkett says, in the introduction of his opinion: “ The main question in this case is, whether the cost of re-paving a public street or thoroughfare can be legally charged against the property fronting thereon. This is neither a new nor an open question. It has long since been definitely settled that, as a general rule, it cannot be <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>done.” Then be proceeds to quote from Hammett’s case, and, on its principles, affirms tbe judgment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b562-4" data-blocks='[["BL_562.4",562,[246,471,1179,1919]],["BL_563.1",563,[219,367,1171,1271]]]'>With all deference to tbe learned justice, for whose ripe experience, eminent abilities and discriminating judgment we have tbe highest admiration, it <em>is </em>a new' question, whether, when a street has once been paved at the public expense in the old built-up portions of our cities and our towns, the expense of a new or re-paving can be assessed against abutting lot owners. We can find no case until this one, where it was distinctly decided. We do not find, however, in Justice Stek-rett’s opinion this question particularly discussed, but he affirms the judgment on the general principles of the Hammett case. Inasmuch as the question before us is a new one, for the act of 1889 is a new and important one to our boroughs, we have looked at this Williamsport case carefully. Its facts show: In 1868, Fourth street, the locus in question, abutting Beck, defendant, was graded and paved at public expense. In 1876, Williamsport became a city of the third class, under the act of May 28, 1874. In 1884, an ordinance was passed for the paving of Fourth street, a majority of lot owners petitioning. The pavement was made, and the net cost assessed against abutting owners under clause 82, § 20, act of 1874. On the scire facias, defendant set up the act of Mayl, 1876, P. L. 94, which prohibits councils of cities from ordaining the grading or paving of streets, etc., until the city engineer has mapped the property liable, estimated the cost, and the board of viewers viewed the location, and other requirements. Failing to do these things, the ordinance would be void. He also averred the re-paving was not an original paving under -the act of 1874. The case was tried upon these questions, no charge of the court below appearing in-the report, but only the points. The defendant’s fourth point related to the act of May 1, 1876, not being complied with, and the verdict must be for the defendant. This was affirmed. This affirmance, itself, defeated the plaintiff. The fifth point recited the street had been a highway; was paved by Williamsport in 1868; that the re-paving was necessary; “that such re-paving is not an original paving within the meaning of the 32d clause of § 20, act of May 23, 1874, hence the cost cannot be assessed to the properly holders abutting.” This was also affirmed. Either the act of 1876 or 1874 would <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>defeat tbe plaintiff. W e now look at the clause of the act of 1874 referred to. It reads, “ cause to be graded, payed or macadamized any public street, which is now or may hereafter be laid out and opened in any of the cities,” etc. Then it proceeds to provide for the collection of the expense from lot owners and the assessment by foot front, and other details. Brushing aside, for our purpose, the act of 1876 and reading the fifth point on the trial, which raised the question of the repaving in 1885 of Fourth street, paved originally at public expense in 1868, we may find warrant for the principle stated in the syllabus to have been decided. The answer to this point was the ninth assignment of error. While the answers to the other points were formally approved by Justice Stebbett’s opinion, this ninth assignment seems to have been discussed on the general principles of Hammett’s case. We find no reference in this opinion to the acts of 1874 or 1876, which were so prominent on the trial. The affirmance, then, of this judgment on the general principles of Hammett’s case must apply them to the questions raised on its trial. We must, therefore, since this Williamsport case, accept it as the law that where pavements have been originally made in the old built-up portions of our cities and towns, and kept up at the public expense a re-paving cannot be charged to the abutting lot owners. We now interpret that case as so deciding, and, if we are in error, we may be corrected.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b563-4" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[224,1647,1170,759]],["BL_564.1",564,[234,375,1172,695]]]'>We can see much reason and justice in the decision. Where the main thoroughfares of our Pennsylvania boroughs have had the customary pavements constructed and kept up from year to year at the public expense, the lot owners, having, throughout that long period, contributed an amount of tax, for the purpose, that approaches if not exceeds the cash value of their lots, it would not seem equitable to suddenly take a new departure, and tear up the old pavement for a new and more expensive one to be paid for by the lot owners, when it is for the general advantage and accommodation of the whole municipality. A careful reading of the act of 1889, which says, speaking of councils, “ shall have the power,.and cause to be paved, curbed or macadamized,.any public street or thoroughfare, or parts thereof, which is nbw or hereafter may be laid out or opened in any of said boroughs,” recalls almost <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>tbe precise language of tbe act of 1874, wbicb was in question in the Williamsport case. When tbe expression is used, “ any public street or thoroughfare which is now or hereafter may be laid out or opened in any of said boroughs,” it seems to indicate that the legislative intent was to authorize this, in the newer portions of the boroughs, or in the parts that had not already been paved. Following, however, the authority of Williams-port v. Beck, if it should appear on the trial of this case that the street fronting on the defendant’s property has been paved by macadamizing originally at public expense and so kept up, and that this is in the old, well-built-up portion of the town, the plaintiff cannot recover. We decide the question thus distinctly, so there may be an expeditious final determination of the matter.</p>
