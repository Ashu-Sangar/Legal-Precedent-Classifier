The demise was a verbal one, and its terms were in dispute; the testimony for the plaintiff tending to prove that he was to have the land for the raising of two successive crops, while witnessess for the defendant testified that it was to be used for one crop only. After so leasing to the plaintiff, Mrs. Ewing leased her entire farm to the defendant, subject to the plaintiff’s rights. The field leased to the plaintiff had at one time been separated by a fence from the adjoining field, but the fence had been burned down prior to 1887 and was not rebuilt.</p>

When he came to gather his crop, he left upon the ground the corn which had been so injured, and afterwards turned into the field the cattle in controversy, that they might feed on the damaged part of the crop. The cattle having strayed across the unfenced boundary, between the field into which they were put by the plaintiff and the adjoining field in the possession of the defendant, which was in grass and kept for pasture, and having damaged the latter to some extent, the defendant took them up, while upon his pasture land, drove them to his barn-yard, penned them up therein, and notified the plaintiff that his cattle were in the barn-yard and that if he would pay for the damage done by them, he could have them again ; and afterwards told him that he could have them “if he would pay the costs at the squire’s office.”</p>

Now, you will observe from the reading of the first section of this act of assembly, that it applies to only one kind of land; that is, improved and enclosed land. If land be unenclosed, if it has no fence surrounding it, and cattle are found upon it, they would not be regarded as trespassing under the provisions of this act of 1807.</p>

The act of 1700, to which we referred, was repealed by a subsequent act of assembly passed upon April 4, 1889, P. L. 27; so that, as regards the fencing of lands, the law now is just as it was under the common law, and it does not require the owner of land to fence the same, under the provisions of this act of 1700 ; but any cattle that are found straying upon the premises would be regarded as trespassing upon the lands of another and could be seized under the provisions of this act of 1807. But the act repealing this act of 1700, was not passed for almost two years after the seizure of the cattle by the defendant in this action, so that this case falls within the provisions of the act of 1700.</p>

The plaintiff alleges that he had rented it, as we understand him, for two years at a stipulated rent, or for two crops; he has given you his construction of that contract, and he has told you precisely, according to his recollection, what passed at the time. Upon the other hand, the defendant alleges that there was no such contract; that the lease extended but for one year, or for a single crop. In support of that contention, the defendant calls Alexander Ewing, if I remember correctly, and another witness, Mrs. Ewing, whose testimony you will recall in that connection. It is important, as the court regards it, for you to determine that as a preliminary fact, before you decide the other question of fact which will be submitted to you.</p>

We understand that the who! e field, and if the court be not correct in this point, the jury has the right to correct us, under the evidence, the whole field was surrounded by a fence; into this field, piart of which was in com and claimed by the plaintiff, and the other part of which was in pasture and claimed by the defendant, those cattle were turned.

He was not a cropper; he rented the lot for twenty dollars, and whether his term had expired at the time of the alleged trespass, was a question for the jury under the evidence. The court could not declare as matter of law that during that term he had no right to pasture his cattle there. There was no restriction in the lease as to the use of the lot. He was entitled to its product for one, or two years, as the jury might find the agreement.

The cattle included in this replevin were not so trespassing, and the appellant knew it. They were in his pasture adjoining the lot which the appellee had rented, and between these fields there was no fence. If the appellant bad taken them on the lot of the appellee, or in the highway, it is not claimed that be could find protection or justification in the act of 1807. Jurisdiction under tbat act is founded upon the facts recited in it; and if these are not present, the taking is a trespass, and for a detention in pursuance of it, replevin is an appropriate remedy. A right to take and impound cattle exists when they are found trespassing in the taker’s enciosed and improved field, and in such case the proceedings must be in strict conformity with the statute, or the taker will be held as a trespasser ab initio. But, when the taking is unlawful, proceedings under the stray law will neither legalize it, nor take away the common-law remedy of the owner.
