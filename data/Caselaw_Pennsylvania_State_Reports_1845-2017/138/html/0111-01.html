      <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>Exceptions filed by tlie plaintiffs having been overruled by the master and renewed before the court on the filing of his report, after argument thereof the court, McMiohabíTj, J., on April 28,1890, filed an opinion in part as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b137-4" data-blocks='[["BL_137.4",137,[195,578,1177,1117]]]'>The original bill in this case does not contain sufficient averments to show that any of the parties to it are entitled to the relief for which they pray. It is stated in the caption, but is not alleged in the bill, that Noble Holton is a stockholder of the company named as defendant. It is conceded that to entitle him to relief it must be admitted, or proved, that he is in fact a stockholder. Then we have this condition of things ; a fact essential to the plaintiffs’ case is not alleged in the bill. And this is not the only fact of that character which is not alleged. Morawetz on Corp., §§ 888, 384, 885, 386, and Taylor on Corp., §§ 138, 139, 140, 141, and the authorities cited by these text writers, conclusively show that a stockholder cannot maintain a suit of this character, without alleging and proving some sufficient reason why the corporation itself does not bring the suit. There is no such allegation, and no such proof in this case. Still further; Adam Treser and William Bryant are described in the caption as creditors of the company named as defendant, but there is no averment in the bill that such is the fact. Wm. Bryant is not a party. If Adam Treser be not a creditor, then he has no business in court asking for the relief prayed for in the bill. The fact that he is a creditor is then an essential fact, and it is not alleged.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b137-5" data-blocks='[["BL_137.5",137,[202,1704,1171,187]]]'>It is insisted that the defendants cannot now take advantage of these defects in the bill, because they relate to the character of the parties, and defendants should have demurred if they intended to avail themselves of these defects.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b137-6" data-blocks='[["BL_137.6",137,[201,1910,1175,501]],["BL_138.1",138,[264,379,1177,657]]]'>It is not correct to say that such defects relate to the character of the parties. They relate rather to the relation the plaintiffs have to the defendants. Let it be assumed that Noble Hol-ton is in fact a stockholder, and that, before filing this bill, he had done everything necessary to be done to entitle him to maintain the suit. Then, the solicitors on both sides would concede that so far as character is concerned he might sue. But if he fail to allege the facts, which if alleged would show his right to an' account, then this case fails, not because of his character as a party, but because he has not stated things <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>which it was necessary he should prove. If he had stated them, but failed to prove them, then the case would fail for want of proof. It fails now for the very same reason; that is, for want of proof. That is, the court does not know that he is a stockholder, and as such entitled to an account, because the court cannot hear any proof on that subject, it not being averred in the bill. Take another illustration: Suppose one member of a partnership file a bill against his copartner for an account. If he fail to prove that he was a partner, his case fails for the same reason. The court cannot then hear the evidence that he was a partner, and hence cannot learn that necessary fact. His failure is not because of his character as a party, but because he fails to prove a necessary fact.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b138-4" data-blocks='[["BL_138.4",138,[255,1044,1178,957]]]'>The important facts are those which relate to the stock, called in the report and argument the A. C. Weaver &amp; Co. stock; those which relate to whether the defendants were directors of, or had in their control or management the affairs of the New Castle. Northern Railway Company, and were therefore occupying a fiduciary relation to that company at the time of the sale of the roa^d; and those which relate to whether at the time of the sale of the road, there was any arrangement or agreement between them, or any of them, and W. W. Reed, to the effect that Reed should not bid against George W. Johnston at the sale of the road. The learned master has found the facts to be against the plaintiffs on all three of these subjects. His report has evidently been prepared with great care, and after a studied consideration of the evidence, and it is full and complete. An examination of the evidence which was before him shows that he did not find any fact against the plaintiffs without sufficient evidence to fully justify the finding, nor without the clear weight of the evidence being in favor of the conclusions which he reached.</p>

The second alleges that the court erred in holding that “ the original bill in this case does not contain sufficient averments to show that any of the parties to it are entitled to the relief for which they pray.” There are several serious defects in the bill. It is sufficient to point out one which fully justifies the ruling of the court. The bill was filed by Noble Holton, as a stockholder, to enforce the rights of the railway company. It is settled law that such suit must be brought by and in the name of the corporation; or, if brought by a shareholder, the bill must contain an averment of a demand by the shareholder upon the corporation to bring suit, and a refusal to do so. This is familiar law, and does not need the citation of authority. In addition, the bill is defective for want of proper parties, and lacks essential averments. The third assignment alleges that the court erred in sustaining the master’s findings of fact, and the fourth is the general assignment that “the court erred in confirming the master’s report.” If the master has erred in his findings of fact, it has not been made to appear. Unless clear error is pointed out, we cannot be expected to go through a vast mass of testimony to re-find <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>the facts. Both the court below and the master agree that the allegations of fraud are not sustained, and in this we think they were right.</p>
