    <p class="summary" id="b551-4" data-blocks='[["BL_551.4",551,[213,720,1176,1165]]]'>The question is not what was the moral status of the commissioners with respect to this transaction, but how were the rights of the county affected by it? We agree with the learned counsel of the defendant that this case is covered in all material points by the decision of our Supreme Court in Lerch Hardware Co. y. National Bank, <a href="/pa/109/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="109 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="542322" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0240-01">109 Pa. 240</a>. There, a negotiable note was executed in the name of the Lerch Hardware Co., Limited. It was signed by the secretary and treasurer and countersigned by the chairman. An affidavit of defence was filed alleging that the note was given for a loan of the credit of the company, but without the knowledge and consent of any of the members of the company save the chairman, and that the consent in writing of a majority of the members was not given as required by the act under which the company was organized. The court below gave judgment for the plaintiff for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, but the Supreme Court reversed this decision, on the ground that the allegations in the affidavit were sufficient to cast upon the plaintiff the burden of showing that he was a bona fide holder for value. The parallel is complete, and leads to the conclusion that the facts appearing in this case are sufficient to require of the plaintiff proof that he was an innocent purchaser for value before maturity.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b551-5" data-blocks='[["BL_551.5",551,[222,1891,1169,502]],["BL_552.1",552,[246,362,1171,337]]]'>It is contended by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that even though the facts in evidence might otherwise cast such a burden upon him, yet, inasmuch as there is no evidence that plaintiff had notice of such special matter as would put him to proof of his title, the usual presumption in his favor must prevail. It is true, the defendants did not give the plaintiff such notice. For, even if the affidavit of defence be sufficient in substance and competent for that purpose, it was not given in evidence, and therefore cannot be considered: Maynard v. Bank, <a href="/pa/98/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="98 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="496974" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0250-01">98 Pa. 250</a>. It is also true that ordinarily a plaintiff is <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>not required to prove himself a bona fide holder for value of negotiable paper, unless he has had notice of the special matter on which the defendant relies: Beltzhoover v.

But, when the evidence is indicated by the plea, and the plaintiff had knowledge of the facts relied upon, we take it the rule would not hold.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.4",552,[237,719,1177,857]]]'>The plea in this case is non-assumpsit, and the defendant relies upon the fact that there was no promise by the county of Mercer to pay these bonds; that they are not the bonds of Mercer county, as the plea implies. On the trial, the plaintiff, knowing that it was not sufficient to simply prove execution of the bonds by the county commissioners, gave in evidence the act of May 4, 1852, and the action of the grand jury, in order to show the authority of the commissioners to execute the bonds. This evidence showed that the commissioners had not such authority. It then became necessary for the plaintiff, according to his own showing, to make proof of further facts which would estop the defendant from denying the power of the commissioners to issue the bonds, to wit, that he purchased for value, in the ordinary course of business, before maturity, relying upon the act of assembly and the contents of the bonds. We think, therefore, the plaintiff cannot object to the burden which the plea and his own evidence imposed.</p>

Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/27/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="27 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="979517" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0389-01">27 Pa. 389</a>. As stated in the affidavit filed on behalf of the county, the defence set up by it was “that the issuance of the bonds upon which said claim is founded <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>was without authority of law and therefore void, and created no legal liability on the county to pay the same, or any part thereof.” The pleas were non-assumpsit and statute of limitations.</p>
    <p id="b554-4" data-blocks='[["BL_554.4",554,[274,588,1171,658]]]'>To maintain the issue on his part, the plaintiff gave in evidence said act of April 21, 1846, and the supplement thereto of May 4, 1852, authorizing the county defendant, under certain restrictions, limitations and conditions, to subscribe for the capital stock of the Pittsburgh <em>&amp; </em>Erie Railroad Company, <em>etc.; </em>also the record of the Court of Quarter Sessions of the county showing the. action of the grand jury in relation to the subscription, the minutes of the county commissioners showing the appointment of managers or directors of the railroad company, etc., the making of bonds including those in suit, and the delivery of same to the company. He then put in evidence the bonds in suit, with coupons attached, and rested. No evidence was introduced by the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b554-5" data-blocks='[["BL_554.5",554,[272,1253,1171,604]]]'>The learned judge, after instructing the jury that the bonds were collectible in the hands of innocent purchasers for value before maturity, directed them to find in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of the bonds and coupons, with interest, etc., and reserved for future consideration the question “ whether the plaintiff must show that he is an innocent purchaser for value, without notice of the illegality of the bonds.” The jury accordingly rendered a verdict for $1,333.76 in favor of plaintiff. The court afterwards entered judgment in favor of defendant on the question of law reserved, non obstante veredicto. That action of the court is the only subject of complaint in the several specifications of error.</p>
    <p id="b554-6" data-blocks='[["BL_554.6",554,[268,1865,1173,552]],["BL_555.1",555,[188,378,1172,800]]]'>The record evidence introduced by the plaintiff in this ease presented precisely the same facts that were before this court in Mercer Co. v. Railroad Co., supra, and upon which it was then adjudged that the bonds were issued without authority of law, and were therefore void. The legal effect of the evidence showing the illegality of the bonds is of course the same as if it had been introduced by the defendant. In other words, the position of the plaintiff is the same as if he had made out a prima facie case entitling him to a verdict, and the defendant had then proved the facts upon which this court in the case above cited, held that the county commissioners had no author<a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>ity to issue the bonds. The plaintiff having thus, by his own evidence, established the fact that he is the holder of bonds issued without authority of law, it necessarily followed that he was not entitled to recover without first showing that he was an innocent purchaser of the bonds in suit for value and without notice of their illegality. No attempt was made to do that, and for that reason the learned president of the Common Pleas entered judgment in favor of the defendant, non obstante vere-dicto. In doing so we think he was clearly right. There is no escape from that conclusion, unless we are prepared to overrule the ease referred to, and now hold that the bonds in question were regularly and legally issued. We are not disposed to take such a radical departure as that would be, because, in the first place, some respect is due to the maxim stare decisis ; and, secondly, because it is far from being clear that the adjudication referred to was erroneous.</p>
    <p id="b555-4" data-blocks='[["BL_555.4",555,[195,1196,1168,900]]]'>The supplement of May 4, 1852, declares that subscriptions to the capital stock of the railroad company shall be made subject to the following restrictions, limitations and conditions, and in no other manner or way whatsoever, viz.: All such subscriptions shall be made by the county commissioners <em>after, </em>and not <em>before, </em>the <em>amount </em>of such subscriptions shall have been <em>designated, </em>advised, and recommended by the grand jury; and the amount of such subscription, ordered and designated as aforesaid, may be made payable either in money or in the bonds of the county so subscribing. The grand jury signed a paper saying they would recommend the commissioners to subscribe to the capital stock of the company to such amount, and under such restrictions, as may be required by the act, to an amount not exceeding $150,000. Without any other authority than that, the commissioners subscribed for $150,000 of the capital stock, issued bonds of the county to that amount, and delivered the same to the railroad company in payment of the subscription.</p>
    <p id="b555-5" data-blocks='[["BL_555.5",555,[195,2115,1171,298]],["BL_556.1",556,[270,378,1184,1527]]]'>Speaking for the court in the case referred to, Chief Justice Lewis said: “ It is impossible to read the act of May 4, 1852, without perceiving that all discretionary power touching the subscription to the stock was given exclusively to the grand jury. They were directed to designate the amount of the subscription to be made; and, when they did so designate the <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>amount, and advise and recommend the subscription, it was imperative on the commissioners to obey. The language of the act is that the subscription ‘ shall be made ’ by the county commissioners. The mandate is repeated in the clause declaring that the subscription shall be made after the grand jury have designated, advised, and recommended the amount. It is indicated in the express prohibition of any subscription before the amount is so designated by the grand jury.That the action of the grand jury was intended to be mandatory — a command and not merely an authority — is manifest from what has already been said. The advice and recommendation of the grand jury was to be regarded as an order which the commissioners were not at liberty to disobey,” etc. The conclusion was thus reached that all discretionary power touching the subscription was given <em>exclusively </em>to the grand jury, and they could not transfer any part of it to the county commissioners or any other persons; that a mere recommendation by the grand jury to subscribe to such stock to an amount not exceeding a specific sum named, was not a compliance with the provisions of the act and conferred no authority upon the commissioners to make any subscription whatever; and that such a subscription, made without any designation by the grand jury of the amount to be subscribed, was without any' competent authority, and therefore void. This appears to be a correct construction of the act, and the only one of which it is fairly susceptible ; but, whether right or wrong, it was given in a case involving the validity of the issue of bonds, including those now in controversy, and it is plainly our duty to accept the construction then put upon the act as final and conclusive. The specifications of error are not sustained.</p>
