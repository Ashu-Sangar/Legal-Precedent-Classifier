    <p class="summary" id="b291-4" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[239,481,1177,354]]]'>“ Gentlemen : We propose to furnish and erect in place the iron work of the curves on your road, including one grip-hatch at each end of each curve, as per your drawings and specifications, placing them in such positions and at such times as your engineer may direct, and properly connecting the same with main track, for the sum of $33.74 per linear foot, measured through the centre of track from out to out of grip-hatch.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b291-5" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[242,843,1181,703]]]'>This proposal was accepted by the defendant company on July 2, 1887. There was evidence that before the proposal was made drawings were submitted, showing the detailed plans of grip-hatches and iron curve-work. There was no ground plan, but the parties agreed that it was understood that the curves were to be formed by connecting the requisite number of boxes end to end bolted together, with a grip-hatch at each end connected with the main track. The box was a large cast-iron box with expensive machine work inside it. The weight of the box alone was about 3000 lbs.; with the curve and machinery alone, 4000 lbs. There were to be a number of curves at different points on the route. The price was fixed per foot, because the exact amount required could not be determined at the time the bids were asked.</p>

This was accomplished by lengthening the radii; and, instead of placing the boxes together, they were separated and placed four and one half feet apart, with lighter and less complicated castings between them.</p>

They claimed to be paid for the whole work, at the contract price of $33.74 per foot. The defendant, however, claimed that they were entitled only to the contract price for the boxes constructed in accordance with the drawings furnished, and for the hatches and filling pieces, their actual value.</p>

That is beyond dispute; there was a change made, and, instead of putting the boxes together, they were separated and pieces four and one half feet long put between them. In the first place, was that a material change ? That is a question for you and not for the court. The model is before you; the testimony in relation to how it was made, and how it was put in, the differences between the boxes and the filling pieces have all been given. Was that a material change from the contract? Or, was it such as would come under, not the word “ curves,” but the terms “ iron work of the curves according to plans and specifications?” If it is substantially the same thing, then they would be entitled to be paid as of the original contract. If not, they are only entitled to receive pay according to its actual value, fair market value at the time.] <em>5 ... .</em>

That if the jury believe the defendant company, at the time plaintiffs made their proposal for the iron work of the curves for defendant’s road, had in contemplation the construction of three comparatively short curves on Fifth Avenue, between Craft Avenue and Short street; that said curves were to be solid curves, composed of the heavy cast-iron boxes, with machinery therein and a cover thereon, which boxes were to be laid one close up against the other, and that plans, showing such curves, so constructed, were the only plans shown to plaintiffs, and the only plans upon which their bid was made and accepted by the defendant company; and, if the jury believe that the defendant company afterwards, with the plaintiffs’ assent, changed the plans for the construction of said curves so that, instead of having three comparatively short curves between Craft Avenue and Short street, with the heavy cast-iron boxes laid up one against the other, there should be between said points practically but one continuous curve with the heavy cast-iron boxes placed, not one up against the other, but four and a half feet apart, with filling pieces in the intervening spaces, and that said filling pieces were not contemplated when plaintiffs’ proposal was made and accepted, and not <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>shown in tbe plans upon which they bid, plaintiffs can recover at the contract rate only for the cast-iron boxes, but for the filling pieces are entitled simply to what at the time they were furnished would be a fair price for said filling pieces, finished and erected in place, but no more.”</p>
