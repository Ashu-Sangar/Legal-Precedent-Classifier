After hearing defendants as to their title, he sets up this defence in rebuttal, which it was claimed and not disputed was in their abstract and gave them the right to offer the proof, that at the time the lease of March 6,1888, was executed, it was at the dwelling of Hugh McClelland; that, at the execution of this lease, C. L. Jones, who was acting for himself and the others named in the lease as grantees, McClelland, and the members of McClelland’s family, there was a parol agreement, additional to what was expressed in writing in the lease, covering that which probably ought to have been embraced in the lease in writing, to the effect that a well was to bo put down within one year within a given territory named, or the payment of money named, or the surrender of the lease. If this be true, it must be established to the satisfaction of the jury that they may find the fact, by clear and indubitable proof, and the burden of that is thrown upon the plaintiff. He must establish this fact in the way provided by the law, and by such clear and indubitable proof, as stated, that the jury will be able to say that that was a part of the agreement at that time and without which the signature of McClelland would not have been appended to the agreement. If this fact be so clearly established that you may determine from the proofs that such was the case, and without this agreement in parol, at the time, McClelland would not have executed that lease, then that becomes a part of this lease: and having so found that fact, then we think, gentlemen, you have reached the main point in the controversy now before you.</p>

This clause of surrender was not a forfeiture which can only be taken advantage of by the lessor, but was a privilege of the lessee to avoid the payment of rentals; and if the lessee did not avail himself of that privilege, an action would lie against him, but no forfeiture would accrue.

The application is governed by equitable principles.

He has therefore no equities to enforce. And the evidence also shows that possession of the lease was never given to Thompson and that he never paid value for it, and he will therefore lose nothing if the paper is not reformed.

The appeal for reformation and forfeiture being to the court sitting in equity, the duties of the judge were those of a chancellor and the verdict was merely advisory. Whether there was sufficient satisfactory evidence to justify a decree, was a preliminary question for the court. We contend that the evidence here was not of such a character as to' justify the change of a written instrument for the conveyance of land. It was essential for the plaintiff to show that McClelland signed the lease on the faith of a parol promise of forfeiture. The testimony of the understanding of others cannot help the matter, if McClelland himself did not understand that a forfeiture was to follow a breach of the parol agreement, for it was not upon the faith of what they understood that he signed the paper. Comparing his testimony upon cross-examination with his testimony in chief, it is not clear that he understood the <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>lease was to be returned if rental was not paid. But a parol agreement to return a lease is not a cause of forfeiture which can be enforced in this action. The agreement to return was a privilege the lessee had, to dissolve the relation &lt;jf landlord and tenant.

Admitting, however, that the parol promise contains a clause of forfeiture and has been made out clearly, a court of equity will not reform the lease, and in the same breath and in the same proceeding forfeit it in favor of a volunteer, simply because a small sum of money, offered to McClelland by Christie before the bringing of the suit, was not paid before March 6, 1889. Courts of equity never lend their assistance in the enforcement of a forfeiture, but leave the party to his legal remedies: Oil Creek 11. Co. V.

In any event, McClelland has no equity to reform the lease, for any recovery by him Avould be in the interest of the plaintiff; and the plaintiff has no equity, because he never had possession of the land, paid nothing for his lease and can lose nothing if he is defeated in this action. The lease made to him by McClelland was in effect merely an assignment of the right to attack the Jones lease for fraud, in a court of equity, so as to have it reformed and forfeited.

The real inquiry in the case was one for the jury, viz.: What were the terms and conditions of the Jones lease ? It was a matter of indifference what title Christie had to it, if it was ended by forfeiture. That the agreement for its forfeiture was made, and that the lease was signed on the faith of it, has been established by the testimony of five witnesses, practically uncontradicted, and by the verdict of the jury. Under well-settled principles, that agreement became a part of the lease, with the same force and effect as though written therein, and failure to perform the conditions specified avoided the lease.

The land was owned by Hugh McClelland, who made a lease to Jones and others for oil purposes in 1888. By the terms of the lease, Jones and others were to drill one test-well within two miles of the land within one year. If oil was found in paying quantities in the test-well, they were “to complete one well on the above-described premises within one year after the completion of said test-well, or, in lieu thereof, pay to the party of the first part forty dollars per annum until work is commenced.” There was no clause in the lease providing for re-entry or forfeiture. The title of the lessees, after passing through several intervening parties, lodged in the defendants, who went into possession in September, 1889, built a rig, and began to drill an oil-well.</p>

To show their title they made an offer to prove that all the former owners of the Jones lease had agreed to assign it to them in September, 1889, had received part of the purchase money, and had put them into possession ; that in pursuance of this bargain an assignment was drawn up, signed and acknowledged by all the grantors, except one, on the 24th day of September, 1889, and by him in December, on the day after the <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>issuing of the writ in this case; that tbe grantor who had not signed when the writ was issued bad assented to the terms of the sale, and received his share of the money paid, before suit brought; and that the defendants after their entry had expended several thousands of dollars in preparing for and in drilling an oil-well on the land, before the writ in this case was issued. Upon these facts the defendants could successfully defend their possession, unless. the plaintiff, who was a subsequent lessee, had acquired his title in good faith and without notice of their rights.</p>
    <p id="b272-4" data-blocks='[["BL_272.4",272,[252,880,1186,1321]]]'>To show that this was not the case, they made- a further offer to prove by McClelland, both upon his cross-examination and again when called by them, the circumstances under which he made the lease to the plaintiff. Their offer was to show that McClelland went to the law-office of J. M. Thompson and W. C. Thompson, who were law-partners, and father and son, for advice in regard to the best manner to proceed in order to terminate the lease to Jones and others; that J. M. Thompson advised, as the cheapest and most expeditious method, the making of a new lease, and putting it upon record so as to secure priority over the unrecorded lease to Jones; that he suggested his son and law-partner as the person to whom the new lease should be made; that the lease was accordingly drawn by him and executed by McClelland for the express purpose oí being used to defeat the title of the holders of the Jones lease. These offers were competent, and the evidence should have been received. <em>W. </em>C. Thompson cannot profit by a lease-obtained for him by his law-partner, without being affected by notice of the facts brought to the attention of his partner during the negotiation and which formed the inducement to the lease: Bracken v. Miller, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 102" data-case-ids="1856421" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0102-01">4 <em>W. </em>&amp; S. 102</a>. Having notice, he took subject to the title of the holders of the first lease, notwithstanding the fact that their lease was not recorded: Swank v. Phillips, <a href="/pa/113/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="113 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="457577" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0482-01">113 Pa. 482</a>. He stood, therefore, in the shoes of his lessor, and could not recover unless McClelland' could have done so if the action had been brought by him.</p>

McClelland could not have recovered in ejectment, therefore, because, by the terms of the lease, it was money, not the possession of the <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>tenants, which delay in completing the well entitled him to demand. Understanding exactly the position of the case, the plaintiff next attempted to reform the lease by adding a clause of forfeiture. He proved by McClelland and members of his family that he was induced to sign the lease by means of a contemporaneous verbal agreement that if the well was not drilled, as provided, within one year, and the forty dollars was not paid, the lease should be delivered up. This was denied by Jones, who negotiated for and wrote the first lease, and it was not consistent with the terms of that instrument. It is not easy to see how, upon this state of the evidence, a chancellor could pronounce the evidence of the alleged omitted clause to be “ clear, convincing, and indubitable,” as was done in answer' to one of the plaintiff’s points ; but, as the learned judge had the witnesses before him, we will not undertake to say that his conclusion was wrong.</p>
    <p id="b273-4" data-blocks='[["BL_273.4",273,[228,1196,1178,1015]]]'>The defendant’s fourth point drew attention to the position of the plaintiff, the kind of relief he was seeking, and the rules prevailing in courts of equity upon the subject of forfeitures. It was refused without any explanation of the subjects to which it referred. This was misleading. The rule undoubtedly is that the right to declare a forfeiture must be, distinctly reserved; that the proof of the happening of the event on which the right is to be exercised must be clear; that the party entitled to do so must exercise his right promptly; and that the result of enforcing the forfeiture must not be unconscionable. In this case the existence of the right was denied. There had been no attempt to exercise it except by means of the device suggested by counsel of executing a new lease. The lessees were in actual possession, and for several months had been engaged in the work of drilling a well on the premises. It would hardly be contended that, if McClelland was in a court of equity with a bill to reform this lease for the purpose of enabling him to assert a forfeiture upon the facts of this case, as they were shown, and as the defendants offered to show them, the conscience of a chancellor would be moved to aid him by a decree.</p>
    <p id="b273-5" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[236,2220,1173,196]],["BL_274.1",274,[261,374,1176,752]]]'>The sixteenth assignment of error is also sustained. The court was asked to say to the jury if they found that a verbal agreement providing for a forfeiture of the lease was made by Jones as the plaintiff alleged, yet if they also found that in<a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>terests in the lease were afterwards sold for a valuable consideration, without notice of the verbal agreement so made, their verdict must be for the defendants to the extent of such interests. The court refused so to charge. It is well settled that a bona fide purchaser, without notice of a secret agreement or trust, takes the title discharged from such agreement or trust, and that he can convey a good title even though his vendee has had actual notice: Bond v. Stroup, <a href="/binn/3/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="3 Binn. 66" data-case-ids="1791066" data-case-paths="/binn/3/0066-01">3 Binn. 66</a>; Bracken v.

The plaintiff sought to avail himself of this rule, and claimed to be a lessee without notice, and in good faith, with a recorded title. The trouble was not with the rule he invoked, but with the facts embodied in the defendants’ offers, which were calculated to fix him with notice.
