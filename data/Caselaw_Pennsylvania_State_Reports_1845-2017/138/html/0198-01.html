    <p class="summary" id="b224-6" data-blocks='[["BL_224.6",224,[245,1072,1173,494]]]'>1. The contract of 1861 between Bernard McLaughlin and John D. Collins was executory, and made upon condition that Collins should comply with the covenants to be kept by him during the lifetime of Bernard McLaughlin. Unless the jury is satisfied that he has substantially complied with his agreement, the verdict of the jury must be for plaintiffs, excluding Lawrence McLaughlin, to the extent of the undivided three fourths of the land in dispute, subject to the interest of Julia McLaughlin, widow of Bernard McLaughlin, under the intestate laws.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b224-7" data-blocks='[["BL_224.7",224,[243,1583,1172,647]]]'>Answer: The first part of this point is affirmed, unless the jury are satisfied from the evidence that Bernard McLaughlin received a substantial compliance with the agreement on the part of John D. Collins, or excused him-from such substantial compliance; or, unless he accepted other services or the services of other persons, in place of such substantial compliance with the terms of the agreement. The last part of the point is not affirmed. If the jury find for the plaintiffs, the verdict should be for all the plaintiffs, except Lawrence McLaughlin, for the undivided three eighths of the land described in the writ of ejectment, said three eighths not to include the mansion house on said premises or the buildings appurtenant thereto.4</p>

The contract of 1861 was executory, and the legal title remained in Bernard McLaughlin during his lifetime, and at his death descended to the plaintiffs in this casé. When it <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>was made, defendant Collins was put into concurrent possession of tbe premises witb Bernard McLaughlin, but abandoned it in 1882. Haying retaken possession after Bernard McLaughlin’s death, without the consent of plaintiffs, who then had the legal title, his present possession as to plaintiffs is clandestine, and he occupies the position of one seeking specific performance, out of possession, of a contract resting in parol, or partly resting in parol. Under these circumstances, he is not entitled to specific performance of the contract, but must be remitted to his action at law for damages. The verdict of the jury must therefore be for plaintiffs, omitting Lawrence McLaughlin, for the undivided three fourths of the land in dispute, subject to the rights of Julia McLaughlin, widow of Bernard McLaughlin, under the intestate laws.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b225-5" data-blocks='[["BL_225.5",225,[229,1127,1172,646]]]'>3. The evidence on the part of defendants shows, if it is sufficient for any purpose, that when the contract of 1861 was abandoned in 1882, a new contract, complete in itself and founded upon a new consideration, was entered into by parol. This contract is void under the statute of frauds, and the contract of 1861 is invalid by reason of non-performance of conditions. The defendant Collins must therefore be remitted to his action at law for damages against Bernard McLaughlin’s estate, and the verdict in this case must be for plaintiffs, excluding Lawrence McLaughlin, for the undivided three fourths of the land, subject to the rights of Julia McLaughlin, widow of Bernard McLaughlin, under the intestate laws.</p>

The title set up by the defendant, Collins, in this action, is upon an executory contract in writing for the conveyance of the land in dispute, and this contract was not kept or performed by Collins. An attempt to excuse performance is set up by defendants, under the allegation that other services by Collins’s minor son were substituted for the services stipulated for in the contract; that the services to be substituted were considered as of less value than those Collins had agreed to perform; that McLaughlin was to engage others to do the farming which Collins had been doing theretofore; that Collins was to do other work, earn money and improve the farm; that in consideration <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>of the reduced value of the services to be rendered, McLaughlin was to receive an increased portion of the profits of the land. This contract, if made at all, was a new contract; substituted for the old, and was in parol; it was binding upon Collins’s son only until he became of age; it was .not kept by Collins, for the improvements to be made by him were never made. Such a claim made against a dead man’s estate and based largely upon loose declarations that the farm was intended for Collins, that it had been given to him, or other like loose declarations, require the closest scrutiny and are insufficient to establish the existence of a contract enforceable under the statute of frauds and perjuries. There being no evidence, then, of performance of the contract of 1861, from 1882 until after Bernard McLaughlin’s death in 1887, the verdict must be for plaintiffs, excluding Lawrence McLaughlin, for the undivided three fourths of the land in dispute, subject to the interest of Julia McLaughlin, widow of Bernard McLaughlin, under the intestate laws.</p>

Collins. As a consideration for the deed, Collins was to perform certain things, McLaughlin reserving the possession during his lifetime. What Collius was to do appears by the agreement bearing even date with the deed. It was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b227-5" data-blocks='[["BL_227.5",227,[235,772,1177,914]]]'>“And the said John D. Collins hereby further agrees that he will continue to live with and labor for the said Bernard McLaughlin for and during the time of his natural life, take care of him and Julia, his wife, in old age or sickness, and in all respects perform his duty towards them as a son; that after the death of the said Bernard McLaughlin he will pay or cause to be paid unto the said Julia McLaughlin the annual sum of fifty dollars, or pay to her the value thereof in grain at market price.and in sickness or old age to pay to her such further sum as may be necessary for her comfortable maintenance and support, or.to furnish the said Julia McLaughlin with a comfortable room in the dwelling-house of the said Bernard McLaughlin, together with comfortable wearing apparel, fuel, attendance, board at his own table, and in all respects furnish her with a comfortable and proper maintenance in health, sickness and old age, and at her death bury her in a decent and Christianlike manner, and sot up a suitable tombstone at her grave.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b227-9" data-blocks='[["BL_227.6",227,[246,1692,1173,708]],["BL_228.1",228,[235,364,1173,542]]]'>Agreements of this kind are quite common and they frequently lead to litigation. This case is no exception to the rule. After the death of Bernard McLaughlin, and during the lifetime of his widow, the collateral heirs of the former brought this action of ejectment against Collins, to recover the possession of the premises conveyed by the deed before mentioned. They allege that Collins did not keep his covenants, and that therefore, the heirs of McLaughlin have a right of entry for condition broken. It may well be questioned whether their remedy, if any, is not by suit upon the covenants contained in the agreement. But we decide this case upon other grounds. Neither McLaughlin in his lifetime, nor his widow since his death, has made any complaint of the breach of any of the covenants to be performed by Collins. The widow is still liv<a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>ing with and cared for by him, as stipulated in the agreement. She makes no complaint; on the contrary, she is entirely satisfied with her treatment, and with the manner in which Collins has kept and is keeping his covenants.' Under such circumstances, it is difficult to see what standing the collateral heirs of Bernard McLaughlin have to meddle in this matter. It is not the case of the grant of an estate upon condition, with the condition unperformed. On the contrary, if we concede it to be an estate upon condition, the condition has been performed in a manner entirely satisfactory to the only parties interested therein.</p>
