Moreover, the respondent apprehends that the same distinction has, in effect, been recognized by your honorable Court in the opinion delivered in Reed’s Appeal, supra. The application in that case was for a wholesale liquor license. What was there said was predicated, therefore, of such a license, which, of course, does not contemplate a necessity for the house.</p>

In attempting to decide as to the necessity of sales of <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>liquors, tbe Court of Quarter Sessions exceeded its powers and failed to exercise the discretion Tested in it by the act of assembly. The interpretation which it put upon § 7, act of May 13, 1887, P. L. 108, seems to be based upon the idea that the statute has in view only the regulating and restraining of the sales of intoxicating liquors, and has no purpose affecting the right of any one to keep a house for the entertainment of the <em>public; </em>that is, that the act of 1887 is a step in advance of all previous retail license laws, and that such a license is not necessarily connected with the keeping of a hotel or an eating house. Such a construction of the law is not tenable. <em>“ </em>The whole theory upon which retailers are licensed, and it is the theory of the law, is that they are needed for the public accommodation, to provide places where strangers and travelers may rest and procure needed refreshment: ” Pollard’s Petition, <a href="/pa/127/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="127 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="565764" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0507-01">127 Pa. 507</a>.</p>

L. 40, as will appear by a comparison of the two acts. The act of 1867 has been clearly construed by this court, in Schlaudecker v. Marshall, <a href="/pa/72/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="72 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="434608" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0200-01">72 Pa. 200</a>, as requiring the license court to ascertain, inter alia, the necessity of the applicant’s house for the accommodation of the public, as a hotel or as an eating house. Under that ruling the application should have been granted in this case, upon the facts found by the court. The dictum of this court in Reed’s App., <a href="/pa/114/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="114 Pa. 452" data-case-ids="550040" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0452-01">114 Pa. 452</a>, does not, and was not intended to overrule Schlaudecker v.

The question raised here was not considered, and it is not possible that a well-considered case like Schlaudecker v. Marshall, would be reversed or modified by a dictum in a per curiam decision.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b145-5" data-blocks='[["BL_145.5",145,[228,2062,1173,352]],["BL_146.1",146,[239,387,1182,609]]]'>3. The act of May 13, 1887, was not intended to abolish the sale of liquors, but merely to curb and license the same. In passing a law to restrain and regulate such sales, the legislature has decided the question of their necessity, for the legislators would not have stultified themselves by passing a law to license sales which are unnecessary. It is absurd to say that sales might be necessary in some places and not in others, for what<a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>ever is required to accommodate the public and entertain strangers and travelers in one place, is equally necessary in all others. If a hotel is required for that purpose, the question whether or not the citizens of the district in which it happens to be situated, think, as a matter of morality or expediency, that the sale of liquors is unnecessary, is .beside the case, for the legislature has already determined that questioñ in passing the law. The interpretation which has been put upon the act in this case, makes it a local option law, broader than the local option act of March 27,1872, P. L. 49, since it' permits the citizens of the district to determine what particular houses shall have license. This the legislature never intended.</p>

In Reed’s App., <a href="/pa/114/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="114 Pa. 452" data-case-ids="550040" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0452-01">114 Pa. 452</a>, we said: “ The action of the court in granting the license complained of, is something that we cannot review, that being a matter of discretion, though we are satisfied that there was a misapprehension of the intent of the act of 22d March, 1867.” In the late case of Rauden-busch’s Petition, <a href="/pa/120/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="120 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="559860" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0328-01">120 Pa. 328</a>, in alluding to this discretion we said: “ It has been exercised by that court (Quarter Sessions),, almost time out of mind, and the power has again and again been affirmed by this court. This discretion, however, is a legal discretion, to be exercised wisely and not arbitrarily. A judge who refuses all'applications for license, unless for cause shown, errs as widely as the judge who grants all applications. In either case, it is not the exercise of judicial discretion, but of arbitrary power. The law of the land has decided that licenses shall be granted to some extent, and has imposed the duty upon the court of ascertaining the instances in which the license shall be granted. In order to perform this duty properly, the act of assembly has provided means by which the conscience of the court may be informed as to the facts; it may hear petitions, remonstrances, or witnesses, and we have no doubt the court, may, in some instances, act of its own knowledge.” ■ In Schlaudecker v. Marshall,.<a href="/pa/72/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="72 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="434608" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0200-01">72 Pa. 200</a>, Mr. Justice Ag-NEW, in referring to the same subject, said: “Whether any or all licenses should be granted, is a legislative, not a judicial question. Courts sit to administer the law fairly, as it is given to them, and not to make or repeal it. The law of the land has determined that licenses shall exist, and has imposed upon the court the duty of ascertaining the proper instances in which the license shall be granted, and therefore has given it to the court to decide upon each case' as it arises in due course of law. The act of deciding is judicial, and not arbitrary or wilful. The discretion vested in the court is, therefore, a sound judicial discretion; and, to be a rightful judgment, it must be exercised in the particular case and upon the facts and circumstances before the court, and after they have been heard and duly considered: in other words, to be exercised upon the merits of each case, according to the rule <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>given by tbe act of assembly. To say that I will grant no license to any one, or that I will grant it to every one, is not to decide judicially on the merits of the case, but to determine beforehand without a hearing, or else to disregard what has been heard,- it is to be determined not according to law, but outside of law, and it is not a legal judgment, but the exercise of an arbitrary will.”</p>
    <p id="b149-4" data-blocks='[["BL_149.4",149,[202,736,1174,1521]]]'>I have given these copious extracts from tbe opinions of this court to emphasize the fact that the law not only gives to the judges of the Court of Quarter Sessions the discretion of granting or refusing licenses, but also requires such discretion to be exercised in a sound judicial manner, and also casts upon them the responsibility. That responsibility they cannot evade by throwing it upon the remonstrants, or upon this court. To refuse a license, because, in the mind of the judge, there is a belief that licenses should not be granted at all as a matter of policy, is to make law, not to administer it. The judge to whom an application is made may inform his conscience in the manner before pointed out. He may hear remonstrances, and it is his duty to give them due weight; but, after all, the responsibility rests with him, and he must exercise his own judgment and discretion in the light which such aids have furnished. In the case in hand, there appears to have been an unusual effort, both for and against the application. The number of remonstrants considerably exceeds that of tbe petitioners. This is all very well, so far as it is addressed to the discretion of the court. The result is not conclusive upon him. Otherwise, we would have local option without the sanction of an act of assembly, yet enforced by the judiciary. In the case in hand, the learned judge has undoubtedly attached great weight to the remonstrances. He does not appear, however, to have wholly substituted the judgment of the remonstrants for his own. The most that can be said is that they were of sufficient weight to convince him that the license was not a matter of public necessity. In the view we take of the case, this was not an abuse of discretion. We are not called upon to say whether it was exercised wisely.</p>
