Mr. Dickey came down to Wilkins’s Mill with Carrier, and he came to the meeting on August 31st, and there is no evidence that he made known to anybody at that time, this claim. He does not say so himself, and there is no evidence that at that time he made any assertion of claim. On the contrary, he put in a claim that might be inconsistent with such claim; namely, a claim for the amount of $10,500, which, if this balance of 34,000 feet of timber belonged to him and would not be included as a debt of Wilkins to him, would be about $5,000 in excess of their rightful claim.

His testimony goes no further than that. Were they sent home? If they were, that would be some evidence that the rafts, so far as the ropes were con<a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>cerned, had undergone some change; that the timber was either being used or a change had been made in the location, or else that they had been tied with new or other ropes. It will be for you to say, if that is the fact, because all of this is for the jury, whether that would have been sufficient evidence to have put these plaintiffs upon notice, if the ropes were sent home, and made it a duty upon them to have come down, as careful men, to see whether their timber was being used, or appropriated or disposed of by Mr. Wilkins. But they were not bound to do so, if that was the contract. We are simply treating that as one of the elements of this case, as affecting them with notice, and affecting them with the duty of looking after their own interests.] 8</p>

I mean there was no legal restraint upon him in using the timber as he saw proper. Even, as we have been requested to instruct, if there was such a conditional contract existing between tbe two parties, although binding upon the parties themselves as to themselves, it would not be binding as such on other creditors or innocent purchasers of the property.

What we know by fraud, is where one by a contract or representations undertakes or attempts to deceive and cheat another; takes undue or improper-ad vantage of him. It is necessary for you to consider, in this aspect, what the character was in reference to that position of the plaintiffs in this case, because if there was a fraud perpetrated upon Darrah at the time, and that led to the execution of the contract and the delivery of the timber, and Darrah relied upon that, then tbe contract was void as to Darrah and he would not be bound by it or held to it, be representing the plaintiffs, unless tlris was something occurring subsequent to tlie actual contract between the parties. If it occurred after <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>there was an actual contract between the parties, and both parties were bound by the contract, then the subsequent declarations of Wilkins would not effect it and would not avoid it. If he had made the declarations subsequent to that, and there had been an actual delivery of the timber or actual sale and it was completed, those declarations if fraudulent, would not bind Wilkins, nor them. It would be, so far as that is concerned, however flagrant the declarations may have been, innocent, as affecting the status of the parties with regard to their contract. If that contract had been completed and was an executed contract between the parties, or even if it was executory between the parties, it might be deemed so.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_1" id="ref_footnote_0_1">*</a>.</p>

Now, as to the facts, you will have to ascertain them. Was that treated as a contract between the parties, without their having any other contract ? There may have been more than this, or there may not, with reference to this particular transaction; it will be for you to say. It is in writing. It has reference to what was done. It refers to an actual sale, and speaks of it as an actual sale further on, but it does not specify that there was any condition attached to that sale. It may not have been thought of, by either of the parties, to have attached any such reference to the conditional sale, or it might imply that that is all that was done in the contract. That is for the jury. If it was a contract, which is an agreement entered into for a consideration between two parties to do or not to do a certain thing, having reference to the assent of two persons concurring or agreeing to a certain matter, either the sale of property or some service one to the other; or, it may be the contract is complete when one agrees to do for another a certain act, or agrees to deliver to another a certain article for a stipulated or valuable consideration. Now, it will be for you to say, under all the evidence, whether this was the whole contract as made between the parties. If it was all the contract, then we have to agree with what we have been requested to charge, that it <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>could not be explained by outside evidence, if that was tbe entire contract, unless it were shown that the other part of it was omitted by fraud or accident or mistake. But, if this is not the contract, then the evidence of what occurred contemporaneously to the making of this paper is competent evidence, and you have a right to give it your consideration. You also take into consideration, what was the duty, if there was any duty, upon these parties to reduce the whole of an important contract of that character to writing, when they had pen, ink and paper before them.] 3.</p>

It will not do to find that one party said, you may have the timber and keep it or hold it, but it must be assented to. It must be a completed contract, so far as it goes, by the assent of the other party. Whether that was so in this transaction, it will be for you to say from the testimony. If Wilkins simply said, “ you can keep the timber until it is paid for,” unless that is made a complete contract between the two and agreed to as between the two, it may have been a mere offer, and unless accepted as an offer, it would not affect this case with reference to the conditional sale.

    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[256,426,1172,1060]]]'>Tbe learned court below, in a very clear and impartial charge to the jury, carefully explained to them that the defendant was the assignee, for the benefit of creditors, of Gr. W. Wilkins; and that, as such, he was “ the direct representative of Wilkins. He stands, as it were, in Wilkins’s shoes; and we may say, further, which we are really requested to do in one of the points, that the remedy against him is the same and the rights of Houston are the same, as would be the remedies and rights with respect to Wilkins. They stand together; he, representing Wilkins, is subject to the like questions that Mr. Wilkins would be with respect to this property.” The first and second points submitted by the plaintiffs, embodying the same ideas, were affirmed without qualification. At considerable length, and in precise language, the court, in the general charge, explained to the jury that if the contract between the plaintiff and Wilkins was as the plaintiffs alleged it to be, a conditional contract, reserving the title in the plaintiffs until the notes were paid, the complete ownership of the lumber would not pass to Wilkins until the money was paid. We do not think it possible the jury could have misunderstood the meaning of the court upon this subject.</p>
    <p id="b514-5" data-blocks='[["BL_514.6",514,[259,1495,1172,906]],["BL_515.1",515,[217,379,1167,195]]]'>The first assignment of error, selecting a single expression from the charge, to the effect that, even if such a conditional contract as was set up by the plaintiffs was the real contract of the parties, it would not have been binding as against other creditors or innocent purchasers, complains of that as error; and the argument in support of it is conducted upon the theory that the court instructed the jury, in this sentence of the charge, in contradiction to their answer to the plaintiffs’ second point, and practically took from the plaintiffs the benefit of the other portions of the charge, because there were other creditors, but who claimed only through the assignee. It is true, there were other creditors of the assignor, but this was in no sense a contest between them and the plaintiffs. What was said by the court in the sentence complained of was perfectly sound law, and the court cannot be convicted of error because of its utterance. If the court had said or intimated that, as between creditors claiming through the assignee and the plaintiffs, the conditional sale alleged by the plaintiffs was void, it <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>would bare been error. But no such idea was expressed, in either the language complained of or in any other part of the charge. On the contrary, the exact opposite of this was repeatedly declared to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b515-4" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[222,582,1172,1367]]]'>The second assignment cannot be sustained, unless the court submitted to the jury a fact of which there was no evidence. But, in point of fact, Wilkins, Hooks, and McGregor testified that the plaintiffs’ lines were taken off, and Wilkins’s lines were put on. Hooks said he took off the plaintiffs’ lines and put on those of Wilkins, and that this was done early in the spring, soon after the timber was brought to Peart’s eddy; and he further said he took the lines to Wilkins’s property, and there tabbed them in the name of Collins, McCain &amp; Co. McGregor testified that he helped Hooks to take off the linos ; that they were taken away to the boat yard and were tabbed, and he took them in that condition from the boat yard to the depot, and the next day he did not see them there. It cannot be said there was no evidence that the plaintiffs’ lines had been removed from the timber and sent to them. As there was no denial that they had been received, on the part of the plaintiffs, some inference would have been justified that they reached their destination; but all that the court charged was to leave it to the jury to say whether the ropes had been sent home, and, if that were so, whether that was notice to the plaintiffs that their timber had undergone some change, and whether, as careful business men, if the timber was still theirs according to their theory, they ought not to come down and look after it to see whether it had been used or appropriated by Wilkins. Certainly there was no error in this. It was only a question as to what a prudent man would do in such circumstances, and it was left entirely to the jury to decide.</p>

The court below did not charge, either in answer to the defendant’s first point, or anywhere else, that there was a written contract between the parties, and that it was the best evidence. In answer to the defendant’s first point, which was altogether hypothetical and depended upon the belief of the jury, the court affirmed the point, “ if the jury find the fact that there was a written contract.” In the charge, the court had very fully and with entire correctness reviewed the contentions of the parties on the <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>question whether there t^as a written contract. Two quite important writings had been given in evidence, both dated on Api’il 29, 1887, when the sale was consummated. One was an entry made in the pass-book of the plaintiffs, and produced by them on notice and subpoena, in these words:</p>
    <blockquote id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[242,626,1167,247]]]'>“ April 28th, ’87. G. W.

Cash, §5,141.94; four months note, §5,141.94; six months’ note, §5,141.96; making total, §15,425.84.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.5",516,[242,880,1167,93]]]'>The other was the receipt given by the plaintiffs to Wilkins on the same day, as follows, viz.:</p>
    <blockquote id="b516-6" data-blocks='[["BL_516.6",516,[239,982,1172,297]]]'>“ Brattonville, April 29th, 1887. Received from G. W.

On the contrary, they left it to the jury to say, on all the evidence in the cause, verbal and written, what the real contract was. The plaintiffs were allowed to give, and did give, all the verbal testimony they had to offer as to what the contract was; and the court left it all, together with the writings, in a way most fair and impartial in all respects, to' the jury, to say what the actual contract of the parties was. To have refused to give any effect to the writings, or to allow the jury to do so, would have been the gravest error. Everythingthat the plaintiffs could ask was accorded to them, and every opportunity to have all their oral testimony considered, in determining what the contract was, was allowed. Very much other testimony was given entirely inconsistent with the plaintiffs’ theory that they were to remain the owners of the timber until the purchase money was all paid, and it is not to be wondered at that the jury failed to take that view of the case. What the court said as to the <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>effect of the contract, if it was in writing, upon the parol testimony tending to change it, was entirely correct. The third and fourth assignments axe not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b517-4" data-blocks='[["BL_517.4",517,[209,528,1172,603]]]'>The same remarks are true as to the fifth and sixth assignments. The court refused to affirm the second point of the defendant, requiring an instruction that the plaintiffs would be estopped, by force of the facts stated in the point, from alleging a conditional sale, but left the whole matter to the jury to say how far the facts alleged in the point tended to rebut the plaintiffs’ theory of such a sale. As the facts in question were strikingly inconsistent with the contention of the plaintiffs that they were the owners of the timber after the sale, the action of the court was as favorable to the plaintiffs as they could ask. No question was raised by the point and answer as to any other lumber than that which was in dispute.</p>
    <p id="b517-5" data-blocks='[["BL_517.5",517,[212,1138,1170,707]]]'>Seventh assignment. As the timber was delivered to the plaintiffs, and the defendant pleaded property, the court correctly charged the jury that, if they found for the defendant, he was entitled to a return of the property, and also to damages for the detention. They were also instructed that the measure of damages would be the interest on the value of the timber during the time it was out of the defendant’s possession. On the trial, plaintiffs admitted the quantity taken under the writ, and proof was offered of a sale of part of the timber at eighteen cents a foot, which was two cents a foot more than the price at which the timber was bought. We cannot say that an allowance of damages for the detention, by way of interest on the value, was erroneous. In an action on the bond, any difficulty from this source can be prevented, if necessary.</p>
