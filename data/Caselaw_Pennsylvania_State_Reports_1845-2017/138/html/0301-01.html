That act, therefore, is unlike the railroad, schoolhouse and similar acts, which expressly provide for a comparison of advantages and disadvantages. A special benefit to the land cannot be shown in a case like this, for the plain reason that the law does not so provide. It is difficult to see how, in the case of a natural-gas company, there can be such a thing as a special benefit of a particular piece of property; but, at all events, the testimony <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>for tbe defendant, admitted nnder objection, tended to establish not a special benefit, but one common to the neighborhood through which the line passes.

    <p class="summary" id="b329-6" data-blocks='[["BL_329.5",329,[251,698,1178,1118]]]'>The vice of the argument made by the appellant’s counsel, respecting the measure of damages, lies in the assumption that this depends upon the act of assembly. The constitution entitles the landowner to “ just compensation for property taken, injured or destroyed ” by either a railroad company or a gas company, and he is entitled to no moje as against a corporation of either kind. It is thoroughly settled in this state that when a landowner gets the surplus of damages over special benefits, he gets just compensation. To hold that the rule prescribed in the railroad act of February 19,1849, P. L. 79, is binding on the landowner, is to hold that it gives him all that the constitution gives him, and merely states the measure of damages as the courts would have stated it without the aid of the legislature. The rule applied in the case at bar has been applied, ever since the adoption of the present constitution, in proceedings for consequential damages by action on the case, where there is no legislative measure of damages. It was competent to show what kind of a line the one in question was, and that the company furnished gas to any one that wanted it, just as it is competent to show what kind of a railroad an assessment relates to, whether for the carriage of both passengers and freight or only the latter.</p>

In the case of railroads, and in some other instances where corporations are clothed with the power of eminent domain, the legislature has provided that the damages shall be determined after a fair and just comparison of the advantages and disadvantages to the property taken: See § 11, act of February 19, 1849, P. L. 84. We have therefore only the constitutional provision, that “ just compensation for property taken, injured or destroyed,” shall be made by a corporation which takes private property for public use by virtue of its right of eminent domain. What is “ just compensation ?” Is it anything more than the surplus of damage over the special benefits conferred? The legislature has practically said that this fills the constitutional requirement when land is taken by a railroad corporation. And if it does so in that instance, why not in the case where land is taken by a gas company ? The landowner is entitled to no more than “ just compensation.”</p>
