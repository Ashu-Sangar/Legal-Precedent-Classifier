I fixed the line of Fifth Avenue, as shown on the plan, and as fixed on the ground by buildings and by the street, as it has been approved, and then measured from Fifth Avenue up to this lot line. The distance from Fifth Avenue along Heisel street is 220 feet, and along the alley it is 220 feet, eleven feet from Fifth Avenue. I marked this line that divides lots 74 and 75, and located the houses in a general way on the sketch that is shown here by the dotted lines.</p>

There are two houses on lot 74, one at each end of the lot. There is a frame house standing on lot 75 fronting on the alley; it stands about ten inches on its own ground at the time I made the survey. The house that was on lot 74 was being moved, and was not entirely up to this house which was over on lot 75, but there was still a little space between the houses, which was, I think, about six or eight inches over on lot 75, and was in process of being moved.”</p>
