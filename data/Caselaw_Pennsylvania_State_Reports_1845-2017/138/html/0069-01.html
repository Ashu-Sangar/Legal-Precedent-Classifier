    <p class="summary" id="b95-4" data-blocks='[["BL_95.4",95,[199,721,1164,139]]]'>There were three affidavits read in support of the bill, and the prayer is that the defendants be enjoined from collecting this tax, and for further relief.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b95-5" data-blocks='[["BL_95.5",95,[201,873,1167,710]]]'>Upon the part of the defendants, there was one affidavit introduced, that of S. H. McKinney, one of the defendant commissioners. It sets out that the new building stands entirely upon one of the lots; that it was erected for a parsonage; that the two buildings are entirely separate and distinct; that the walls and the roof are separate, and that the new building could be entirely removed without in any way involving the disintegration of the church building; and that, although a Sunday school class may be taught occasionally in one of the rooms and mass said occasionally in the other, the old church building is where the Sunday school is held and mass ordinarily is said, and that the attachment of the new building to the old church, in the manner by the defendant alleged, is but for the purpose of escaping taxation upon the parsonage.</p>

Mr. Ramsdale, the architect, says he constructed the new building; that it was built with the view to use a part of it for religious worship; that the addition is joined to the old part in solid stone and brick work; that a portion of the stone and brick was torn out of the old wall; that a part of the old cornice and roof was torn off, and the addition roof and old roof were built in together, as one, and that the entire structure as it now stands forms a single building, no part of which could be removed without causing disfiguration and disintegration. J. S. Mc-Garry and John E. Maher fully corroborate Mr. Ramsdale, the architect, as to the construction of the building, and further say, that at least two rooms of the addition are in daily use as <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>places of stated, religious worship, and that tbe saying or repeating of mass constitutes the principal part of tbe religious worship of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>

L. 158.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b96-5" data-blocks='[["BL_96.5",96,[256,722,1172,912]]]'>A number of cases have been cited by counsel for the complainant and the defendants, but I have not discovered any, where the facts are similar to the one under consideration. From all the cases, I am of the opinion that to exempt property from taxation, where the claim of exemption is based on the section referred to, two things must concur: First, it must be a regular place of stated worship, and second, it must be in actual use as such. The whole of the lot, and the entire building erected thereon, are assessed and taxes levied upon it. Under the state of facts developed by the bill and affidavits, can this be done without offending against the section of the constitution and the act before cited ? The architect, who ought to know better than any other, says “ that the entire structure as it now stands forms a single building, no part of which could be removed without causing disfiguration and disintegration;” while the bill and other affidavits upon part of the complainant clearly show that two of the rooms are in daily use for regular places of stated religious worship.</p>
