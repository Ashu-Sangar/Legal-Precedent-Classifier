The ordinance and its acceptance became the contract of the parties. It does not appear clearly how many street lamps or how manjr lights were supplied in the streets, alleys, council chamber, town hall and for police purposes, until the 28th of March, 1889. Prior to this date, various differences and disagreements arose between the company and the borough authorities about the kind of street lights the borough could use for which the company was to supply the gas. That there was a difference between the parties about the kinds of lights, is perfectly clear; the company contending that it was to supply without charge gas only for what the ordinance designated as street lamps, while the borough claimed that the company was to supply the gas for such street lights as were erected, regardless of their being street lamps or otherwise. To settle these differences, on March 28,1889, the company submitted the following proposition, which appears as exhibit B in plaintiff’s bill:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b277-4" data-blocks='[["BL_277.3",277,[210,373,1170,597]]]'>

Thereafter, in this respect, this written proposition of the company became the contract of the parties. It appears that in pursuance of its terms, nineteen open street lights were thereafter put up and burned along the streets, and paid for until the filing of this bill. This contract is plain, and speaks for itself. It had the merit of mutuality. It could be terminated by either party. The notice of the company, of January, 1890, the plaintiff’s exhibit C, terminated this contract on the 1st of April, this month. The plaintiff company now claims to stop the burning of its gas in open lights, hereafter, because of their alleged exhaustive consumption, and the necessity for economizing the supply; ‘and that for that purpose it can dig to its pipes in the streets and sever the connection between its mains and the open street lights. The defendant borough denies the plaintiff’s claim, and now contends that by the fifth section of its ordinance of March 12, 1888, it is entitled to a supply of gas for either street lamps or open lights, as it may choose to erect, and that there is really and practically no difference between street lamps and open lights.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b278-4" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[256,938,1179,1314]]]'>But does it appear doubtful, on the bill and affidavits of both sides, that there is substantial difference between street lamps and open street lights ? Here is the test of the controversy. If, from the reading of the fifth section of the ordinance of1 March 12, 1888, a reasonable doubt arose, the parties themselves resolved it by their contract of March 28, 1889. The company insisting, then, there, was a material difference, it admitted its liability to supply free gas for street lamps, but claimed money compensation for the open lights. The borough recognized and acceded to this demand. It is difficult for us to dismiss a distinction the parties themselves recognized. But, it is said this latter contract is ended and the parties are remitted, to the ordinance of March 12, 1888. This is true; but in construing what the borough is entitled to under that ordinance, it is most persuasive to recall what the council, on April 1, 1889, did, in accepting plaintiff’s contention that there was a material difference between street lamps and open lights. The case of Williamson v. McClure, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20Pa.%20408" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="37 Pa. 408">37 Pa. 408</a>, has been well quoted on the argument, wherein Justice Wood-wakd says: “It is a true rule of construction, said Lord ElleNBOROUGH, in Barton v. Fitzgerald, 15 East 541, that the sense and meaning of the parties, in any particular part of an instrument, may be collected- ex antecedentibus et conse-quentibus; that every part of it may he brought into action, in order to collect from the whole one uniform and consistent sense, if that may be done.”</p>

The very subject matter between them was the <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>alleged difference, under their original contract, of the kind of lights. With what was done before us, can we doubt both parties accepted the substance of the difference between the character of the lights, in consumption and expense of gas? But it is said, by defendant, that this contract of March 28th was only a temporary expedient; that ended, the parties are now remitted to the original ordinance of March 12th. Let this be granted, and we must repeat with emphasis, when construing the original contract, that the construction the parties themselves gave it continually presents itself. When so intelligent a body as the town council, speaking for the community, formally by a contract recognized the difference between street lamps and open lights, agree to pay for the latter, when the former was secured them free, how can we fail to regard their act, if not conclusive, certainly as most persuasive, when inquiring whether a street lamp or an open street light is practically the same thing ?</p>

What does its reading indicate the parties to be bound intended? “ Shall furnish gas for all street lamps, for the council chamber, town hall, and all town police purposes,” it says. In the connection we find this sentence, the natural inference is, the same character of lights for streets was to be used for the town hall and council chamber. There are some matters we can take judicial cognizance of without evidence. What we see and know, in. general use, for heating and lighting houses and streets in a large section of the country, may be recalled and discussed by the court, without waiting to hear particular evidence about it. Observation informs us the open, flaring natural-gas lights we see at night, here, in front of this court house, and at occasional places on the streets, as we walk along, are not used in town halls and deliberative council chambers. Lamps, jets, or burners of the size and appearance of those employed for artificial illuminating gas are there used. The first reading of the section, quoted from the ordinance, impresses us these were the lights in the minds of the council passing it, when they say “gas for all street lamps.” But we have listened with patience and entertainment to the learned <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>counsel for defendant, in his copious citations from lexicographical authority to show, from the etymology of the words, that lamps and lights were really synonymous and should be here so treated.Leaving the region of literature and science, and recalling our common sense and observation, in the natural gas regions of Pennsylvania the street lamp and the open street light are each employed and have obviously different characteristics. Their very construction indicates a difference in gas-consuming, as well as light-giving power. We cannot ignore what is so manifest to our senses, as we travel along the railroads and through the gas towns of western Pennsylvania. We must accept as true what is so plainly visible. Accepting, then, the contention of the defendant, now, to secure the dissolution of this preliminary injunction, that the parties, since the termination of the contract for open lights of April 1, 1889, are remitted to the terms of the ordinance of March 12, 1888, we cannot say the claim of the plaintiff company, as at present advised, that street lamps are not open street lights, is so doubtful, in view of all that has transpired, as to require us to refuse equitable interference by injunction.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b280-6" data-blocks='[["BL_280.4",280,[262,1438,1173,452]]]'>We have considered the objection of the defendants, although not formally demurring, to our jurisdiction in equity, yet the same as if they had. W e cannot fail to regard that any remedy at law would be inadequate, under the circumstances, for both parties. Suits at law by the plaintiff for the gas consumed by the open lights, would certainly be less convenient to all the parties. These are tests for equitable, interference we cannot disregard. We will, therefore, for the present, continue the injunction against the use of the open street lights.</p>

The word lamp, considered with reference to the general idea conveyed, is as definite as any word in the language, but with regard to the particular form, material, and method of operation of the instrument itself, and the substance used as a light producer, it is as vague as the name of any concrete article in daily use can well be. As to these matters, therefore, its meaning must depend largely on the context, and on the time, place, and habits of the people with reference to which it is used. Thus, in the early years of all the members of this court, a lamp would have been universally understood, not only in Pennsylvania but throughout the United States, as one which burned whale or lard oil; and a street lamp would have had the same meaning everywhere, except in a few cities where gas had rather recently supplanted oil, but where the old name still held its place. Probably at the present day a street lamp would be understood everywhere but in the smaller villages as a gas lamp, but in places within the natural-gas region the old meaning may have already become unsettled, or a new one established. This is what is claimed in the present case.</p>

In all the towns and cities where streets were thus lighted with natural gas, open lights were alone used for this purpose; a fact which must have been known to complainant, and it was in view of this condition of things the contract was made. ” The affidavits on behalf of the respondents amply sustain this averment of the answer, while, on the other hand, it is not opposed by the evi<a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>dence of complainant. The affidavits on behalf of the latter speak in general terms of the open lights as wasteful and extravagant, but not a single one of them denies that open lights were and are still commonly used in the natural-gas region of Pennsylvania, nor mentions any place in this state where enclosed lamps are successfully used at the present day. The only places specified in which enclosed lights are used are in Ohio and West Virginia. The clear preponderance of evidence is with the respondents, and settles the meaning of the word as used by the parties in 1888.</p>
    <p id="b283-3" data-blocks='[["BL_283.4",283,[225,903,1172,288]]]'>This result is not at all affected by the agreement of March 28, 1889, which is not a construction of the ordinance by the parties, but a compromise of conflicting views, for the sake of peace. It is expressly temporary in character, and, on its termination, each party was remitted to its claim under the ordinance.</p>
    <p id="b283-4" data-blocks='[["BL_283.5",283,[227,1209,1173,505]]]'>We have thus expressed our views on the merits, on account of the public interests and convenience involved, but the case is clearly not one for equity at all. The basis of the complaint is that the borough is using more gas than it is entitled to, and complainants ask the court to assist them to remedy their alleged grievance by tearing up the streets and cutting off even the use of the gas to which the borough is admittedly entitled. The court did not go as far as it was asked to, but it went farther than the limits of equitable jurisdiction in this class of cases, as defined in Grubb’s App., <a href="/pa/90/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="90 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1065608" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0228-01">90 Pa. 228</a>.</p>
    <p id="b283-5" data-blocks='[["BL_283.6",283,[229,1722,1171,595]]]'>The common law is the living science of justice, and adapts the application of fixed principles to changes in the affairs of men. Natural gas is a newly discovered, and as yet unfamiliar product of nature, and the law will recognize a general progress in its economical, prudent, and profitable use. If, therefore, the plaintiffs can hereafter show that open lamps are extravagant, wasteful, and unnecessarily burdensome to the company, it may be that an action will lie for the value of the excess. But, as open lamps were the ones in contemplation at the date of the contract, the onus will be on the plaintiffs to show a progress in the art of illumination that has superseded the use of them, and made it unreasonable.</p>
