These legacies amounted to five thousand dollars, and it is evident that by this clause he merely directed out of what portion of his estate they should be paid, and did not intend to give any additional legacies.1</p>

It and the other two were demonstrative legacies, and payable primarily out of certain stocks, and the testator left sufficient to pay them. In a subsequent part of the will, he gives all these stocks which are unsold to Harvey Powell, when he arrives at the age of thirty years. It was only necessary and the executors only had authority to sell enough to pay the legacies which had not lapsed. The balance remain unsold; and clearly, under the will, the title to them would vest in Harvey Powell when he arrives at the age of thirty years. In the meantime, it vests in the executors.3</p>

The opinion of the Orphans’ Court, even if erroneous, is of little consequence if the decree is right. We do not reverse a correct decree because of a wrong reason. Hence it is always safer to assign error to the decree of that court, rather than to its opinion. The last three assignments however, are specific, and raise all the questions of importance in the case. A careful examination of them fails to satisfy us that the Orphans’ Court committed error, either in its decree or the reasons given therefor.</p>

He then gives one thousand dollars to each of his sisters, Anna Evans and Hannah Davis. To provide for die payment of the foregoing five thousand dollars, and the funeral expenses, he authorizes his executor to sell so much of his bank or other stocks as may be necessary. Anna Evans died before the testator and the legacy to her lapsed. The appellant claims this legacy as heir at law, upon the ground that there is no residuary clause in the will. In this she is clearly mistaken. This 11,000 falls into the residue. This disposes of the fourth assignment. The fifth and sixth are based upon an entire misapprehension of the language of the will. There was no sum of five thousand dollars given to the appellant and to the testator’s sisters, in addition to the bequests to them above specified. The appellant has confounded the direction to sell stocks to pay these legacies, with the gift of an additional five thousand dollars.</p>
