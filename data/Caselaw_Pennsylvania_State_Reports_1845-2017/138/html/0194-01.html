Now, then, it must be done by threats or by force-! An ordinary robbery is committed from the person of another; <em>\ </em>but, if the goods are taken by threats, by menaces or by force, in the presence of another, it is an offence under this section of the statute.</p>

[The Commonwealth has called the boy Edgar Moorhead, who has so recently testified in your hearing the circumstances about his being left in the store, the time, the absence of his brother, what was in the <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>store, and tbe coming, by tbe defendant, into tbe store. Tbe boy says, substantially: “ Tbe man said be was keeping a man, boarding bim out at tbe <em>farm; </em>be would like to get some money for flour and coffee. I told bim I was not allowed to pay tbe money while my father was away. He says, ‘ My God, you ought not to be afraid.’ Then be says, (repeating an oath not necessary for us to repeat,) ‘ I will take it.’ Then I got it and gave it to bim; one silver dollar, a quarter, a dime, a nickle and two pennies. Then be went on tbe other side of the room and pointed up and said, ‘What is that?’ I said ‘that is starch.’ He says, ‘ Give me a box of that.’ I gave him a box of that. He went around and looked up and down and says, ‘What is that ? ’ I says, ‘ Pepper. ’ He says, ‘ Give me a box of that.’ I gave him the box. Then be says be wanted two more boxes of starch and I gave them to him. Then be went .out of tbe door, and looked up and down and came in again land says, ‘ Aint your father got a revolver ? ’ I said be had. He said, ‘Tour father sold it to me.’ Afterwards be got it.” Then you will recollect tbe circumstances under which tbe boy testifies that he gave it to him, and will recall the narration which the boy gives of the whole conversation that he had with the defendant, when passing upon the claim made by the Commo'nwealth that this conduct terrified himand was such a (threat and menace as hrougBTtEe"offence under the ban of the statute, and made him guilty of felony, as indicating that the building was entered by him, the defendant, with the intent to commit such a felony.]10.</p>

If he was not a thief, he certainly acted like one. When a man goes into a store, in the absence of the owner and with only a child of ten years of age in attendance, and by a falsehood and threats pfjyiolence induces the child to hand oyer the money in the till, and some of the goods upon the shelves, he has a right to expect that a jury will convict him of larceny. It was urged, however, that there were no threats. That was for the jury. Aside from this, the evidence is that he took the revolver out of the drawer himself. The appellant was properly convicted.</p>
