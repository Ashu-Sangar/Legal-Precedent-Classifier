New Castle Northern Railway Co., at No. 25 September Term 1883, when the subject was again considered, and the former ruling of the court was adhered to. Now, the court is, in effect, asked to reconsider and reverse these former decisions.</p>

This railroad is located across quite a number of farms whose owners are in precisely the same condition, respecting their damages, that these plaintiffs are in. The former decisions of this court, on their rights, doubtless appear unjust'to these landowners, who, as the case stands, cannot collect any damages for the injuries done them by the construction of this railroad.

They grant no right to any one to take private property for public use. They prohibit the state from granting the franchise of eminent domain so that it can be used, and they prohibit every corporation from using that franchise, without paying or securing just compensation for property taken, injured or destroyed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b195-4" data-blocks='[["BL_195.4",195,[263,1000,1170,506]]]'>The legislature can grant the right to take private property for public use subject to these restrictions, and it has never been doubted that the legislature may prescribe the kind and character of the security to be given and the manner in which it shall be given. The power to so prescribe must be lodged somewhere else than in the parties immediately concerned, viz., the corporation and the property owner, because they might never agree. The state has retained this power, and has exercised it, and its right to do so will not, I think, be questioned.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b195-5" data-blocks='[["BL_195.5",195,[264,1513,1172,966]]]'>Then we have this case: The New Castle Northern Railway Company had the right to take plaintiffs’ property for its use in constructing its railroad, upon securing to the plaintiffs the payment of just compensation for the property taken. The kind and character of the security to be given and the manner of giving it were prescribed by law. The company observed and obeyed all the legal requirements respecting the security, and took the property. Did it have the right to take it ? It is surely difficult to answer no to that question. It had the right under certain conditions and restrictions, and it complied rvith these conditions and restrictions. Then its right was absolute. There is nothing anywhere in this legal machinery which makes the company’s right to the property conditional on the security being adequate for all future time, or until the compensation shall be in fact paid. The company must give a bond “ with at least two sufficient sureties,” “ and if the bond and sureties are approved ” by the court, “ the bond shall bo filed in said court for the benefit of those interested: ” Section 2, act of April 9, 1856, P. L. 288.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b196-3" data-blocks='[["BL_196.3",196,[233,382,1177,811]]]'>
      <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>The sufficiency of the sureties is to be decided by the court, where the parties do not agree respecting them, and if the court decide them sufficient, that is an end of the question. There is no further condition that they must remain sufficient. If there were such a condition, then the company’s right to take property upon giving security would be valueless. It would be no right at all. The only right to take private property for public use, then, would be to pay the owner the just compensation. Until actual payment the owner would retain his grasp on the property. The right to take the property on giving security cannot be reasoned away in such a manner. “ Sufficient sureties,” as used in the act of 1856, does not mean sureties who will not or cannot become insolvent. If it did, then no such bond as the act requires could ever be given, because there are no such sureties. The history of the business world proves that they do not exist.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b196-4" data-blocks='[["BL_196.4",196,[231,1201,1177,401]]]'>The only reasonable, and therefore the true construction of the word “ secured ” in the constitution, is that it shall be made reasonably safe or sure that the owner of the properly taken shall be able to collect the compensation for it, and the words “ sufficient suretiés ” in the act, must be construed to mean such sureties as at the time they are taken make it reasonably certain that the owner of the property taken can collect from them a just compensation.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b196-5" data-blocks='[["BL_196.5",196,[227,1611,1177,339]]]'>These views are fully sustained by the Supreme Court in Fries v. South. Penna. R,. &amp; M.

True, the solvency of the sureties was not a question in either of those cases. But, if their insolvency could have defeated the company’s right in either case, the Supreme Court could not have reached the conclusion it did reach.</p>
