McAninch wrote to A. D. Lundy, representing other insuring companies, requesting him to adjust the loss for the defendant company. For this purpose, Lundy appeared upon the ground on December 23,1884, and under his directions appraisers were selected, who appraised the entire loss at 18,127.93. The proportion of the loss, as thus adjusted, which the defendant company was to pay, was $500, for which amount Lundy drew a draft upon the company, payment of which was afterwards refused, the defendant repudiating the transaction on the ground that its business was confined to the insurance of dwelling-houses.</p>

      <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>Tbe plaintiff obtained a policy of insurance on his building from the recognized agent of the company at Waynesburg, Greene county, and paid the agent the premium therefor. The agent reported the matter to the home office at Boston, and forwarded the premium. After waiting the usual time for a reply and receiving none, he delivered the policy to the assured. This he testified was in accordance with his usual course of dealing with said company. A fire occurred shortly thereafter, and this suit was brought to recover for the loss sustained thereby. When, upon the trial below, the plaintiff offered his policy in evidence, he was met with the following objection, inter alia, to its admission: “ That there is no evidence that, at the time this policy is claimed to have been issued, or claimed to have been in force, the defendant company was duly empowered by law to transact business in this state, and therefore, this policy is ultra vires, and void.” See second assignment. The company not only repudiated its policy, but also its agent who issued it. For anything that appeared upon the trial, the case was an honest one, and the evidence fully justified the verdict found by the jury. The remaining assignments have about the same merit as the second one, above referred to.</p>
