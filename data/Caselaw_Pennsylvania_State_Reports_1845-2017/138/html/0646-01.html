There is no question about this general equitable doctrine, but it is not of universal application, and can only be enforced in certain cases which we will endeavor to explain hereafter. The auditor is of the opinion, however, that the doctrine is not applicable to the present distribution.These trust deeds are specific and comprehensive, in their terms, enough to secure Mr. Kuntz in all the judgments which he holds against the said James R. Moss in <a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>Washington county, and also for all money which he paid on the" judgments specified in the second deed to the extent of $8,500. Now, whilst Mr. Kuntz, by his activity and vigilance, procured the above securities to protect himself and the parties for whom he loaned money to James R. Moss, the other lien creditors, amongst whom are exceptants, relied upon their judgment liens entered against said Moss in Washington county. We are unable to see that the exceptants have any lien, or claim, either in law or equity, upon the money arising from the sale of the three hundred acres held by Kuntz, by his deeds of trust, to protect himself and the others named in said deeds; except, of course, the claim which they have to participate in the fund left in the hands of the assignee, after the liens protected by the said deeds of trust have been satisfied, along with the other creditors of said Moss.</p>

That doctrine only applies, we submit, when the liens are against the same debtor, against the same property, and within the same jurisdiction. The auditor admits that the question is not without doubt, in our state, and the authorities which bear on the question not numerous, as far as he has been able to find. The case of Smith’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pa.%20381" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Pa. 381">2 Pa. 381</a>, decides “ that A, who held col-laterals iu trust for an execution creditor and was also assignee of the debtor, and who had received money on the collaterals, could not be compelled by a subsequent execution creditor to pay the money thus received on the collaterals to him, but that the assignee may retain it for the general creditors, subject to the obligation to satisfy any deficiency under the executions.” And the case of McGinnis’s App., <a href="/pa/16/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="16 Pa. 445" data-case-ids="410257" data-case-paths="/pa/16/0445-01">16 Pa. 445</a>, as we understand it, decides that the doctrine contended for by exceptants will not apply, where the liens, although against the same debtor, are on different property of the debtor, not being in the same county.

An examination of the deed of assignment and of the assignee’s account will show that this position is untenable. The assignor conveyed by specific description the W est Virginia land to the assignee, and he accepted the trust. His account shows that he has charged himself with $10,810, the amount for which this land sold; he took credit for the disbursement of part of the money to the West Virginia creditor who had the first deed of trust, and he is allowed about $250 commissions as assignee for receiving and paying out this money, as his percentage, amounting to $700, is evidently computed on the amount of the debtor side of the account, which includes this $10,810.

The trustee who made the sale was not subject to the control or jurisdiction of the court below, but to that of the courts of Ohio county, West Virginia, and the deeds of trust held by Mr. Kuntz are under the control of those courts: Wharton, Confl. of Laws, § 291; Goddard v.

In case the decree of the court is affirmed, not only will the Brownlee judgment be satisfied, but that of John Henderson, who filed.no exception to the auditor’s report, will be paid in full also. This is a strange application of the rule that it is the active and vigilant creditor, if any, who shall be favored. Neither Brownlee nor Henderson made any attempt to secure a lien upon the real estate in West Virginia, and they had no claim against it that was not equally available to any of the assignor’s creditors who were totally unsecured.</p>

It is difficult to see how the fact, that the fund realized from the sale of the land in West Virginia is within the jurisdiction of the court, can be seriously questioned. The assignee charges himself with it in his account and takes credit for the disbursement of it, including the payment of $3,787.60 to himself on his deeds of trust. No exceptions to the distribution of this fund by the auditor were filed by either of the appellants, and they cannot now be permitted to raise objections which were not raised in the court below.

The case is clearly within the rule that when one creditor has a lien on two funds, and a junior creditor has a lien upon but one of them, and both funds are before the court for distribution, the fund on which there is but one lien will first be applied so as to protect the junior creditor who has a lien only upon the other fund: Alston v.

It is contended, however, that this principle will not apply, because Kuntz, having guaranteed payment of Crow’s judgment, which is not paid in full, would be the loser by reason of its application. Admitting that subrogation will not be permitted when it would affect intervening lights, it is equally clear that when the right to subrogation has once vested, it cannot be defeated by the paramount encumbrancer, especially by an act on his part which reverses the equities of judgment creditors. Brownlee, having a prior lien, had a superior equity to Crow. The moment Kuntz received his deed of trust as collateral security for his judgments, the right vested ill Brown-lee to insist that the proceeds of the collateral, when received, should be applied to those judgments, and Kuntz could not defeat that right by guaranteeing Crow’s judgment: Hastings’ Case, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20W.%20303" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="10 W. 303">10 W. 303</a> ; 2 Lead.

The personal estate of the assignor was all exhausted by executions issued prior to the assignment. The entire fund for distribution is the product exclusively of the sales of real estate, part in West Virginia and part in Washington county, Pa. The liens in West Virginia, entered prior to the assignment, were more than enough to exhaust the whole proceeds of the land sold there. Indeed, the proceeds of the West Vii' ginia land were only enough to pay the first deed of trust n, full, and the second deed of trust in part. The third deed of trust was not reached at all, and hence the judgments, which, being entered in Pennsylvania, were the subjects of the trust, received no protection from the sales of the West Virginia land. The judgment of the appellant was one of these. The sales in Pennsylvania did not reach to pay the liens entered in that state, even after the application of all the West Virginia proceeds to the payment of the judgments, also entered in Pennsylvania, but which were secured by the second deed of trust in West Virginia. There is therefore no personal estate of any kind applicable to the payment of any of the liens either in Pennsylvania or West Virginia, unless we, by judicial decree, convert into general personalty, applicable to all the unsecured debts of the assignor, the proceeds of the sale of the West Virginia real estate left after the payment of the first deed of trust. As the liens in West Virginia were more than sufficient to exhaust all the proceeds of the sale in that state, and the liens in Pennsylvania were more than sufficient to exhaust all the proceeds of the sales in that state, we are entirely at a loss to perceive how or upon what principle we can make such a decree. To us it is quite apparent that the present contest is confined to lien creditors alone, and it is merely a question between them whether one, or another, shall be permitted to come in on the fund.</p>

The whole fund is now iix the hands of the accountant, and he is the assignee for the <a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>benéfit of creditors of the assignor, wbo is a citizen of Pennsylvania living in Washington county, and owning the' lands in qúestion, situate in both states. The assignee is a Pennsylvania official who must account, and who has accounted, to the Pennsylvania court, for the whole of the assignor’s property. Moreover, in his account, as filed, he has charged himself with the whole proceeds of the land sold in West Virginia, and it is the distribution of that very money that must now be determined. Still further, he is the grantee in the second deed of trust, and he is both trustee and cestui que trust under that deed, because tbe judgments which it was given to protect are judgments owned by him. He has in his hands the very money which was realized under that deed of trust. If the judgments which that deed was intended to secure were the property of other persons than this assignee, it could not be questioned for a moment that it should be distributed to the owners, of those judgments. It may well be that such distribution could be compelled by the courts of West Virginia, because the money, being the proceeds of land in that state, sold under judicial process there, would be properly distributable by the law and the courts of that state. But no such question arises here. There are no claimants to the fund under the law of West Virginia, and we are not informed that the result would be in any wise different if there were. But, this assignee is-in the position of a lien creditor having recourse to two funds, and he is engaged in a contest with another lien creditor having access to one only of the same two funds. Strangely enough he does not desire to avail himself of his right of access as a lien creditor to the West Virginia part of the fund, but actually asks the courts in Pennsylvania to consider that part of the fund as general personal estate accessible to the whole body of' the assignor’s unsecured creditors, and this, although he Would thereby cut out a lien creditor in Pennsylvania, who, if the true character of the fund is preserved, would be paid in full for his lien.</p>

He thinks this would be equitable, although other lien creditors, who have just as much legal and equitable merit as he has, will thereby lose their money. We are quite unable to see it in that light. The appellees have the undoubted right prima facie to require the application of the West Virginia part of the fund to the payment of the judgments which were to be protected by the second deed of trust. That right must be enforced, unless it will interfere with the equity of the person against whom it is invoked. But he has no equity as a lien creditor against the equity of the appellees, and only claims that the doctrine should not be enforced, in order to enable him to come in with general unsecured creditors. To do this, the Virginia fund must be converted from its position as real assets applicable to the payment of West Virginia lions into personal assets applicable to all creditors alike. Why all unsecured creditors should be let in to defeat a lien creditor, it is impossible to see. Certainly they have no claim to postpone a lienocreditor with a valid lien and an undoubted priority as to them. Yet the argument of the appellant is based upon no consideration that is not common to them all. There is neither equity, nor law, nor a sentiment of justice that can be offered in support of such a position.</p>
