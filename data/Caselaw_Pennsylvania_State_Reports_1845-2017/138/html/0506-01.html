It is essential, then, to a plaintiff who seeks to recover in a case of this kind that his case does not disclose negligence upon his part, because if there is any degree of negligence upon the part of the plaintiff that is an absolute barrier to his recovery, even though he make out the clearest case of negligence on the part of the railroad company.</p>

Therefore, gentlemen of the jury, we say to you in this case, that if the evidence discloses that the plaintiff has been guilty of negligence in the occurrence which is the subject of this suit, contributing in any degree to the injury of which he complains, he cannot recover here. But, if the evidence does not so show, and it does affirmatively appear by the weight of the evidence, that the defendant company was guilty of negligence at that occurrence, and that negligence resulted in damage to the plaintiff, he is entitled to compensation for whatever damage he thus sustained.

Both those using the highway as well as those using the railroad have rights, and these rights must be regarded by each with respect to the other. It is the duty of a railroad company, as the train approaches the crossing of a highway, to give proper warning of that approach. In thickly populated districts the duty goes to the extent of requiring the railroad company to put flagmen in the way, or even gates, for the purpose of preventing crossing while the train is in that vicinity. But in districts which are not thickly populated, that is not required of railroads, but then they are required to give proper warning by such signals as they can make, so as to notify pen-sons approaching the railroad crossing of the approach of the train and thereby prevent collision. These remarks apply to crossings generally.</p>

There is evidence that this train was‘running at an extraordinary rate of speed; it is claimed as fast as from forty-five to sixty miles an hour. It is also in evidence 'that there was another crossing a short distance west of the one where the accident occurred and another <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>somewhat further distant east of this.

But otherwise, if the whistle was blown and the bell was rung, you should find for the defendant.

We are not warranted in affirming this second proposition of law. We refuse it; leaving it to the jury to say whether the plaintiff did stop and look and listen at a place where he could see up and down the track, and whether he used such care and diligence in approaching that crossing as ought to be used by a man of ordinary care and prudence.1</p>

While the law does not fix any rate of speed, particularly, at which a train may pass along defendant’s track, it does require that those in charge of the train shall use proper care and diligence, according to the circumstances, as they approach any crossing. The amount of care which they are to use is proportionate to the particular circumstances of a particular crossing. Thus explained this point is substantially affirmed.1</p>

But the defendant cannot be held to a stricter account in running a special train than in the case of any other. The same uniform rule must apply to the running of all trains. The judge was in error in' giving force to the fact that this was a special train, and demanding special •care from the company. Then he coupled with this, in such a way as to give it with the jury the force of a fact proved, the statement that the train was running at the rate of from forty to sixty miles an hour, whereas there is no evidence to support it. And the general tenor of the charge was misleading. The comments upon the credibility of the engineer and fireman, who were entirely disinterested, could have no other effect upon the average juror than to prejudice his mind against the witnesses and the defendant’s case.</p>

The vice of the point is that it assumed that the railroad company had performed its whole duty, provided the whistle was sounded and the bell rung at a proper distance from the crossing. But there was another element in the case which the jury were necessarily compelled to pass upon, viz., the rate of speed at which the train approached the crossing. The character of the crossing itself was a circumstance which could not be ignored, and which necessarily affected the relative duties of both the plaintiff and the company. If it was a dangerous crossing, as was practically admitted on both sides, it was the duty of the plaintiff to exercise the more care in approaching it. At the same time, it was equally the duty of the defendant company to see that then1 trains passed it at a reasonable rate of speed, proportioned to the danger. In other words, negligence is the absence of care according to the cir<a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>cumstances, and must be measured by the apparent danger.

We refuse it; leaving it to the jury to say whether the plaintiff did stop and look and listen at a place where he could see up and down the track, and whether he used due care and diligence in approaching that crossing as ought to be used by a man of ordinary care and prudence.”</blockquote>

As I drove along there I was standing up back of the seat. As I drove across between the New Castle &amp; Franklin and Lake Shore railroads, I think I had full view of the Lake Shore road towards Stoneboro, the most of the distance. I neither heard nor saw any train on the Lake Shore road; everything was perfectly still. Before I undertook to cross, the Lake Shore road, I stopped, and looked and listened for trains on it, because there was considerable lumber piled up on it. At the point where I stopped, I think it was about two rods from the Lake Shore road; it might have been a little more or less. At that time I neither saw nor heard any trains on the road.”</p>

R. Co. v. Beale, as to stop, look, and listen twice before he attempted to cross defendant’s road. Did he stop at the right place, and was it his duty to go up on the track ? The latter can only be necessary when he can get a view of it in no other way, which does not appear to have been the case in this instance. The first branch of the inquiry was for the jury, and it would have been error in the learned judge to have ruled it as a question of law. In Lake Shore R. Co. v. Frantz, <a href="/pa/127/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="127 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="565711" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0297-01">127 Pa. 297</a>, the plaintiff was injured by the collision of his wagon and a hand-car at a public crossing. It was partially obstructed by standing cars. The defendant moved for a compulsory nonsuit on the ground of contributory negligence, alleging that it was the duty of the plaintiff to stop, look, and listen at a point where he could see the main tracks of defendant’s railroad. The court below refused to grant a nonsuit, and also refused to charge that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. Upon appeal to this court it was said, by Mr. Justice Mitchell : “ A nonsuit could only be granted on the ground of manifest contributory negligence of the plaintiff. This we do not find. There were a number oE tracks, and the evidence is strong that the plaintiff <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>stopped, looked, and listened before crossing tbe first. It might still have been his duty to stop again before going upon the track of the defendant company on which the collision took place, but the evidence does not enable us to say so as a matter of law. It is far from clear that the place where plaintiff stopped was not the best, or that there was any safe place for a second and better view. It was proper, therefore, that the case should be left to the jury, and the nonsuit was rightly refused.” In McNeal v. Railway Co., <a href="/pa/181/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="181 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="891425" data-case-paths="/pa/181/0184-01">181 Pa. 184</a>, the plaintiff stopped within fifty feet of the track, and it was presumed he looked and listened, and it was left to the jury to say whether he had exercised due care. Penna. R. Co. v. Beale does not appear to have been referred to in that case. While the rule to stop, look, and listen is an invaluable one, and may be properly declared by the court as a matter of law, yet the question whether a traveler in a given case has stopped at the best place, is necessarily a question of fact, not of law. If I am right in this, it must, as a general rule, be passed upon by a jury.</p>
    <p id="b546-4" data-blocks='[["BL_546.4",546,[245,1338,1173,959]]]'>We find no error in the qualification which the learned judge gave to the defendant’s third point. The rate of speed of a railroad train at a public grade crossing has been sufficiently referred to in the remarks upon the first assignment of error. A considerable portion of the charge of the court below is also assigned as error. We cannot say that the reference to the speed of the train was wrong. On the contrary, the charge in this respect was entirely fair. It is true he said to the jury: “ If that rate of speed was from forty-five to sixty miles an hour, as it is claimed on the part of the plaintiff,” etc. Here, the learned judge only stated what the plaintiff claimed as the rate of speed, and while no witness stated in terms, if I am correct in my examination of the testimony, that the train was running at the rate of sixty miles an hour, yet there was evidence from which the jurjr might have found the fact inferentially. On the other hand, the learned judge fairly stated what the defendant claimed as to speed. The testimony upon this point, as is usual in such cases, was vague and unsatisfactory.</p>

What the learned judge said upon this point was entirely true, and it was proper to call the attention of the jury to it. There might have been a good ground of objection, had the learned judge referred only to these two witnesses. But he pointedly called the attention of the jury to tbs interest of the plaintiff and his two sons, and told them that it affected their credibility. The reference in each case was proper.</p>
