Such an ordinance directing the sale of the Mif-flin township poor farm belonging to the city was duly passed and formally approved by the mayor, as set forth in the answer of the city of Pittsburgh.

It differs materially from the case of Fuller v. Scranton, 18 <em>W. </em>N. 18, and differs essentially from the case in relation to the purchase of a poor farm argued with this case. If, then, the various acts of assembly, cited in relation to cities of the second class, be constitutional and valid, we see no good objection to the validity of the proceedings, unless a decree of court was necessary.</p>

The third section of the act contains a general repealing clause of all acts inconsistent herewith. Does this act become a part of the law governing the sale and purchase of property for poor purposes belonging to the city of Pittsburgh, i. e., cities of the second class ? This and the questions of the constitutionality of the aGts of May 25, 1887, and June 14,1887, in our opinion, raise the only doubtful questions in the case.</p>

(who was a distinguished member of the constitutional convention,) we cannot agree with this view, until it shall be so decided by him or by the Supreme Court. It is true that the seventh section of the third article of the constitution does not in the precise words prohibit local legislation for poor districts, as it does for school districts, and for this very good reason: the care of the poor had always been considered a municipal function and “affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards and boroughs,” for which local laws are prohibited in the second paragraph of § 7, while the uniform rule had been to treat schools and school districts as something separate and independent of the ordinary municipal governments. The same reason will apply to other articles in the constitution where school districts are mentioned and poor districts are not named. In article IX., §§ 8 and 10, on taxation and finance, school districts are named, but poor districts are not. Certainly, these sections were intended to include all officers, bodies or departments, that could involve a community in debt or who managed the affairs of such community. It was no more necessary to specify poor districts than to specify police districts or road districts, or to specify township auditors.</p>

The last paragraph of § 7 prohibits the passing of any law “ granting powers or privileges in any case where the granting of such powers and privileges shall have been provided for by general law, or where the courts have jurisdiction to grant the same or give the relief asked for.” It seems to us that the act of April 28,1887, is a general law providing for the sale and purchase of property and for the care of the poor.</p>

In the important case of Howard v.
