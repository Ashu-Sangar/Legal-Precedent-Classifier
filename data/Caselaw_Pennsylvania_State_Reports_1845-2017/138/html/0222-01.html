Plaintiffs shipped the coffee and sent to defendant a statement, the bill amounting to $305. A second statement was sent in December, and a third in January, 1887. On January 11th the defendant sent to the plaintiffs his individual check for $150, writing to them, “ The balance I will send you in a few days.” In February, the plaintiffs sent a fourth statement to the defendant, giving credit for the $150.

    <p class="summary" id="Aha" data-blocks='[["BL_249.5",249,[229,977,1171,759]]]'>The plaintiffs in this action claim that there was shipped to the defendant, on November 16,1886, 2,000 lbs. of coffee, the cost of which would be $305. They admit that on January 12, 1887, there was a payment made by a check sent by the defendant of $150, which would leave a balance of $155 due, together with proper interest thereon; and this is the claim of the plaintiffs and for which this suit has been brought. They contend that the coffee was ordered by their agent, John L. Chambers, and that a bill was sent to the defendant accordingly ; and upon the 12th or 13th of January, this letter and check for $150 were received of the defendant, stating that the balance would be arranged; we do not give his words but the substance of them. We may say here, that if there was nothing else in the case but this, the plaintiffs’ right to recovery would be beyond question.</p>

Yet it appears, if it be the fact, if the testimony of Truby be true, that, notwithstanding this, the coffee was shipped upon an order signed by John L. Chambers, who was the agent, the acknowledged agent of the plaintiffs.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b250-4" data-blocks='[["BL_250.4",250,[250,471,1173,912]]]'>Mr. Truby explains this payment of $150; that he called Chambers, he says, into his store, and demanded to know of him why this coffee was shipped in his name and against his orders and directions. It was explained by the agent of the plaintiffs, that by shipping coffee in this way the sale of goods could be facilitated and the freight charges reduced, and that he had been so doing, as we now recall the testimony of the witness ; said he proposed to retail, if I may be allowed the expression, this ton of coffee among his customers, or wherever he could sell it, and bring the money to Truby and let him send it in upon his account. Thus, Mr. Truby explains why he sent the check, the $150 having been paid according to the promise of this agent, and he supposing or resting upon the promise made by Chambers that the balance would be paid; and he explains that he wrote the letter in that way, and it was in that light and with that understanding, made with the agent of plaintiffs, that he thus acknowledged the amount of the claim and promised paj^ment.</p>

Truby says there was no sale of any coffee to him; that it was shipped, as we have said, against his direction and without his knowledge; that he did not want, he says, to buy the coffee. Now this testimony is uncontradicted. Mr. Chambers, the agent, is not here. The plaintiffs themselves could not know, because they were not present. The question, then, of ratification comes up; that, although there may have been no actual sale, yet if the plaintiffs parted with their property through the representation of their agent, the same might be ratified by the defendant in this case adopting what the agent of his own volition and of his own act had done.</p>

[But if he acted innocently throughout; if he acted without any knowledge that the intent and purpose of Chambers was to injure his principals, to cheat and defraud them, and only by way of favor sent the money for him, and promised when he sent the check that the balance would be paid, resting in good faith upon the purposes and intentions as declared by the agent of the plaintiffs themselves, such act, in the view of the court, and in the view of the law as the court understands it, would not, if he was so innocent, would not be a ratification and could not be.] 4</p>

This may be true. [If there was no actual sale, no bargain and sale, an offer to deliver and an offer to pay, made at the same time, we say if there was no such offer, then there could be no ratification of that which never existed.] 5 And yet, still, if there was no sale at all, yet with the agent he might agree and ratify what had been done, and communicate the same to the principals, the firm that the agent represented. But here, again, comes in the same question, [if the defendant was acting innocently and resting upon the declarations of the agent of the plaintiffs that this would be a good way to dispose of their goods, that it would facilitate a sale of their goods, and the defendant was innocent of any unlawful purpose upon the part of the agent, we would view it, as we have already said, that this would be no ratification;] 6 [and there is evidence here, gentlemen, that goes to show that as soon as the defendant here discovered this fraudulent business of the agent, he notified the plaintiffs and was the means of first informing them; and, upon the information so received, they pursued their fraudulent agent and had him arrested so that he might be brought to punishment.] 7.</p>

This, we <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>say, is tbe question; and if you believe lie was innocent throughout, he ought not to be made to pay for a thing which he did not get, when the whole matter was brought about by the plaintiffs themselves through their agent; because, as we have said before, it is a general rule that principals are bound by the acts of their agents while acting within the scope of their powers.] 8 You will, therefore, gentlemen, take the whole of this evidence and inquire from it how the facts are.</p>

The coffee was ordered in defendant’s name, was sent to him by plaintiffs with a bill or statement in the regular course of business, and he had immediate knowledge of all the facts by his interview with Chambers. Instead of repudiating the transaction and promptly notifying plaintiffs, he accepted Chambers’s explanation and permitted him to carry out his plan. This was a clear loan of his credit to Chambers, and of itself would have made defendant liable. But, to put the matter beyond all question, the defendant received a second and a third bill, and in response to the latter sent his check for about half the amount, and promised “ the balance in a few days.” A plainer case of ratification can hardly be imagined.</p>
