The track upon the trestle was laid with such a grade that ordinarily these movements of the cars could be effected with the force of gravity, but frequently, in consequence of the tightness of the axles, or the friction produced by the action of straight flanges upon the rails, it was necessary to push the cars along the track by means of a “ pinch bar.”</p>

After they were unloaded, the railroad company would again take charge of them. When engaged in the work of unloading, the laborers would usually, just before cutting a car from the train, try the brake upon the car behind it to see whether it was properly set. The defendants’ labor boss, who had charge of the men employed in this work, had often cautioned them to be careful about ascertaining that the brakes were tight upon cars left standing behind them, but he endeavored to see that the oldest hands should attend to the brakes, and sometimes prevented men like the plaintiff, who was a Swede, unable to speak English, from doing so. Two or three days before the accident, the plaintiff started to examine the brake of a car, standing on the trestle, from which another was about to be detached, when the boss motioned him back.</p>

Three loaded cars were standing upon the track. Having detached the front car from the other two, the plaintiff and Christopher Parkinson started to push it down the track by means of the pinch bar, while the third man was on top of that car, ready to apply the brake to it when necessary. Parkinson had been informed by a co-laborer that the latter had examined the brakes on the two remaining cars and they were all right, and in consequence of this information, Parkinson refrained from examining them himself. After the car which they were pushing had been moved several lengths, the two remaining cars, probably set in motion by a jarring of the trestle resulting from the work of the plaintiff and Parkinson, came running down the track and struck against the car in front of them, catching the plaintiff’s arm between the bumpers and injuring it so that it had to be amputated. The brakes of those two cars were found to be set, but were defective and failed to hold for that reason. It was known to the labor boss, the superintendent and the employees generally, that cars with defective brakes were sometimes run upon the trestle by the railroad <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>company.

An examination of that case, however, discloses the fact that it was decided under the act of February 24, 1806, § 25, 4 Sm.

Under this act it has been held that opinions thus filed, by the positive command of the law, are of the body of the record, and that the law intends that the judge shall place upon the record also such facts as are necessary to explain his opinion: Downing v.
