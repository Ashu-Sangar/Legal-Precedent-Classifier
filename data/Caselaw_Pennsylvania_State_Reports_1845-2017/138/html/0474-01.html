It is there said that if, before the maturity of paper held by a bank against a depositor, an arrangement is made by which the bank agrees to hold the deposit for a specific purpose, and not to charge the note against it, the bank may be regarded as a trustee and the deposit special. In such a case, in the absence of fraud or collusion, an indorser on such paper has no right to require the appropriation of the deposit towards the payment of the paper on its maturity. Although not the precise point on which the decision in the case of the Bank v. Henninger turned, Justice PaxsoN takes occasion to say: “ It must be conceded that if the deposit had been special, or, if previous to the maturity of the note any arrangement had been made between the depositor and the bank, by which the bank had been forbidden to apply the money in its hands to the payment of these notes, the indorser would not be discharged.” Unless, under the facts found, the defendant was discharged from his liability to the bank, it had the right to pursue Shoup and either or both in-dorsers, until satisfaction was obtained; and the fact that Shoup indemnified it from the cost and expenses of this suit <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>against the defendant, does not exempt defendant from bis legal liability to plaintiff.</p>

Speight, as equivalent to a ruling upon a state of facts similar to that now before the court. But the facts in Bank v. Speight were very different from those of the present case. Here, the deposit was in no sense special; there was no appropriation of it to any special purpose, and the indorser of the note did not consent to or acquiesce in the agreement between the maker and the bank. No matter what agreement had been made between the bank and the maker, the former had it in its power, when the note matured, to realize its debt by set-off against the deposit. It could not relinquish its right so to do, without discharging the indorser.</p>

When the plaintiff was peremptorily forbidden by Shoup to apply his funds to the note, and agreed not to do so, the deposit became a special one, and the bank was bound both legally and morally by its agreement. In no phase of the case was the bank morally bound to charge the note to the depositor. It had the legal and moral right to choose between the drawer and the indorsers, in enforcing its collection, and under <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>an equitable view of all the facts of the case the choice was very properly made. The bond given to the plaintiff by Shoup should have no weight in the disposition of this case. While a collateral security of a higher grade might operate as payment, as regards an indorser on the original paper, this bond, which was not given as collateral security for the note, but simply as an indemnity against loss by reason of this suit, had no relevancy upon the trial.</p>

At the time the note matured, John Shoup, the maker, had on deposit with the bank more than sufficient to pay it; but Shoup, conceiving that he had a defence as against the payee, notified the bank not to charge it off against his account at maturity, and at the same time gave the bank a bond of indemnity to secure it in case it failed to recover against the indorser. Being thus indemnified, the bank did not charge the note to Shoup’s account, and brought this suit against the payee, who was of course indorser. The latter defended upon the ground that he was discharged as in-dorser, by reason of the failure of the bank to collect the note from the funds of the maker in its hands. The court below held that the indorser was liable, and entered judgment against him for the amount of the note.</p>

It was there held that “ where a bank is the holder of a note payable at the banking house, and upon its maturity the maker has a cash deposit in said bank exceeding the amount of the note, which deposit is not specially applicable to a particular purpose, the bank is bound to charge up the amount of the note against the deposit. In such case, the note is in effect a draft on the bank in favor of the holder, and in discharge of the indorsor.” The case in hand comes directly within this ruling. The money was there to the credit of the maker; it was not a special deposit, nor had it been specifically appropriated to any other purpose. The maker could have drawn his money out the day before the note matured; he might have turned it into a special deposit, or he might have appropriated it to the payment of some other note. As was said <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>in Commercial N. Bank v.

    <p id="b504-4" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[263,669,1178,1667]]]'>The learned judge below appears to have been misled by the following passage from the opinion in the ease referred to: “ It must be conceded that if the deposit had been special, or, if previous to the maturitjr of the note, any arrangement had been made between the depositor and the bank, by which the bank had been forbidden to apply the money in its hands to the payment of these notes, the indorser would not be discharged.” The learned judge below has omitted the sentence immediately following, which explains what was meant by this language: “ As was held in Bank v. Speight, 4T N. Y. 668, ‘if before the maturity of the paper held by a bank against a depositor, an arrangement is made by which the bank agrees to hold the deposit for a specific purpose, and not to charge the note against it, the bank may be regarded as a trustee, and the deposit special. In such a case, in the absence of fraud or collusion, an indorser upon such paper has no right to require the application of the deposit towards the payment of the paper upon its maturity.’ ” Considering the above paragraph as a whole, it will be seen that it means merely that where a depositor has made a special application or appropriation of his balance, and so notifies the bank, the latter cannot charge off the note against his deposit. This arises from the fact that a man may do what he will with his own so long as he retains control of it. Here, the depositor retained full control over his deposit; made no appropriation of it, but retained it subject to his check; then, by a collusive arrangement with the bank, which was the holder, induced the latter to violate its duty to the indorser. It was an arrangement which the bank had no right to make. That the deposit did not, in any sense, become a special one, is shown by the fact that it remained in the bank subject to Shoup’s check. Being so subject, it was the duty of the bank to charge off the note against it, and by its failure to do so the indorser is discharged.</p>
