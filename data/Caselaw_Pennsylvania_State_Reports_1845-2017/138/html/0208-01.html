When these provisions are examined, it will be found that the testator bequeathed to his wife his household furniture absolutely. He devised to her two pieces of real estate during her natural life. He directed that his personal property, not bequeathed to his wife, and two lots of land mentioned, should be sold, and the interest on the proceeds of these sales and also the interest on all “moneys, notes, bonds outstanding” he directed should be received by her during her natural lifetime.</p>

They, with the residuary legacies, are to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of “ all my property.” The testator by his will converted all his property into personalty, so far as these legacies are concerned. He made of all his property, real and personal, one fund, out of which the particular legacies are to be paid and the remainder divided among the residuary legatees. The fund now for distribution, viz., the proceeds of the personalty, is but a part of the fund out of which these legacies are payable; and it is proper that the condition of the whole fund should be taken into consideration in order to arrive at a correct conclusion respecting the questions involved.</p>

He finds that the widow declined to accept under the will, and elected to take the portion of the decedent’s estate to which she would be entitled under the law had said decedent died intestate. He finds “ that all the real estate of said decedent was sold by said executors on order of the Orphans’ Court. ” We should know what became of the proceeds of that sale of real estate, because they are a part of the fund out of which these legacies are to be paid. The auditor’s minutes show that the evidence was before him. In brief, it is that the testator’s widow commenced proceedings for the partition of his real estate which resulted in sales of all of it for the aggregate sum of $9,814. The last sales were confirmed absolutely on June 24,1889. The terms "of sale, as finally ordered by the court, were that the executors, (they being the trustees who made the sales,) should receive from the purchasers one half of the purchase money presently on confirmation of sale “ and the remaining one half to remain charged upon the said real estate during the lifetime of Eveline Ferguson, widow of said Samuel Ferguson, deceased, the interest thereof to be paid to her annually, and the principal to be paid at her death to the parties then entitled thereto, and to be secured by bond and mortgage on the premises.”</p>

One half of the proceeds of the realty will probably be for distribution soon; and the remainder of the realtjq amounting to over $4,500, is secured by bonds and mortgages on the respective parcels of land sold, and to be distributed at the death of the widow, the time when, by the will, all the legacies were to be paid.</p>

Under the will there could not be, and as the facts now are there cannot be, anything but personal estate to resort to, and this position of the auditor fails to apply to this case.</p>

In that case all the legacies were of one class; they were all residuary, and none of them was affected to a greater degree than were all the others by the widow’s election. There the present payment to one was no injury to another; they were all equal. That is not our case. Here the particular legatees are entitled to be paid in full at the death of the widow, and there will be money enough to pay them. They are in no way injured or disappointed by the widow’s election. The widow has withdrawn from the fund one half of the proceeds of the personal estate. That loss must fall on the residuary legatees. To that extent they are disappointed. On the other hand, the widow has, by her election, released one half of the personal estate and one half of the real estate proceeds, which were by the will to be held till her death, so that that much of the fund for the payment of legacies can now be distributed. Surely it would be just, when the particular legatees are in no way injured, to make this benefit, which the widow’s election has made possible, compensate the injury which that election occasions to the residuary legatees.</p>

The other legatees have no right to complain if the court do equity to the disappointed ones, so far as the condition of the fund will permit. The language of Justice Stekrett, in Young’s Appeal, is as applicable here as in that case. “ By the terms of the will their legacies are not payable until the death of the widow, and what right have they to demand payment in advance of the time, so long as there are disappointed beneficiaries who in equity should be compensated?” It follows from these authorities, that the persons to whom the learned auditor made distribution are not now entitled to this fund.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b240-4" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[246,876,1177,1106]]]'>The next question is, what should be done with the fund ? Provision must be made for the payment in full of these particular legacies when the time arrives for their payment. The present fund might be invested, and the interest paid to the residuary legatees during the life of the widow, and at her death the principal paid to the other legatees, but that does not appear to be necessary in this ease. The residuary legatees are entitled to the whole fund, composed of that now for distribution and the proceeds of the sale of the realty, except so much as may be necessary to pay the particular legacies at the death of the widow. That amount can be very nearly ascertained now, and in no event can it reach $3,000. If that amount were securely invested until the widow’s death, it would meet every requirement by others than the residuary legatees. As the facts are, there is now over $4,600 so invested, the interest of which is to be paid to the widow. I do not know how the court could make another investment more secure or more likely to be collected than this one. It is ample in amount and in security to meet every necessity of the case. There is, then, no necessity to invest the present fund. It may as well be paid at once to the persons who in any event would be entitled to it with its interest.</p>

Then came the particular legatees and after them the residuary legatees. The effect of a widow’s refusal to take under her husband’s will, is to make all the legacies which the will postpones until her death, due and payable immediately: Goover’s App., <a href="/pa/74/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="74 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1034681" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0143-01">74 Pa. 143</a>.

Porter, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Pa.%20537" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="13 Pa. 537">13 Pa. 537</a>. Hence, when she refuses to accept under the will, all provisions intended for her benefit are, in legal effect, eliminated, and the legacies to be paid at her death become presently due and payable in the order mentioned in the will. Accordingly, the particular legacies in this will were entitled to be paid out of the first money ready for distribution. Equity has been called in, in a number of cases, to aid in preventing the defeat of the testator’s intention, as in Gallagher’s App., <a href="/pa/87/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="87 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1057839" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0200-01">87 Pa. 200</a>; but never to introduce an interference with the plain intention of the testator or the well-established rules of distribution.</p>

The decree in this case proceeds on a principle the very reverse of that laid down in Gallagher’s Appeal. It advances the residuary legatees at the expense of the particular legatees, and compels the appellant to receive his five per cent, which is due to him from the entire estate, real and personal, out of the proceeds of the real estate, at the death of the widow, if he ever gets it at all. By the election of the widow, $1,411.83 was withdrawn from the distribution directed by the will, and the appellant was disappointed to the extent of five per cent <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>thereof. Yet the court makes no compensation to him for this disappointment. The cases cited by the court below do not support the decree. Sandoe’s App., <a href="/pa/65/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="65 Pa. 314" data-case-ids="430671" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0314-01">65 Pa. 314</a>, read in connection with Bard’s Est., <a href="/pa/58/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="58 Pa. 393" data-case-ids="1013158" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0393-01">58 Pa. 393</a>, a prior case in the same estate, is an authority for reversing in this case.

N. 172, support the doctrine laid down by the court below. The exceptions to the auditor’s report raised no question as to the real estate fund, and it was error for the court to make a general reconstruction of the work of the auditor.</p>

This was not a case of the abatement of legacies, but simply the postponement of the particular legacies until the time provided in the will for their payment. By the decree of the court, the particular legatees are to get the sums bequeathed to them and are to receive payment at the time specified therefor in the will. The appellant’s counsel beg the question in assuming that the appellant will not receive five per cent of the amount which the widow has taken. No one disputes his right to it, and under a proper construction of the will he will be entitled to it at the proper time.</p>

The condition of the particular legatees is not affected by the widow’s election, but that of the residuary legatees is affected very materially.

In such circumstances, equity would come to their relief. Our position is squarely within the decisions in Vance’s Est., 24 W. N. 172, and Young’s App., <a href="/pa/108/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="108 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="539233" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0017-01">108 Pa. 17</a>.

    <p id="b243-5" data-blocks='[["BL_243.6",243,[224,1133,1180,917]]]'>It was held in Coover’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=74%20Pa.%20148" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="74 Pa. 148">74 Pa. 148</a>, that devises or be-q uests, subordinate to a life-estate in the widow and contingent upon her death, or payment of which is postponed until then, become presently payable upon her election to take under the intestate laws. As to its effect upon all claims under the will, her election is equivalent to her death. This is the general rule, and if there are any exceptions, they must depend on the expression or unavoidable implication of a contrary intent of the testator. No such intent is apparent in the present will. The widow was the chief object of the testator’s bounty. With the exception of a small piece of land which he appears to have overlooked, he left her his whole estate, real and personal, either in specie, or in income, for her life. He gave nothing to anybody until her death. When, therefore, she renounced the provisions of the will, and claimed her legal rights under the intestate law, there was no longer any reason why the definite legacies to appellant and others should be postponed, and they became immediately due.</p>
    <p id="b243-6" data-blocks='[["BL_243.7",243,[231,2057,1177,452]],["BL_244.1",244,[264,388,1182,1887]]]'>The learned court below was, however, of opinion that, as the residuary legatees would be disappointed in the amount coming to them, which would be diminished by the half of the personalty taken absolutely by the widow, they should be compensated out of the benefits intended to be conferred on the widow by the will which she has renounced. The principle is well settled that equity will depart from the literal provisions of a will in order to carry out a superior or preferred intent of the testator which would otherwise fail. But the object is not to <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>produce a distribution which the court may think more equal or more equitable, but to approximate as closely as possible to the scheme of the testator which has failed by reason of intervening rights or circumstances. Hence the regular order of the will is never departed from except of necessity, and then only to the extent that necessity requires. There is no such necessity in the present case. The exact scheme of the testator has been somewhat disarranged, but, taking out the widow’s share, and treating her election as equivalent to her death, there is nothing at all in the way of carrying out the remaining directions of the will literally. True, the residuary legacies will be lessened in amount, but that is the unavoidable incident of such legacies. They take only what is left, be it much or little. Had the estate here, by any accident, been reduced to four thousand dollars, the widow would have taken one half, the definite legatees the other half, and the residuaries nothing. On the other hand, had it increased to forty thousand dollars, the definite legatees would still have got no more than their five hundred dollars each, and the residuaries would have reaped the full benefit of the rise. Such subjection to contingencies is the fortune of residuary gifts. The testator is presumed to have known this ; and yet, knowing it, he provided that each of the definite legatees should receive five hundred dollars before the residuaries should receive anything. To postpone the former to the latter would be a plain violation of the testator’s express command. In this case, the definite legatees, to be sure, get the benefit of the acceleration of payment, but so also do the residuaries. The latter, moreover, get the advantage of one half the personalty given by the will absolutely to the widow, and it might so happen that this, and the acceleration of payment, would be practically more valuable to the residuary legatees than the provisions of the will. The use and income from now until the death of the widow may far more than make up for the diminution of the principal. That is a matter which will vary with the facts of each case. But the law must have a settled and uniform rule, and it is that the widow’s election to take against the will is equivalent to her death.</p>
    <p id="b244-4" data-blocks='[["BL_244.4",244,[266,2277,1175,151]],["BL_245.1",245,[201,367,1175,453]]]'>It is urged “by the appellee that the testator made a distinction between the fund raised by the sale of the property not bequeathed to his wife, and the sale to be made after her death; <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>and tbat it is out of the proceeds of tins latter sale that the definite legacies are directed to be paid. But the distinction between the two funds has been obliterated by action of the widow equivalent to her death. Again, it is said that the pan ticular pecuniary legacies are not made payable out of the per sonal estate. But neither are the residuary legacies. Both are payable out of the same fund, and there is no sufficient reason for departing from the ordinary rule that specific legacies are to be first paid, and then the residuaries.</p>
    <p id="b245-4" data-blocks='[["BL_245.4",245,[204,830,1185,1533]]]'>The learned judge was largely influenced by Young’s App., <a href="/pa/108/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="108 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="539233" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0017-01">108 Pa. 17</a>, and the reasoning of the court below in that case would appear to sustain his conclusion. But, though the decree in Young’s Appeal was affirmed, the opinion of this court contains no intimation of an intent to depart from the principle settled in Coover’s Appeal. The main question was whether the annuity survived. It was charged expressly on the life-estate of the Avife; and when the wife destroyed that estate by action equivalent to her death, it was claimed that the annuity fell also. To save the annuity as a preferred intent of the testator, was the object of invoking the principle now under discussion, and to that only was the opinion of this court directed. If there was any departure from the recognized principle in the other points involved, it was because they were so subordinate that it was overlooked in the general affirmance of the decree, which was clearly right on the main and only important question. The case was intended to be in entire harmony with the rule laid down in Coover’s Appeal, and with the applications that had been made of it in other cases. In one of these, Gallagher’s App., <a href="/pa/87/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="87 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1057839" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0200-01">87 Pa. 200</a>, the law is well expressed by the learned judge of the court below, approved by this court, as follows: “Where a widow elects not to take under a will, her substituted devises and bequests are a trust in her for the benefit of the disappointed claimants, to the amount of their interest therein. A court of equity will sequester the benefit intended for the wife, to secure compensation to those whom her election disappoints. Then add the general rule that specific legatees and devisees shall be first satisfied, and any deficiency or loss must fall upon the residuary legatees, and we think this question is decided.”</p>
    <p id="b245-5" data-blocks='[["BL_245.5",245,[251,2371,1134,33]],["BL_246.1",246,[257,363,1181,1060]]]'>From these views it follows that in its main features the dis<a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>tribution reported by the auditor was correct, but it must be modified in regard to tbe five per cent payable to tbe appellant. By tbe terms of tbe codicil tbis was to’ be “ five per cent of tbe value of all tbe personal and real estate remaining at tbe death of Eveline Ferguson.” Tbis is five per cent of tbe whole net fund for distribution, and must be so calculated, though it will of course come out of the remaining half, after the widow has taken her half. There is, however, no reason why it should have any priority in payment over tbe definite pecuniary legacies. It is no more definite, and is given no precedence over them by the will. It should therefore come in pari passu. It would have simplified matters in this respect, and avoided any question of pro-rating, if the second fund arising from the sale of the real estate, etc., had been referred also to the auditor, but as it was not, the distribution must be made without reference to it. The widow will take one half as if the decedent had died intestate, and the other half will then pass under the will as if the widow were dead. The definite pecuniary legatees, including the appellant’s five per cent, will take the balance of the present fund pro rata, and the residuaries will have to wait until there is a residue to come to them.</p>
