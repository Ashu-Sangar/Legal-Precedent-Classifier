    <p class="summary" id="b357-7" data-blocks='[["BL_357.7",357,[266,934,1181,1523]]]'>At the trial on April 20, 1890, it was shown that on February 21, 1887, the plaintiff was in the employ of the defendant, a manufacturer of bottles at Tarentum. His duty was the grinding of bottle necks. The machine at which he was employed consisted of a grinder made of a horizontal plate of cast iron hung on a perpendicular shaft, the plate being protected by a sheet-iron casing about it, extending a little above its upper edge. Over the plate was suspended a box, feeding upon it sand and water. The shaft was run by a belt attached at its top. The testimony of the plaintiff was to the effect that the bearings of the shaft at the top and bottom had become worn so that it wabbled, and tended to throw the belt from the shaft pulley; that no sufficient hanger was supplied to catch the belt should it become loose and fall; that while the plaintiff was at work the belt fell upon him, and, in attempting to lift it from about his head, he was caught about the shaft and his right arm so badly mangled that it had to be amputated. As he testified, he had never seen or been employed about the machine until that day, and his instructions were limited to directions how to hold the bottles upon the grinder. There was also evidence that the engine running the shaft was not at the time in the care of the proper engineer, and that one Stoltz, a fellow employee, ran to the engine and stopped it. From the evidence on the part of the defendant, it was claimed that the plaintiff was guilty of negligence in being at the place where the belt would strike him if it fell; that at that point, which was rather between the shelving and the grinder, there was but little room, and plenty of room about it at other places; that the shaft was not in bad working order, and that the plaintiff’s injury was caused by the carelessness of the boy Stoltz with the engine.</p>

Was it from plaintiff climbing up on the grinder to put back <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>tbe belt that bad fallen from tbe pulley ? That is the first question to be determined in this case. The theory of the defendant, upon that point, is that the plaintiff, being in this place, assuming for the present that it was a proper one where he had a right to be, and the belt having fallen, undertook to replace the belt, and in doing that got his knees upon the rim of the grinder, reached up his hand or arm in such a way that it got caught in the belt, and was in that way drawn on the grinder, and the injury sustained. If that is so, the plaintiff cannot recover in this case. It was something he had no business to do. It was an act of carelessness, and an act his duty did not require him to perform; and if that is the way the accident happened, he cannot recover.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b360-4" data-blocks='[["BL_360.4",360,[263,1026,1172,1367]],["BL_361.1",361,[262,383,1173,146]]]'>If he was not drawn upon the grinder and hurt by means of climbing up upon it in that way, as is alleged by the defendant, and, of course, denied by the plaintiff, the next question is, was he in a place where it was apparent from the arrangement of the machine and the bench, if there was a bench there, he should not have placed himself ? If he climbed up he cannot recover. If he did not climb up, was he in a place where he had no business to be? You will recollect on that subject there is no evidence indicating that he was put in any particular place. He was taken to the machine and directed to go to work. He had a right, in the absence of anything that would indicate the contrary, to go to work wherever it was most convenient. If the water was splashing around one place more than another and the one place seemed to be a better place than another, so far as his own convenience or comfort was concerned, he had a right to assume or take that position and go to work. [If there were nothing other than the belt running over his head to indicate danger, if there were nothing that would indicate it was not a proper place, not a place intended for him to go, or for a workman to be; if the surroundings indicated it was a place where he should not go, where it was apparent to a man of ordinary discretion, (and he is to be held to that,) he had no business to be, and he placed himself there, and the belt fell down upon him and drew him on to this grinder, he cannot recover, because that would be negligence. That is based on the assumption that, if he was put there without instructions, it would be a dangerous place to go, because <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>in the absence of that he cannot be held negligent in doing that he had no warning against, either in words or in appearances, as to danger.] 8</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b361-5" data-blocks='[["BL_361.4",361,[265,537,1173,608]]]'>Then I say, first, if the accident occurred by his climbing upon the grinder to put back the belt, as claimed by the defendant, the plaintiff cannot recover, because he was guilty of contributory negligence; second, if it did not occur in that way, but, as the plaintiff claims, by being drawn upon the grinder, then, if he was in a place where it was apparent from the arrangement of the machine and the bench he should not have placed himself, because dangerous, and the jury believe from the evidence, that if he had not been in such place the accident would not have occurred, he cannot recover; because in such case the law estops him from recovering on the ground of contributory negligence.</p>
