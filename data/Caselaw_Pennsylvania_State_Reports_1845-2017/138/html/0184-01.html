It was then said by GoedON, C. J.: “ What coal was necessary for consumption in their (Canonsburg Iron Company’s) works they must take from the plaintiffs. This is all they were bound to do, and all the plaintiffs were bound to furnish them; and it was of no consequence whether the falling off in the consumption was occasioned by the contraction of their business, or by the introduction of gas. In either case, less coal was necessary for the defendants’ manufactory, and they were not obliged to pay for what they did not require. ” Upon the present trial below the defendants attempted to ignore the above ruling. This clearly appears by their second point, in which the court below was asked to instruct the jury “ that, by the true construction <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>of the writing dated November 8, 1882, the defendant company was not bound to' take all the coal it used from the plaintiffs, but was only bound to take what coal it saw fit to order, at the prices named; and no liability arises on the part of the defendant company except for coal so ordered.” This instruction the learned judge very properly refused, as it was right in the face of our former ruling. Nor is error perceived in the answer of the court to the defendants’ seventh point. See third assignment. This point was affirmed, with a qualification which was justifiable under the circumstances. It is true, nut coal was not specifically named as such in the contract, but said contract called for all the coal used, and there was evidence that nut coal took the place of the slack; in other words, that the slack included nut coal.</p>
