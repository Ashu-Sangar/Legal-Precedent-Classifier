And the same reasons exist here, as there, for maintaining the jurisdiction of this court to afford relief. The respondents, admit that at the time of the original pledge the stocks were the property of the estate of James Marshall, deceased, and that they were illegally pledged for the individual debt of James Marshall, Jr. This court had jurisdiction of the settlement of the estate of James Marshall, deceased, and its possession of these stocks was an essential step towards that settlement. It had, in fact, possession of them, for the possession of its officer is the possession of the court: Kerr on Receivers, 165 ; Wheat-land’s App., <a href="/pa/125/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="125 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="563964" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0038-01">125 Pa. 38</a>.

This court is a court of equi-r ty, and within the orbit of its jurisdiction administers equity by the same rules and remedies. What more appropriate, indeed, what other tribunal could there be to follow these assets ? It has exclusive jurisdiction of the settlement of this estate'; and for the purpose of that settlement, had these stocks in its. possession when they were eloigned.

Those in possession are trustees ex maleficio, claiming title through a trustee who was subject to the jurisdiction of this court, and recovery of possession of these stocks is essential to the exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction of this court in the settlement of the es-, tate of James Marshall, deceased. It cannot be doubted, that in these circumstances, this court can maintain its jurisdiction as a court of equity, and restore these assets to their original status. Its equitable jurisdiction having once attached, is sufficient to embrace every relief necessary to a full disposition of the case. “ When a cause is once within the grasp of a court of equity, or a court lawfully exercising equity powers, it has no need to call in the aid of a court of law. Its process is plastic, and its power is only limited by the necessities of the case, and by its duty to administer equity in accordance with established rules.

Contempts may relate, as well to misconduct tending to obstruct the proceedings of courts or mar -their efficiency, as to disobedience to decrees; and it is obviously essential to the purposes of their jurisdiction that they should have power to punish such misconduct whenever it shall be brought to their notice: Wells oil Jur., § 178. When the jurisdiction of a court has once attached, time cannot run against its exercise. The collusion of its officers might otherwise defeat the administration of justice, without any default on the part of those for whose benefit suph jurisdiction was established. James Marshall, Jr., was amenable to the jurisdiction of this court, as acting executor of the will of James Marshall deceased, and it must be conceded that he could not have pleaded the statute of limitations as against the exercise of that jurisdiction, in respect of the stocks; his pledgees are trustees ex maleficio, who sit in his seat, amenable to the same jurisdiction; and there is no reason why they should have privileges which he could not have claimed.</p>

There was in fact no adverse claim made by these pledgees, as trustees <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>ex maleficio, until after the last note bad been discounted. They admit that until then they supposed the estate of James Marshall, deceased, was in the firm of James Marshall &amp; Co. The whole series of notes, and the successive renewals of pledges -were confessedly made upon that supposition. The last pledge •was made by James Marshall, Jr., within six years, as collateral •security for the last discounted note; there could have been no ■ pledge without actual or implied possession, and his possession was the possession of the estate. The acceptance of the pledge was a distinct recognition of title in the estate within six years. And there was no actual notice of any adverse claim by the trustees ex maleficio until after the last note had been discounted, to any of the parties, trustees, or beneficiaries named in the will ■of James Marshall, deceased. James Marshall, Jr., asserts that he was not aware the pledge was a breach of trust; and the •other parties had no knowledge that the pledge was being made. :Three of the four beneficiaries were under disabilities ; and of these, Anna F. Marshall, the present petitioner, did not obtain her majority, and was incapable of receiving notice until 1886. There was nothing in the circumstances to put any of. these parties other than James Marshall, Jr., upon their guard. These stocks were in the'custody and control of James Marshall, Jr., as their trustee; and they had a right to assume that he would ■faithfully discharge his duty.</p>

The possession of the bank lacks every element of fraud or concealment, and even of silence, to stay the running of the statute. But the appellees claim that the pledging of the stock was illegal at its inception, and that the bank was visited with notice of its illegality. If this be so, the rule of notice must work both ways. The analogy drawn by the court below between the possession of an executor and that of a receiver, is fallacious. To hold that trust assets held by an executor are in possession of the Orphans’ Court, and therefore no limitation can run against its jurisdiction, is to establish an anomaly in jurisprudence, and to depart from a long line of precedents, uniform and unbending, to the contrary. Nor does the fact that the loans were renewed within six years, toll the statute. The renewal 'notes in no way affected the bank’s possession, or the right of the executors to bring suit, or the running of the statute from the inception of the bank’s possession.</p>

Another reason prevents the bank from pleading the statute, viz., that it held the stock as a trustee ex maleficio. It was visited with notice of the provisions of the will: Gar-rard v.

It can no more set up the statute, therefore, than its co-conspirator, James Marshall, Jr., could. In cases of fraud by a trustee, the statute does not run until discovery of the fraud: Hill on Trustees, *266-269. This is such a trust, therefore, as is not barred by the statute : Yorks’ App., <a href="/citations/?q=110%20Pa.%2079" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="110 Pa. 79">110 Pa. 79</a>.</p>

But, even if the bank could be regarded as holding the stock adversely to the real owners, the statute of limitations cannot avail it, because the statute could run only from the date of the last pledge, which was within six years of the commencement of the present suit. In order that its title under the statute might mature, the bank must have held for six years uninterruptedly and adversely. An interval or lapse of one instant in the holding, or any interruption in its adverse character, will toll the statute: Clarke v. Dougan, <a href="/pa/12/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="12 Pa. 87" data-case-ids="963777" data-case-paths="/pa/12/0087-01">12 Pa. 87</a>; Sailor v.

This court has ruled that when a trustee has made an unauthorized pledge of the trust, assets, the same trustee can institute legal proceedings to recover them back, and that it is his duty to do so: Abbott v. Reeves, <a href="/pa/49/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="49 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="998423" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0494-01">49 Pa. 494</a>. The statute certainly would run against James Marshall, Jr., only from the dates of the last pledges, and probably only from the maturity of the notes for which those pledges were made: Waterman v. Brown, <a href="/pa/31/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="31 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="985126" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0161-01">31 Pa. 161</a>. This suit of Anna F. Marshall is in lieu of the suit of her unfaithful trustee. If he might sue within six years after the last pledge, can she be barred in less time ? There are no-equitable circumstances in the case to induce the court to withhold its aid from her.</p>
