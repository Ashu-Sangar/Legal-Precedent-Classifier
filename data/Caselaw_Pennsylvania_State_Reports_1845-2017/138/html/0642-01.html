On May 21, 1890, said company shipped from Hamilton a number of kegs of beer to the care of the defendant at Leechburg. They were received by the defendant on May 24th, and were sold by him on that day, in Leechburg, to residents of that borough and its vicinity. In making such sales, the defendant was acting solely as the agent of said company, and the kegs of beer were sold in the same condition as they were when originally shipped to him. There was testimony tending to show that some of the persons to whom sales were made were minors; that the persons named in the indictment as men of known intemperate habits were such, and that the defendant furnished beer to two of them by sale and to the third by gift.</p>

It is for you, gentlemen, to say, under all the evidence before you, whether or not these men named in this indictment are men of known intemperate habits; and if you conclude that they are men of known intemperate habits, and that this beer was sold to them by Charles Silverman, we would say it would be your duty to convict him under the third count of the indictment.. The reason we give for the non-application of the recent decision of the Supreme Court [of the U. S. ], as to this charge of the indictment, .is, that the commonwealth of Pennsylvania has a right to a police regulation of its affairs, and the putting into the hands of men of known intemperate habits intoxicating liquors would be a violation of the laws of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the defendant cannot shield himself under the recent decision of the Supreme Court; saying to you at the same time that original packages from another state cannot be sold in a state to which they are shipped regardless of the law there, on account of the existence of inter-state commerce; and if you find that these men were men of known intemperate habits and that the defendant, Charles Silverman, sold this liquor to them, it would be your duty to convict him of this third count in the indictment, by reason of the commonwealth of Penns}1!-vania having a right to control its police regulations.] 5 . . . .</p>
