The act of April 21,1858, P. L. 385, under which the municipal claim was filed in that case, expressly exempted the superstructures of railroads in Philadelphia from such assessments, and the policy of the law, forbidding the assessment of one highway for the improvement of another, as declared in Philadelphia v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/33/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="33 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="988384" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0041-01">33 Pa. 41</a>, gave added force to the legislative prohibition.

In § 6 of the act of 1870, the power is conferred to assess the cost of such improvements on the owners of property abutting on the street improved, by the foot-front rule; and § 18 provides that the term, owner, shall include corporations and associations having any title or interest in the properties assessed. Under § 20, when the defendant in a scire facias is a public corporation, so that the property assessed “ cannot for any reason in law be sold upon a judgment obtained on such scire facias, such lien shall be prosecuted to judgment on the scire facias; and the writ of execution to be issued on any such judgment shall be a writ of fieri facias, by virtue of which the sheriff may levy upon any personaUproperty, etc, of said corporation.”, These provisions were intended to alter, for the city of Allegheny, the law declared in Philadelphia v.

The defendant, then, may, if it chooses, abandon this ground for railroad purposes, and devote it to some other use. But, under § 18 of the act of April 1, 1870, it is immaterial whether it owns the iee or only an easement. The liability of this defendant for municipal assessments was decided by this court in West. Penoa. R. Co. v. Allegheny, 2 W. N. 229. Moreover, it is incompetent for the defendant to raise the question whether its property was benefited by the improvement for which the present lien was filed: Commonwealth v.

The councils of the city, in making this assessment, were the ministers of a sovereign state, imposing a tax by its supreme authority; and it is against the letter and policy of the law to permit the interposition of such a defence, especially when the amount of the tax is fixed by frontage. The defendant has alleged nothing to make the frontage rule unconstitutional as applied to this case.</p>

Whatever force there may be in the appellant’s contention, based upon the provisions of the act of April 1, 1870, P. L. 751, as to railroad property abutting on streets, and used for stations, warehouses, etc., it fails in its application to a case like the present, where the property is merely the roadway. The present question was neither raised nor decided in West. Penna. R. Co. v. Allegheny, 2 W. N. 229. The railroad company, in that case, contended that the assessment of the benefits sought to be collected was illegal, because based upon an unlawful taking of its property in opening a street. The decision of this court was that the company was concluded by the previous proceedings in the Court of Quarter Sessions. The provisions of the act of April 27,1864, P. L. 624, referred to by appellant’s counsel, relate to the abandonment of the canal* as distinguished from its maintenance. They do not authorize the defendant bo abandon its railroad and to devote the land to other uses. At any rate, this has not been, and is not likely to be done.</p>

Even if the act of 1870 did authorize the assessment of <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>defendant’s roadway for tbe improvement of an adjacent public street, the foot-front assessment cannot be sustained. Such a method is sustained only as a substitute for actual assessment, where the properties are of one kind and not differing much in value: Hammett v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/65/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="65 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="430574" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0146-01">65 Pa. 146</a>; Washington Ave., <a href="/citations/?q=69%20Pa.%20852" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="69 Pa. 852">69 Pa. 852</a>; Seely v.

And it appears, in the present case, that on the northern side of East Ohio street are city lots, probably substantially similar in character and value, while on the southern side is the defendant’s railroad, from twelve to fifteen feet below the grade of the street. There is no necessity for any access to the street from the railroad, but if there were, the difference in grades makes it impossible. The improvement of the street cannot possibly benefit the railroad; but even if there were a possibility of such benefits, the situation of the land and the nature of its use render it so totally unlike the property on the north side of the street, as to bring this ease within the decisions holding the frontage assessment inapplicable.</p>

We have decided, in an opinion filed herewith, Mt. Pleasant Bor. v. Railroad Company, ante 365, that a lot of land belonging to a railroad company, on which were erected a depot, freight depot, and lumber yard, was liable to a municipal claim for paving the sidewalk in •front of said lot. At the same time, we held that so much of the said lot, if any, as formed a portion of the roadbed or right of way, was not subject to the lien. We need not repeat what was said in that case. The constitutionality of assessments for street improvements can be sustained only upon the ground that the property assessed is benefited by the improvement. This is the doctrine of all the authoritiés. It is sufficient to refer' to Hammett v.

These cases, however, and the reasoning by which they are supported, have no application to the roadbed of a railroad company. This is the one species of property which it is conceded can derive no possible benefit from street improvements. "As was said in Philadelphia v. Railroad Co., supra, “ A railroad cannot, from its very nature, derive any benefit from the paving, while all the rest of the neighborhood may.” The owner of an ordinary lot of ground, whether such owner be an individual or a railroad corporation, cannot be heard to defend against a municipal assessment for paving, for the reason that the law presumes such property is benefited. But, in the case of the roadbed of a railroad, the presumption of law is the other way. It is the same at all times and under all circumstances; hence, the law declares the absence of benefits.</p>

      <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>It was urged, however, that tbe liability of a railroad company for municipal assessments was decided by this court in Western Peuna. R. Co. v. Allegheny, 2 W. N. 229. That case does not rule this, however. A railroad company may be liable for some municipal assessments. We have just decided, in Mt. Pleasant Bor. v. Railroad Co., as has been already stated, that a passenger depot, freight depot, and lumber yard were so liable. But neither of the above cases, nor any other case to which my attention has been called, has ever held that such a lien may be hied against the roadbed. It was urged, however, that it is within the power of the legislature to subject it to such claims, and that the act of 1870 has done so in the city of Allegheny. We are not discussing the power of that body to impose general taxation. It is admittedly very great, and, as observed in Fox’s App., <a href="/pa/112/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="112 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="546754" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0337-01">112 Pa. 337</a>, “ within the limits of the constitution it is bounded only by the necessities of the state and the will of the people.” We are dealing with the question of special, local taxation; of the right of municipal authorities to levy a tax upon A, which it does not impose upon B, for the reason that it has done something by which the property of A has been specially benefited to the amount of the tax. In the absence of any such benefit; in á case where we can declare as a matter of law no such benefit1 can arise, the legislature is powerless to impose such a burden, It would not be a tax in any proper sense of the term; it would be in the nature of a forced loan, and would practically amount to confiscation.</p>
