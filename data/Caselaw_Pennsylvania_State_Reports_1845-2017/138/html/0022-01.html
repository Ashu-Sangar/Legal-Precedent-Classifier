For these infringements of plaintiff’s rights, the plaintiff claims damages. The plaintiff also claims damages for a well mentioned in exhibit B and identified as the well with the bailer in it, alleging that plaintiff was damaged to the extent of §800 by reason of the defendant representing that it was a gas producing well, and that the bailer was only dropped in, while in fact it was stuck in by defendant, and that thereby the well was practically of no account. The plaintiff further claims the equitable interference of. the court, on the ground of a §250,000 mortgage that is a lien on the property described in the contracts; and further claims to recover for back rentals that it is alleged it had to pay while the defendant had possession of the wells.</p>

Mellon, were all the parties present at the making of the agreement. It is therefore manifest that this allegation of complainant could not be supported under any rule of law or equity.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b51-6" data-blocks='[["BL_51.5",51,[196,1242,1168,542]]]'>It being admitted by complainant that the wells, etc., mentioned in contract A, were delivered to it on November 16 or 17, 1888, and claimed by it and admitted by defendant that plaintiff had performed its part of the covenant in contract A, prior to the hearing of this suit, it would seem to the master that defendant’s contention that contract A makes the bill of complaint multifarious must be sustained, and it should therefore be stricken therefrom; also, on the further ground that it is but an attempt to use the equity side of the court for the mere purpose of recovering damages for the breach of contract.</p>

Neither <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>has the claim for damages on account of the well with the bailer in it. The plaintiff seems, according to the evidence, to have had notice of the fact that the bailer was in it before it bought; and the representations, or rather the allegations as to deceit, are unsupported by sufficient testimony to affect the contract, in view of the notice the plaintiff had of the bailer being in the well before it bought. The allegations that defendant neglected the wells after they were sold to plaintiff and before they were delivered, is wholly without support for want of any evidence as to this particular. This leaves only two other matters for consideration.</p>

The damages plaintiff sustained by reason of defendant’s interfering with the wells on January 26th and 29th. For this they should be compensated, but in the absence of any incidental damage being proved, actual damages only should be allowed. The highest damage proven was $200, and the estimate of Mr. Carroll, who superintended the repairs for plaintiff, was $150. In view of all the evidence, the master concludes that $175 would be a liberal allowance for the actual damages in this particular.</p>

The plaintiff estimates this damage at from fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars. The defendant contends that the gas from wells such as these was at that time worth but from fifteen to twenty-five dollars per month. The question resolves itself into what is the measure of damages. The complainant contends that they are entitled to whatever incidental damages they are able to show. The defendant contends that it is only liable for the value of gas in place, at the mouth of the wells.</p>

But it is clearly shown by plaintiff’s own evidence that if the gas from these wells had been delivered on October 30,1888, it would have been turned into a common line with gas from eleven other <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>wells, and in a commingled mass transported to tbe consumer of complainant. It does not appear from tbe testimony wbat the combined pressure of these eleven other wells was at that time, in a common line, or what the pressure of any of them was at the wells from which the gas was produced. It does appear that the C. I. McDonald well, one of the wells named in exhibit B, was not producing gas at that time, and did not for a considerable time after it was delivered.</p>

For the same reason, it is impossible to determine the value of the gas from these wells from a consideration of the receipts and expenditures of the complainant company. It remains, therefore, to consider the contention of the defendant’s proposition, the value of the gas in place.</p>

The objection, that multifariousness can only be reached by demurrer, is not tenable. In Oliver v. Piatt, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20How.%20332" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 How. 332">3 How. 332</a>, Justice Stoky says: “ The objection of multifariousness cannot, as a matter of right, be taken by the parties except by demurrer, or plea, or answer, and if not so taken, is deemed to be waived. It cannot be insisted upon by the parties, even at the hearing in the court <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>below; although it may at any time be taken by the court, sua sponte, wherever it is deemed by the court to be necessary, or proper, to assist it in the due administration of justice.” See, also, 1 Daniell’s Ch., 3 Am. ed., 852, and Equity Rule No. 7 of our Supreme Court. The case of Persch v. Quiggle, <a href="/pa/57/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="57 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="1010478" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0247-01">57 Pa. 247</a>, cited by the plaintiff’s counsel, does not sustain the position that the only way to object to multifariousness is by demurrer. Perhaps, however, it is needless to spend time on this question, as the master has found as a matter of fact that there was no breach by the defendant of contract A, and the court would not be warranted, by the evidence, in reversing this finding.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b56-4" data-blocks='[["BL_56.4",56,[261,987,1169,399]]]'>The only other matter raised by the exceptions, on either side, which requires serious attention, is the rule adopted by the master for measuring the damages resulting to the plaintiff by the defendant’s delay in giving to the plaintiff the use of the gas from the wells mentioned in contract B. The master held that the value of the gas at the wells, which was where it was agreed to be delivered, should govern. In this I think he was right.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b56-5" data-blocks='[["BL_56.5",56,[258,1394,1171,1009]],["BL_57.1",57,[221,396,1171,401]]]'>The defendant, finding that the wells mentioned in contract B had become useless to it, by reason of diminished pressure, agreed to sell them to the plaintiff for little, if any, more than the value of the pipe and other materials on the premises. The plaintiff, being nearer to its market than was the defendant, could make some use of the wells, and therefore concluded to buy them and use the gas therefrom to increase the supply it already had from numerous other producing wells. When the contract was made, no notice was given the defendant that the immediate possession of the gas under the “license” was necessary to keep going the business of the plaintiff. There is nothing to show that the defendant had reason to apprehend, at the time, that withholding the gas for a week or two would leave the plaintiff without a sufficient supply, or entail loss of custom. The written agreement, and the evidence relating to the transaction, forbid the idea that the parties could have even remotely contemplated that the defendant, for a few days’ delay, should be made liable for all the speculative, collateral and consequential damages now claimed by the plaintiff. The remarks of Justice Stekrett in Billmeyer v. Wagner, <a href="/pa/91/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="91 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="488684" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0092-01">91 Pa. </a><a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a><a href="/pa/91/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="91 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="488684" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0092-01">92</a> (paragraphs 4 and 5 of the opinion), are very applicable to the present case. See also Fleming v. Beck, <a href="/pa/48/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="48 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="422295" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0309-01">48 Pa. 309</a>; Fess-ler v.

It may be further said that under the peculiar circumstances of this case, any other way of estimating the damages than that adopted and followed by the master would be, as he has well shown, largely guess work.</p>
