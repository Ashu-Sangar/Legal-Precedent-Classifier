The entire ownership of the land so taken, thereafter became vested in the state in its character as paramount proprietor.

If the alley lying south of Second street and north of Fourth street, as appears from the draft annexed to the plaintiff’s bill, were extended so as tp close the gap, it would evidently, in part, occupy the ground <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>now occupied by the main track of the railroad, formerly the bed of the canal, and in part what was formerly the towing path.

Houses were also erected on these lots outside of the towing path facing the canal, and depending for entry and exit upon the open front afforded by the towing path. This use of the towing path was certainly acquiesced in by the canal company, and no difference how long such use has continued or how great it may have been, no rights of absolute user could have accrued either to the public or to the owners or occupiers of the lots, the property to the canal and its appurtenances being vested in the commonwealth: Haldeman v.

The station house is opposite part of the ground now sought to be taken; whilst the present main and side tracks extend along and outside, but immediately contiguous to this ground. These erections have been maintained continuously for railroad purposes, and up to this time have furnished all the facilities for operating the road that have been required. They doubtless occupy a part of the site of the alley, as would be shown by closing the gap indicated on the draft lying between Fourth and Second streets. So, in that respect, the public have acquiesced for a number of years in the occupation of at least a part of the alleged alley, thereby recognizing the right of the railroad company to the ground so occupied.</p>

The railroad company have also permitted the public to enjoy at least so much of the ground outside of these tracks as has not been required heretofore in the operation of their road. But the-railroad company have been in actual occupancy of the ground so far as it has been necessary. It has never disclaimed ownership to any part of the ground it now seeks to use and to which it clearly has title. Must it be assumed that, in order to maintain its title, it must cover its whole extent of right of way with tracks or other erections ? It is well understood that the ordinary light of way for railroad lines is sixty-six feet in width. In only a few instances in the state can it be shown that this extent of ground has been occupied by continuous tracks; and yet, is it ever true that the railroad company has lost its right to the ground adjacent to its tracks on either side by such an omission to occupy ? The nature of such thoroughfares and public highways as railroads must be taken into consideration. They are, perhaps, to a larger extent than anything else in modern years, developing agencies, tending largely to develop business and increase population. With this increase of population and of business, facilities only contemplated at the beginning but not completed have to be provided from time to time to meet the <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>public demands. Hence it would be unreasonable to bold that the mere nonuser of a part of a railroad location, side by side with the part in actual continuous use and embraced in the original grant, would revert to the public, simply because the public had enjoyed a permissive, not a hostile use, of this contiguous ground.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b120-4" data-blocks='[["BL_120.4",120,[245,675,1171,1000]]]'>We think the construction of a track or tracks, upon a part of the location throughout its length, is the best assertion of right to the entire width that could in the nature of railroad construction and operation be demanded. By'the side of every railroad track extending throughout the country beaten paths may everywhere be found, daily used and traveled upon by the public and enjoyed as the easiest and most convenient thoroughfare, for such in reality they become. And yet the thought is never entertained that the public, by the most constant and continuous use of such ground, acquires an indefeasible title to it. The reason is palpable. The presence of the railroad tracks constantly in use is the defiant badge of ownership. It is the only practical assertion of title that can be made. The rule does not differ because the location of a road is through a more populous district, in this case through a borough, whose citizens have availed themselves of the convenience of using the ground along the railroad track, notwithstanding the railroad ties and rails of the company may not have spanned and bound literally, with an iron grasp from one side to the other, its authorized domain.</p>

Unless it were shown that the plaintiffs have occupied to the full extent of their claim or title on the lower side, we can see no better right that the plaintiffs wofild have to the ground on the upper or west, than they have to the ground on the lower side. The west or upper side of the canal was what was known as the berme side, and therefore the side not occupied in the operation of the canal, consequently, furnishing less evidence of appropriation to canal purposes than would the other, or towing path side.</p>

The suggestion that the occupation of the berme side of the canal would'do less local injury, cannot be regarded as a reason for compelling the railroad company to lay its track on that side, if it is of greater advantage to the company in the construction of a general thoroughfare or public highway, intended for the benefit, safety and convenience of the general public, as well as its own, to place the track where it now proposes to place it.</p>

Sterrett, then an able and experienced judge of Allegheny county, and now a learned member of the Supreme Court. The case presented two features: one, that whatever right the company had to the land outside of the original location for roadbed, nearly, sixty-six feet, it was lost by reason of non-user and the statute of limitations, it having been shown that the defendant had closed it in by fencing it; second, that that part of the actual roadbed, closed in by the defendant, was also lost to the plaintiffs by reason of the statute of limitations. Judge Sterrett in answering the defendant’s point, says, “ that the statute will not run against the plaintiff’s right of way. The charter makes the road a <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>public highway, and we are satisfied that the statute of limitations will not run against the plaintiff’s right of way, and as a matter of law we so instruct you.”</p>
