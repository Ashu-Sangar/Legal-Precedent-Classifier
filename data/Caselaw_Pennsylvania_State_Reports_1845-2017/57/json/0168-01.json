        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nAgnew, J.\nIt has been said so often that it will scarcely bear repeating, that the proper course when the recognisance of an appellant is defective or invalid, is not to dismiss the appeal, but to rule him to amend or perfect it, and to dismiss only as the penalty of neglect or refusal. The right of appeal and of trial by jury is too precious to be frustrated by the ignorance, incompetency or malice of inferior magistrates and officers: Means v. Trout, 16 S. & R. 349; Huntingdon Borough v. Jackson, 2 Penna. R. 431; Bream v. Spangler, 1 W. & S. 378; Adams v. Null, 5 Id. 363; Ihmsen v. Mon. Nav. Co., 3 Casey 267. It is not safe or expedient to rely upon a discarded practice, or upon overruled cases. This is sufficient to dispose of the 1st and 2d assignments of error.\nThe 3d error is unaccompanied with the bill of exceptions, and is therefore informally assigned. But I may say, without a specific rule of the court to regulate the practice in this respect, it is the defendant\u2019s right under the Act of Assembly to claim and give evidence \u00a9f the damages he has sustained by reason of his removal from the premises. No other notice than the law itself, was therefore necessary to be given by him to his landlord. Tho law prescribes the issue, which is to be tried in the same manner as an action of ejectment, and directs the jury if they find for the tenant, to assess the damages caused by his removal.\nThe 4th error is not sustained. The examination of the defendant\u2019s daughter in surrebuttal, after she had been examined before, was a matter within the sound discretion of the court. Slight explanations will often explain-apparent discrepancies, or exhibit a witness\u2019s truthfulness; and a court will not suffer truth to be smothered by form, when a discreet exercise of its power will prevent it.\nWe discover no error in the charge of the judge or his answer to the plaintiff\u2019s points, as set forth in the 5th and 6th assignments of error. The court was right in refusing permission' to the plaintiff to take a nonsuit. The defendant had a right to the verdict, both to be restored to possession and to recover his damages for removal.\nNone of the errors are sustained, and the judgment is affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Koenig versus Bauer.\n1. An appeal should not be dismissed because the recognisance is defective, until the appellant has been ruled to perfect it.\n2. It is not error to allow an appellant to file an amended recognisance.\n3. Where a landlord has ejected the tenant under a judgment of a justice and the case is tried on an appeal, the tenant can show his damage by the removal and the value of the place to him.\n4. The examination of witnesses in surrebuttal, is within the discretion of the judge trying the case.\n5. On- an appeal the jury are to decide the case precisely as if there had been no prior decision. A landlord who has taken possession under an alderman's habere, cannot suffer a nonsuit upon trial of the appeal.\nFebruary 4th 1868.\nBefore Thompson, C. J., Strong, Agnew and Sharswood, JJ. Bead, J., at Nisi Prius.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia : No. 451, to January Term 1867.\nThis was originally a landlord and tenant case, under the Act of December 14th 1863. The landlord obtained a judgment before the alderman. The defendant appealed, giving security for all damages and costs until final judgment, but not for all costs and rent accrued or that might accrue up to final judgment.\nThe landlord issued a writ of possession and the tenant was ejected.\nThe landlord moved to strike off the appeal because of the defect in the recognisance. The defendant then asked leave to file the required recognisance. This was granted, and the required recognisance was filed. In answer to a rule to declare the landlord filed a narr. in ejectment. The tenant pleaded not guilty.\nOn the trial the landlord gave in evidence his deed \u2014 proved possession in his grantor and rested.\nThe tenant alleged and proved by his daughter that the notice to quit was not served three months before the expiration of the term. He then offered to show \u201cwhat his damage was by the removal, and the value of the place to him at the time of the removal.\u201d This was objected to, but admitted under exception.\nThe landlord then in rebuttal, proved a notice to quit three months before the expiration of the year in a conversation with the tenant\u2019s daughter.\nThe tenant recalled the daughter and offered to contradict this evidence. The offer was objected to, but admitted under exception.\nThe evidence being closed on both sides, plaintiff\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge the jury that, \u201c as the plaintiff recovered a judgment before the alderman, after the hearing of both parties, and as that judgment gave the plaintiff a right to eject the defendant, notwithstanding the appeal of the defendant, the presumption is that that judgment was right, and the plaintiff had a right to the possession of the premises.\u201d\nThe court (Brewster, J.), charged the jury as follows:\u2014\n\u201c This is what is called' a landlord and tenant case, under the provisions of the Act of 1863. It comes before you on an appeal by the defendant to the decision of the alderman, and you are now to decide it precisely as if no prior decision in favor of the plaintiff had taken place.\n\u201cPrior to the Act of 1772, landlords had to bring ejectment, which subjected them to much trouble and delay. The Act of 1772 was then passed, authorizing a proceeding before two justices and a sheriff\u2019s jury, in cases where landlords desired .to recover the possession of the premises. Then the Act of December 14th 1863 was passed, authorizing a complaint before a single justice, and providing for no jury trial. It gives an appeal which is not a supersedeas, but the act declares that the appeal shall be tried as actions of ejectment are tried, and if the jury find for the tenant they shall \u2018 assess the damages sustained by reason of his removal.\u2019 The controversy here is on the words of the law, \u2018 having given three months\u2019 notice of such intention to have again and repossess the premises.\u2019 The defendant contends no such notice was given. The plaintiff asserts it was given. This is the first question you have to pass upon.\u201d\nAfter referring to the testimony, the court said: \u2014 \u25a0\n\u201c The question of the credibility of these witnesses is exclusively for the jury. If they find due notice was given, then their verdict should be for the plaintiff. If no such notice was given, then their verdict should be for the defendant. In the latter case you are \u2018 to assess the damages sustained by reason of the defendant\u2019s removal.\u2019 There is no evidence of malice or oppression. The defendant does not contend for this. The defendant is entitled to compensatory damages only.\u201d\nThe point for charge was thus answered:\u2014\n\u201c The presumption is in favor of the regularity and fairness of all judicial proceedings, but the alderman\u2019s judgment is not binding upon the jury.\u201d And the court also charged the jury that they were \u201c to decide the case precisely as if no prior, decision in favor of the plaintiff had taken place.\"\nTo this answer and charge the plaintiff excepted. He then moved to take a nonsuit; which was refused and an exception noted.\nThe jury having found damages in favor of the tenant, and judgment having been entered for the tenant, the landlord took this writ of error and filed the following Assignments of error:\u2014\nThat the c.ourt below erred:\n1. In not quashing the appeal, as the recognisance was not filed in time, nor before th\u00e9 proper tribunal.\n2. In requiring the plaintiff to declare, as the appeal was defective and the case not regularly and properly in court.\n3. In not overruling the defendant\u2019s offer \u201c to show what his damage was by the removal, and the value of the place to him at the time of the removal.\u201d\n4. In permitting the defendant to call and examine- his daughter in surrebuttal \u201cto contradict Langebartel by showing what he said to her when she called on him to- see if the property had been sold, and at other times.\u201d\n5. In answering plaintiff\u2019s point, \u201cas the plaintiff recovered a judgment before the alderman, after hearing both parties, and as that judgment gave the plaintiff a right to eject the defendant, notwithstanding the appeal of the defendant, the presumption is that .the judgment was right, and the plaintiff had a right to the possession of the premises,\u201d as follows, viz.: \u201c The presumption is in favor of the regularity and fairness of all judicial proceedings, but the alderman\u2019s judgment is not binding upon the jury.\u201d\n6. In charging the jury that they were \u201c to decide the case precisely as if no prior decision in favor of the plaintiff had taken place.\u201d\n7. In not permitting the plaintiff to take a nonsuit.\nThe case was argued by B. Woodward, for plaintiff in error,\nwho cited Guilky v. Gillingham, 3 S. & R. 93; Langs v.
