He said if I would trust him to do the conveyancing, he would have all the papers prepared in time. I told him it was not sufficient time to make an examination of the title and get out searches — only three working days. I told him so.

There are but three links: the deed of Charles Henry Eisher to the Merchants’ Insurance Company ; from the Merchants’ Insurance Company to the Exchange Insurance Company, and from the Exchange Insurance Company to Charles Macalester. I have continued the brief to include these three links. Here it is, with Harry Wharton’s opinion on it.’ He said: ‘I had made the searches, procured certificates to show the title .clear of encumbrance, but I have loaned them to Mr. Livensetter, who is drawing other deeds. As soon as he is through examining them, I will hand them over to you, with the old title-papers.’ I consented. I called on the morning of the 2d * * the deeds were not prepared for execution. * * He said if I would give him a check ‘ I can settle all your business satisfactorily.’ ” Cavender accordingly gave defendant a check for $6231, the purchase-money of five ground-rents, including that in question. He afterwards received the deed to the plaintiff for the ground-rent and the searches, which he did not then examine. Some time afterwards, the defendant sent his clerk to inform Cavender that the ground-rent was advertised for sale by the sheriff, and he informed Cavender that there was an interlocutory judgment which Mr. Wharton said did not bind the ground-rent. Cavender then examined the searches which he had not seen before, and found a judgment certified.

I was about to levy on these ground-rents, when either some member of the company, or Mr. Muirhead on behalf of them, came to me and said that they were very desirous of preventing a sacrifice of these ground-rents, and therefore they would prefer to have them sold, and they would pay the amount of the judgments. I agreed to that. Some time subsequently, Mr. Muirhead stated he had procured a purchaser, but desired me to examine the title and to look at the searches, which I agreed to do. These searches were then produced to me — that was some time in April or May 1859 — showing two judgments; one judgment which I held myself, and another in favor of Charles W. Howland. On that appearing, I requested Mr. Muir-head to furnish me with copies of the docket-entries of that judgment, .and to make any further examination which might be necessary. He furnished me with the docket-entries of the judgment, and also the papers in the case. It appeared to be an action on a policy of insurance in which judgment was taken for want of a plea. That judgment was subsequently opened, the order being made on payment of costs. It also appeared that a writ of inquiry had been taken out. I directed Mr. Muirhead to examine the sheriff’s office and the prothonotary’s office, to discover whether it had ever been executed. He informed me that it had not been executed. I directed that the costs that appeared in the case, and on the payment of which the order to open the judgment was passed, should be paid. Under those circumstances I had no doubt that that judgment was not a lien. For that reason I gave my opinion, as it appears here, that the property was clear1 of encumbrances other than the judgment which I myself held. After that the matter was placed in Mr. Porter’s hands, as counsel for Mr. Maealester; and I had no further knowledge of the subject until very recently.”</p>

I had also occasion to. <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>examine some papers upon the record referred to in the brief, but I cannot tell what they were.

I have no recollection of seeing the searches; but upon inquiring upon that point, it was said that the searches had been submitted, I think it was to Mr. Wharton,' and then or about that time the fact was stated that there was a judgment on the searches, to which no amount had been fixed. And so I gave it as my opinion that that judgment need not stand in the way of the purchase. I cannot say that this was before the purchase was actually made. On learning that the searches had been submitted to Mr. Wharton, I felt no more concern or uneasiness about it; but I do remember that about that time this fact was called to my attention.”</p>

If, however, you are of opinion that there was no fraud or want of fairness on his part, the inquiry will then be, was he employed as a conveyancer by the plaintiff? Was he guilty of negligence in the course of that employment ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b165-7" data-blocks='[["BL_165.5",165,[220,1214,1156,856]]]'>“ It cannot be said that there is no evidence from which the jury can find that the defendant was acting as the plaintiff’s agent. At the same time the evidence is equally if not more consistent with the idea that what passed between the defendant and Mr. Cavender was not an agreement to examine the title for the plaintiff, but an assurance that it did not need examination, that it had been already investigated, and that the plaintiff might safely rely on the result. If this be so, there is no responsibility on the part of the defendant, because a man who expresses an opinion as such is only responsible for expressing it fairly. He is not responsible for its absolute correctness. It is proper to add in this connection that, according to the testimony given by Mr. Cavender, the defendant did not take out, and was not paid for taking out searches against any one. That the only compensation he received was for drawing the deed, and that he was told that it was not necessary to have searches made against Mr. Macalester.

A conveyancer does not guaranty the titles which he passes — such a liability would not readily be assumed for such a reward as the evidence in this case shows is ordinarily paid to conveyancers for examining titles. What he does undertake is to use due care according to the light which he has, and to have such a reasonable amount of light as a man in his walk of life ought to bring to the discharge of his <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>professional <em>duties. </em>If walking by that light and with a proper degree of care he makes a slip, it is not negligence. But if from want of proper knowledge, from a failure to use proper means, or from carelessness in applying those means to the matter in hand, loss results to his client, the fault is his, and he will be responsible.</p>

Did he fail to use the proper means? Did he neglect to apply them in the proper manner? Was he ignorant of what he ought to have known ?

    <p class="summary" id="b166-7" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[278,986,1162,1150]]]'>“ The specific negligence charged in this instance is the failure to inform the plaintiff of the existence of the judgment under 'which the ground-rents were subsequently sold; and testimony has been adduced to show that whenever a judgment appears on the face of the searches, it is the duty of a conveyancer to disclose the existence of the judgment to his client, whether it is or is not, in his opinion, or according to the opinion of counsel, a lien. There is, however, no rule of law rendering such a disclosure imperative, and the question whether it should be made is one of facts and circumstances. When, for instance, the lien of a judgment expires by lapse of time, or when it is opened and a verdict rendered for the defendant which is confirmed by the court, the original judgment still remains on the judgment-index, and may be returned by the prothonotary if searches are ordered; and yet it cannot be said to be the duty of a lawyer to advert to the existence of such a judgment in giving an opinion upon the goodness of the title or advising a purchaser that it is safe to buy. The question whether the defendant is responsible for not disclosing this judgment is therefore an open question, which ought not to be decided adversely, unless the defendant was negligent. All that a professional man is bound to do in any case is to seek for information at the best sources, and apply that information honestly and fairly when obtained with proper care and diligence. His conduct is not necessarily to be judged by the result. It is rather to be tested by considering what was the best light to <em>be </em>had at the time, and whether the error, if he committed one, was the result of an excusable mistake or of negligence.</p>

It requires an acquaintance with the general principles of the law of real property and a large amount of practical knowledge, which can only be derived from experience. In England it has been pursued by lawyers of the greatest eminence. As our titles become more complex, with the increase of wealth, and the desires which always accompany it to continue it in our name and family as long as the law will permit, it will become more and more necessary that gentlemen prepared by a course of liberal education and previous study should devote themselves to it. There have been and still are such among us. The rule of liability for errors of judgment as applied to them ought to be the same as in the case of gentlemen in the practice of law or medicine. It is not a mere art, but a science. “ That part of the profession,” said Lord Mansfield, “which is carried on by attorneys is liberal and reputable, as well as useful to the public, when they conduct themselves with honor and integrity; and they ought to be protected when they act to the best of their skill and knowledge. But‘ every man is liable to error; and I should be very sorry that it should be taken for granted that an attorney is answerable for every error or mistake. <em>* * * * * </em>A counsel may mistake as well as an attorney. Yet no one will say that a counsel who has been mistaken shall be charged. * * * Not only counsel, but judges, may differ, or doubt, or take time to consider. Therefore an attorney ought not to be liable in case of a reasonable doubt:” Pitt <em>v. </em>Yalden, 4 Burr. 2060. The rule <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>declared by Lord Mansfield has been followed in all the subsequent cases. “No attorney,” said C. J. Abbott, “is bound to know all the law; God forbid that it should be imagined that an attorney or a counsel, or even a judge, is bound to know all the law; or that an attorney is to lose his fair recompense on account of an error, being such an error as a cautious man might fall into :” Montriou <em>v. </em>Jefferys, 2 C. &amp; P. 113; and see Godefroy <em>v. </em>Dalton, 6 Bing. 460; Kemp <em>v. </em>Burt, 4 B. &amp; Ad. 424; Gilbert <em>v. </em>Williams, <a href="/mass/8/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="8 Mass. 51" data-case-ids="2028566" data-case-paths="/mass/8/0048-01">8 Mass. 51</a>.</p>
    <p id="b168-6" data-blocks='[["BL_168.4",168,[272,808,1151,812]]]'>If the defendant had undertaken to act upon his own opinion that the judgment, which appeared on the searches, was not a final one, and therefore not a lien upon the ground-rent, the title of which it was his duty to examine, could we say that, before the decision of this court in Sellers <em>v. </em>Burk, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20344" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="11 Wright 344">11 Wright 344</a>, the mistake was one which could only result from the want of ordinary knowledge and skill or the failure to exercise due caution ? But when in addition it appears that having been previously employed to investigate the same title, he had submitted it to eminent counsel, who had given a written opinion in its favor without even expressing a doubt as to the judgment in question, to hold him responsible would be to establish a rule, the direct effect of which would he to deter all prudent and responsible men from pursuing a vocation environed with such perils. We think the court below was right in refusing to charge as requested in the plaintiff’s points; all of which assume as matter of law that to pass 'the title with such an encumbrance upon it was evidence of want of ordinary knowledge and skill and of due caution. We see therefore no error for which we ought to reverse.</p>
