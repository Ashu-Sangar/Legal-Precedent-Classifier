    <p class="summary" id="b186-5" data-blocks='[["BL_186.3",186,[301,433,1160,1624]]]'>
      <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>“ The plaintiff leased certain premises to the defendant for the term of three years, and the defendant covenanted expressly £ at the expiration of the said term to yield up and surrender the possession’ to the plaintiff. It is also agreed by the same instrument that if the defendant £ should continue on the premises after the termination of the above contract, then this contract is to continue in full force for another year, and so on from year to year, until legal notice is given for a removal.’ The plaintiff demanded possession at the expiration of the three years, and the defendant refused on the ground specifically that he had not received three months’ previous notice. There is nothing, however, in the contract which requires such previous notice, and nothing is better settled than that on a lease for a term certain it is not necessary : Bedford <em>v. </em>McElherron, 2 S. &amp; R. 49; Lesley <em>v. </em>Randolph, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Rawle%20126" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Rawle 126">4 Rawle 126</a>, where the cases are all cited by Judge Kennedy. The only possible footing on which the plaintiff can hope to succeed, is by showing that, by the terms of the contract, he was to have the election to convert the contract from a lease for three years into a lease from year to year. There is nothing to warrant such a construction. There is an absolute and unqualified covenant by the tenant to surrender possession at the end of the term of three years, and the subsequent provision is perfectly consistent with it. It was meant for the benefit of the tenant, and to protect him from the operation of the rule established in Hemphill <em>v. </em>Elynn, 2 Barr 144, where it was held that if the tenant holds over after the expiration of a term certain, the landlord at his election before receiving rent, can treat him as a trespasser or tenant, but that it is not competent for the tenant to elect himself to be a trespasser, to move out whenever he pleases, and pay rent only for the time he occupies. Under the provisions of this lease, if without a demand of possession by the landlord, on or before the day the lease expired, the tenant continued, he could not be turned out by the landlord until the end of a year, and then only on three months’ previous potice.' In other words, he became a tenant from year to year. When the contract says £ if the tenant should continue,’ it means unquestionably a lawful continuance, and not in express violation of his covenant to surrender possession demanded by the landlord.”</p>
