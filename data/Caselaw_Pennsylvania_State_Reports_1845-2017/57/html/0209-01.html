Had it been the latter, it would not have escaped the observation of the able counsel for the defendant that there was an ample remedy at laAv in the premises on the part of the plaintiff, and that the case did not belong to equity at all. But this point is not taken by the defendant, and I will leave it to the court in banc to act upon it, <em>ex mero motu, </em>if thought best, when it becomes possessed of the case, if it ever does. I do not feel it a duty to elaborate an opinion on the point, whether a will, made in 1843, devising property to a charitable use, with but a single subscribing witness, is void under the provisions of the Act of 26th April 1855, requiring two in such cases, the will not taking effect by the death of the testator until June 1866. The provision of the Act of 1855 on this point is: ‘ That no estate, real or personal, <em>shall hereafter </em>be bequeathed, devised, or conveyed, &amp;c., for charitable uses, except the same be <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>done by deed or will, attested by two credible witnesses,’ &amp;c., ‘ and all dispositions of property contrary hereto shall he void, and go to the residuary legatee or devisee,’ &amp;c. The prohibitory clause is not to be treated as an independent provision. It is part and parcel of the provision brought into action by the section, and that section is designed to operate prospectively, and not retrospectively.

L. 328, do not justify such a construction. It provides, § 11, “ that no estate, real or personal, shall hereafter be bequeathed, devised or conveyed to any body politic or to any person in trust for religious or charitable uses except the same be done by deed or will, attested by two credible and at the same time disinterested witnesses, at least one calendar month before the decease of the testator or alienor, and all dispositions of property contrary hereto shall be void, and go to the residuary legatee or devisee, next of kin or heirs according to law.” It is true, that every will is ambulatory until the death of the testator, and the disposition made by it does not actually take effect until then. General words apply to the property of which the testator dies possessed, and he retains the power of revocation as long as he lives. The act of bequeathing or devising, however, takes place when the'will is executed, though to go into effect at a future time. The language of the Act of Assembly, in its ordinary use and meaning, relates to wills thereafter to be made. It is only by a technical construction that it can be made to bear a different sense. Such a construction might justly be applied to a law which on its face appears to be retrospective, in order to restrain it to a prospective operation, but it would certainly be a novelty to apply it conversely.</p>
