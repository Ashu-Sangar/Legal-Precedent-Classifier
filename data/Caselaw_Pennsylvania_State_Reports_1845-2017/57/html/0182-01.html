Amongst his • grandchildren surviving him were the above-named Susan A. Wister, Margaret E.

At the time of his death, James owed his- father $9486.43, for which judgment had been entered against him in 1845. On the 1st of January 1866, this debt amounted to $16,381.14, which was then reduced to $8697.14 by deducting from it James Wilson’s share of his father’s personal estate.</p>

It is agreed that the one-sixth of the real estate which descended to the three grandchildren is less in value than the balance which remains due on the judgment, after deducting therefrom his share of the personal estate. This is a case stated in an amicable action of ejectment, in,which the plaintiffs are the trustees of, and are vested with the interest of the three grandchildren. It is agreed that if the court should be of the opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, then judgment to be entered in their favor for one-sixth of the real estate, subject to the life estate of the widow, but if the court should be of a contrary opinion, then judgment to be entered for the defendants.</p>

But I assume from the argument, valuing plaintiffs’ one-sixth, and from the written agreements which have been submitted to me, that both parties waive all such questions and desire the opinion of the court upon this point alone, whether the share of the grandchildren descended to them subject to the payment of their father’s debt ? Had James Wilson survived his father, his part of the inheritance unquestionably would have been so subject. It was, at the time of his father’s death, a valid subsisting debt, no legal presumption of payment, from lapse of time, having then arisen.</p>
