The defendant was drafted in February; he reported in March; was examined and held to service, furloughed, and before he again reported in person or by substitute, the Avar closed, and by general order drafted men were excused from again reporting.

They were issued under the Act of March 15th 1865, Pamph. L. 24, entitled “ A further supplement to an act relating to the payment of bounties to volunteers,” approved March 25th 1864. After enacting that the authorities mentioned in the act to which it was a supplement should have power “to raise a sufficient sum to pay a bounty to each volunteer enlisted under the present call or who may hereafter be enlisted under the’pending or future calls, not exceeding $400,” it goes on to provide “that it shall and may be lawful for the authorities to pay the amount of bounties herein prescribed to any person drafted into the military service of the United States and serving therein, or to the families of the same, at such time and in such sums as the said authorities shall deem proper; or to any person furnishing a substitute for said service, who may be credited to the quota of any county, city, ward, borough, township or enrolment district of this Commonwealth.” Flynn, the plaintiff in error, was drafted into the service of the United States from the township of Jackson, in February 1865, and the bonds in question were issued to him upon his agreement to put a substitute into the service. In point of fact he never did put in a substitute, and never was-mustered into the service himself. According to the testimony of ICilbourn, his own witness, he reported to the deputy provost-marshal, was examined and held to service and then furloughed. The war closed, and all drafted men not mustered into service were discharged in April 1865, by general orders from the War Department. The school directors had no authority to pay money to any person on his mere agreement to furnish a substitute, but only to a person actually furnishing one. Even if they had, yet the consideration of these bonds failed, by reason of his failure to perform his agreement, <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>which would be equally effectual as a defence to the school district. So payment could not be made, nor, of course, bonds issued to a drafted man until actually mustered into service. The words of the statute are express and imperative, “ drafted into the military service of the United States and serving therein.” These considerations dispose of the 1st and 4th assignments of error.</p>
