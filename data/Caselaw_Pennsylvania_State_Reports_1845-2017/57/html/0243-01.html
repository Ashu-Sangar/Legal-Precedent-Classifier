This, too, was the rule as settled in England before the change recently introduced in the law of that country on the subject of the competency of witnesses. It will be presumed that the proceeding was instituted by the direction of the party interested; and therefore in <em>Bell v. </em>Smith, 5 B. &amp; C. 188, in an action by the brokers on a policy of insurance, one of the parties for whose benefit the policy was effected, having released to the plaintiffs, was offered as a witness, and it was held on error in the King’s Bench that he was incompetent by reason of his liability for costs. C. J. Abbott said: <em>“ </em>There can be no doubt that originally he was substantially, although not nominally, a plaintiff in the cause; and we ought not to be astute to give effect to that which makes the real plaintiff a witness. The action being for his benefit, although brought in the names of the brokers, it must, until the contrary is shown, be presumed that it was brought by him and by his authority.” Now, admitting that a responsibility for costs would not attach to a party, who had renounced all claim before the proceedings were commenced, or who, never having made any claim or taken any part in the contest, should execute a formal renunciation or release before examination, yet that must be made to appear affirmatively. The <em>prima fades </em>is against it. This was not done in this case. In the examination of the witnesses on their <em>voir dire, </em>the contrary rather appeared; certainly the presumption was not removed by anything which was elicited. Mrs. Mack admitted that she had retained counsel to attend to her claim, and Miss Duval had been frequently at his office in relation to it. We are of opinion, therefore, that these witnesses were incompetent, by reason of their personal liability for the costs of the proceeding. This renders' it unnecessary to examine any other ground of objection to their competency.</p>
