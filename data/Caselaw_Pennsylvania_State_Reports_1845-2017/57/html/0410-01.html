And there seems to be no reason why what appears to be a valuable consideration should not be proved by parol to be a gift for a good consideration.

The consideration being thus inserted rather to meet the exigency of the law, than the whole truth of the case, it was held not to be inconsistent with the intention of the parties, which ought to give force and meaning to the terms of the deed, to admit parol evidence to show what the true consideration of it was.” This case is quoted by my brother Strong, in Buckley’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%20491" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="12 Wright 491">12 Wright 491</a>, and the principle is stated in Miller <em>v. </em>Goodman, <a href="/mass/74/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="8 Gray 542" data-case-ids="2079281" data-case-paths="/mass/74/0542-01">8 Gray 542</a>. Judge Kennedy says, <em>“ </em>It appears to me they were a part of the <em>res gestee, </em>and according to the settled rule in this respect ought to have been admitted in evidence,” and this is in conformity to the very liberal rule adopted in this state as to the admission of parol evidence as explained by the late Chief Justice in Chalfant <em>v. </em>Williams, 11 Casey 212.</p>
