Smith 210. It was by force of this act the deposition of the defendant was taken, and it would lead to fraud and deception if the plaintiff should be permitted to suppress it, and withhold the truth from the court and jury. The question was virtually decided by us at this term in O’Connor <em>v. </em>American Iron Mountain Co., 6 P. F. Smith 234, in which we said: “ The deposition of one of the real plaintiffs, taken under a commission issued by and on behalf of the defendant and filed in the case, was offered in evidence by the plaintiff, objected to and received. Such a deposition of a disinterested witness would clearly have been evidence for either party: 1 Greenl.
