About one o’clock on the 3d of November 1876, she started to visit her sister-in-law, Mrs. Jared Waple, who lived about two miles distant. No more was heard of her until the 8th of November, when her body was found in the woods about one hundred yards from the road leading to Jared Waple’s, with one gun-shot wound in the body and another in the top of her head. Turner and the deceased had been seen at the gate of the house of the latter engaged in conversation on the day of the murder, shortly before the deceased had started for the house of her sister-in-law, and very soon after she started two shots were heard in quick succession from the direction she had taken and- where her body was discovered. Turner, it was shown, left his house, a short distance from that of deceased, about one o’clock on the day of the murder. He arose from the dinner-table, went up stairs and started from his house with his gun. This gun had two barrels, one. of which was rifled and the other a smooth-bore, and the wound in the body of deceased was apparently made by a rifle-ball and that in the head by buckshot. When the prisoner returned to his house in the evening both barrels of .the gun were unloaded, and he remarked <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>that he had been after squirrels and had had bad luck. When the search was made, the tracks of what appeared to be a man and woman were found in the vicinity of the body, and tracks which in size corresponded with those made by the shoes of Turner were found leading in the direction of the house of one Williams, about a mile and a half distant, where Mrs. Williams testified Turner came on the afternoon of the 3d of November, and that he had a gun in his hand.</p>

Because, if it has not — if the evidence in the case does not show that this intimacy existed — then, of course, it must be thrown out of the case.

He may sit still and demand proof beyond doubt of his guilt. What reason can be given, in accord with humanity, for changing this rule and destroying this presumption, when he tries to show the physical impossibility of his presence ? It is often the only refuge of innocence. The jury, under instructions, maybe safely trusted with the legal scrutiny of the evidence. It is not sustained by reason. The allegation of the indictment is “he did then and there kill.” This is a vital part of the proof of the Commonwealth. It is traversed by the plea of not guilty. Alibi is a defénce and not»a plea. It confesses nothing. It avoids nothing. It does not admit the killing either “then or there.” It simply says : You must prove this charge; if you do prove it, I am not guilty for I was elsewhere. It is not an afiirmative defence. It is a denial of the charge “you did there kill.” There can be no such thing under the law as an affirmative defence to the gist of a crime, which will <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>shift the burden of proof from the Commonwealth to the prisoner. If alibi be such, it is an anomaly in criminal jurisprudence. The defences of insanity, provocation, necessity, and former acquittal or conviction are all in excuse or justification, and each of them is an admission of the essence of the offence — the very fact of killing. Alibi, on the contrary, if narrowed to its lowest conception, distinctly traverses this vital element of the crime — he did there kill. All of the authorities agree that the Commonwealth, upon the whole case, must prove every essential of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. They also agree that the prisoner makes no admission of guilt by setting up an alibi. If those be sound law, and they are undoubtedly humane — it necessarily follows that the presumption of innocence is not dethroned, that the burden of proof rests, as to this averment, upon the Commonwealth. If this be not true, we have the incredible result that a law based upon humanity, logic and common sense, holds the prisoner innocent until he is proved guilty, but as to the vital requisite to the crime • it requires him to prove his innocence. The burden of proof in the sense used by the court below — the affirmative of the issue as to the material averment, <em>“ </em>he did, then and there kill,” never shifts from the Commonwealth. The character of the proof to support this defence, and the measure of that proof may well be what this court and others of like enlightened character hold them to be — carefully scrutinized and preponderating proof, but these do not justify the charge of the court nor sustain the illogical position that.the burden of proof is upon both the Commonwealth and the prisoner as to an essential element in the crime.</p>

We mean by this, that the broad declaration, that “ If a defendant offers to show an alibi, the burden is upon him, there he becomes the affirmant, he becomes the actor, and the law requires him to prove to your satisfaction that his allegation of being somewhere else is true,” is not warranted in law. If for no other reason, it is unsound, because it imposes the duty of satisfying the jury of its truth upon the prisoner, and denies him the benefit of this proof in qualifying all of the proof on. this subject, so as to enable the jury to determine whether a reasonable doubt existed. He is held to the task of proving it to their satisfaction — of proving it as a truth. But we place the case here upon other ground, as well as upon this. The burden of proof is not upon' the prisoner; he does not become the affirmant — the actor. The burden is still upon the Commonwealth. The jury must carefully scrutinize the evidence upon the alibi, and if there be a preponderance of the whole evidence from which they are satisfied the alibi is established; or if, taking this in connection with all of the other proof in the cause, a reasonable doubt is raised, they must acquit.

The doctrine quoted from Wills, which asserts that “A resort to that kind of'evidence implies an admission of the truth and relevancy of the fact alleged,” if it ever was the law, is not so now. The whole of this sentence in Wills is as follows: “An unsuccessful attempt to establish an alibi is always a circumstance of the greatest weight against -the prisoner, because the resort to that kind of defence implies an admission of the truth and relevancy of the facts alleged, and the correctness, of the inference drawn from them, if they remain uncontradicted.” We have already seen that the first clause of this sentence is not the law.

Naturally those exceptions which go to the jurisdiction of the court first claim our attention. It is alleged, firstly, that the indictment was found, and the defendant tried and sentenced, in a court unknown to the constitution and laws of this Commonwealth. This allega<a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>tion is based on the fact that the record names the coutt as the “ Oyer and Terminer,” and omits “and General Gaol Delivery.” This, however, is exactly what is done in the eighth and ninth sections of the fifth article of the constitution of 1874, so that such a court cannot be said to be unknown to the constitution. The first of the above-named sections designates the criminal courts of Philadelphia and Allegheny counties as “ the Courts of Oyer and Terminer and Quarter Sessions of the Peacethe second connects the-term “General Gaol Delivery,” not with the Court of Oyer and Terminer, but rather with, as it immediately follows, the Quarter Sessions. This latter section is that which confers upon the judges the power to hear and determine all cases of a criminal character. Thus it comes to pass that our judges have, in a single commission, all the powers which the English judges derived from several. Indeed, as we learn from Blackstone’s Commentaries (vol. 4, p. 270), anciently it was the custom to issue separate writs of gaol delivery, called writs <em>de bono et </em>malo, for each case. This practice, being found to be attended with inconvenience, was in the course of time abolished, and instead thereof, a general commission was substituted for all prisoners triable at a particular term. This commission, unlike that of oyer and terminer, ran only to “try and deliver” prisoners in each separate gaol. (Id. 271, note.) The reason for this was, that as the commission of oyer and terminer only, empowered the judges to “ inquire and determine,” they could proceed under it only upon indictments found at the same term as that at which the several trials were heard, hence the necessity of an additional writ for the disposition of indictments and other cases previously found and instituted. Under our system this writ has no place; and it is obvious .that the name itself can have no legal significance, since it but imports a power which every judge possesses by virtue of his general commission. We conclude, therefore, that the omission of the words “general gaol delivery” was of no importance, and, had the attention of the court been called thereto, might have been supplied by amendment.</p>

It is insisted that the Act of Assembly which authorizes the election of an additional law judge for the 25th district, composed of the counties of Clearfield, Centre and Clinton, was and is unconstitutional and void. This point is raised under the 5th section of the 5th article of the constitution. It will be observed that when, by this section, a county is to compose a <em>separate </em>district, provision is made for additional law judges ; but for <em>single </em>districts, formed <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>of several counties, no such provision is made. The learned counsel for the defence regards this omission as significant. Not, indeed, because, without more, the legislature would not possess the power to create such judges, since it is conceded that such power must necessarily belong to that body if it be not in terms withheld, but because it is said the phrase “ single district,” as used in this section, means a district having but a single law judge. To prove this, reference is had to the debates in the convention. But if these prove anything, they prove too much for the argument which they are adduced to support, for they advocate districts with single judges, without regard to whether those districts were to be composed of one or several counties. As the idea was dropped as impracticable in single county districts, we may well suppose it was also abandoned as to those formed of several counties; for it is not reasonable to suppose that, whilst provision was being made for the possible wants of districts having populations of forty thousand, those having possibly double that number should have been wholly neglected. We are inclined to think that that- word “single,” directly connected as it is with the word “ district,” is to be regarded as a synonym of “ separate,” and as having been used to avoid tautology. If not, its use, in the connection in which it now stands, was unfortunate, for grammatically it qualifies and characterizes the judicial districts, and does not limit the number of judges.</p>

They relate to admissions of evidence and the charge of the court on the subject of the relations existing between Turner and Mrs. Waple. That adulterous intercourse may be proved as a circumstance leading to the commission of crime, is ruled in the case of Ferrigan <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20386" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="8 Wright 386">8 Wright 386</a>, and it would thus seem to follow that if the criminal conduct proposed to be proved becomes in any way a link in the chain of circumstances which connects the defendant with the crime.charged, it is admissible in evidence. That such circumstance is in its character criminal, and tends to exhibit another crime than the one charged, is no reason for its exclusion. It certainly does not follow that evidence, otherwise legitimate, should be excluded only because it tends to exhibit a character not accordant with an honest life. We need not say how important this testimony is to the case now in hearing, and how little there would be without it to connect the defendant with the offence charged ; it is enough to say that it is a legitimate part of the case, and that it was properly admitted. It is conceded that an independent crime, unconnected with the matter in trial, may not be put in evidence, for this is but proof of character, and that in its most objectionable shape; such, however, is not the case with the testimony under consideration. The criminal relation is <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>but one of a series of facts connecting the defendant with the homicide, and a proper use was made thereof by the prosecution.</p>

The whole was one transaction, and could not be dissevered to suit the purposes of either party. In like manner, when the defence undertook to show Thomas Waple’s whereabouts at and about the time of the murder, and his animus towards the deceased, it was altogether proper for the Commonwealth to endeavor to rebut the presumptions arising from those facts; for, however concealed, their purpose could have been nothing less than to direct the attention of the jury to Thomas Waple as the real criminal.</p>

In these the complaint is that the court permitted the jury to find a verdict against the prisoner upon a degree of proof less than that required by law in capital cases. We think this complaint not well founded. The evidence, if believed, was sufficient to warrant a conviction; and an examination of the charge shows that, in submitting that evidence, the court omitted no proper instruction. The. attention of the jury was called to the duty resting upon it of carefully and faithfully weighing and examining the evidence. That body was told that in order to work a conviction each material fact must have been satisfactorily proved, and if it remained in doubt, or if the defendant’s proof showed that it could not be true, it must not be regarded as a fact in the case. The learned judge further says, in answer to the defendant’s first point, “you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, first, that the murder was committed; second, that, this defendant was the guilty agent, or you would not be justified in finding a verdict of guilty.” Again, in answer to the fifth point, “we told you in our charge that the facts proved must be such as to exclude every reasonable hypothesis but that of the prisoner’s guilt.” Surely if the jury misunderstood this language it was no fault of the court; everything was said that the defendant had a right to require.</p>

And, first, it was improper to submit the general character of the witnesses to the jury without evidence touching such character. There is a very wide distinction between the personal character of a witness and the character of the evidence which he may give in a particular case. If the former be good, though the latter be impeached by facts and circumstaáces developed during the trial, yet the defects in such testimony may be accounted for by mistake or lack of memory, and whatever of it remains uncontradicted may be accepted without hesitation ; on the other hand, if the former be bad, corroboration must follow the evidence in all its material parts or it is worthless. This submission ivas erroneous in that it gave to the jury the power of testing evidence by that which could be found only outside of the trial itself, perhaps in the personal knowledge of some of the jurors. Perhaps this submission was inadvertent, and from its generality may have been harmless; nevertheless,, we have thought proper to advert to it in order that its repetition may be avoided.</p>

This covers the submission to the jury of the alleged attempt by the defendant to manufacture evidence. As was said by the court, “if it was proved that this defendant did so attempt to manufacture evidence that was false, it is a fact which you must consider.” The matter is thus put as an important element of the. case. Now if there was testimony to support this submission no fault could be found with it, but we have looked in vain for such testimony, though, in this, we have had the assistance of the able counsel for the Commonwealth. The evidence on this branch of the case is as follows: George Morgan testifies to Turner’s presence at the depot at Wallaceton, between two and three o’clock of the afternoon of the day of the murder. He says the defendant was in the office before the arrival of the freight train, and assisted him in checking his manifests. On cross-examination, he stated that at two or three times, or perhaps oftener, Turner had called his attention to this fact, and that, previous to these reminders on the part of Turner, he had not recollected the time. As, however, Morgan seems to have been a reputable witness, it would seem, that the defendant but called his attention to what was the truth, and thus, in a legitimate manner, obtained for himself an important piece of testimony. This act, unaccompanied as it was by anything, resembling an attempt to corrupt this witness, was altogether proper, unless, indeed, one accused of crime is to make no effort in the <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>way of self-defence. Then, it is said, he was seen in close conversation with a witness named David Snyder, but what he said to Snyder, or Snyder to- him, is wholly unknown.

So, if the case of the Commonwealth rested upon positive and undoubted proofs, it might require like testimony to beget a reasonable doubt, and hence, less than full, clear, and satisfactory evidence would be worthless. The fault, however, with this instruction, in the present case, which is one depending wholly upon circumstantial evidence, is that, under it, if the testimony fails to reach a strength sufiicient to work an acquittal, it is in effect excluded from the case. This is a rule inadmissible in modern criminal jurisprudence; for proof of an alibi is <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>as much a traverse of the crime charged as any other defence, and proof tending to establish it, though not clear, may, nevertheless, with other facts of the case, raise doubt enough to produce an acquittal. We are inclined to think with Mr. Greenleaf (Ev. vol. 1, sec. 81 b) that the true rule in criminal cases, notwithstanding some decisions to the contrary, is, that' the burden of proof never shifts, but rests upon the prosecution throughout, so that, in all cases, a conviction can be had only after the jury have been convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the defendant’s guilt. From this it results, that, if from any, or from all the evidence taken together, a reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt is raised, there should be an acquittal.</p>
    <p id="b74-6" data-blocks='[["BL_74.4",74,[273,942,1173,467]]]'>The latter part of the instructions above cited is manifestly wrong in this, that the jury are told that the defendant, having undertaken to defend himself on the ground of alibi, must produce evidence sufficient to work his acquittal, or, if not, his failure is in itself evidence of guilt. This is adding a penalty to what maybe, not the defendant’s crime, but his misfortune — a result that we cannot sanction. Were the defendant detected in an attempt to corrupt witnesses, or to manufacture evidence, it would certainly weigh heavily against him, but his mere failure to prove a given point of his defence is no evidence of such attempt, and it 'ought not to have been submitted as such.</p>
