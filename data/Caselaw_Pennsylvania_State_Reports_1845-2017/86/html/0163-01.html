On the contrary, the framers of the constitution purposely avoided interfering with it, by use of the words “for regular terms of service.” The constitution having fixed when the election for regular terms should be held, it became necessary for the legislature to fix when the terms should commence, as under the existing state of things the man elected in February would not enter upon his office until the succeeding January. Therefore, the Act of March 10th 1875 was passed, providing that thereafter the terms should begin and end on the first Monday of April.

The legislature was aware that, under the laws then in force, the term of a member of councils began and ended on the first Monday of January, and therefore he could not enter on the duties of his office until more than ten months after his election. The time of his election they could not change, but they could designate the time when he should assume his.official duties. To shorten the intervening time, to not permanently lengthen a regular term beyond three years, and at the same time not to disturb the existing division into three classes, the act provided: 1. For a longer term for each member to be first elected at the expiration of each term, which, under existing laws, would expire in January. The term of each to be so elected was to extend until the first Monday of April next following the January when the term would otherwise have expired. As the term of all members of councils then in office expired in January, this act necessarily extended the term of all members to be elected at the expiration of those terms. This, however, was limited to the first election in each case. 2. As soon as the object of requiring the person elected to enter on the duties of his election within a few weeks after his election was accomplished, then the regular term was again to be three years only. This was in entire harmony with the constitution of 1874.</p>

The fact that the sheriff, in his proclamation giving notice of the election, declared that the person to be elected would serve until the first Monday of April 1877, could not change the statute nor extend the term. The term for which Downing was elected, as well as the term of the person who filled out the unexpired portion of Downing’s term, expired on the first Monday of January 1877. Hence the third Tuesday in February 1876 was the proper time to elect a successor, to enter on his duties in January 1877. The respondent, John Gr.
