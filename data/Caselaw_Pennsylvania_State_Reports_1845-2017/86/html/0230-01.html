Montgomery and Alida G., his wife, from the decree of the court in the matter of awarding commissions to the executors under the will of Edward Wharton, deceased. Edward Wharton died in May 1873, having made a will in which he appointed the Pennsylvania Company for Insurance on Lives, &amp;c., his executors. The testator, after creating certain trusts in favor of Mrs. Kate Lawrence, and of his son, an infant, to the extent of $20,000, bequeathed the residue of his estate to his sister, Mrs. • Alida G. Montgomery, one of the appellants. .The estate, consisting mainly of stocks, was appraised at $34,460.75, which was subse<a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>quently increased by interest, dividends, &amp;c., to $42,385,93, at the time of filing the account.</p>

They subsequently filed a supplemental account, in which they deducted as further commissions five per cent, on all income collected. Objection to these commissions was raised before the auditor, as appears in his report, who sustained the objections, and awarded the accountants the sum of $500, in full compensation for their services as executors, and surcharged them with interest at the rate of four per cent, on the amount retained by them as commissions. To this reduction of their commissions the accountants excepted, and their exceptions were sustained by the court below, and a decree entered recommitting the report to the auditor, with instructions to allow the commissions as claimed; to which decree this appeal is taken.</p>

The auditor decided in favor of the direct payment to Mrs. Lawrence; to which finding both the appellants and appellees excepted, and their exceptions were sustained in the court below, and the appellees continue to hold the said fund in trust.</p>

An examination of the account will show that the estate, as it came to the executor’s hands, consisted wholly of stocks and a small amount of furniture. The subsequent receipts were only of stock and cash dividends and interest. The debts paid were seven in all, besides the one contested before your auditor; and these debts, he is satisfied from what occurred before him, <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>were paid with the approval and after the examination of the residuary legatee, who also took the furniture at the appraised value.

It was decided in Stearley’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20525" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Wright 525">2 Wright 525</a>, that a trustee cannot claim compensation for services self-imposed, and resulting from his own wrong; and it is certainly quite as true that he cannot be compensated for a risk that he should not have taken. On the other hand, if the accountants should have changed the stock into legal investments, and did not, they cannot recover for'services which they should have performed, but did not render. It was said by Strong, J., in McOausland’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20470" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Wright 470">2 Wright 470</a>, that ‘ commissions are given as a compensation for labor and responsibility, and where neither the one has been performed nor the other incurred, there is nothing to be compensated.’ And, indeed, the principle laid down in this case would seem to deny all commissions to the accountants (if we had adopted that mode of measuring their compensation) on such of the stocks as have not been and will not have to be converted into cash.</p>

With these exceptions, the credits claimed in the account and supplemental account are allowed.”</p>

Recognising the principle thus announced, executors and other trustees, for the faithful performance of the ordinary duties of the trust, have generally been compensated by a commission of 5 per cent, upon the amount of the personal estate, and 2-J per cent, upon the proceeds of real estate. This has become the established practice and rule. And where additional trouble has been occasioned in the settlement of the estate, an increased commission has been frequently allowed.</p>

In the late case of Eshelman’s Appeal, 24 P. F. Smith 42, the estate, consisting of realty and personalty, amounted to about $75,000, and a commission of 5 per cent, was allowed upon the personalty, and 2J per cent, upon the proceeds of the real estate. We think the general rule mentioned applicable to the present' estate. There were no extraordinary services performed, but, as in Eshelman’s Appeal, it was <em>‘ </em>attended with the quantity of trouble, care and responsibility, which the settlement of intestates’estates ordinarily imposes.’ The executors here are entitled to the same compensation as would be allowed individuals. That they are a corporation does not create any distinction. The same duties are required, and similar responsibilities incurred. Nor can they then be expected to execute trusts without just compensation. They incur expense for reliable officers, clerks and other employees; are subject to taxation of their real and personal estate, and the individuals composing the corporation are entitled to a return for the risk of the capital invested, and liable for the honesty and careful management of their employees.”</p>

Gibson, C.

It may be awarded even in a gross sum, according to a common practice in the country, <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>which I take to be the preferable one, as it necessarily leads to an examination of the nature, items and actual extent of the services, which the adoption of a rate per cent, has a tendency to leave out of view.” So it is said by Strong, J., in McCausland’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20466" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="2 Wright 466">2 Wright 466</a>: “commissions are given as a compensation for labor and responsibility, and where neither the one has been performed, nor the other incurred, there is nothing to be compensated.” This same general idea runs through all the cases and it is useless to enumerate them.

If to these we add the ordinary services of proving the will, appraising the assets, filing the inventory, &amp;e., we have the sum total of all that was done by this corporation for this estate. When, in connection with this meagre array of services, we consider the fact that, by an Act of Assembly, this corporation is relieved of all responsibility, which otherwise might attach to it, from a depreciation of the stocks whilst in its possession, we cannot but think that it was far overpaid in the charge and allowance of two thousand and ninety-five dollars in addition to one hundred dollars as a counsel fee. We incline, rather, to approve the auditor’s award of five hundred dollars, with the counsel fee, as a more fair and just compensation. As we are not certainly informed whether, since the filing of the accounts, now in hand, the executor has converted stocks sufficient to meet the legacy of Mrs. Lawrence, we may add that, if this has been done, or if not so done, when such conversion is made and the proceeds thereof passed to the credit of the trust estate, an additional allowance may be made, to this executor, in a sum not exceeding two hundred dollars, to be paid out of the residuary estate.
